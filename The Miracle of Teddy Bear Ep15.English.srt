1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,039
I promise.

2
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,840
I'll stay and take care of you

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,080
and take care of Nut.

4
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,479
I'll never leave.

5
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,560
Let's make the rest of your mom's memories

6
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,439
good memories.

7
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,479
The thing that Alzheimer's
can't take away from us…

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
is love.

9
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,680
I want a photo shoot too.

10
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,000
A family photo shoot.

11
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,879
You better ask your dad.

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
If Dad agrees,

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,639
we have to dress up nicer than this.

14
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,919
But I'm sick of it!

15
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm sick of getting pressured by everyone,

16
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,879
including Sib, Mr. Sakon,

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,479
Ms. Ching, and you.

18
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,639
Are you leaving already?

19
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
What's the rush?

20
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,639
You talked me into staying over.
What am I supposed to do?

21
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,240
I have to go before your dad comes back.

22
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,319
Didn't you say you're willing
to face anything?

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,039
What are you afraid of?

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm not afraid.

25
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm just thinking of your dad.

26
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,840
If he sees me here unexpectedly,

27
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,240
he might be shocked.

28
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
When Dad gets back,

29
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,560
I'll tell him about us.

30
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
Are you in a rush?

31
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,919
Yes. Of course.

32
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,479
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

33
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
Nothing is certain in life.

34
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,439
Look at Nut and his mom.

35
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,279
They say you should live life
to the fullest.

36
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,600
Do whatever you want to do.
Love whoever you want to love.

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
Tell the ones you love how you feel.

38
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,279
I'm very happy to have you.

39
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,920
Should I be happy

40
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
to have you?

41
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
Of course.

42
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,680
I have many good qualities.

43
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,040
Do I still have to prove them?

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,920
You little…

45
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,439
Should I do it again?

46
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,959
Dad.

47
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,319
Here.

48
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,879
I'm leaving now.

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
I'll let you two talk.

50
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,879
I want you to stay.

51
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
He and I

52
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
are seeing each other, Dad.

53
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,959
I wanted to tell you about it
in Chiang Mai.

54
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,879
I just couldn't find the right timing.

55
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,720
How long has it been?

56
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,160
I didn't think I needed to tell you.

58
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,720
We've lived together for so long.

59
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,560
You should have realized what I'm like.

60
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,759
But I forgot

61
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
that actually…

62
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,399
we barely spent any time together.

63
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,439
I was focused on my studies here.

64
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,079
You were busy with your work there.

65
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,240
We don't know each other
as well as I thought.

66
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,680
Even though I'm still young,

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,839
and you still see me as a little kid…

68
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,519
this…

69
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,439
is something I'm certain about.

70
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm sorry, Dad.

71
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,480
Getting married,

72
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
having children,

73
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,199
having a family like you dream of,

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,959
like other sons could,
isn't possible for me.

75
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,000
I know that

76
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,040
this might come as a shock.

77
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,759
It might make you upset

78
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
and disappointed,

79
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,279
but we promised

80
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
that we would be honest with each other.

81
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
I wanted you to hear this from me

82
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,600
rather than find out from someone else.

83
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,639
Hello, are you home yet?

84
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,759
Yes, I'm home.

85
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,480
Are you all right?

86
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,679
Sure.

87
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,879
I meant to introduce you to my dad
under better circumstances.

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,679
However you did it,
your dad would have been shocked.

90
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,679
But I'm sure

91
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,799
that your dad will realize

92
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,399
that you told him first

93
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,759
because he's the person
you love and trust the most.

94
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,039
Just be patient.

95
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,039
I'm sure he was so quiet
because it was a shock like you said.

96
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,080
But I believe that Dad
will come to love you like I do.

97
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,919
Dad will realize
that I made the right choice.

98
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,879
I know. I'll speak to you later.

99
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,159
I'm going to do some revision.

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,679
Song.

101
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,399
I should

102
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,519
apologize to you.

103
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,159
I know that in the past,

104
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
I didn't give you
the attention you deserved.

105
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,200
Now, I know who you really are.

106
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,039
I need some time.

107
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,679
Please give me time.

108
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,519
I love you, Dad.

109
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,759
I love you too, boy.

110
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,720
Yes, Lieutenant Kong?

111
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,960
Ms. Kaew-ching-duang flew back to Bangkok.

112
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,559
From the information I found,

113
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,159
TRD seems to be a major investor
in the hospital.

114
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,600
They've been donating money
for construction and medical supplies

115
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,360
for years.

116
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
You seem very concerned about Tarn.

117
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,480
You came all the way here to visit him.

118
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,399
I care for the welfare of all people.

119
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,879
Particularly people involved
with your assets, right?

120
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,600
Everyone is concerned with their assets.

121
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,200
As it happens,

122
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,919
you wouldn't give the time of day
to the nephew you so despise

123
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,279
if he didn't own the land
you have your eyes on.

124
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
Don't look so surprised.

125
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,799
I pay attention to every single one
of my people.

126
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,120
Your husband is my trusted employee.
We've worked together for years.

127
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,799
If he has a problem,
I'm always willing to lend a hand.

128
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,840
But it appears that someone
doesn't want this to end.

129
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,879
Things would have turned out better

130
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,840
if it wasn't for those busybodies
causing trouble.

131
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,039
The people checking out Tarn's house?

132
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,399
Yes, but they won't be
in the way much longer,

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
because I hate people getting in my way.

134
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,360
Oh, wow.

135
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,759
Are you that sick of my cooking?

136
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
Not at all.

137
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,240
I just wanted to take you out for a meal.

138
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,519
We could just eat at home.
That way, your mom could join us.

139
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,120
I promised you
before we left for Chiang Mai

140
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,840
that I wanted to take you on a trip.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,279
But right now, we can't go anywhere.

142
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,399
Since we can't take a trip,

143
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,120
a meal will have to do.

144
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,919
Also, don't worry about Mom.
I've told her about this.

145
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,080
Mom wanted you to take a break.

146
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,080
She also said you've lost weight lately.

147
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,399
You should eat more. Here.

148
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,159
I'm going to dig in then.

149
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,759
This is mine.

150
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,960
You should think about
your own feelings, Tofu.

151
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,840
If you have a chance to love someone,

152
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,200
you should show your love
and take good care of that person.

153
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,159
Is it good?

154
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,120
You have no clue

155
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,960
where your path will lead.

156
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Your destination

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
may cause you heartache,

158
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,000
but you will not regret it.

159
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,879
There's nothing more important

160
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
than seeing your loved ones happy

161
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,080
when you are together.

162
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,639
It's Juea. I should take it.

163
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,679
What is it, Juea?

164
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,080
When?

165
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,799
I already sent it.

166
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Nut,

167
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,759
I need the bathroom.

168
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,919
I already sent it. Check again.
It's the third draft.

169
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,519
Yes. No, that was last Monday.

170
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
Here, Tofu.

171
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,880
Thank you.

172
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,759
Tofu. Pampering him like this
will only make him fall deeper for you.

173
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,480
Nut has been taking great care of me.

174
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,680
I wanted to give him something.

175
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Thank you so much.

176
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,200
It's no problem.
I like seeing people in love.

177
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,759
I'm going now.

178
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,519
Aren't they enviable?

179
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,960
Why would you be envious?
Do you want a gift too?

180
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,720
Of course not.

181
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,279
I'm already head over heels for you.

182
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm just waiting for Dad to feel the same.

183
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,400
He needs some time. Please wait a bit.

184
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,960
Where are you going?

185
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,799
If you don't want to die,
keep your mouth shut.

186
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,799
Who are you? What do you want?

187
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Tofu.

188
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,039
Nut.

189
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,920
Tofu.

190
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,559
Are you hurt?

191
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,720
Hey.

192
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,160
If I hadn't been there,
what would you have done?

193
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,720
Fortunately, I went to look for you.

194
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,880
You had been gone a while.

195
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,799
I'm sorry.

196
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,680
I almost got you hurt again.

197
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,000
It's you who got hurt.

198
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,920
Why didn't you let me call the police?

199
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,720
It's no big deal.

200
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,319
If you call the police

201
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,880
and they find out
that I don't have any ID,

202
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,440
we'll have problems.

203
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,519
But we'll never know who he was.

204
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,480
What brings you to see me this early?

205
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,839
I brought you some strawberry jam.

206
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,640
Mrs. Na and I made it
for the people who came to our party.

207
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,759
I thought you would like some.

208
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,440
I don't like sweet stuff.

209
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,880
Say thank you anyway, though.

210
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,559
What happened to your hand?

211
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
I was attacked.

212
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,039
A harmless boy like you got attacked?

213
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,799
It must have been a misunderstanding
or misidentification.

214
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,599
That's what I thought at first.

215
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,960
But when he threatened me,

216
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,720
I thought maybe I had stumbled upon
someone's secrets.

217
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,720
People these days are scary.

218
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,880
They're hard to read.

219
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,880
They do what they like.

220
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,759
That's right. You never know.

221
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,960
Some people seem harmless,

222
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,680
but they can be hiding a vicious side.

223
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
And sometimes,

224
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,640
those closest to you

225
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,480
are the least trustworthy.

226
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,039
But you have amnesia.

227
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,000
How could you have come across
anyone's secrets?

228
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,200
Maybe…

229
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,000
you really don't have amnesia.

230
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,079
Hey, I'm just kidding.

231
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,799
A good boy like you wouldn't lie, right?

232
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,759
I don't know

233
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,799
if you had anything to do with Tarn.

234
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,799
However, if you happen to remember
anything, you should be careful.

235
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,240
With some matters,

236
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,160
the more you know,
the more danger you are in.

237
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Like how Tarn was attacked

238
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,720
on the day you and Mr. Saen were there?

239
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,160
SAEN

240
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,240
Why don't you answer it?

241
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,680
Do you have a secret I shouldn't hear?

242
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,839
I can leave.

243
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,759
What is it?

244
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,119
The doctor wants to talk?

245
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,079
What's the matter?

246
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,680
Okay. I'm on my way.

247
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,279
Can I go and see Tarn?

248
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,359
You wouldn't mind, would you?

249
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,160
From the X-ray and CT scan,

250
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,880
we found that the patient
has a brain abscess.

251
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,480
It's about 3 cm across.

252
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,000
If we leave it,

253
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,200
it could rupture,
causing pus to enter the brain cavity.

254
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,240
That could be fatal.

255
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,640
We need to operate again
to remove the pus.

256
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,759
Dr. Nueng will perform the surgery.

257
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,440
Why did the previous doctors
not find this?

258
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,799
Perhaps because his symptoms
weren't indicative of an abscess then.

259
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,759
I can't say for sure
how long it has been there.

260
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,279
We saw he had fever,

261
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,880
which suggested an infection.

262
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,279
So Dr. Nueng ordered the CT scan,
which led to this finding.

263
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,559
Is the surgery high-risk?

264
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,519
It's possible that the patient
won't survive the surgery.

265
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,480
After the surgery, will my nephew
regain consciousness?

266
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,960
The brain abscess doesn't affect
whether he will wake up or not.

267
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,680
He's in a coma

268
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,759
because his brain suffered severe trauma

269
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,039
that put him in a brain-dead condition.

270
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,519
For that, we can only wait
for his brain to slowly recover.

271
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,119
As for the abscess,

272
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,119
if we don't operate on it,
there's a chance he'll die if it ruptures.

273
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,839
What about the cost?

274
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,359
I will cover any costs. I'm happy to.

275
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,119
I just want Tatarn to be safe.

276
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
There's no need to help.
I can handle this myself.

277
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,319
Seeing my employee

278
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,359
running around for his nephew,

279
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,880
I can't help but lend a hand.

280
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
Are you helping me or TRD?

281
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,799
You know

282
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,680
that with my help,

283
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,359
all sides stand to gain.

284
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,279
If you want to repay my kindness,

285
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,279
you should use your time
to focus on our project.

286
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,400
Why do you care?
The operation won't wake him up.

287
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
Does Tatarn need more surgery?

288
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,880
The doctors found an abscess.

289
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,119
They need to operate

290
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,400
as it could be dangerous.

291
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,400
He might not make it.

292
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,559
How did you get here?

293
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,319
I went to Jan's house
to give her something.

294
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,519
When I heard the news,

295
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,480
I wanted to visit him.

296
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,160
And your hand?

297
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,400
It was just a little accident.

298
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,319
I'm leaving now.

299
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,279
Don't tell me you did that.

300
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,680
I told you not to do anything.

301
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,960
Why are you stirring things up?

302
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,559
Why is it always my fault?
I didn't do anything.

303
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,960
Let me drive you home.

304
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,079
I want to see Na.

305
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,160
That blanket…

306
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,319
It's the wedding gift
you gave Mrs. Na, right?

307
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,119
How strange.

308
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,599
When I gave it to her,

309
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,720
I had this feeling

310
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,920
that it was like our little daughter.

311
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,119
Na and I used to talk
about having a daughter.

312
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,200
That must be why Ms. Blanket

313
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,440
became such a chatty girl.

314
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,640
I never thought

315
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,960
that what I did would hurt Na.

316
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,720
I made Sib paranoid.

317
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,880
The blanket made him jealous.

318
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,359
He forbade her from using it.

319
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,960
He thought I gave it to her
to remind her of me.

320
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,000
Even on that day,

321
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,519
the day he died…

322
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,799
The day Mr. Sib died,

323
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,119
were you there?

324
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,000
I had come back to Bangkok on business.

325
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,160
I went to see Na and Nut as usual.

326
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,440
Nut wasn't home that day.

327
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,920
Sib was seriously ill.

328
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,720
He still managed
to come downstairs, though.

329
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,599
Mr. Sib must have thought

330
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,480
that the two of you were still in love,

331
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,440
so he hurried down to intervene.

332
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,119
That was part of it.

333
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,319
The thing was,

334
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
Sib used to hit Na.

335
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,480
He didn't want me to find out.

336
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,400
He took a load of meds,
so he could go down and get rid of me.

337
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,240
As your friend, you can tell me.

338
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,400
He must have been in a hurry,

339
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,400
and he took the wrong meds.

340
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,279
Sib had been allergic to NSAIDs
since he was young.

341
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,640
Luckily, I don't have the same allergy.

342
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,839
Honey.

343
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,279
What's wrong?

344
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,000
What's wrong?

345
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,000
What's wrong?

346
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,799
Saen, call for an ambulance.

347
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,920
Sib.

348
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:46,680
Sib.

349
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,680
Na and I tried to get him to the hospital.

350
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,799
But it was too late.

351
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,079
-No!
-Na was devastated.

352
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,880
She blamed herself for his death.

353
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,359
She didn't know
that Sib was allergic to those drugs.

354
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,400
That's why she kept them in the house.

355
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,200
I tried to console her.

356
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,000
I told her it wasn't her fault.

357
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,960
All she did was buy the medicine.

358
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,400
The reality was too cruel to take,

359
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,440
which was why she deluded herself

360
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,720
and created a new world.

361
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,000
I'll come back another day to visit her.

362
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,839
She needs plenty of rest.

363
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm leaving now.

364
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,720
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

365
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,720
I'm sorry

366
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,720
for going to visit Tatarn
without telling you.

367
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,319
Since we came back from Chiang Mai,

368
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,839
you've visited Tarn regularly

369
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,799
and it seems like
something is on your mind.

370
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,960
It's not just Tarn
that has been bothering you, is it?

371
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,519
It has something to do
with Uncle Saen and Jan.

372
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
You know?

373
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,360
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,400
I have my suspicions,

375
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,800
but I hope those are not true.

376
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,480
I never thought someone like Mr. Saen

377
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,360
could hurt anyone,

378
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
especially his own family.

379
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,599
I hope you're right.

380
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,559
I have enough on my plate with Mom.

381
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,320
You love Mr. Saen a lot, don't you?

382
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:01,119
Maybe because I've always wished

383
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,320
he was my dad.

384
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,239
When my dad died, I hardly cried.

385
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,079
I used to think that

386
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,480
it wasn't bad that he died.

387
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,559
Mom and I were free.

388
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,719
We would no longer get hurt.

389
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,079
You must have been
grief-stricken that day.

390
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,960
It was like any other day.

391
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,239
My dad and I stayed out
of each other's way.

392
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,239
At the time, I was staying in a dorm.
I rarely came home.

393
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,960
When I found out and came to the hospital,

394
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,239
he had already passed.

395
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,519
When I asked Mom…

396
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,920
What happened?

397
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,639
…she just cried.

398
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,760
She must have been in shock
to see him die in her arms.

399
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,840
My uncle later told me

400
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,960
that Dad took the wrong meds.

401
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,320
I don't know how it could have happened.

402
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,920
Dad knew which meds he was allergic to.

403
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,960
Mom also knew.

404
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Even I knew about it

405
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,360
because I used to buy meds for him.

406
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,079
I guess it was just his time.

407
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,360
Uncle Saen arranged the funeral.

408
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,559
He stepped in to help us.

409
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,840
After that, we rarely saw him.

410
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,559
He still helped us from afar,

411
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
but he stopped visiting Mom.

412
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,760
At the time, I was busy studying.
I didn't come home much.

413
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,039
Mom was grieving on her own.

414
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,960
If I had known then that Mom was sick,

415
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,719
I wouldn't have left her like that.

416
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,760
How is Tarn?

417
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,280
The surgery went as planned.

418
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,400
We managed to draw out some pus.

419
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,079
And during the surgery,

420
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,639
his blood pressure
and vital signs were all normal.

421
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,599
Does that mean Tarn
has a chance of recovering?

422
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,480
Like I've said,

423
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,280
whether he wakes up or not
depends on how his brain recovers.

424
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,760
But I think I know

425
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,559
what caused the abscess.

426
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:05,760
I need to talk with the doctor first.

427
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm the officer in charge of this case.

428
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,599
Lieutenant.

429
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,199
I just heard from the doctor that--

430
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,199
Dad.

431
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,000
Dad!

432
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
Dad.

433
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,119
You have to be okay.

434
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,960
Your dad will be fine.

435
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,320
Nut.

436
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,960
What happened?

437
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,599
He was shot.

438
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,719
What?

439
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,320
I just saw him less than ten minutes ago.

440
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,039
You were with him?

441
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,159
Yes. Me, the deputy chief,
Mr. Saen and Jan

442
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,840
were just speaking with Tarn's surgeon.

443
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,280
How could he get shot at the hospital?

444
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,079
He doesn't have any enemies.

445
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,360
Maybe it's about what the doctor said?

446
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,000
What did she say?

447
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,639
The doctor found a splinter
in Tarn's brain.

448
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,079
When I removed the pus,
I found this splinter.

449
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,559
A splinter?

450
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:29,360
I suspect this to be the cause
of the abscess…

451
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,679
even though it has been a while
since the incident.

452
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,320
But the previous doctor said

453
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,679
that the weapon the perpetrator used
was a blunt, solid object.

454
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,320
Moreover,

455
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,559
there was no sign of an open wound

456
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,159
or any other object found.

457
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
That's not possible.

458
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,519
During the first operation,

459
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,559
the surgeon must have seen
that piece of wood in there.

460
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,119
Unless the surgeon made a mistake.

461
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,119
The doctor suspects that it was likely
from the assault weapon.

462
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,880
I reckon it's a vital piece of evidence

463
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,840
that will help us identify
who the perpetrator is.

464
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,079
Dad must have realized this,

465
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,000
so they sent someone to silence him.

466
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,360
What about the broken tiles?

467
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,360
What are you talking about?

468
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,960
That day at Tarn's house,

469
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,559
I found some tile fragments in a pot.

470
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,400
They shouldn't have been there.

471
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,639
I told Mr. Anik about it,

472
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,400
in case they might help find who did it.

473
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
Why didn't you tell me?

474
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,519
Do you actually think
that Uncle Saen and Jan did it?

475
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,960
I can't be sure.

476
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,840
The perpetrator must have known
that I told Mr. Anik this.

477
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,320
Actually, the day I was attacked,

478
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,039
he didn't get the wrong person.

479
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,599
He threatened me.

480
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
I didn't tell you

481
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,920
because I didn't want you to worry.

482
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:10,039
It's obvious.

483
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,280
The culprit must be involved
in Tarn's assault.

484
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,880
Someone must have been following us.

485
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,079
Anyone that bold,

486
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,039
who's not scared of the police,

487
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,440
must have money and power.

488
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,360
TRD?

489
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,239
Saen, where are you going?
We have to talk.

490
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,519
Since it has come to this,

491
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,760
will you tell me

492
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,239
what happened after you took Tarn
away in your car?

493
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,559
-Saen!
-I don't know.

494
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,239
I know.

495
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,639
I know that you can get out of this.

496
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,400
What the doctor said about the splinter

497
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,400
means that you didn't put Tarn in a coma.

498
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,199
If we tell the police,
we'll be out of the spotlight.

499
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,039
Will you stay out of this?

500
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,800
But why? You didn't do anything wrong.

501
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
Why would you be a scapegoat
for your boss?

502
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,039
What I do is my business.

503
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,360
What did she say to you
to make you do all this?

504
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,079
Did she threaten you?

505
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,079
Are you afraid?

506
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,519
You should go home.

507
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,079
I can handle this.

508
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,559
Saen.

509
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,719
Saen.

510
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,880
The police will be on their way
to the hospital.

511
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,079
Tell him to find a place to lay low.

512
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,840
This way, we'll win this.

513
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,760
Why did you have to do that?

514
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,400
Was hurting the kid not enough?
You sent someone to shoot the cop.

515
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,480
I was only going to handle that young man.

516
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,880
But you had him transferred here
and alerted the police.

517
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,400
I had to nip it in the bud.

518
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,039
How many more doctors will you pay off?
How many police are you going to kill?

519
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,000
How is this going to end? By killing me?

520
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,079
Killing you would be nothing.

521
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,079
That's right. If you wanted to kill me,
you would have done so long ago.

522
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,199
But you didn't,

523
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,880
because you knew that more killings

524
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,639
would attract more attention to TRD

525
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,880
reducing your chances
of getting away with it.

526
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,679
I think instead of stirring
things up further,

527
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,000
we should make a deal.

528
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:33,719
What deal?

529
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,000
If you want the property development
project to continue,

530
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,320
you must stop hurting people.

531
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,280
Let me deal with Tatarn.

532
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,800
When he wakes up, I'll talk to him.

533
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,079
Are you going to ask him
not to pursue the assault case?

534
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,519
That's right.

535
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,400
When he wakes up,

536
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,239
I'll explain everything
that happened to him.

537
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,719
There's no chance that will work.

538
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,599
If you had done the job properly
in the first place,

539
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,320
it wouldn't have come to this.

540
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,320
It's your fault it came to this.

541
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,239
You sent people after us
after ordering me to negotiate with Tarn.

542
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,199
I knew what a coward you were.

543
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,280
That's why I sent my people
to finish the job.

544
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,960
But you were stupid.

545
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,519
You almost wrecked everything.

546
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,559
Tarn!

547
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,559
Tarn.

548
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,519
Clean up the scene.

549
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:17,119
What are you doing?

550
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:19,000
Why did you do that?

551
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,679
It's done.

552
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,360
Hey.

553
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,519
Let's move him.

554
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:29,199
Where are you taking him?

555
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,159
I won't let you do this to my nephew.

556
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,360
Stay out of this.
It's none of your business.

557
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,760
I made a recording.

558
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,599
You killed your own brother.

559
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,760
You caused the woman
you loved to go crazy.

560
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,920
But you pretended
it had nothing to do with you.

561
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,679
Pick him up.

562
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,000
How fortunate that luck
didn't side with an idiot like you.

563
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,639
We succeeded.

564
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,920
It's just a shame that my people
weren't thorough enough.

565
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,199
Your nephew is like a cat with nine lives.

566
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:06,480
What did you do to him?

567
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:11,360
Careful.

568
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,559
-You!
-Ouch.

569
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,960
You are even more heartless
than I thought.

570
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,960
You are no less heartless than I am.

571
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,519
Acting all worried about your nephew,
but not reporting it to the police.

572
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,639
Hurrying home to get rid
of incriminating evidence.

573
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:04,800
You might as well admit

574
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,159
that deep down,

575
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,960
you wanted him dead.

576
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,280
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
threatened him with the vase.

577
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,760
Besides, you didn't want him dead

578
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,840
just because I ordered it.

579
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,840
You know the real reason.

580
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,920
Should I tell the police

581
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,400
as well as your wife?

582
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,920
Jan.

583
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,039
What are you doing here?

584
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:32,199
I told you I could handle this.

585
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,400
If I hadn't come,

586
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,559
would I have found out what she did

587
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,880
to force your hand

588
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,719
and make you her scapegoat?

589
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,599
Scapegoat?

590
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,320
Do you really believe your husband
is so innocent and virtuous?

591
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,719
You put on a good facade.

592
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,119
Haven't you told your wife
the terrible thing you did?

593
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
What did you do?

594
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,360
ONE MILLION BAHT

595
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,440
Please return this to your boss, Uncle.

596
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,920
Let's not make things difficult.

597
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,199
-Accept this and--
-I won't.

598
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:33,199
I'm not like you,
choosing money over justice.

599
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:35,280
Justice?

600
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,880
Justice in this country can be bought.

601
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:41,280
Do you really think you can beat them?

602
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,440
Look at them, then look at you.

603
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,599
Stop being naive.

604
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,519
It's because of your generation
thinking that way

605
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,440
that our country is like this.

606
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,360
If you don't want to make things better,

607
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,800
feel free to put up with it.

608
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,000
Just don't get in my way.

609
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,119
Tarn.

610
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:03,679
Please Tarn, do it for me.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

611
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,760
Are you threatening me?

612
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,159
I'm just trying to warn you.

613
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,400
Stop trying.

614
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,119
I won't back down.

615
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:14,519
What do you hope to gain?

616
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,639
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

617
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,840
It's not going to bring about any change.

618
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,320
Things might not change today,

619
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,320
but they will in the future.

620
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,960
Time is on our side.

621
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:30,440
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

622
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:33,880
Winning might take time,

623
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:36,239
but that day will come.

624
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,559
But power is on their side.

625
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,119
We have to get that power on our side.

626
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,159
The people should have the power,
so that problems can be solved.

627
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,039
Am I supposed to give up

628
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:50,159
and be a coward like you?

629
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,000
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

630
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:56,800
and behave immorally like you?

631
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
I can't do it.

632
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Tarn!

633
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,719
You have to back down.

634
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,360
Let others do what they want.
It's not our concern.

635
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,280
Not our concern?

636
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,679
I'm not surprised by your indifference.

637
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,960
One of your family members died

638
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,039
and you kept it quiet to this day.

639
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:25,400
What are you implying?

640
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,639
Did you think you could keep a lid on it?

641
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,960
Don't forget that Mrs. Na is sick.

642
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:37,400
Do you think a sick person
can keep secrets?

643
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,639
Two years ago,
I went to visit your nephew Nut.

644
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,360
He wasn't home.

645
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,679
We had a long talk.

646
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:53,639
The words of a mentally ill person

647
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:57,159
are more truthful
than those of a mentally capable one.

648
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,639
Wouldn't you agree?

649
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,320
She's like that

650
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,239
because she feels guilty
about her husband dying in her arms

651
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,039
and not being able to do anything.

652
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,639
You killed your own brother,

653
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,719
You caused the woman
you loved to go crazy.

654
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,920
But you pretended
it had nothing to do with you.

655
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,960
So it's not surprising

656
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,719
that you said this isn't your concern.

657
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,400
The wife wanted his nephew dead
to get the inheritance.

658
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,480
As for the husband,

659
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,039
he wanted to kill his nephew

660
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:37,159
because Tatarn discovered his secret
that he killed his own brother.

661
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,239
You might have been able
to stop your nephew,

662
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,280
but you can't stop
other people from finding out.

663
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,760
And if your nephew recovers

664
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,599
and gets in my way again,

665
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,760
I won't hesitate to get rid of him.

666
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,559
If anyone gets in my way,

667
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,960
I will get rid of them all.

668
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,280
What you two need to do

669
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,199
is mind your own business

670
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,519
and let it all pan out the way I want.

671
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,199
That way, your secret…

672
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,559
will remain a secret.

673
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,400
You killed your own brother.

674
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,280
You're a murderer.

675
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,760
You thought that if Sib weren't around,

676
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,239
you could return to Na, didn't you?

677
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,119
I just didn't want him
to hurt her anymore.

678
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,639
I wanted her to be happy.

679
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:13,199
You two shared a secret.

680
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,239
You must have been delighted

681
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,079
when she went mad.

682
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,119
What are you going to do?

683
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,239
Everyone seems to know your secret.

684
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,480
Your boss and Tarn. Tofu as well.

685
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,559
I think he knows everything.

686
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,239
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

687
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,199
Are you going to beg him for mercy
as well as Tarn?

688
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,840
You can't keep begging
more and more people.

689
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,119
What sort of a life would that be?

690
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,199
Kuenchai.

691
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,199
Stop it, Kuenchai.

692
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,880
Kuenchai!

693
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,000
Let go, Kuenchai.

694
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:42,079
Let go.

695
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,079
-Mom.
-Let go, Kuenchai.

696
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,519
-Kuenchai, Let go.
-Kuenchai!

697
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,840
-Stop!
-Kuenchai!

698
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,880
Watch out.

699
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:50,400
Mom.

700
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,360
Tofu!

701
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,519
Help me, Tofu!

702
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,079
Tofu!

703
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:57,199
Kuenchai. Kuenchai, stop.

704
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,039
Kuenchai, let go. Kuenchai!

705
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,400
Kuenchai, let go. Stop.

706
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,880
Kuenchai, let go.

707
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,159
Kuenchai, stop.

708
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,480
Give it to me.

709
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,480
Kuenchai, let go.

710
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,960
Kuenchai.

711
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:30,880
What happened?

712
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,760
I just moved a little.

713
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:35,719
Then Kuenchai bit me.

714
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,920
It hurt just like that day.

715
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:40,679
What day?

716
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,960
The day Mr. Sib died.

717
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,000
I just remembered.

718
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:47,960
That day, Mrs. Na took me out
of the cabinet.

719
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,440
Mr. Sib was gravely ill.

720
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,360
She got me in case he felt cold.

721
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,559
Suddenly, Mr. Sib got angry.

722
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,320
He threw me away and trampled on me
as he walked out.

723
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,280
A little while after he left,

724
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,480
I heard Mr. Sib, Mr. Saen,

725
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,079
and Mrs. Na arguing with one another.

726
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:15,639
Mr. Sib kept coughing.

727
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:19,480
A short while later,
I heard someone stomping up the stairs.

728
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:23,960
I thought it was Mr. Sib.

729
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:25,840
But it wasn't him.

730
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:30,280
Thank goodness it was Mr. Saen.

731
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,920
Mr. Saen came up to fetch
some medicine for Mr. Sib.

732
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,639
But there was none left.

733
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,320
He filled the bottle with his own pills

734
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
Mr. Saen was so kind.

735
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:53,320
My uncle later told me

736
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,519
that Dad took the wrong meds.

737
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,800
I don't know how it could have happened.

738
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,480
Dad knew which meds he was allergic to.

739
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,360
Mom also knew.

740
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,480
Even I knew about it

741
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,679
because I used to buy meds for him.

742
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:13,480
So you're saying

743
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,519
Mr. Saen swapped the meds.

744
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,519
So Mr. Sib didn't take the pills
by mistake.

745
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:23,599
He lied.

746
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,519
Mrs. Na knew about his drug allergies.
She wouldn't have bought them.

747
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,519
What are you saying, Tofu?
I'm so confused.

748
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,119
I'm very sleepy.

749
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:42,239
Who said that?

750
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:46,880
I know. That's Mr. Backpack.

751
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:49,119
Mr. Backpack?

752
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,559
Yes.

753
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,960
I'm in here.

754
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,960
Nut's backpack.

755
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,639
Mrs. Na cleans Mr. Backpack regularly.

756
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,639
She keeps him in here.

757
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:28,639
He drifts between sleeping
and being awake just like me.

758
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,480
Do you know anything
about Mr. Sib and Mr. Saen?

759
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,840
I don't know about Mr. Saen,
but I remember Mr. Sib very clearly.

760
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,800
Nut didn't talk about his dad much.

761
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,440
But one day, he went to buy
some meds for his dad.

762
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:44,519
I was with him.

763
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,960
Where are you going?

764
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,920
I'm getting some meds for my dad.

765
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:57,199
Can I get something for cough and flu?

766
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,880
Any drug allergies?

767
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,519
Yes, NSAIDs.

768
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,480
Got it. Please wait a moment.

769
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,159
-I'll give you this one.
-Sure.

770
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:10,239
-And this one is for coughs.
-Okay.

771
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,679
-Has he ever taken these?
-Yes.

772
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,320
-That's 80 baht.
-Eighty baht?

773
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,599
-Thank you.
-Here.

774
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,679
-The change.
-Thank you.

775
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,880
That means Tatarn

776
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,320
also knew of Mr. Sib's drug allergies.

777
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,800
There's another character?

778
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,599
Is he related to the others?

779
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,239
Of course. Not only did Tarn go
with Nut to the pharmacy,

780
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,119
he also came here and spoke with Mrs. Na.

781
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:42,719
Mrs. Na told me about that day.

782
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:44,880
Do you know about it too?

783
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,320
It was a coincidence.

784
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,599
Mrs. Na took me out for a wash.

785
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,159
She hadn't put me back in the box.

786
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:54,079
I got to see Tatarn again
after a long time.

787
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,880
I'm thinking of setting up
a photography studio in Chiang Mai.

788
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,440
-Really?
-Yes.

789
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,159
They were talking for a while.

790
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:06,480
Then Mrs. Na excused herself
to take her meds.

791
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,280
I forgot that it's time for my meds.

792
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,360
Okay.

793
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,199
Mrs. Na, let me help.

794
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,880
Sib is allergic to these.

795
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,039
Sib is allergic to these.
Don't let him take these.

796
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,000
Saen, don't give it to him.

797
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,079
-Mrs. Na.
-Don't give it to Sib.

798
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,440
-Mrs. Na.
-Don't do it.

799
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,199
-Please calm down.
-Don't.

800
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:57,920
Don't make him take it.

801
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,199
I wasn't well back then.

802
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,719
But he made me feel better.

803
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,960
Was Tatarn aware that you weren't well?

804
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:11,960
He was.

805
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:19,639
I didn't sense that he was treating me
like a sick person at all, though.

806
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:23,239
He didn't find anything strange
about my hallucinations.

807
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,920
It made me drop my guard,
and we had a long chat.

808
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,199
What happened next?

809
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
Then…

810
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:41,360
Mrs. Na must have stopped

811
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,039
because she realized

812
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,320
that her condition

813
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,320
made her reveal a secret to Tatarn.

814
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,840
Tatarn must have wanted to tell Nut.

815
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,159
But it's not an easy topic to bring up.

816
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:01,159
He must have been afraid

817
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
of hurting Nut.

818
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,440
Also, they were no longer together.

819
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:10,239
He knew he had no right to interfere.

820
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:13,960
Tatarn kept that secret to himself

821
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:18,039
until the day trouble came knocking.

822
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:22,320
If things really played out
the way it seems,

823
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,360
how distressing it would be for Nut

824
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:27,519
to find out

825
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:29,480
that the uncle he respects

826
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,880
killed his father.

827
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,000
His relationship with his dad
might not have been the best,

828
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,760
but his dad and his mom raised him.

829
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,920
If Nut finds out
that his mom knows everything,

830
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,719
what will he think?

831
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,639
I bought snacks.

832
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,920
Keep reading.

833
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:17,440
Thank you.

834
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,559
Here's some sago.

835
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,440
Just be patient.

836
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,599
I believe that Dad
will come to love you like I do.

837
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:11,480
Dad will realize
that I made the right choice.

838
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:28,880
Have you been awake long?

839
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,559
You're awake?

840
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,079
Tofu.

841
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,400
What are you doing?

842
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:07,800
Tofu.

843
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,199
Hey.

844
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,960
Why do you look so pale?

845
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,760
Get up.

846
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:18,199
What's the matter?

847
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,119
Tofu.

848
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,960
Watch out.

849
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,279
Tofu, lie down.

850
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,760
Tofu.

851
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,000
What's wrong?

852
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,640
Tofu.

853
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,279
Mom!

854
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,840
Mom!

855
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,159
Mom, something is wrong with Tofu.

856
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,159
What should I do?

857
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,239
Should I act as if nothing has happened

858
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,720
and carry on as if everything is normal?

859
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,800
I want this house to be a home.

860
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,439
I want Nut and his mom to be happy.

861
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:03,399
But how will…

862
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,800
Tatarn get justice then?

863
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,600
What's wrong with Tofu?

864
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,479
They said it's stress-induced gastritis.

865
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,479
What is he stressed about?

866
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:27,159
Tofu.

867
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,640
How are you feeling?

868
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,760
Do you still feel nauseous?

869
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
Not anymore.

870
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:44,039
I'm sorry for making you worry.

871
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:49,159
How is Mr. Anik doing?

872
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,720
Dad woke up.

873
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,640
His condition is stable.

874
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,359
Can you take me to visit him, Nut?

875
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,640
He helped me
when I got lost in Chiang Mai.

876
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:07,319
Leave Tofu with me.
I've already visited Mr. Anik earlier.

877
01:10:07,399 --> 01:10:08,920
I've also visited Tarn.

878
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,960
How is he doing, by the way?

879
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,359
I think he's improving,

880
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,920
but he's still unconscious.

881
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,560
Speaking of which, two days ago,

882
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,840
before he had the surgery
to remove the pus,

883
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,600
he seemed to have improved
all of a sudden.

884
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,159
But the nurse said

885
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,560
that was normal

886
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,920
and he was still unconscious.

887
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,800
I remember his condition
improving like this once before.

888
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:42,279
It's the time I went to visit Tarn
in Chiang Mai with Tofu.

889
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:48,159
I really hope he recovers quickly
and he wakes up soon.

890
01:10:49,319 --> 01:10:51,319
I'll be back in a bit.

891
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,760
Call me if you need anything.

892
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,039
Leave him with me. Don't worry.

893
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,720
Let's go, Mom.

894
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,000
Take care of him.

895
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:05,039
I will.

896
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:23,560
Do you want some, Tofu? I'll get you some.

897
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:28,640
No, thank you.

898
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,920
Hello, Uncle Juea.

899
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:40,760
Prib,

900
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:44,039
where's the movie contract?

901
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,319
The document is in my car.

902
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,840
Can you check if I've signed it?

903
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:51,840
They need it soon.

904
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,720
Okay, I'll check it for you.

905
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,439
Okay. Got it.

906
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,760
What should I do?

907
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,680
As long as I'm alive,

908
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,920
Tatarn will never wake up.

909
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,159
You made the right decision
bringing Tatarn here for treatment.

910
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,079
He should wake up soon.

911
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,279
Hi, Nut.

912
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,119
Saen is walking me back.

913
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:27,560
Tofu hurt himself again.

914
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,720
He cut his hand.

915
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,399
Is it serious?

916
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,640
No. He's more interested in food.

917
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,039
He asked me to buy something.

918
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,800
That boy.

919
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:38,560
That's good to hear.

920
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:44,800
Please apologize to Tofu for me.
I can't visit him today.

921
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,640
It's okay.

922
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:49,880
Do you want to visit Tatarn?

923
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,520
Maybe next time. I don't want
to leave Tofu alone for long.

924
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:02,159
Goodbye for now.

925
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:03,560
Thank you, Saen.

926
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,960
What is it, Tofu?

927
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,720
Is it a good idea to lie to Nut?

928
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,760
Or you're a habitual liar anyway?

929
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:35,680
You helped me lie to Nut about my amnesia.

930
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,079
Wasn't I right?

931
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,159
You claimed that you and Tatarn
knew each other

932
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,840
and you went to Chiang Mai
because you began to remember.

933
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,680
You clearly used to live in the area.

934
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:51,000
But you hung around Na's house
until they let you stay.

935
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,680
What does that mean?

936
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,960
What is it that you want?

937
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:58,560
If I were to tell you

938
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:01,960
that I was at Tatarn's house that day

939
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:05,720
and I know about your argument,

940
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,039
about him knowing

941
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:12,319
that you killed Mr. Sibmeun,

942
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,359
what would you think I wanted?

943
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,840
So are you saying
that you went to Na's house

944
01:16:23,319 --> 01:16:25,560
and got close to Nut

945
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:28,399
in order to investigate what happened?

946
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,600
What an ingenious and roundabout method.

947
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:38,319
I didn't have much choice.

948
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,720
But you still have a choice.

949
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,800
You can choose to seek justice for Tatarn.

950
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,560
You want me to turn myself in.

951
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,079
Tatarn didn't do anything wrong.

952
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,920
This shouldn't have happened to him.

953
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,399
I want you to do the right thing.

954
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,760
I know that it's not easy.

955
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,239
But you need to put everything right.

956
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,640
I'm not just talking about you.

957
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:19,000
The real culprit, TRD,
also has to be made accountable.

958
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,119
If you're certain
that either I or TRD did it,

959
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,119
you should go to the police.

960
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,159
Unless you have no evidence.

961
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,560
You should think carefully.

962
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,920
Digging up the past

963
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,600
will not only cause Na to suffer,

964
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:55,560
but it will also hurt Nut.

965
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,119
If one day

966
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,840
I am no longer by your side,

967
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:26,319
will you be okay on your own, Nut?

968
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:34,760
Let's go home, Tofu.

969
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,520
Perhaps death

970
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,880
is not as scary as saying goodbye.

971
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,279
Kuenchai, what are you doing there?

972
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,760
What do you want to talk to me about, Jan?

973
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,560
I've always known
that Saen was in love with you.

974
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:06,840
But I never thought that he would kill
his own brother for your sake.

975
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:10,840
Maybe it's because I'm jealous
that I'm saying this now,

976
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,520
but you should know that your condition

977
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,319
has caused a lot of problems.

978
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:19,760
That secret should have stayed
between the two of you,

979
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,079
but now it has spread.

980
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,159
Do you mean Tatarn?

981
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,119
Yes, him.

982
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,920
Because of him,
Kaew-ching-duang found out.

983
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,720
If you do up the first button wrong,
the rest would get done up wrong.

984
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:40,439
He chose to help you that day,

985
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,680
and that led to the position he's in now.

986
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,720
He spends his whole life looking
over his shoulder. It's suffocating him.

987
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,680
Whichever way he turns is a dead end.

988
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,319
I'm sorry.

989
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:04,720
Honestly though,
I know it's not your fault.

990
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,880
But I still hate you.

991
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,720
I also hate him for helping you
without a care for his own well-being,

992
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,600
while you never did anything yourself.

993
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:21,800
You never thought
of standing up for yourself.

994
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,039
It compelled him to commit murder.

995
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,000
As for you, you were so immersed
in your grief and guilt

996
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:31,720
that you became mentally ill.

997
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,079
I used to think

998
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,479
that your life was pitiful.

999
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,239
But everything that happened
is your own fault.

1000
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,680
Well…

1001
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,000
Taking it out on you
won't change anything.

1002
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,800
I just wanted to tell you

1003
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,119
that I won't remain passive like you.

1004
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,600
If what he did

1005
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:09,640
was to relieve you from your suffering,

1006
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,239
I could do the same.

1007
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,000
What did you just say?

1008
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,520
You're making a mess.

1009
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,039
I said let's take a trip.

1010
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,920
Just the two of us?

1011
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,000
Yes.

1012
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,399
Mom is going away with her friend,

1013
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,560
Mrs. Pritr.

1014
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:50,600
She has called to ask Mom multiple times.

1015
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,720
At first, Mom thought
she would be a burden.

1016
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:57,680
I noticed she was down,
so I told her to go.

1017
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,199
So I was thinking we could go away.

1018
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,680
I made you a promise.

1019
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,000
Aren't you happy?

1020
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,800
Don't you want to go?

1021
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,840
Of course, I'm happy.
I'm dying to go on a trip with you.

1022
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:34,039
Why did you choose to come here?

1023
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:38,159
Actually, any place was fine.

1024
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:40,520
For this trip,

1025
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,680
the company is more important.

1026
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:50,680
I chose Sichang Island
because it was close.

1027
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,760
What should we do?

1028
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,760
Go swimming?

1029
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,840
No.

1030
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,439
I want to be with you

1031
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:04,399
and celebrate finishing the project.

1032
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:07,479
I brought you a gift.

1033
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,960
It's for me?

1034
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,039
In the past, I haven't done much for you.

1035
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,479
It's always you who do things for me.

1036
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,960
I wanted to thank you.

1037
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:21,960
This might be a little strange

1038
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:25,119
because I didn't know what to give you.

1039
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,239
I asked Gen for advice.

1040
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,960
Here you go.

1041
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:37,359
Ice cream?

1042
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:40,840
I was considering buying
an ice cream factory for you,

1043
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,680
but you'll have to wait until I get paid
like a Korean scriptwriter.

1044
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:47,720
Make do with this ice cream cake for now.

1045
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:52,880
I didn't know what flavor you liked,

1046
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,680
so I picked the flavor I like.

1047
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,159
What flavor do you like?

1048
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,239
I like tofu flavor.

1049
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,199
I would like to say I did it myself,

1050
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,159
but I actually had lots of help.

1051
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,319
Not just them, though.

1052
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:35,039
Chu and Nhong helped me as well.

1053
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:36,800
They were my brave tasters

1054
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:40,920
and they shared some ideas
about toppings and decoration.

1055
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:45,159
When I told people
that I wanted to make you a gift,

1056
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,920
everyone was happy to help.

1057
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,840
You really are loved by everyone.

1058
01:25:52,039 --> 01:25:54,920
I have to say that this gift

1059
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:57,680
is not only from me,

1060
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,119
but from everyone.

1061
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:03,039
Everyone wants you to be happy.

1062
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:06,920
I'm the happiest person in the world.

1063
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,880
Before I dig in,
can I have a photo with it?

1064
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,960
No problem.

1065
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,079
-I'll take the photos for you.
-Thanks.

1066
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,119
One, two, three.

1067
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,000
One, two, three.

1068
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,199
I have something else for you.

1069
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:39,600
It's from me alone.

1070
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:51,680
A chain bracelet with a lock?

1071
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:53,800
Are you going to chain us together?

1072
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,680
Yes. I'm binding you to me forever.

1073
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:00,239
You can't go anywhere.

1074
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,840
I'll stay with you, Nut.

1075
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:18,680
I'll never leave.

1076
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,479
Do I deserve to be happy?

1077
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,920
I took Tatarn's place.

1078
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,800
I get to be with Nut

1079
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,880
and do the things he can't.

1080
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,079
I know that my time is coming to an end.

1081
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:05,840
What will happen to me?

1082
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,239
Will I transform back
into Nut's teddy bear?

1083
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,800
Will I ever wake up again?

1084
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,680
Will I be able to speak?

1085
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,760
Will I be left with nothing

1086
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:21,439
and be erased from everyone's memory?

1087
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:28,119
When we get back,
what story do you plan to write?

1088
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,720
Juea and I haven't decided yet.

1089
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,880
He wants something new from me.

1090
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:38,000
Why don't you write my story?

1091
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,479
If he wants something new,

1092
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,760
I am your new boyfriend.

1093
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:45,359
I'm newer than Tatarn.

1094
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:47,960
You're such a jealous boy.

1095
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:51,399
I really am jealous.

1096
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:53,560
I want to be present in your work too.

1097
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,279
What would people think?

1098
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:58,800
I've just written about my ex,

1099
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,840
and then I'm writing
about my new boyfriend.

1100
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,239
They'll tear me apart online.

1101
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,640
Aren't you going to write about me?

1102
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,720
I'll think about

1103
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,279
what I could write.

1104
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,840
Promise?

1105
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,119
I promise.

1106
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,199
Let's stop talking about work.

1107
01:29:18,279 --> 01:29:19,359
Let's take some photos.

1108
01:29:25,239 --> 01:29:27,079
One, two, three.

1109
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:29,560
One, two, three.

1110
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,159
Nice.

1111
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:42,000
It's a shame that Mom
has a doctor's appointment

1112
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:44,800
or we could spend more time here.

1113
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:49,359
I'm already very happy.

1114
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:53,800
This memory is something
I'll never forget.

1115
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,520
Thank you for doing so much for me, Nut.

1116
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:14,680
Seeing you happy makes me happy.

1117
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,039
I hope this happiness stays with us
for a long time.

1118
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,840
You should understand

1119
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,680
that it hurts even more

1120
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,680
to see your loved ones in pain.

1121
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,159
Tofu!

1122
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,039
Tofu, what happened?

1123
01:30:41,079 --> 01:30:43,720
I can see you're happy
that you found each other.

1124
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,920
I can tell that you two
can take care of each other.

1125
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,640
If it makes you happy, then be together.

1126
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,680
Didn't I tell you?

1127
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,359
I'm happy

1128
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,279
to see you happy.

1129
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,479
I'm happy

1130
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:04,880
to see you smile.

1131
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
Please be very happy.

1132
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,600
