00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
When you're with me you're mean to me,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.740
but with Lin you're so sweet.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.440
Now, I don't know when you're joking or when you're serious.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620
What's your deal?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.280
You're such a....

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360
Sine

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.280
you're my sin(90)

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280
you're my number one.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.780
Tan

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.540
I also wanna tell you that,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
the domain (in math)

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.900
It's like the feeling,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
that I have for you.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.900
The sine's domain..

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960
It's a real number that...

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980
never ends.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.940
Sine, why are you back so early?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.020
I don't have any studies today.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.000
I'll be up in my room.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.990
Is everything okay?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm just a bit sleepy.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.780
Are you alright?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.680
Let me take a rest.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.380
Hey, Atom

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.640
Leo

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.000
Guys!!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.520
What!?
Guys!!

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.020
What!?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.220
I know you have something on your mind.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560
Otherwise, we won't be here this late.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.260
I'll be honest with you guys

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.860
I like Sine.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.080
That's it.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.560
I'll tell you only once.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.080
I'm already so shy!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.880
It's the first time that,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.660
Sine is ignoring me.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.060
I'm so embarrassed.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.220
How about...

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.460
Lin?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.480
What are you going to do?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.460
I'll have to tell her the truth.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600
I'm afraid I'll make her sad.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.000
Don't worry.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.360
Tonight, let's teach Tan about Ethanol.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.560
Good idea.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.220
Do you guys know,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.480
there's many types of alcohol?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.440
I see.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.440
About the details..

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.080
I'll teach you in Thonglor.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.360
Okay

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.580
I want to thank you, Atom

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.840
for being here with me.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.840
No problem.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.840
After all, I'm your friend.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.120
Let the light-weighted Leo go sleep at home.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.580
Let him sleep.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.400
Atom

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.160
I think I'll have to tell Lin.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.340
About what?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.720
About me and Sine.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.040
I feel like...

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.240
It's not fair for Lin,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.380
I'm so selfish.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.980
Uhh

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.800
Do it!

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.720
Just tell her.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.080
So, it will no longer bother you.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.080
So, you can still be friends with her.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.540
Yeah, It's just like you said.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.380
I'll tell her tomorrow.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.380
Good.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.700
It's been bothering me a lot.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.000
Leo and I will always be here for you.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.500
Atom..

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.360
don't forget to help me.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.880
Don't worry.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.600
I'll be by your side.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.600
Want me to talk with Sine?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600
Okay, I'll help you.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.700
Can I sit with you?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.700
Go ahead.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.000
But if you are going to talk about him..

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.700
don't bother.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.100
Okay.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.380
I understand how you feel.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.380
I shouldn't be their third wheel.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.680
It should only be the two of them.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.680
So, they can love each other.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.680
I think I should leave.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.680
Let this end with me.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.260
I don't think so.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.500
It can't end with you.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.340
Cuz, Tan loves you.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.340
I'm afraid that our relationship won't last long.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.700
Listen to me.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.040
The duration is up to both of you to decide.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.280
That you're together because of love

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.200
or you just feel good.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040
Think carefully.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.240
Hey!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.620
Talk to me.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.160
How long will you keep ignoring me?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.920
Tell me what's on your mind.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.360
I'd feel better, even if you scold me.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.720
Don't just keep quiet.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.020
Speak out!

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.380
What's your problem?

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.140
Didn't you tell me...

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.500
that friends can share each other anything?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.500
We're not even together yet.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.580
We haven't started yet.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.580
So, why the hell are you ignoring me?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.520
You said that you don't want to lose your best friend.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.060
So, why do you feel so bad?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.400
Just tell me.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.180
Are you done?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.420
What's up?

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.420
Call him...

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.800
Of course, it's me again.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800
It's always me.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800
Ohhh

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.480
I'll put it on speaker.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.480
Okay.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.980
Yes, Sir Neung.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.980
He answered.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.980
Umm, Sine.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.980
Can we talk?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.320
I have something to ask you.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.040
Tan looks absent-minded and ..

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.180
like sad and stressed.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.040
Do you know what's going on?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.740
I think he's fine.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.120
He is just playing around.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.400
He looks like he broke up with someone.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.400
How can he feel like that?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.400
He doesn't even have a special one.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.340
Hmm, does he really not have a someone special?

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.180
I think so too.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.080
A person like Tan, if he flirts with someone...

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.220
means that he really likes that person.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.120
Anyway..

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.780
please look after him.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.040
To tell you the truth..

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.940
lately, I don't want to be with him.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.300
Well...

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.820
If you're free,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.820
just drop by.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.280
I'm a bit worried.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.200
Anyway, I won't bother you any longer.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200
Okay, goodbye.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.000
Tough luck, kid.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
That's all I can help.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.640
The rest is...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.760
up to you.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.280
Okay, thanks.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.280
I already glad with just that.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.540
That's all you're gonna get.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.160
Hey, Lin.
Hey, Sine.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.300
How many kilometers so far?

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.300
Can I not count the distance?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.300
Just the spot for my Instagram.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.300
You really gonna do that?

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.620
The weather's really good today.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720
The sky is so clear.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720
Yeah, perfect for cycling.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.320
Have you been here for a long time?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.320
I've been here for 2 hours.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.320
My calves are getting sore.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.860
Ohh, get home safely.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.460
Okay, see you.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.600
Bye-bye.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.080
Hello, Tan.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.000
I just saw your missed calls.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.160
Oh yes, I wanted to see you.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.080
I'm at Peppermint Bike Park.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.140
Can we meet up?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.840
Sure,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.840
but...

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.640
It'll be a while, I have something to do.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.100
I'll drop by Mint Café.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.600
See you, then.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.080
Okay, I'll be waiting for you.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.540
Okay, see you.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.860
Bye-bye.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.140
I cycled so much today.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.140
I think..

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.140
you drop a few.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.140
I hope so.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.060
To be honest..

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.460
I also wanted to see you.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.840
The truth is..

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.000
I know that...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.480
Yesterday, you had a fight with Sine.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.800
I know how you feel.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.520
Can I hold your hand?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.560
It would be nice...

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.740
If I could hold your hand like this...

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.720
like lovers.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.640
But do you know..

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.560
It'd be better if we changed how we hold hands.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.200
Like this...

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.200
like friends.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.840
Taking care of each other.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.840
Worry about one another.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.220
When you're happy or sad, you'll still have this friend...

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.220
by your side.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.420
Tan.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.920
Don't lie to your heart about your true feelings.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.620
Choosing what is right for you...

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.620
it's better that way.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.540
Lin, I'm sorry.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.780
"Sorry"...

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.780
it's truly a selfish word, right?

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.260
Don't think too much.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.320
I'll drop you off.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.040
Don't worry, my house is right around the corner.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.520
In reality, my father is very strict.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.520
I'll be off, then.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.880
Okay.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:40.640
Anyway,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.240
don't forget to do something to make up with Sine, tonight.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.980
Bye.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.380
This song is for..

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.160
the person..

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.840
who keeps me awake at night.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.460
I'll post this on Facebook.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.420
I won't tag anyone, let him see it by himself.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.680
[Late at night, you sleep tight.]

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.440
[But you don’t know, right? I can’t sleep tonight.]

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.600
[Inside someone’s heart, full of love...]

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.420
[The love, that you’ll never know.]

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.840
[Someday... I hope you’ll know... I’ll be glad.]

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.400
Why didn't you attend class?

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.660
The final examination is coming soon.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.900
[I don’t know, do I?]

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.400
[I should go, should I?]

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.400
[Please, treat me.]

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.340
[Treat me, please?]

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.960
[If you don't love me,]

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.660
[just tell me clearly.]

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.360
[Do not trick me.]

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.140
[Do not hurt...]

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.540
