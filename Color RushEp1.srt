4
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:25,404
My aunt doesn't recall...

5
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,103
Mom was wearing the headband the day she disappeared.

6
00:00:29,504 --> 00:00:30,874
But I do.

7
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,173
However, I suffer from monochromacy,

8
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:37,144
so I have no way of telling what color it was.

9
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:40,684
Everything is in a shade of gray to me,

10
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:42,813
so I just can't say.

11
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:44,923
What color...

12
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:47,294
"What color..."

13
00:00:47,553 --> 00:00:52,063
Yellow.

14
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,203
No!

15
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:39,774
A man in his 40s kidnapped a woman in her 30s...

16
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:42,214
and held her captive against her will.

17
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:46,714
According to some acquaintances, the suspect is a monochromat.

18
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,054
He appears to have taken her...

19
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:50,514
after her presence led him to identify colors.

20
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:53,684
Those like me with monochromatic vision...

21
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:56,654
who see the world only in gray are called Mono.

22
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:02,894
We're different from those who have total color blindness.

23
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,263
Our cone cells aren't impaired,

24
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:07,834
but our brains can't distinguish the colors.

25
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:10,674
However, looking at the face of a certain someone...

26
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:12,603
lets us see colors.

27
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,614
And that person...

28
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:19,283
who opens the world of colors to us are known as Probe.

29
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:22,984
The only issue is that...

30
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:26,454
there is only a rare chance of a mono meeting a probe...

31
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:31,823
and quite a number of them don't get to meet theirs at all.

32
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,293
Worried that they'll lose the ability to see colors again,

33
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,563
monos become obsessed with their probes.

34
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:40,364
And their obsession...

35
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,434
leads to them to break the law.

36
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:48,244
Monos and probes should never meet one another.

37
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,584
Why are you watching something like that?

00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,494
I'm moving schools again?

40
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:07,263
Yes. To a boys' school this time.

41
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:09,234
Not a coed school?

42
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,834
Why? You think you'll be missing out?

43
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:14,274
It's not like you ever date anyone anyway.

44
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,503
I beat up a boy who teased me of my condition...

45
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:22,674
and now I'm once again transferring to a new school.

46
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,554
Darn it. I don't know who did this,

47
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:35,124
but someone threatened me again to stop looking into the mono case.

48
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:38,464
Aunt Yi Rang, you need to watch out for yourself.

49
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,093
You don't know who you're up against.

50
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:43,093
That's more the reason for me keep digging.

51

I'll dig, dig, and dig.

52

I must keep digging.

53

Four years ago, my mom's disappeared.

54
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,904
Since then, my aunt has been searching for her...

55
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,744
by investigating all related cases.

56
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:59,184

- Is that it? - Yes.

00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:50,833
Right.

74
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,034
See that empty seat next to the class leader?

75
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,833
You can sit there.

Hold on. Class leader.

- Yes? - One's missing.

Oh...

Asleep like always.

83
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,804
Just when is he set to make his debut?

84
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,974
Why does he even bother coming to school?

85
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,374
Unbelievable.

86
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:34,174
You all seem to be here, so I'll skip the roll call.

87
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:37,713
Don't make any trouble today and don't chat in class. Got it?

88
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,984
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,323
I hope we get along.

00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:56,763
Sure, me too. I'm Choi Yeon Woo.

Are you also a K-pop idol trainee?

Him too, you know.

96
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:07,344
Hey.

97
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,184
Okay, fine. I'll cut it out.

98
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,443
Anyway, my name is Jung Joo Haeng.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,813
It's probably obvious, but I'm class leader.

Who Joo Haeng just referred to is him.

Go Yoo Han, the one taking a nap.

102
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:24,094
He denies it since it isn't official yet,

103
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,594
but he's a K-pop idol trainee.

104
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,794
Anyway, ask Joo Haeng if you have any questions.

105
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:30,934
Why me?

106
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:36,234
No, he's right. Come to me instead of going to Min Jae.

107
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:37,773
What?

108
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:41,713
The old man in him could take up your time, you see.

109
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:19,344
Grandpa Min Jae will only bore you silly,

110
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,984
so refrain from asking him anything.

111

Matching a black face mask with his school uniform.

112
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,294
He's trying to get that to trend.

113
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:30,523
Are you sure he didn't remove a mole?

114
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,094
So what's with him and the old man?

115
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,763
The spirit of one takes over Min Jae sometimes.

116
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,534
By the way, you're quite pretty.

117
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:01,054
- I'm not. - Actually, you're stunning.

118

while jumping from one agency to another,

120
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,563
but you're worth noticing.

121
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,364
Yoo Han, it's not like you can remember faces anyway.

122
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,903
I may not be able to, but I can still feel one's vibe.

123
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,003
He's a pretty boy for sure.

124
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,643
Life must be tiring for you. So which agency are you with?

125
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,474
I know which ones you should avoid.

126
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,013
I'm not a trainee.

127
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,814
- Why? - What?

128
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:28,854
What?

129
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:31,724
I've never been interested.

130
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:39,564
Go Yoo Han, this is the first time...

131
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,393
you've shown interest in anyone but us.

132
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:43,663
Have you always been this friendly?

133
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,803
Doesn't he seem like the type to suddenly give up on college...

134
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,104
and announce his debut?

135
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,374
Right, Min Jae?

136
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,104
Should I ask the old man later on?

137
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,744
Just who is this old man?

138
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:55,214
The first class is about to begin.

139

00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:53,084
I'm not sure. I can't say for sure...

168
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,683
since it's my first time witnessing a case.

169
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,753
But I'm right. It's proof that he's experiencing a color rush.

170
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:59,854
Be a doctor yourself if you're so sure.

171
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,994
I need to step out to collect some materials,

172
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,393
so keep an eye on him for me.

173
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:07,564
Call me if his eyes start to pop out or is about to die.

174
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:09,433
Got it.

175
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:16,704
Choi Yeon Woo, you can open your eyes now.

176
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:29,954
Do you want something for your headache?

177
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,423
- Yes. - Then sit up.

178
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,753
No. I'm too dizzy.

179
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:39,594
Why? Is it because you can see colors now?

180
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,433
Still, you should take the medicine.

181
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,423
That's the color of the ocean.

182
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:14,423
- The color of the ocean? - Yes.

183
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:17,494
What is it?

184
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,834
The oceans I saw were of a different color.

185
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:24,704
How the moonlight could shine on the water always fascinated me,

186
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,374
but this is the color of that water.

187
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:34,413
Gosh...

188
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,553
What is it?

189
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,253
The colors...

190
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,954
I'm losing them.

191
00:15:01,104 --> 00:15:02,614
Decoloring?

192
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,183
Are the colors disappearing?

193
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:06,944
Yes.

194
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:14,854
At least, my breathing is better now.

195
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,224
Before, I felt like I was suffocating.

196
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:21,433
I don't like being touched by just anyone.

197
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:25,303
Then you should know that I'm more than that to you.

198
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:28,604
A mono and his probe.

199
00:15:30,074 --> 00:15:31,704
That's what I am, aren't I?

200
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:50,694
(Color Rush)
