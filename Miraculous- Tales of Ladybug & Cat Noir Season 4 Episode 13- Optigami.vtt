00:02.000 --> 00:04.880
<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:07.960
<i>Just a normal girl,</i>
<i>with a normal life.</i>

00:07.960 --> 00:10.920
<i>But there's something about me</i>
<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.520
<i>Because I've got a secret.</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:15.800
<i>♪ Miraculous, simply the best</i>

00:15.800 --> 00:18.200
<i>♪ Up to the test</i>
<i>when things go wrong</i>

00:18.200 --> 00:21.040
<i>♪ Miraculous, the luckiest</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:24.080

00:24.080 --> 00:26.520
<i>♪ Miraculous</i>

00:26.520 --> 00:28.400
<i>♪ Miraculous ♪</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:32.680
This is what we've learned,
thanks to Chloé Bourgeois

00:32.680 --> 00:36.320
- as Miracle Queen.
- Yes. I remember.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.040
People of Paris! Listen
to Miracle Queen's first order.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.000
From now on, no one will have
to keep his identity a secret!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.840
All the Miraculous wearers,
come to me!

01:00.360 --> 01:03.840
Yes... Yes! No more hiding!

01:07.040 --> 01:09.960
Since then,
I've created Optigami.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.840
My beautiful amok,
bring my creation to life.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.720
Optigami, I am Mayura.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.040
Be my eyes and discover
all of Ladybug's secrets.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.200
Under my control, Optigami

01:37.200 --> 01:39.680
followed
each of the Miraculous holders.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.200
Alas,
they're just ordinary teenagers,

01:42.200 --> 01:45.920
who spend their time between
school and other activities.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.640
True, Ladybug sometimes
trusts them with a Miraculous,

01:53.640 --> 01:56.040
but she's established rules
that prevent anyone

01:56.040 --> 01:57.840
from discovering her identity.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.880
She never shows her face, always
takes back the Miraculous,

02:01.400 --> 02:03.840
and makes sure
no one ever follows her.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.280
Even Optigami
couldn't stay on her tail.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.320
We will learn nothing
more with this Sentimonster.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.920
On the contrary, I believe that
it will help us finally discover

02:14.920 --> 02:16.760
who is behind Ladybug's mask.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.880
There's a flaw when the holder
gives their Miraculous back!

02:20.280 --> 02:23.880
There! Imagine if Optigami
was hiding in the Miraculous

02:23.880 --> 02:25.320
Ladybug took back.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.160
He would lead us straight
to her home,

02:27.160 --> 02:28.560
unknowingly.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.960
Brilliant! But how do you plan

02:29.960 --> 02:32.000
- to do that?
- I need an event

02:32.000 --> 02:34.240
where all the holders
will be sure to come,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.480
and a supervillain
who'll force her to assign

02:36.480 --> 02:38.320
a Miraculous to defeat it!

02:38.640 --> 02:41.000
And I know
just the right person for it.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.960
Are you serious?
Where is the glitter?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.920
- You're utterly useless!
- (Phone rings)

02:44.920 --> 02:47.240
- Shoo! Shoo!
- GABRIEL AGRESTE:<i> Audrey!</i>

02:47.240 --> 02:49.880
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>this idea was formidable.</i>

02:49.880 --> 02:51.600
Utterly formidable, you mean.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.440
Uh... What was the idea, again?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.560
This new award by your magazine.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.160
The Fashion Icon of the month!

02:57.160 --> 02:58.600
And I was thinking
what better way

02:58.600 --> 02:59.640
to launch the award

02:59.640 --> 03:01.520
than by electing my son?

03:01.520 --> 03:03.640
I'll take care
of the invitations right now!

03:08.040 --> 03:10.080
Everyone's invited to this party

03:10.080 --> 03:11.600
where Adrien's going to receive

03:11.600 --> 03:14.160
the Fashion Icon Award
from<i> Style Queen.</i>

03:14.160 --> 03:16.240
That's why she's paralysed.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.080
Roar! Since everyone's invited,
can we come too?

03:19.080 --> 03:20.880
ALL: Yeah!

03:21.320 --> 03:25.200
Wait a sec. Sorry, but you know
the rule, no holder, no wander!

03:25.480 --> 03:28.160
In that case, I can come,
since I've got a holder!

03:28.520 --> 03:31.120
Technically, no.
I hold onto her Miraculous.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.560
Well, then just
give it to her permanently.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.800
Trixx isn't wrong. Now I know
you're Ladybug, I could help.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.240
No. That'd be too risky.
You know the rule.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.720
No Miraculous out of my sight,
no plight!

03:42.520 --> 03:44.520
You're the Guardian. Your call.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.000
Besides, it's time to go see
Adrien, our Fashion Icon.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.640
Adrien!

04:00.240 --> 04:04.120
- Yeah! Pew-pew. Pew-pew!
- Yeah! Pew-pew. Pew-pew!

04:04.360 --> 04:07.440
I bet I can get there before
the elevator does! Max, time me!

04:07.440 --> 04:08.560
Ready? Go!

04:10.320 --> 04:12.240
Elevators are perfect
for getting close

04:12.240 --> 04:15.080
- to your secret crush.
- What? No!

04:15.320 --> 04:17.760
What if we accidentally touch?

04:21.080 --> 04:23.400
Let's not rush things, OK?

04:28.360 --> 04:32.200
- Yeah! Pew-pew. Pew-pew!
- Yeah! Pew-pew. Pew-pew!

04:32.200 --> 04:34.480
(Laughter)

04:35.040 --> 04:38.920
Ugh! If you don't start filming
this instant, you're fired!

04:38.920 --> 04:41.520
Oh, but we have to wait
for Alec, he's the emcee!

04:41.520 --> 04:44.240
Ridiculous! utterly ridiculous!

04:47.160 --> 04:50.040
- Optigami is in place, sir.
- Ladybug has no idea

04:50.040 --> 04:53.680
that her defeat will be captured
on film! Icing on the cake!

04:56.400 --> 04:58.560
Yeah! Oh, come on!

05:09.640 --> 05:12.880
- Hey! What's this?
- SentiAlec, you're up.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.920
At your command, Shadow Moth.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.440
(Cheering)

05:24.000 --> 05:25.680
- It's about time!
- Roll!

05:27.600 --> 05:30.240
- You won't be disappointed!
- You'll see.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.600
It was worth the wait.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.120
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the outdated headquarters

05:36.120 --> 05:39.000
of<i> Style Queen </i>magazine,
that's almost as outdated

05:39.000 --> 05:41.240
as Audrey Bourgeois herself!

05:41.240 --> 05:42.760
(Laughter)

05:42.760 --> 05:45.600
- (Laughter)
- Grr!

05:45.800 --> 05:48.640
Well, well, has the Queen
of Digs suddenly lost her voice?

05:48.640 --> 05:50.560
What a shame.
She could have told you

05:50.560 --> 05:53.240
that this whole
award ceremony is rigged!

05:53.240 --> 05:56.200
- Sorry, my boy!
- That's false, utterly false!

05:56.200 --> 05:58.680
Don't listen to him!
You! How dare you?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.760
- You're --
- Fired! Ha, ha! Too late!

06:00.760 --> 06:03.520
You've utterly
ridiculed yourself already!

06:03.520 --> 06:05.240
(Laughter)

06:06.560 --> 06:08.600
Fly away, my little akuma,

06:08.600 --> 06:12.480
and evilise this wonderfully
vile queen, once again!

06:13.560 --> 06:15.440
(Laughter)

06:17.720 --> 06:20.840
Style Queen, I am Shadow Moth.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.040
This emcee has lost
all sense of style and class.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.040
Spare me the boring speech,
Shadow Moth.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.840
Give me back my powers and
I'll give you the two trinkets

06:28.920 --> 06:31.680
- you're so obsessed with!
- Immediately, my Queen.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.040
Aaah!

06:38.880 --> 06:42.040
We gotta be ready in case
Ladybug needs us. Come on!

06:42.200 --> 06:44.680
Glitter? Really?
For a Style Queen you sure are

06:44.680 --> 06:46.040
a fashion victim!

06:46.320 --> 06:48.120
You're the only victim
around here!

06:49.360 --> 06:50.480
(He laughs)

06:54.920 --> 06:57.440
- Go, Adrien, run!
- Kagami, no!

06:57.440 --> 06:59.480
Since you want to play the hero,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.720
you'll be the first
to get fired!

07:02.760 --> 07:04.440
(Chloé screams)

07:05.240 --> 07:08.200
Kagami, holder of the Dragon
Miraculous. Neutralised.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.800
We must find the others
before Ladybug shows up.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.840
Plagg...

07:20.280 --> 07:22.320
Tikk -- Tick, tick, tick!

07:22.320 --> 07:24.280
Tick-tock.
It's time to get out of here!

07:24.280 --> 07:27.280
Uh, yeah... I was about to go
and get some help.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.960
How gorgeous of you...
Uh, I mean how brave of you!

07:31.280 --> 07:34.520
- Ladybug will show up!
- Yes, and Cat Noir!

07:35.400 --> 07:37.280
Alec...

07:38.280 --> 07:40.760
- This way, Mom! I saw him!
- I saw you laugh

07:40.760 --> 07:42.840
when he ridiculed me!
You're fired!

07:45.360 --> 07:48.720
Chloé, holder of the Miraculous
of the Bee. Neutralised.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.560
Optigami, go find the others.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.360
This is the safest way!
Run! Run! Go! Go!

07:56.240 --> 08:00.040
Max, holder of the Miraculous
of the Horse. Located.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.280
It seems like some know-it-alls
are trying to get out of here,

08:03.280 --> 08:05.240
- my dear Queen.
- No one can escape

08:05.240 --> 08:06.800
my unrivalled style!

08:15.640 --> 08:17.440
Aaah!

08:18.440 --> 08:22.040
No underdressed slob gets
out of here without a makeover!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.120
- Uh... Sorry!
- Sorry!

08:25.120 --> 08:26.280
(Embarrassed laugh)

08:27.800 --> 08:29.000
The elevator doesn't work.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.600
(Straining)

08:32.840 --> 08:35.160
- It's too hard.
- I'm sure Cat Noir

08:35.160 --> 08:38.720
- will be along to save us.
- Yeah... or Ladybug.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.320
(Phone buzzes)

08:45.320 --> 08:46.840
<i>I'm stuck in the elevator!</i>

08:49.320 --> 08:51.000
<i>With Adrien? LOL!</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:54.600
<i>Yeah!</i>

08:56.960 --> 08:58.880
<i>I'm stuck in an elevator</i>
<i>with Marinette.</i>

08:58.880 --> 09:02.360
This is so cool, Marinette
and Adrien are stuck together!

09:02.360 --> 09:05.080
Yeah, that's awesome,
and not at all a problem!

09:05.640 --> 09:07.600
<i>How are you gonna do</i>
<i>what you need to do?</i>

09:07.600 --> 09:09.920
<i>I have a plan,</i>
<i>but I need some time alone.</i>

09:09.920 --> 09:12.920
Gotta find a way
to let Ladybug know we're here.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.400
- I'll go with you!
- Er... No, no, no, no, no!

09:15.400 --> 09:17.680
We should split up.
If Style Queen gets to me first,

09:17.680 --> 09:20.920
- you'll do something.
- I won't let that happen.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.240
OK, but first
I've gotta make a pit stop,

09:24.240 --> 09:26.960
if you know what I mean.
Wait here. I'll be right back.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.520
I release you
from your existence, SentiAlec.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.360
Aah! Huh?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.280
Supervillain?
Super-moron, right?

09:41.840 --> 09:42.960
Right!

09:42.960 --> 09:44.080
Some still mock you

09:44.080 --> 09:45.840
in the air ducts!

09:45.840 --> 09:46.880
Argh!

09:49.200 --> 09:51.080
Hold on! It's gonna be OK!

09:56.880 --> 10:00.560
Luka, holder of the Miraculous
of the Snake. Neutralised.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.040
Only three left.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.080
(Dialling)

10:06.080 --> 10:08.120
- (Laughter)
- (Phone rings)

10:08.400 --> 10:10.400
It's the Guardian's
emergency cell!

10:10.760 --> 10:12.280
KWAMIS:<i> Hello?</i>

10:12.960 --> 10:16.520
- Who is it?
- Uh... I'm... I'm calling...

10:16.520 --> 10:18.400
I'm calling the fire department!

10:18.400 --> 10:20.560
Hello?
We're trapped in an elevator

10:20.560 --> 10:23.160
- in Montparnasse Tower!
- Got it. We're taking off!

10:23.640 --> 10:26.440
No, no! Don't fly here!
Because... um...

10:26.440 --> 10:28.880
helicopters
are bad for the environment!

10:28.880 --> 10:31.840
Maybe come on horseback,
instead!

10:33.320 --> 10:35.760
You got that, fire department?
On horseback!

10:35.760 --> 10:39.040
- Horse! She means you, Kaalki!
- I am not a horse.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.440
I am a noble steed!
I was the companion

10:41.440 --> 10:43.240
to the most glorious heroes!

10:43.240 --> 10:44.920
She might be
talking about Fluff!

10:44.920 --> 10:47.120
Of course! In prehistoric times,

10:47.120 --> 10:49.160
they had a common ancestor.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.320
Let's go back
to prehistoric times!

10:51.320 --> 10:53.680
No, no, not prehistoric times!

10:56.440 --> 10:57.840
Shh!

10:59.440 --> 11:02.080
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She's in trouble, for sure.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.600
- What are we gonna do?
- Stay calm. She'll call back.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.040
Ha, ha!

11:11.400 --> 11:12.280
PLAGG: Nnn-nnn.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.440
- I...
- I...

11:16.200 --> 11:17.880
BOTH:
..have to tell you something.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.280
It's only your son. He's safe
with one of his classmates.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.520
She's not on our list.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.520
There's no one in that elevator,
Style Queen.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.920
Phew!
What were you gonna tell me?

11:30.280 --> 11:31.920
Uh, nothing. You?

11:32.080 --> 11:35.480
Just... I was wondering
what that "eye thing" was.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.600
I don't know.
But we'd better lay low.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.360
I'll text Alya and ask
if she can call for help.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.960
So... Here first, huh?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.040
Everyone's a loser today!

11:47.120 --> 11:50.560
Kim, holder of the Miraculous
of the Monkey. Neutralised.

11:50.560 --> 11:55.320
That leaves us Alya and Nino,
the Fox and the Turtle.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.200
Style Queen, only two left.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.160
<i>Call this number.</i>

12:05.800 --> 12:07.280
- Hello?
-<i> I knew the Guardian</i>

12:07.280 --> 12:09.360
<i>- should've let me party!</i>
- Trixx?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.600
(Phone rings)

12:12.640 --> 12:14.600
<i>Hey, there, it's Alya.</i>
<i>If you wanna stay connected,</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:15.880
<i>leave a message!</i>

12:21.000 --> 12:24.040
Nino Lahiffe. Located. Alone.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.240
Style Queen, you're up.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.720
I know the perfect bait
to lure our last target

12:34.720 --> 12:36.320
out of her hiding place.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.120
SentiNino, I am Shadow Moth.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.200
You will help me find
Alya Césaire.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.360
Alya! Alya!

12:49.360 --> 12:52.520
- Come on! Saddle up!
- Alya!

12:52.760 --> 12:54.400
Alya!

12:54.400 --> 12:56.600
Um, when a kwami
uses their power

12:56.600 --> 12:58.240
without their holder,
doesn't it usually

12:58.240 --> 12:59.560
set off catastrophes?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.280
I never set off catastrophes.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.760
Only exceptional events!

13:07.040 --> 13:09.160
(Phone rings)
<i>Don't forget to take</i>

13:09.160 --> 13:10.560
<i>the Bee Miraculous.</i>

13:10.560 --> 13:12.480
<i>It's essential to the plan!</i>

13:12.480 --> 13:14.320
I know, girl, don't worry.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.320
Time to shine, guys!

13:19.320 --> 13:20.680
Yeah!

13:22.080 --> 13:24.200
Trixx, let's pounce!

13:40.560 --> 13:43.120
Mirage! And voilà!

13:43.400 --> 13:45.920
A cool little Ladybug illusion
to keep Style Queen busy,

13:45.920 --> 13:47.160
while I'll...

13:51.760 --> 13:53.640
Did the Guardian
ask you to do that?

13:53.640 --> 13:54.880
Just a precaution.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.320
Voyage!

14:06.240 --> 14:09.000
Alya! Alya!

14:09.680 --> 14:11.040
Alya!

14:12.040 --> 14:13.920
Alya!

14:14.280 --> 14:16.600
- Alya!
- Style Queen might hear you!

14:16.600 --> 14:18.240
Alya Césaire located, sir.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.360
But she's transformed
into Rena Rouge!

14:20.360 --> 14:22.160
- And she's with a kwami!
- What?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.600
Here, your Miraculous.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.880
Why are you the one
giving it to me?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.960
Ladybug gave me a mission.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.120
Go help her. I'll meet up later.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.800
The only person
Ladybug entrusted

14:31.800 --> 14:34.040
to distribute a Miraculous
was Cat Noir.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.880
Seems Alya Césaire
is not just any holder.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.560
Be that as it may, our plan has
not been compromised. Wayzz...

14:40.560 --> 14:41.520
Shell on!

14:42.400 --> 14:45.120
NATHALIE: Optigami,
merge with the Miraculous!

14:52.160 --> 14:55.400
Today, I promise you
a great victory, Ladybug.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.440
But what you don't know is that,
thanks to Optigami,

14:58.440 --> 15:00.840
your victory will also be mine!

15:04.520 --> 15:06.240
- Huh?
- Everything's fine.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
Ladybug sent me
to get you to shelter,

15:08.920 --> 15:11.200
before I help her fight
Style Queen! Kaalki?

15:11.480 --> 15:12.680
Voyage!

15:14.480 --> 15:16.120
- You first!
- Argh!

15:17.120 --> 15:19.400
Wow, Marinette,
that was very well played!

15:19.400 --> 15:21.520
Thanks. Tikki, spots on!

15:22.520 --> 15:25.600
I'll come back for you as soon
as we've defeated the villain.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.360
It won't be easy
to get back into that tower.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.440
- Then let's go home!
- Not just yet.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.840
Plagg, claws out!

15:35.160 --> 15:37.520
- Good job, girls!
- That was some mission!

15:37.520 --> 15:40.320
- Right, Kaalki?
- We did act with some mastery.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.080
Just so I know, how many times
did you use your power?

15:43.240 --> 15:46.120
Uh... a certain amount of times.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.680
I can't imagine the catastrophes
that may have caused.

15:54.240 --> 15:58.520
There's no time to lose.
Tikki, Pollen, unify!

16:06.080 --> 16:07.880
Amazing job, Rena.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.840
- Carapace?
- There's never too many of us.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.480
Hmm. You're right.
Carapace will be useful to us.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.040
Lucky charm!

16:29.440 --> 16:31.640
Weird! I think
I can beat Style Queen

16:31.640 --> 16:33.360
without my lucky charm.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.240
The important thing
is to beat her, no matter how!

16:36.240 --> 16:37.640
Call back your illusion!

16:39.880 --> 16:42.760
So, you want to play
hide-and-seek, Ladybug?

16:42.760 --> 16:43.560
Reality!

16:45.800 --> 16:46.760
Argh!

16:47.280 --> 16:49.160
Carapace!
I need you to protect me.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.880
- Got it!
- I'll follow your lead.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.640
(Evil laugh) Don't worry,

16:53.640 --> 16:56.400
I won't say anything
to Style Queen, Ladybug.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.040
I'll protect you. Because
nothing should prevent you

16:59.040 --> 17:00.800
from winning today.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.040
Shelter!

17:09.800 --> 17:11.040
What?

17:14.880 --> 17:15.880
Shell off!

17:18.880 --> 17:20.080
Buzz off.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.360
No more evil-doing
for you, little akuma.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.000
Time to de-evilise!

17:38.480 --> 17:39.400
Gotcha!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.480
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

17:45.840 --> 17:47.200
Ladybug?

17:48.080 --> 17:49.480
Cataclysm!

17:56.280 --> 17:58.720
Ridiculous! utterly ridiculous!

18:01.160 --> 18:04.560
Ladybug? Rena Rouge? Carapace?
How did you get in?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.640
- Hello, Cat Noir.
- Sorry, Cat Noir.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.160
I'd have come to get you
if I knew your identity.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.320
Like I always say, Milady,
to know me is to love me.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.640
On second thought...

18:13.640 --> 18:16.760
(Chuckles) Rena Rouge, Carapace.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.400
Stay here! I'll be back!

18:22.600 --> 18:24.280
It was so easy
to beat the villain!

18:24.280 --> 18:26.640
It's because
she had good partners!

18:26.800 --> 18:27.600
ALL: Pound it!

18:28.040 --> 18:29.320
- Shell off.
- Let's rest.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.200
I don't get it. It was so easy,
I didn't use my lucky charm.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.200
Normally, it's been the key
element to defeat the villain!

18:40.360 --> 18:43.320
Our trap has just snapped shut,
Ladybug.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.040
I guess it was only here
to help repair everything.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.800
Uh... Hmm!

18:49.880 --> 18:52.920
- Pew-pew. Pew-pew!
- (Laughter)

18:54.600 --> 18:56.840
We're gonna have to be
a lot more careful now.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.160
Shadow Moth knows the identities
of some of the people

18:59.160 --> 19:00.600
I've given a Miraculous

19:00.600 --> 19:03.360
and has decided
to use this information.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.320
Isn't that right, Shadow Moth?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.680
I'm sorry.
You'd better move away from him.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.040
This isn't Nino.
It's a Sentimonster.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.400
- Huh?
- That's impossible!

19:13.400 --> 19:14.720
How did she figure it out?

19:24.880 --> 19:26.280
Cataclysm this for me!

19:26.280 --> 19:28.880
- But it's a Miraculous!
- Trust me.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.800
(Groans)

19:35.120 --> 19:38.640
One day I'll get you, Ladybug!

19:38.960 --> 19:41.360
I release you
from your existence!

19:46.080 --> 19:48.120
Miraculous Ladybug!

20:04.600 --> 20:06.720
How did you figure out
there was a Sentimonster

20:06.720 --> 20:09.680
- in that Miraculous, Milady?
- Thanks to my lucky charm.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.680
It always shows me
the right way.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.320
Except, this time,
I'd gotten the villain wrong!

20:16.120 --> 20:18.360
Shadow Moth almost
unmasked you because of me.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.640
I should never
have taken that Miraculous.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.760
It's true,
you did make a mistake.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.280
That's why I'll have to make
a difficult decision.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.440
It's important
to learn from our mistakes.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.600
And I learned that I need
an ally who can replace me

20:31.600 --> 20:33.960
in case something
happens to me one day.

20:34.480 --> 20:35.760
From now on, you'll keep

20:35.760 --> 20:37.320
the Miraculous of the Fox
with you.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.240
And I'm going to tell you
everything I know.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.880
See? I'm always right,
even when I'm wrong!

20:55.760 --> 20:58.000
We don't know our enemies
well enough.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.520
Alya Césaire
seems to have a special status

21:00.520 --> 21:03.480
in the organisation Ladybug
has set up as a Guardian.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.920
It's time for us
to take an interest in her.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.440
Hmm.
