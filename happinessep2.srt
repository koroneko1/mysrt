1
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,844
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,764
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,183
What is it? What happened?

4
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,060
-Did someone die?
-Dead bodies?

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,772
-What is it?
-Is it a murder case?

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,191
Why won't they tell us?

7
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:25,335
…or command locusts to devour the land
or send a plague among my people.

8
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,712
If my people, who are called by my name,

9
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,966
will humble themselves
and pray and seek my face

10
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,219
and turn from their wicked ways,

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,429
then I will hear from heaven,

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,934
and I will forgive their sin
and will heal their land.

13
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,062
Now my eyes will be open

14
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:47,106
and my ears will be attentive
to the prayers offered in this place.

15
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,903
I have chosen and consecrated this temple…

16
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,170
One of the homeless people had pneumonia,

17
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,588
so they gave him medicine.

18
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,925
It was donated, so they didn't know
about the side effects.

19
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,451
Reports of a disease
that causes the infected

20
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,746
to bite people and suck their blood
are coming from all over the world.

21
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,001
The public health authorities made clear
that it hasn't been confirmed yet,

22
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,004
but similar cases are also occurring
in Korea.

23
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,799
In a shelter for the homeless in Seyang,
around ten homeless individuals

24
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,468
who were staying there were killed.

25
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,514
The authorities stated
that there was a random fight

26
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,809
among the homeless at the shelter,
which caused casualties,

27
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,686
so there may be possible sanitary…

28
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,646
SUSPECTED TO BE AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE

29
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,273
You're eating plants again?

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,985
Sae-bom, are you okay?

31
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,488
Yes, I got tested and got myself together.

32
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,619
Just what in the world is going on?

33
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,205
We stopped all the drills.

34
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,500
They shut down the training area
where Lee Jong-tae caused a scene.

35
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,632
He's that man from before, right?

36
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,426
Yes, he is.

37
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928
He really does have some power.

38
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,600
What if something really bad happens?

39
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,562
If people suddenly start
to go mad like that…

40
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,565
There is a cure for this, right?

41
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,984
I don't know.

42
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,987
It looks like they're
trying their best, but…

43
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,077
I got a call from a journalist.

44
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,498
He said he'll pay me
if I tell him what happened here.

45
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,582
Me too.

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,169
Looks like he contacted
everyone on our team.

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,339
Hey, don't contact people like him.

48
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,883
We even signed a confidentiality oath.

49
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,010
Right.

50
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,682
-Are you returning to work now?
-No.

51
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,434
I received paid leave for six months.

52
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,353
I stopped by to say hi today

53
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,230
after sending my stuff to my new house.

54
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,190
Are you leaving the public official dorm?

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,109
You worked so hard to decorate it.

56
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,402
It's okay.

57
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,488
I got a house.

58
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,616
An apartment.

59
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,245
-With a loan?
-No.

60
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,497
Remember when we talked about
additional points?

61
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,915
The special provision.

62
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,459
I do. Work evaluation, arrest records…

63
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,338
I got the highest points,
but I still lacked points for that.

64
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,134
So I decided to get points
for newlyweds too.

65
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:09,142
You mean… You're going to get married
because you need more points?

66
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,226
Yes.

67
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,979
Who are you going to marry?

68
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,815
There's this guy who asked me out
when we were young.

69
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,400
I rejected him at the time.

70
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,195
But I asked him
if he still has feelings for me.

71
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,449
It's not because
I don't take you seriously.

72
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,242
I…

73
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,913
I always dreamed
of living in my own house.

74
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,333
That's why.

75
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,798
These are for the clothes we burned.

76
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,676
Thank you.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,762
I feel like I've gotten closer to you.

78
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,143
She's cold.

79
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,150
-Do you need more points?
-That's true, but…

80
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,200
I asked you
because I have feelings for you.

81
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,036
You're not so bad on the eyes,
and you are resourceful.

82
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,164
Hey, I'm a lot better than you think.

83
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,375
Being two years behind? That's nothing.
Plus, it's a newly built apartment.

84
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,169
If you miss this,
you'll regret it forever.

85
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:26,302
Hey! You can't find
another friend like me.

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,223
Okay, sure.

87
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,774
I'm asking you…

88
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,026
to marry me.

89
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,028
I know what you mean.

90
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,780
I'm saying yes.

91
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,074
He said yes.

92
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,330
He said yes.

93
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
Oh… Congratulations.

94
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,670
Oh, well…

95
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,006
-When are you moving in?
-Today.

96
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,726
This is the scratch Lee Jong-tae made,
and it's not healing that well.

97
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,437
It didn't get worse, though?

98
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,357
No. They want to draw
my blood every two weeks.

99
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
I see.

100
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,284
Are you okay?

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,162
What?

102
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,914
Yes, I'm okay.

103
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,756
(I AM) THE LIFESAVER

104
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,176
Aren't you taking that?

105
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,344
I will.

106
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,346
Hang on.

107
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,273
I'm going to go home now.

108
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,276
I'll organize your stuff when they arrive.
You take your time.

109
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,819
-Okay.
-Okay.

110
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,990
You're putting in so much effort.

111
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,421
DEDICATED TO THE SECURITY OF THE HOMELAND

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,522
Corporal, have you thought about it?

113
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
How much can you pay me?

114
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,110
I talked to the director,

115
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,779
and if there is internal footage

116
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,280
and if we get an exclusive,

117
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,158
I think we can do our best
to give you the amount you ask for.

118
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,705
Why don't you get in?
Let's talk comfortably.

119
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,029
Hang in there, okay?

120
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,365
It's okay.

121
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,716
Seung-young, what are you doing?

122
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,894
Here.

123
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,606
Thank you.

124
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,151
How can you remember
a picture from 12 years ago?

125
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,944
I almost got killed back then.

126
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,696
Anyway, congratulations. You did it.

127
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,948
Though I didn't expect it
to work out like this.

128
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,749
Move!

129
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,251
-Why? What is it?
-My gift for you.

130
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,169
Come on.

131
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,254
My wife started working a side job.

132
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,175
Don't worry. She's all better now,
completely healthy.

133
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,509
We also do delivery.

134
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,137
Hand them around the apartment
and spread the word about our shop.

135
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,598
You should be helping your wife,
not making things hard for her.

136
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,727
About the info
on Han Tae-seok like you asked…

137
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,896
I will do my best. What is it?

138
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,398
He specializes in infectious diseases.

139
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,734
Some of the military academy
students are sent

140
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,028
to a medical school
as commissioned education.

141
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,698
He became a doctor through that, served
as a medic, and finished his service.

142
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,242
After that, he worked
at a pharmaceutical company.

143
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,537
He was the Team Leader
of Competitiveness Reinforcement.

144
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,997
And…

145
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,797
This was taken during his trial
for assaulting the CEO

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,465
of the pharmaceutical company.

147
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,385
He didn't look like the type to do that.

148
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,930
Those who look well-mannered
are scarier when they lose it.

149
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,891
Anyway, he was suddenly found innocent,

150
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,476
and he went back to the military.

151
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,645
As a dispatch to the CDSCHQ.

152
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,814
That's weird.

153
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,609
Anyway, try not to get involved in this.

154
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,237
You'll just get yourself in trouble
by meddling in it.

155
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,321
Okay.

156
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,614
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

157
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,075
And if you need more rice cakes,
tell me, okay?

158
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,701
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

159
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,090
I don't want to get involved either,

160
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,551
but I think that'll be hard.

161
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,653
SEYANG FOREST LE CIEL
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

162
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,086
That trainee I gave first aid to.

163
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,007
-He kept coming to mind.
-What about him?

164
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,888
He's in bad condition,
just like Lee Jong-tae.

165
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,308
Even his family can't visit him.

166
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,020
I asked the guys who were
dispatched to the CDSCHQ,

167
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,984
and they said once you go in there,
you can't come out alive.

168
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,529
But I came out alive.

169
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,031
Right.

170
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,576
Only you did.

171
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,128
Is this really okay?

172
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,923
What if everyone is dying in there?

173
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,430
It's so difficult to be happy.

174
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,738
You scared me!

175
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,699
Sorry. You need to be careful.

176
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,451
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

177
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,874
That scared me.

178
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,994
I'm going to the fifth floor. Thank you.

179
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,211
Please wear a mask indoors.

180
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,215
Okay, I'm sorry.

181
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,016
That hoodie…

182
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,185
Where did you buy that?

183
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,146
It looks genuine, not custom-made.

184
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,024
I'm in the SOU.

185
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,819
The real SOU?

186
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,280
You're a tactical agent
who fights terrorist attacks?

187
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,489
Yes.

188
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,076
Can you please get me an SOU T-shirt?

189
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,830
The one that has SOU
printed in the front and back.

190
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,956
Large-sized.

191
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,880
I'll look into it. Large, you said?

192
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:27,051
Yes, please do. I'm on the 15th floor.

193
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
He's eccentric.

194
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,830
You're early.

195
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,874
We should celebrate with delivery food.

196
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,294
I knew you'd say that, so I searched
for good restaurants already.

197
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,921
Hey, you had this picture?

198
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,007
Jung-kook had the file.

199
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,218
So I had it developed.

200
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,136
Don't you like it?

201
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,513
Well…

202
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,350
But this situation
wasn't that joyful for you at the time.

203
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,476
Do you like it?

204
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey! Stand straight.

205
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,067
Okay, here we go! One, two, three!

206
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,279
When life is hard, look at this,
and do your best in life.

207
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,786
There.

208
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,500
Well, you said the district office
can come and check

209
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,168
if we really are married.

210
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,755
This would show why we got married.

211
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
It's a very powerful motive.

212
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,719
Right. It looks like
there's a deep story behind us.

213
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,811
It's nice I'm cuffed.

214
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,731
When would I ever experience
getting cuffed again?

215
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,317
Are you passing around rice cakes?

216
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,821
It's Jung-kook's side job.
He wants me to advertise them.

217
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,780
Okay.

218
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,825
-I'll be back soon--
-No, I'll do it.

219
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,744
You get the house organized

220
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,288
and order black bean noodles.
I want a double portion.

221
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,706
Okay.

222
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,375
-Hey, be careful.
-Okay.

223
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,981
Who is it?

224
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,984
I moved in next door.
Aren't the grown-ups home?

225
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,039
Hi.

226
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,919
Thank you, I will enjoy it.

227
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,714
Bye.

228
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,108
What?

229
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,830
It won't open.

230
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,792
The lower floors are public rentals,

231
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,710
and the upper ones are regular apartments.

232
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,505
They blocked it to stop people downstairs
from coming up.

233
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,132
You know all kinds of things.

234
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,426
I know everything.
Kids call us beggars at school.

235
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,808
-How do they come down from upstairs?
-By taking the elevator.

236
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,234
-Are you going downstairs?
-Yes.

237
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,778
One apartment is empty,

238
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,905
and a lady lives alone
in the other apartment,

239
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,615
but she didn't come home yesterday.

240
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,868
You really know everything.

241
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,887
That's better.

242
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,601
Jeez.

243
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,270
Is it okay to do this?

244
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,815
Yes. Blocking an emergency exit
is a violation of the Fire Prevention Act.

245
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,942
If they complain, we can report them.

246
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,194
I see.

247
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,779
Okay then, see you later.

248
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,632
The insurance companies
always say it's 50-50.

249
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,551
Keeping a safe distance,
obligation to look forward. Right?

250
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,429
Don't mind what those parrots
are squawking about.

251
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,640
I saw the footage. And 90-10 is possible.

252
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,393
I'm from Unit 501.
I moved in today, so I brought rice cakes.

253
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,354
Please excuse me.

254
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,489
We're neighbors, so
I'll provide legal counseling for free.

255
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,699
So come anytime and consult me.

256
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,410
Yes, that's what you should do.

257
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,288
SPECIALIZES IN DIVORCE AND CAR ACCIDENTS

258
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,669
"Lawyer Kook Hae-seong,
who appears like a comet in hard times."

259
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,796
Those are separate. Yes.

260
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,713
1:1 COUNSELING CHAT
WITH LAWYER KOOK HAE-SEONG

261
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,715
Yes, you can check and call me again.

262
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,052
That's a separate matter.

263
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:02,970
IT'S A HIT-AND-RUN
IT'S NOT ME, MY FRIEND DID IT

264
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,221
Yes.

265
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,889
Of course. Call me anytime.

266
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,183
Okay, thank you.

267
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
ARE YOU GOING TO TURN YOURSELF IN?

268
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,104
-Who was it?
-Downstairs.

269
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,940
She just moved in.

270
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,027
But you're throwing away food?

271
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,906
You've worked as a lawyer's secretary.

272
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,033
How can you be so gullible?

273
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,369
You shouldn't eat food
a stranger gives you.

274
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,833
So the woman downstairs
gave us poisoned rice cake to kill us?

275
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,087
Honey, you have a psychological problem.

276
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,298
So-yoon, I was once a public defender.

277
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,635
I learned about
people's evil intentions quite early.

278
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,137
Fine.

279
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,056
Then as a public defender,
please go consult them.

280
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,267
That one really needs
an attorney right now.

281
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,728
Good grief.

282
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,943
Of course you'll get caught, you fool.

283
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm sure the cops are
on their way to your house now.

284
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,575
WILL I GET CAUGHT IF
I DON'T TURN MYSELF IN?

285
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,413
FIRST, I MUST FIND OUT
IF THE ACCIDENT WAS REPORTED

286
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,582
CAN I GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRIEND?

287
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,370
Who are you?

288
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,707
Hi.

289
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,002
I moved in downstairs.
Here's rice cake for you.

290
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,964
I don't like food made from flour.

291
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,843
But this is "rice" cake.

292
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,938
Nice to meet you too.

293
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,067
Honey.

294
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,737
Honey.

295
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,531
Hey.

296
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,533
Hey. You're home.

297
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,452
Why didn't you answer the door?

298
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,579
I was washing my hair.

299
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,666
Why did you suddenly
press the doorbell, though?

300
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,086
I didn't press it.
Someone came from downstairs.

301
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,592
The apartment is tiny,
and the security is awful.

302
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,262
Hey, Min-ji, wash your hands first.

303
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,014
You should wash your hands
when you come home. 20 seconds.

304
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,481
Are you taking your meds? Hang on.

305
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,198
Here's some water.

306
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,743
I got five complaints today.

307
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,915
Why do they ask for so much
over a few shots of fillers?

308
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,503
This is why I didn't want to do
a franchise dermatology clinic.

309
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,713
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,507
You're doing bothersome work
because of me.

311
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,096
I will make you an awesome glass
of nice, cold tangerine highball.

312
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,516
What is this?
Your legs are as hard as rocks.

313
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,477
I must relieve them all today.

314
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,065
Shall I make you
a tangerine highball first?

315
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,025
Madam.

316
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,278
You're being a good boy today.

317
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,437
COLLECT THE COUPONS

318
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,565
Let's eat 20 dishes
and get a small sweet and sour pork.

319
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,566
Okay.

320
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,239
And this.

321
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,950
What is this?

322
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,369
A contract for joint ownership
when it's switched

323
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,204
to a regular apartment in ten years.

324
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,625
Six to four is okay, right?
Because my points are higher.

325
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,211
Of course. You even saved my life.

326
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,796
-Right?
-Yes.

327
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,508
I wanted to have herringbone flooring,

328
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,511
but it's new flooring,
so I can't rip it out.

329
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,472
Still, this is neat.

330
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,436
I can't believe this.

331
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,064
I have a house now.

332
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:16,074
White or beige curtains
would be nice and natural, right?

333
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,492
Yes.

334
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,494
Should we install blinds for the veranda?

335
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,414
The lighting seems just fine.

336
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,250
Still, I might buy
a few lighting fixtures.

337
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,338
We'll need
some gym equipment for this room.

338
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,840
Nice.

339
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,135
I prefer stainless steel countertops.

340
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,805
But all this is brand new.

341
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,683
Let's use it for now and replace it later.

342
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,437
Should we replace only
the sink and bathroom faucets?

343
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,354
Sure.

344
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,732
I'll need to make a lot of money.

345
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,860
But it's nice.
It's worth earning money for.

346
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,820
I'll work hard too.

347
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,489
Let's do this.

348
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:13,423
The District Office can come
for an inspection, so…

349
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,552
-Shall we change it? Or move it?
-No, you did a great job.

350
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,472
We must be meticulous until the very end.

351
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,975
Right.

352
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,732
When I was young, we had a house.

353
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,405
But something went wrong
and we kept moving to smaller houses,

354
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,699
and in the end,
we lived in a semi-basement.

355
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,036
It only had one room.

356
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,997
-Back in high school?
-Yes.

357
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,250
I could wander around outside
during the day,

358
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,668
but I had to sleep at night,

359
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,963
so I went home as late as possible.

360
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,719
We crammed ourselves
into that small room to sleep.

361
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,145
My mom and dad
were always yelling and fighting…

362
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,608
If I just couldn't stand it anymore,

363
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,820
I got my dad's car key and came outside.

364
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,697
I can't take this!

365
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,283
You get paid peanuts, and…

366
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,682
I always wanted to have my own space.

367
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,103
My own space, just for me.

368
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,111
And I finally made it,

369
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,117
so the Earth
shouldn't meet its end just yet.

370
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,746
Good night.

371
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,452
You will end up like me too.

372
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,884
What is it?

373
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,016
What are they doing
in the middle of the night?

374
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,645
Do you want me to go talk to them?

375
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,815
No…

376
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,734
I was just startled, that's all.

377
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,769
Hello?

378
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,319
You mean now?

379
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,506
-Who was it?
-What?

380
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,969
It's a guy I know.
It's because of the investigation.

381
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,971
Get some more sleep. You're on leave.

382
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,855
Why are you collecting her blood?
She's already worn out.

383
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,065
We won't take that much.

384
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,859
You got married thanks to me,
so don't be so mean.

385
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,905
Thanks to you? This was all me.

386
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,157
If I didn't help her
with additional points,

387
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,534
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom
wouldn't have asked you to marry her.

388
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,335
By the way, you come into
someone else's apartment so easily.

389
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,046
Did you see the news about
the homeless shelter?

390
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,005
I did.

391
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,591
The article about Next
being given to the homeless there

392
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,884
will be released today.

393
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,261
Due to concerns about
possible side effects,

394
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,555
the drugs in the market
will be all collected,

395
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,933
and those who sold them illegally
will be punished.

396
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,768
That's the government's conclusion.

397
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,020
But why are you telling me that?

398
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,692
Because we're going to
investigate together.

399
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,362
I sent the document
asking for cooperation to your station.

400
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,531
Well, I'm a bit busy.

401
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,494
As you can see, I…

402
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,413
CHIEF

403
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,422
Yes, Chief.

404
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
Okay.

405
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,554
Do I have to do this?

406
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,268
Of course, I should do it. Who else would?

407
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:53,990
So…

408
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,160
What should I start with?

409
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,122
This is Lee Jong-tae's phone.
It's been unlocked.

410
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,542
Meet the dealer as Lee Jong-tae
and make the arrest.

411
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,211
Is he cooperating
with the investigation too?

412
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,548
Something like that.

413
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,185
But do you know

414
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,813
what the most difficult part
of narcotics investigation is?

415
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,192
These jerks are always
full of suspicion and greed.

416
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,861
We can't even meet them
if we don't pay half in advance.

417
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,571
But the police don't have money.

418
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,116
I'm not saying that I don't want to help,
it's just the investigation can't…

419
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,077
Use it for the investigation.

420
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,081
Make expense reports,
and return the remaining amount.

421
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,335
I heard you worked
at a pharmaceutical company.

422
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,462
That you were in some
competitiveness team.

423
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,464
Competitiveness Reinforcement Team.

424
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,466
It's where we steal
other companies' drugs.

425
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,678
I may not be good at making things,
but I am good at stealing.

426
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,889
And beating people up?

427
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,476
Call me when you arrest the dealer.

428
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,269
I will participate as an observer.

429
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,774
By the way, how much is the amount?

430
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,652
You're not going to say that
the amount is wrong later, right?

431
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,696
Corporal Jung Yi-hyun.

432
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,867
I heard your nickname is
"Great Detective."

433
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,079
Because you always logically infer cases.

434
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,126
They call it "reckless"
or "hoping for good luck."

435
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,921
They say the way I think is weird,
but I somehow get things right.

436
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,967
There's a bias that athletes are dumb.

437
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,721
You must show that you both have
a good brain and good physique.

438
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,981
I seriously hate him.

439
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,451
MS. KIM BOK-NAM

440
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,877
Hey, Mom, what is it?

441
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,504
I heard you moved into
an apartment yesterday.

442
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,339
And you didn't even call me.

443
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,677
Come on. Do I have to hear
about you from Yi-hyun?

444
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,429
Mom, I'm tired.

445
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,974
I got tested for an infectious disease.

446
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,602
I got tested for COVID-19
more than five times.

447
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,438
No, not that. It was for
that infectious disease

448
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,482
-that makes people bite other people.
-You mean Mad Human Disease?

449
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,193
It has a name?

450
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,237
Yes, they say it's similar to rabies
and makes people go mad.

451
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,323
I heard humans can catch rabies too.

452
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,158
My goodness.

453
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,411
So dog owners are in a frenzy right now.

454
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,538
Yes, anyway, it was for that.

455
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,707
I got tested for Mad Human Disease

456
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,126
and I'm now in self-quarantine
at my apartment.

457
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,296
I even had a dream
about biting people last night.

458
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,547
Really?

459
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,842
What about Yi-hyun?
Is he okay with living with you?

460
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,555
Of course. We really do love each other.

461
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,727
I'll recover soon and call you
when our wedding date is set.

462
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm starting to cough now. I should go.

463
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,389
I need to go buy groceries.

464
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,989
GYM REGISTRATION PROCESS: RESIDENTS

465
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,199
WEEKDAYS: 6:00 TO 22:00
WEEKENDS: 6:00 TO 21:00

466
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,266
-Hi.
-Hi.

467
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,976
What is that? A battle request?

468
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,110
I guess you don't know it.

469
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,656
I ENJOYED THE RICE CAKE, THANK YOU

470
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,200
You're such a good girl. Thank you.

471
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,953
You know they offer deliveries, right?

472
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,456
-Yes, Myungwon Rice Cake Shop.
-Yes.

473
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,126
If you want rice cakes later,
ask your family to buy them from there.

474
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,089
By the way,
are you really a police officer?

475
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,841
Of course I am.

476
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,344
Look.

477
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,723
It's even better than a police officer.

478
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:14,018
When I get healthy,
I want to be just like you.

479
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,480
-Are you sick right now?
-A little bit.

480
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:23,944
When I was little, I was also really sick.
So I couldn't go to school for two years.

481
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,613
-Really?
-Yes.

482
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,990
But I'm totally fine and strong now.

483
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,992
You will be even stronger than me,

484
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,496
so you don't need to worry about anything.

485
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,623
Thank you for this.

486
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,668
Where are you going?

487
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,253
To have a battle.

488
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
How can I help you?

489
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,820
I live downstairs, and it's been
so noisy since last night.

490
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,780
Are you doing construction work in there?

491
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm sorry. I'm moving my furniture, so…

492
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,540
In the middle of the night?

493
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,792
I'm a person with initiative,

494
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,836
so I have to do things when I decide to.

495
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,003
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,464
That's not initiative, it's an illness.

497
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,592
It will never happen again.

498
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,470
All right, then.

499
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,014
We enjoyed the rice cake.

500
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,600
How did you know it was me?

501
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,019
-We never met before.
-I heard about you.

502
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,397
Your daughter looks just like you,
she's lovely.

503
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,940
You look lovely.

504
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,241
Haven't you seen that man before?

505
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,410
I got on the elevator
a few times with him,

506
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,829
but it seems like
he's not interested in others.

507
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,750
Both him and his wife are doctors,
but he doesn't work and just stays home.

508
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,796
My mom said
they have a legal problem or something.

509
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,716
Perhaps it's because
he just likes to be lazy.

510
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,593
-Okay, then. Bye.
-What about you?

511
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,720
Me? I'm going to work out.

512
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,310
Goodbye.

513
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,442
Are you home alone?

514
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,528
My dad does parcel delivery work,

515
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,989
and my mom helps with
sorting in the morning.

516
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,782
What about school?

517
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,743
I'm doing experience learning at home.

518
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,080
These days, if we tell the school,
we can get 19 days of school off a year.

519
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,918
Come with me.

520
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,172
Let's do experience learning
of sports with me today.

521
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,303
Oh, this is the place.

522
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,438
Hi.

523
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,774
This is nice.

524
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,738
-Hi.
-Hi.

525
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,616
I'm a resident here.
I heard I can come here anytime.

526
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,576
Please wait.

527
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,872
You can bring
your own sneakers and towels.

528
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,917
But first, please write down
your building number and unit number.

529
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,796
Hi.

530
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,506
Hi.

531
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,384
-Are you going to work out too?
-Yes.

532
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,178
-Here.
-Thank you.

533
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,598
YOON SAE-BOM - BUILDING 101, UNIT 501

534
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:46,313
The public rental residents
are not allowed to enter.

535
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,526
Why not? Is it because
of the maintenance fee?

536
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,820
Well, the maintenance fee is one thing,

537
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,780
but it's more because of the equipment.

538
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,532
The regular residents paid for them,

539
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,992
so some say that it's not fair

540
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,828
if we let the public rental residents
use them freely.

541
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,998
Okay, I'll work out at home.

542
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,959
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

543
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:12,131
But if you get personal training from me,
I can help you with that.

544
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,091
I'll work out at home.

545
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,889
-Did you know?
-Yes.

546
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,225
Then why didn't you tell me?

547
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,519
I thought you'd be able to solve it.

548
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,980
Is there anything else like
the Fire Prevention Act?

549
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,899
When money is involved,
it's hard to solve it.

550
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,236
But still, there is a way.

551
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,530
-One.
-One.

552
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,365
-Two.
-Two.

553
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,409
-Three.
-Three.

554
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,910
Slowly.

555
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,330
-Four.
-Four.

556
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,706
You're good.

557
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,666
-Five.
-Five.

558
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,251
Let's go do that one over there.

559
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
What do you learn in PE class these days?

560
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,306
-Running.
-Oh, are you a good runner?

561
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,223
No.

562
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,351
I'm totally good at running.

563
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,627
WIFE

564
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,926
MISSED CALL: WIFE

565
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,002
Since you worked out, get some good rest.

566
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,588
Goodbye.

567
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,469
She's cute.

568
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,808
Hey.

569
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,145
Sae-bom, help me.

570
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,941
I got scratched by that trainee.

571
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:40,195
I was too scared to say it, but…

572
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,489
the wound isn't healing.

573
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,283
Where are you?

574
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,118
I'll be right there.

575
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,336
It'll be okay.

576
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,547
Look at me. I'm okay.

577
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,549
You just need to get tested

578
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,469
and get some rest today.
You'll be fine after.

579
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,931
I'll tell your wife that
you're not cheating on her.

580
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,854
I'm scared to think that I'm going to die.

581
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,397
You won't die!

582
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,191
You didn't get bitten.

583
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,609
Look at me.

584
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,278
It really is nothing.

585
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,949
You just need to get tested
and confirm things today.

586
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,994
I'll ask them to give you
additional points.

587
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,672
You're not thirsty, are you?

588
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,889
STOP

589
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,813
There's one more patient.

590
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,835
Let me see the wound.

591
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,771
Are you sure it was a scratch?

592
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,067
It looks like it was cut with a blade,
done quite recently.

593
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,904
I wish that were the case.

594
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,866
My wound isn't healing properly, either.

595
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,664
It doesn't seem that serious
from how it looks.

596
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,292
Let's test it.

597
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,591
-What is different when it's serious?
-The color.

598
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,885
The color turns dark red,
starting from the wound.

599
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,269
Stay here until the test is over.

600
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,441
Aren't you going to uncuff me?

601
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,835
This is enough space
for you to move, right?

602
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,130
Tell me if you're thirsty.

603
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,008
Ms. Yoon, come out for a moment.

604
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,848
See? I told you.

605
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,642
It's okay.

606
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,311
I'll go have my blood drawn. Wait here.

607
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,455
It's okay.

608
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,500
Nothing will happen.

609
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,628
I'm just going to make money and go.

610
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,422
It's okay.

611
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,827
When something like this happens again,
tell us beforehand.

612
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:59,329
I don't want to get startled.

613
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,334
I got it. So can you please open the bag?

614
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,220
MYUNGWON RICE CAKE SHOP

615
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,395
They say you should spoil
the people you dislike.

616
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,913
About the trainee…

617
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,708
The one who got bitten by Lee Jong-tae.

618
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,919
I heard he's in bad condition.

619
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,881
Even his family's request to visit
got rejected.

620
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,684
When they're bitten,
they get infected, no matter what.

621
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:08,231
The condition worsens,
so less time is spent being normal.

622
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,194
We never know when he'll feel thirsty
and attack someone,

623
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,446
so it's impossible for him
to meet any visitors.

624
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,616
What about the cure?

625
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,245
There's none at this point.

626
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,458
Once it gets worse,
they feel thirsty all the time.

627
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,877
They lose their minds
and attack anyone they see.

628
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,005
What we can do now

629
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,466
is to slow down the speed
of reaching that condition.

630
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,431
So it's true that no one
got out of here alive.

631
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,772
You're an extremely lucky case.

632
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,069
If nothing goes wrong, I'm sure
Mr. Lee Seung-young will be the same.

633
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,415
Are you bored? Want something to eat?

634
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,059
Where are you right now?

635
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,189
I have a family.

636
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,027
If I die for nothing, they'll keep
the reason for my death secret.

637
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,529
Sae-bom.

638
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,866
There's a way to make money,
and safety is guaranteed.

639
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,159
Hello? Seung-young!

640
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,636
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

641
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,430
Is this really okay?

642
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,515
What if everyone is dying in there?

643
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,350
I got a call from a journalist.

644
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,937
He said he'll pay me
if I tell him what happened here.

645
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:33,335
He put on a biohazard suit and escaped.
They thought he was bringing out chairs.

646
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,545
Where are the seriously ill patients?

647
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,590
Where are they?

648
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,553
We put them in a freezer storage
for food in the basement,

649
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,473
but they increased in number,
so we had to move them elsewhere.

650
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,391
So, where is this "elsewhere?"

651
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,645
A freezer truck.

652
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,940
Damn it.

653
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,331
DAMN JOURNALIST

654
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,042
DID YOU THINK ABOUT OUR OFFER?

655
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,005
DAMN JOURNALIST

656
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,428
You should pay me first.

657
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,849
If you do,
I'll send you the footage right away.

658
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:21,438
This call is being recorded,
so don't think about tricking me later.

659
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,984
Pay me half of it first, at least!

660
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,451
Send the money and call me.

661
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:35,827
This…

662
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,663
is a huge story.

663
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,789
SEYANG DREAM CAR WASH

664
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,336
They're in there. Why aren't you going?

665
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,671
Someone's supposed to come here.

666
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,381
Who? Did you ask for backup?

667
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,383
There he is.

668
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,428
What?

669
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,182
Hello, Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok.

670
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,975
What brings you to this shabby place?

671
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,812
I'd like to meet the dealer
with Corporal Jung only. Is that okay?

672
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,442
Sure, that's fine.
I can just wait here, then.

673
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,909
-Hey! You…
-I know.

674
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,369
Stay here.

675
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,039
I hate him, seriously…

676
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,541
By the way, why are you really here?

677
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,711
The remaining Next was kept
in the company's storage.

678
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,880
I want to find out
who spread it in the market.

679
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,717
It seems like this infectious disease
is making a mess overseas too.

680
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,761
Has Next been sold worldwide?

681
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,683
I told you I'm not good at making things,
but I'm good at stealing things, right?

682
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,228
It's a foreign drug.
I stole it while I was

683
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,230
in the Competitiveness Reinforcement Team.

684
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,693
You are an incredible man.

685
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,543
Total of three.

686
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,795
Damn it, turn the light off!

687
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,594
You brought the money, right?

688
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,597
Where is Lee Jong-tae?

689
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,062
That jerk Lee Jong-tae…

690
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,731
I bet you can't reach him.

691
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,288
-There are two of them.
-There are three of them.

692
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,881
The drug.

693
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,009
In the trunk…

694
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,552
Cuff them while I get them.

695
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,692
You assholes! You're all dead now!

696
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,256
What is this?

697
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,551
A Glock. You've never seen one?

698
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,804
I mean, why are you carrying that around?

699
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,106
What do you think you're doing?

700
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,982
Making sure it's dead.

701
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,736
You dare to kill a person
in front of a cop?

702
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,823
Do you think this is a human being?

703
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,589
All of you, hands up!

704
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,299
Hands up…

705
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,927
It's all done.

706
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:05,513
Oh, really? Gosh.

707
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:09,142
Hey! How many shots did you fire?

708
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,353
If this was a residential area,
you'd get disciplined again!

709
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,022
Did you do all this?

710
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,208
Since when has that thing
been in that condition?

711
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,334
I don't know.

712
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,507
I just went to his house
to get paid, and he was like that.

713
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,509
He bit his whole family and killed them.

714
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,637
He was banging his head
on the puddle of blood!

715
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,308
-Did it take Next?
-Tons of it.

716
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,602
He's been like that the whole time.

717
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,687
And you did that to someone ill?

718
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,357
What else would I have done?

719
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,777
He was the best guard dog ever.
I didn't even have to feed him.

720
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,784
All of you took that drug, right?

721
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,703
You'll become like that soon.

722
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,791
-Get up, you jerk.
-Hello?

723
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:18,961
Okay.

724
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:23,424
Mr. Jung, we have a problem at the dorm.

725
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,342
So?

726
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,302
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom is there.

727
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,765
Why did she go there again?

728
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,372
They're not humans.

729
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,583
What do you mean?

730
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,710
None of them are.

731
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,609
Quiet!

732
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,325
Open this.

733
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,286
Now!

734
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,165
No, don't open it!

735
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,283
Be honest.

736
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,912
You're seeing those people as monsters.

737
01:05:58,746 --> 01:05:59,789
They told us to stop.

738
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,792
Mad Human Disease is spreading
in the apartment.

739
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,378
Those drugs cause
Mad Human Disease, right?

740
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,923
Bad rumors don't help with house prices.

741
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,132
We're stopping them all.

742
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,551
So you lock them up
and wait until they die?

743
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,763
I'm sure there's something
about that woman upstairs.

744
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,433
What's going on in that house right now?

745
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:27,733
