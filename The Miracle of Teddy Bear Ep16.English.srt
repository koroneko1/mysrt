1
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,599
What do you want?

2
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,840
You should be careful.

3
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,919
With some matters,

4
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,960
the more you know,
the more danger you are in.

5
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,360
Was hurting the kid not enough?
You sent someone to shoot the cop.

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
I was only going to handle that young man.

7
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,639
But you had him transferred here
and alerted the police.

8
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,199
I had to nip it in the bud.

9
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,199
I know about your argument,

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,560
about him knowing

11
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,159
that you killed Mr. Sibmeun,

12
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,199
That secret should have stayed
between the two of you,

13
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,520
but now it has spread.

14
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
Do you mean Tatarn?

15
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,639
THE END

16
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,120
Is it really the end?

17
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm really going to miss it.

18
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,080
So many things have happened
while writing this screenplay.

19
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
The best thing, though,

20
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,759
was you helping me reconcile with my mom.

21
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,240
Thank you, Tofu.

22
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm so pleased.

23
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,360
I couldn't have done it alone.

24
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,680
That's not true.

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
Even if I wasn't here,

26
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
you two would still have made up,

27
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
because you love your mom.

28
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,439
I also love you.

29
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,639
I love you too.

30
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
Very much.

31
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,360
I was born out of Tatarn's love

32
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,039
and Nut's memories.

33
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,120
But I think

34
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,520
my identity is also
linked to Nut's desire.

35
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,839
The desire he had to resolve things

36
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
with Tatarn

37
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
and his mom.

38
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,360
He just never had the courage.

39
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,240
Aren't you sleeping?

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,439
I can't sleep.

41
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,000
Humans have it rough.

42
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,040
Objects like us never struggle to sleep.

43
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,480
The bear is not the same anymore.

44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,839
He has evolved
from a simpleminded teddy bear

45
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,079
into a fully-fledged human.

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Human lives are never simple.

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,839
It's hard

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,279
and tiring.

49
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm happy, though.

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,879
I got the chance to live as a human

51
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,959
and to love Nut.

52
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,279
When I was a teddy bear,

53
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,040
I could only comfort him
when he hugged me.

54
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,279
As a human,

55
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,839
I helped him reconcile with his mom

56
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,759
and move on from his painful past.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,079
I gave him the courage
to write a screenplay about Tatarn.

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
I think that's more than enough.

59
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,199
If I really have to leave now,

60
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,800
I won't be sorry.

61
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,800
Come on, Kuenchai.

62
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,920
We have to take Mrs. Na
to the hospital later.

63
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,439
Let's go.

64
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,759
Kuenchai.

65
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,079
May I help you?

66
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Are you free?

67
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm donating some belongings.

68
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
Can you give me a hand?

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,800
What do you say?

70
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,639
Are you so afraid of me
that you won't come?

71
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,560
Let me tell Nut first.

72
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,560
I won't let you go.

73
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,199
Are you her servant?

74
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,000
She can do it herself.

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
Calm down, Nut.

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,120
Jan lives alone.
It's probably hard for her.

77
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,800
It would be nice
if Tofu could lend a hand.

78
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,000
We can go alone. Okay?

79
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,439
She asked me for a favor.

80
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,399
Why don't you go with your mom?

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,279
Of course. Why not?

82
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,639
Right?

83
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Nut.

84
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,600
What is it?

85
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,320
Drive safely.

86
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

87
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,399
I'll come straight home after.

88
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,039
You should

89
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,919
wait for me here, okay?

90
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,000
You should get going.

91
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,320
When you come back…

92
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,840
I might not be here anymore.

93
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,799
Goodbye, Nut.

94
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,600
Kuenchai.

95
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,919
You don't want me to go either, do you?

96
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,840
I've made up my mind, though.

97
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,879
All right.

98
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
Before I go,

99
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,320
let's play together one last time.

100
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,279
Let's play your favorite game.

101
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,919
Goodbye, Kuenchai.

102
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,879
I'm here.

103
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,679
CASHIER - PRESCRIPTIONS

104
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you have an appointment?

105
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes.

106
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Where's Tofu?

107
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
He's not here.

108
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,720
He's helping Jan with her stuff at home.

109
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,679
I have to go. Please excuse me.

110
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Thanks for helping me.

111
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,679
I barely did anything.

112
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,720
There wasn't much stuff.

113
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,559
It's better to have a helping hand.

114
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
Drink this to feel refreshed.

115
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,480
TOFU

116
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,840
TOFU - NHONG

117
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,279
NHONG

118
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,960
-Hello.
-Kuenchai is barking nonstop.

119
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,320
Tofu is not here
and he won't pick up his phone.

120
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,120
Well…

121
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,720
I don't know what to do,
so I'm letting you know.

122
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,799
-Excuse me, nurse.
-Nut.

123
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,440
Take care of Mom for me, Gen.
I'll be right back.

124
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,360
Nut!

125
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,519
Aren't you drinking, Tofu?

126
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,559
Do you really want me to drink this?

127
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,399
Yes.

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Why?

129
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't you like soft drinks?

130
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,000
Your first name is Sajjaree.

131
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,039
It means truth.

132
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,600
What are you trying to say?

133
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,519
You're not telling the truth.

134
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,159
You lied about needing a favor.

135
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,679
You knew,

136
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,960
but you came anyway.

137
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,440
I wanted to know
what you plan to do to me.

138
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,120
Are you doing all this

139
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,240
because you love Mr. Saen?

140
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,799
What do you mean?

141
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,720
Everything you've done…

142
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,559
has been for Mr. Saen…

143
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,399
Right?

144
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,759
People will do anything
to protect their loved ones.

145
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,519
You have someone you love.

146
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,720
You should understand

147
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,200
that it hurts even more

148
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,360
to see your loved ones in pain.

149
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,039
For me,

150
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,559
nothing is more important
than their happiness.

151
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,679
If you were me,

152
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
you would have done the same.

153
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,039
I understand.

154
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,279
We all do things for the ones we love.

155
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
But you and I are different.

156
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,000
My love is based on truth

157
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,879
and righteousness.

158
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,279
Nut.

159
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,440
Wish me luck.

160
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,080
I must finish this.

161
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm the only one…

162
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,360
who can do this.

163
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,480
It's sweet,

164
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,799
but it's not healthy.

165
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,839
You knew that, but you drank it anyway.

166
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,920
What an idiot.

167
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
I've been waiting for a miracle,

168
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,319
just like the others are waiting
for one for Tatarn.

169
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,960
Jan finally handed it to me.

170
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,119
Thank you

171
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,200
for making everything easier.

172
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,799
Forgive me.

173
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,640
I didn't want to do this.

174
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,200
It's too painful.

175
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,640
But this is the easiest way.

176
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,319
It's your fault

177
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,799
for being stubborn and asking for trouble.

178
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,319
If you hadn't tried to force Saen's hand,

179
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,799
I wouldn't have been bothered.

180
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,000
I know that Saen
is running out of patience.

181
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,720
That's why I had to step in.

182
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,200
Even if all I can do
is get rid of a puny pawn,

183
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,039
it's still better than doing nothing.

184
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,680
I understand.

185
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,000
I knew this day would eventually come.

186
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,039
I shouldn't be alive.

187
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,200
It's not fair on Tatarn.

188
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,480
Me, Mrs. Na,

189
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,559
you, and Mr. Saen,

190
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,839
Our lives have jeopardized Tatarn's.

191
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,839
I can't continue living like this.

192
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
Nut once told me,

193
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
Some use belief as a tool hiding the truth

194
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,119
to serve their purpose.

195
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,640
I don't want to be that kind of person.

196
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,519
The thing that Nut and I have…

197
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,359
came from Tatarn.

198
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,799
If I were to stay with Nut

199
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,799
and write our own story

200
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
while ignoring Tatarn…

201
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I won't leave you alone.

202
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,279
I'll stay with you

203
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,119
until you slip away.

204
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

205
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,279
I know TRD can help me

206
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,960
since it would benefit them.

207
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,720
That is how this country works.

208
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,720
People with power and authority
are above the law.

209
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,440
-What the hell did you do?
-Stop!

210
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,400
What did you do?

211
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,920
I did the same thing you did for Na.

212
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,559
You killed your own brother
for someone you love.

213
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,079
I just did the same thing.

214
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,599
I poisoned his drink.

215
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,240
I killed Sib because he deserved it.

216
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,480
-Tofu is--
-He deserves it too

217
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,519
if he's keeping you from happiness.

218
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,039
Are you crazy?

219
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,319
You were crazy too.

220
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,079
You and I aren't so different.

221
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,559
We would do anything for those we love,

222
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,480
even when they don't love us back.

223
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,400
Stop.

224
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Gosh.

225
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
What are you doing? Don't!

226
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,720
If he survives, you'll be arrested.

227
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,519
Then so be it!

228
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,119
I'm willing to go to jail!

229
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,359
I can't live like this anymore.

230
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,000
You can't do this.
I've done everything for you.

231
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,559
You can't get arrested.

232
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,559
-Let go!
-No!

233
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,400
-Don't.
-Tofu!

234
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,799
Tofu.

235
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,599
Get up, Tofu.

236
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,279
Tofu.

237
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,920
Tofu!

238
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Tofu, what happened?

239
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,160
Tofu.

240
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,720
Tofu!

241
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,880
My life as a human was a miracle.

242
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,839
I learned a lot.

243
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,240
I got to know the people
and the world around me

244
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,400
little by little.

245
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,480
Just as Nut once said,

246
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
"History depends on who's writing it."

247
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,440
Now, I know

248
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
 that a teddy bear like me,

249
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,160
even as a human,

250
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,359
could never love Nut deeply enough

251
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,440
to bring about a miracle
like Tatarn's love did.

252
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
I just hope

253
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,680
that what I have done

254
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,599
has made some sort of difference.

255
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,759
Doing that has made my life worthwhile.

256
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,839
Before I go,

257
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,240
I remember a quote I once read.

258
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,839
"When someone passes on,

259
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,240
people recognize them
for who they really are,

260
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,880
as the best version of themselves."

261
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,359
I hope that the best version of me

262
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,759
remains

263
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,720
in everyone's memories.

264
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Neung.

265
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,839
Is that you?

266
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,119
I'm Tofu.

267
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Have we met before?

268
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,960
It doesn't matter.

269
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,400
What matters
is that you brought me to Nut.

270
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,160
Do you know Nut?

271
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,839
Thank you

272
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,039
for turning me into who I am

273
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,960
and giving me the chance
to spend time with Nut.

274
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,839
I don't know if I'll get another chance
to be that happy.

275
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,880
But that one chance

276
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,119
was amazing.

277
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
Hey.

278
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,359
Hey.

279
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,519
Time of death, 5:13 p.m.

280
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,400
Nut,

281
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,839
I'm sorry that we won't grow old together.

282
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,799
I'm sorry

283
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
that I won't get to hold you

284
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,480
when you're upset
or when you need someone by your side.

285
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,240
I know that you're strong enough.

286
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,279
Your strength

287
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,400
is what taught me to be strong.

288
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,400
I don't regret my decision.

289
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,880
Even though I'm alone now,

290
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,839
and no one else knows

291
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,359
or even understands why I did it,

292
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,119
as long as I understand,

293
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,759
isn't that enough?

294
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,039
Thank you

295
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,039
for teaching me to stand up
for truth and righteousness.

296
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,400
If we stand up for what's right,

297
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,119
there's nothing to fear.

298
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,039
-Are you a relative of Tofu?
-Yes.

299
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,960
How is he?

300
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
He suffered a cardiac arrest.

301
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,680
We tried our best to save his life.

302
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm very sorry.

303
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,880
Please excuse me.

304
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,599
Tofu!

305
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,480
What happened?

306
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,440
What did you do to him?

307
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,079
What did you do?

308
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,640
Tell me!

309
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,720
I did it.

310
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,440
Tofu knew too many of my secrets.

312
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,759
Tofu.

313
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,480
Tofu.

314
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,839
Hold on.

315
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

316
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,359
Tofu. Stay with me.

317
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,519
Tofu.

318
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,759
Tofu!

319
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,559
I never thought someone like Mr. Saen
could hurt anyone,

320
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,119
especially his own family.

321
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,200
I hope you're right.

322
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,519
You love Mr. Saen a lot, don't you?

323
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
Maybe because I've always wished

324
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,200
he was my dad.

325
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,400
You have to tell them what I said.

326
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,000
Tell the police that I planned everything.

327
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,000
I was here because I planned to kill Tofu.

328
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,799
I saw the chance
when you asked him to help you,

329
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,240
and I poisoned his drink.

330
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,400
You didn't know anything about it, okay?

331
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,559
You just got caught in the middle.

332
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,279
You tried to stop me when you found out,
but it was too late.

333
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,279
Do you understand?

334
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,799
No. You didn't do it.

335
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,799
None of this

336
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,240
was your fault.

337
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,119
I'm solely responsible
for everything. Okay?

338
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,559
I'll take the rap.

339
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,519
I have something to tell you.

340
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,119
What is it?

341
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,319
It's about Saen.

342
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,119
I know you can't forgive him.

343
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,839
I just want you to know that what he did

344
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,839
was meant to protect us.

345
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,359
By murdering people?

346
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,000
What he did

347
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,599
was partially my fault.

348
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,559
I wasn't strong enough.

349
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,759
I let your dad hurt you.

350
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,039
I let him hurt me.

351
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Saen!

352
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,480
I told you not to come here again.

353
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,839
I wouldn't have to come

354
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,160
if you didn't hurt your family.

355
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,599
Saen.

356
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,039
What?

357
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,920
What did she tell you now?

358
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,640
She didn't have to.

359
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,400
I've seen with my own eyes
the terrible things you've done.

360
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,079
So what?

361
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,319
They're my family.

362
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,160
They're not yours. Why do you care?

363
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,160
Have you forgotten?

364
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,079
Before she became your family,
she almost became mine.

365
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,960
You have her.
Why can't you take care of her?

366
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:27,480
How dare you call yourself
a husband and a father.

367
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
Do you think

368
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,440
a loser like you could take care of her?

369
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,839
Don't do it, Saen.

370
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,119
You should leave.

371
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,519
I won't stand idly by

372
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,559
if I ever find out you hurt them again.

373
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,640
It wasn't just him hurting me.

374
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,000
I hurt him too.

375
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,440
Why?

376
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,519
Why?

377
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,960
I love Na too.

378
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,359
I'm no less devoted to her.

379
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,319
What's so bad about me?

380
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,440
Why does Na love a loser like you so much?

381
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,880
She never even tells me she loves me.

382
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,759
Why?

383
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why?

384
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,480
Not getting to be with the one you love

385
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,200
is no worse
than being with someone you love,

386
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,680
but who doesn't love you back.

387
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,200
THE LITTLE PRINCE

388
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,119
That one is old,

389
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,799
so I bought you a new one.

390
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,200
THE LITTLE PRINCE

391
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,960
They say

392
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,400
if you read The Little Prince
at different stages of life,

393
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,639
your interpretation changes.

394
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
I hope we get another chance
to read this together.

395
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,039
It was the turning point

396
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,159
that made me realize.

397
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,039
I decided to tell him I love him.

398
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,440
I've never loved Sib
the way a wife should love her husband.

399
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,599
From now on,
I've decided to be a good wife

400
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,639
and mother to my family.

401
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,800
Don't worry about me anymore.

402
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,599
I'll become stronger

403
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,800
for my family's sake.

404
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,519
I'm glad

405
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,360
that you're stronger.

406
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,159
I hope you're happy.

407
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,159
If you ever need a friend,

408
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,320
you can always let me know.

409
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,400
Thank you.

410
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,960
Saen!

411
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,719
What's the matter with you?

412
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,719
I should ask you why you keep
coming over to see my wife!

413
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
It's not what you think.

414
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,559
So what is it?

415
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,360
Do you dress up,

416
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,239
clean the house, and cook for me?

417
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,159
How can you do this?

418
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,480
Your husband is lying sick upstairs,

419
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,599
and you're having an affair in our house.

420
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,000
How could you do it?

421
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:11,679
What are you saying?

422
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,960
You--

423
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,679
Oh, no.

424
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,480
Honey, don't.

425
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,239
Don't--

426
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,679
Na!

427
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,039
How dare you hurt her in front of me!

428
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,440
Honey.

429
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,159
Let go.

430
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,480
Don't. Please don't fight.

431
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,079
He's very sick.
You should calm down and leave.

432
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,920
Okay? Sit down over there.

433
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,480
I'll get your medicine.

434
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:46,719
Don't.

435
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
I'll get it.

436
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,079
You should talk to him.

437
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,960
I'll get the medicine.

438
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,519
Where is it?

439
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,719
It's in the bedroom, by the bed.

440
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,719
Honey.

441
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,679
What happened?

442
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,360
Did he take the medicine?

443
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,239
This isn't his medicine.

444
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,559
Honey.

445
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,599
Please stay strong.

446
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,079
How could you do this?

447
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,880
You can see he hasn't changed.

448
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,280
He even hurt you in front of me.

449
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Without him,

450
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,800
you and Nut can be happy.

451
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,119
I can't let him die like this.

452
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,760
No, please stay with me.

453
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,039
Stay with me.

454
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,239
It was too late.

455
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,039
We took Dad to the hospital,

456
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,679
but it was too late.

457
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,519
I didn't know what to do.

458
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,159
I couldn't tell anyone.

459
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,679
I was afraid.

460
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,280
The truth…

461
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,559
might upset you,

462
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,199
but I want to tell you everything…

463
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,239
while I still can.

464
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,559
I'm sorry.

465
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,320
I know you're lonely.

466
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,239
I won't let you be.

467
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,400
I wake up to see the happy face

468
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Of the person in my heart

469
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,800
Why can't I forget this person's face?

470
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,079
Why is he so memorable?

471
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,039
It's strange

472
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,519
To think

473
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,719
Of those lost memories

474
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,679
Of beautiful

475
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,440
Days and nights

476
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,079
However much I cry

477
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,400
I think about you

478
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,599
And the days

479
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,719
When you were with me

480
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,960
In the end
We still have to part ways

481
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,719
This…

482
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,840
This place means so much to me

483
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,000
And I have so many

484
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,360
Memories

485
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,320
Please stay here with me

486
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,079
There will be another day for us

487
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,320
A day when we will be together

488
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,119
Again

489
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,000
Tofu.

490
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,400
I don't know if I can be strong
like you wanted me to.

491
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,320
After everything that has happened
with my family,

492
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:35,119
I don't know if I can get through it
without you.

493
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,800
I don't know what will happen to me.

494
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,119
I really want you here with me.

495
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:02,440
But I know…

496
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,320
that's not possible.

497
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:33,760
It's like I'm cursed.

498
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,239
The good things in my life

499
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,320
are short-lived.

500
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,599
In the end, they all leave.

501
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,239
My mom's memories,

502
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,800
my trusted uncle,

503
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,000
and you.

504
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,280
I was afraid
that you wouldn't stick around,

505
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,119
and it turned out to be true.

506
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,119
I can't believe

507
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,239
that you're really gone.

508
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,039
I guess that's what life is like.

509
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,840
We all die in the end.

510
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,559
We may stop breathing when we die,

511
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:32,199
but memories never disappear.

512
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,440
No matter how hard it is to say goodbye,

513
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,239
we still have to move on.

514
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,280
The memories

515
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,559
will always stay in our hearts.

516
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,960
Memories also make us realize

517
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,639
that we're not alone in this world.

518
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,639
There are many people waiting for us.

519
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:06,679
They're waiting for us

520
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,960
to be a family again.

521
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,159
About Gen and me,

522
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,760
you may not agree with it,

523
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,519
but we won't just give up.

524
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,079
I want you to know

525
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,000
that we are serious about each other.

526
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,159
We'll love each other whatever happens.

527
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,159
I'm sorry if I upset you.

528
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,639
I've actually known for a while.

529
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,719
Since the day I visited you on set.

530
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,239
-You knew?
-Yes.

531
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,039
I didn't know what to do then.

532
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:48,760
I didn't know how to handle it.

533
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,480
I never thought my son would like men.

534
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,039
It doesn't mean
that I can't accept it, though.

535
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,559
I was just worried.

536
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,800
Now, I know that I don't have to be.

537
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,760
I can see you're happy
that you've found each other.

538
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:17,039
I can tell that you two
can take care of each other.

539
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,800
If it makes you happy, then be together.

540
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,679
Thank you.

541
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,920
I know that I'm not such a great dad.

542
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,199
My words might have hurt you in the past.

543
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,119
I'm sorry.

544
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,400
I'm sorry too.

545
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,039
We're both sorry.

546
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,760
Because we love each other, right?

547
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,599
Now, Song and Gen are a family.

548
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,719
It might not be a regular family,

549
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:15,960
but it's a very big one.

550
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,360
So big that when you see them,

551
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,880
you would be happy for them too.

552
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:32,800
As for Tarn and me,

553
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:35,239
we got to meet again.

554
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,000
Tarn.

555
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:41,000
-I--
-I missed you.

556
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,920
I really missed you, you know?

557
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,039
You were right.

558
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,199
I did miss him.

559
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,760
But that doesn't mean I didn't love you.

560
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,599
I miss you.

561
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,119
I miss your voice.

562
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,679
I miss your hugs

563
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,679
and your kisses.

564
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:10,880
Don't be afraid that I'll stop loving you.

565
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,960
I know it hurt
that you couldn't compete with Tarn,

566
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,559
that you couldn't help financially,

567
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,760
that you weren't popular like him.

568
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,199
But those things don't mean anything,

569
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:26,920
because who you are

570
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:29,920
is what made me love you.

571
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,760
Tarn showed me the reality of this world,

572
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,320
while you showed me the beauty in it.

573
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,599
I really wonder

574
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,159
where you came from.

575
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,400
If you really fell from the sky
like Mom said,

576
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,800
which galaxy are you from?

577
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,840
It's probably really far from my universe.

578
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,000
Your mothership must have taken you back

579
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,880
to your place of happiness.

580
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,920
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

581
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,079
You had to live
with my dysfunctional family.

582
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,440
If it were possible,

583
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,079
I would forsake having ever met you,

584
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,800
if it meant you would have a better life,

585
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
so you didn't have to meet me

586
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:29,000
and end the way it did.

587
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,880
My first boys' love series was released.

588
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,199
How is it?

589
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,440
I think you know.

590
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,599
I'm still my crazy self

591
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:46,760
writing love stories,

592
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,280
but with political issues snuck in
and complicated storylines.

593
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,199
The reviews weren't as good
as Juea expected.

594
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,840
People still talk about it, though.

595
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,039
A lot of people preferred
my complicated story

596
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,000
to the usual lovey-dovey romance.

597
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,519
Song has so many fans now.

598
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,880
Gen had to step in as his manager.

599
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,519
It didn't turn out as well as you wished,

600
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:14,559
but I'm happy that I wrote it.

601
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:15,920
Most importantly,

602
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,719
the person I wanted to show it to

603
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,239
got to see it.

604
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,079
I love you, Tofu.

605
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,920
I have no doubt that anyone
who got to know you

606
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,039
would love you too.

607
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,679
Thank you for always holding my hand

608
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:34,559
and not thinking I was weird.

609
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,679
You will always be a gift to me.

610
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,079
I wish you were here,

611
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,000
so you could live these stories
along with me.

612
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,039
I miss you.

613
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:46,440
Love from me.

614
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,280
I do know, though.

615
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:58,280
I know everything

616
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,639
because I'm back.

617
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,559
You're probably wondering how I came back.

618
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,679
It happened that day.

619
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,039
It wasn't just Tatarn
who received a miracle.

620
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,679
I did too.

621
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,079
I returned to my body…

622
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,440
just before I was…

623
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,320
cremated.

624
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,840
I don't know
how the miracle happened again.

625
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,239
I don't know if my waking up

626
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,480
affected Tatarn in any way.

627
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,280
All I knew at that moment

628
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,320
was I had to escape.

629
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,760
I wanted to go back to Nut.

630
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,360
When will these dogs
stop targeting bears like me.

631
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,440
Let's go.

632
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,760
Gosh.

633
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,599
Why is he so fast?

634
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,400
When will you stop?

635
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,760
Wait a minute.

636
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,079
What?

637
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,840
Ms. Left Slipper.

638
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:40,679
Why are you here?

639
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,920
Wait. It's coming back.

640
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,440
Let's go, Ms. Left Slipper.

641
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,440
Can you tell me

642
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,960
how you ended up here?

643
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,920
After you lost me that day,

644
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:01,039
I was brought here.

645
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,519
I thought nobody would find me,

646
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,119
so I came to terms with it.

647
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,119
It must have been hard out here.

648
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,599
I'm sorry.

649
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,480
Don't be.

650
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,519
It was no one's fault.

651
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:27,119
It's not easy to survive out here,

652
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,119
but I learned a lot.

653
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,280
It made me prouder of myself
than when I was home.

654
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,960
I know.

655
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,679
At home,

656
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,639
you barely got to be yourself.

657
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,119
Mr. Right Slipper really misses you.

658
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,400
We all do.

659
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,920
I miss him too.

660
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:55,000
But look at me now.

661
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,440
Nobody will want me, even if I go back.

662
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,639
Hasn't Mrs. Na

663
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:02,440
thrown him away?

664
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:04,760
Not yet.

665
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,760
I saved him for you.

666
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,840
He was really sad that you disappeared,
so he went to sleep.

667
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,159
Maybe he'll wake up if you go home.

668
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,440
Let's go home together.

669
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:26,920
Were there really no remains?

670
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,719
Yes.

671
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,400
I was surprised too.

672
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:48,880
Right.

673
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,760
I found this by the crematorium door.

674
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,519
Does it belong to the deceased?

675
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:00,519
Yes.

676
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,719
Is this all that's left?

677
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:06,199
Yes.

678
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,280
It's like a dream.

679
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,400
Tofu wasn't just a dream.

680
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,480
He didn't go anywhere.

681
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,800
He'll always be with us.

682
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,760
That's right. I didn't go anywhere.

683
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,719
I knew Nut would return,

684
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,960
so I'll find a way to follow him home.

685
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,679
But that dog is back again.

686
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,039
Gosh!

687
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:36,440
Let's go.

688
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:38,840
Come on.

689
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,079
Tofu, this way!

690
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,280
Ms. Left Slipper!

691
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,159
Ouch.

692
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:12,840
Go on, Tofu.

693
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,079
No, we have to go home together.

694
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,320
Kuenchai!

695
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:27,920
Kuenchai!

696
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:34,800
Stop, Kuenchai!

697
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:05,440
Nut.

698
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,079
Where are you going, Nut?

699
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,639
Tofu.

700
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,719
Isn't this my slipper?

701
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:05,519
That's your teddy bear. Tofu.

702
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,119
The missing teddy bear

703
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,639
and Mrs. Na's slipper
that Tofu was searching for.

704
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,079
They both ended up here.

705
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,320
That's right.

706
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,079
I'm back, Nut.

707
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,639
Tofu is back!

708
01:03:57,719 --> 01:04:00,320
You're back, Tofu.

709
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,840
Hey, Tofu!

710
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,119
Tofu. Good gracious.

711
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,400
You're really back.

712
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,320
-How are you?
-I knew you would come back.

713
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,360
Nothing is better than
when the people you love

714
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,840
love you back and wait for you to return

715
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,679
to them.

716
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,039
Kuenchai.

717
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,079
Tofu is gone.

718
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,119
From now on, I'll play with you more.

719
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,400
Is your name Tofu?

720
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,960
I don't remember.

721
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,480
But that's what your mother calls me.

722
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,400
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

723
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,079
I guess…

724
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,039
I really missed you.

725
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,960
Even though Nut doesn't know
that I'm back,

726
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,880
I'm just glad

727
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,519
that a teddy bear like me

728
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:47,800
can make him feel a little less sad.

729
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,920
This is what love is.

730
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,519
I get to love him,

731
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:13,000
and I get to watch him.

732
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:42,159
I get to stay--

733
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,239
That's right. I'm always by his side,

734
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:52,079
or sometimes by the bed.

735
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:56,159
Mrs. Na's memory worsens every day.

736
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,719
The pain of a person losing their memory,

737
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,840
and the pain of the person
who still remembers

738
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,119
are just as real.

739
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,039
Mrs. Na isn't the only one who needs help.

740
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,000
Nut is seeing a doctor too.

741
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:16,640
The doctor said

742
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,600
that Mrs. Na does what she does
because of Alzheimer's disease.

743
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,319
While Nut's accidental fits

744
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,840
are due to cumulative fatigue.

745
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,399
Nut should take care of his mom with love.

746
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:34,319
But he must also remember to take care
of his own heart.

747
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,680
But I think

748
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,239
Nut has found someone
to take care of his heart.

749
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,800
I heard that your protest
against Hollow Forest

750
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,920
finally succeeded.

751
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,159
Right.

752
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,560
They halted the construction.

753
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,840
It's a shame

754
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,760
that the law can't touch TRD.

755
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:09,600
They didn't get the real culprit.

756
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,039
What I did

757
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,880
might seem crazy,

758
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:16,000
but sometimes,

759
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,920
miracles do happen.

760
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:24,800
You're still the same.

761
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:27,119
Yes.

762
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,760
I am.

763
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,119
Kuenchai. There you go again.

764
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,119
Come on, Kuenchai.

765
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,960
I was watching quietly.

766
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,800
But now,

767
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,640
I have to witness their love up close.

768
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,920
I didn't think

769
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,920
that you would keep this.

770
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,079
It has always been with me.

771
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:10,640
It suddenly disappeared
when Tofu came, though.

772
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,159
They have the same name.

773
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,039
He had lost his memory

774
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,319
and Mom called him by that name.

775
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,960
She said he looked like this teddy bear.

776
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:30,119
When the teddy bear disappeared,

777
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,560
I even thought that he stole it.

778
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,880
He even told me

779
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,079
that he was the bear.

780
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:42,560
I was furious at him.

781
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:45,239
So,

782
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:47,600
how did you get it back?

783
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,920
I found it at the temple.

784
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,560
It's funny.

785
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,319
When he showed up,
the teddy bear disappeared.

786
01:10:58,039 --> 01:10:59,840
Then, when he left,

787
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,279
the teddy bear came back.

788
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,039
So,

789
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,199
what are your plans for the future?

790
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,039
I think I'll still be
an artist and an activist.

791
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm thinking of opening a new studio.

792
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,840
In Chiang Mai?

793
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,479
Somewhere around here.

794
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,920
I'll get going.

795
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,000
I think I have an idea

796
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:40,000
where his studio will be.

797
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,119
Hey, Nut.

798
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,520
Congratulations on the studio.

799
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,039
I once went to your house in Chiang Mai.

800
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,239
I thought you might like it,

801
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:29,399
so I got it for you.

802
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,119
You can have one here too.

803
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
Did you ever think

804
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,479
that we would see each other again?

805
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,960
I didn't dare to.

806
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:53,920
I'm sorry

807
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,439
for hurting you

808
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,520
and letting go of your hand.

809
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,560
I was never hurt.

810
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,479
You don't have to be sorry.

811
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,039
I know you chose the right path.

812
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,960
Let's go.

813
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,279
All right.

814
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,079
Come on, Song.

815
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:58,239
Everyone, give me a hand.

816
01:13:58,319 --> 01:13:59,920
-It's quite a lot.
-Take this.

817
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:04,239
-It's heavy.
-Here.

818
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,319
Take this.

819
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,479
This one is quite heavy.

820
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,720
All right.

821
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,039
-Are you okay?
-Kind of.

822
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,279
What does "kind of" mean?

823
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:18,600
-It means I'm fine
-It means he's fine.

824
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,880
Okay?

825
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,600
-Are you okay?
-It's a little heavy.

826
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

827
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:27,239
Hello.

828
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,039
Put it here.

829
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,159
What did you guys bring?

830
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,520
I posted drawings of teddy bears
on my page.

831
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,319
They turned out to be really popular.

832
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:40,800
People wanted them,

833
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,159
so I made some sample products.

834
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,399
Prib. Why does it have to be a teddy bear?

835
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:53,079
I once asked Tofu about teddy bears.

836
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,560
He didn't say anything,

837
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:59,159
but when we went to retrieve Tofu's ashes,

838
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,199
Nut got his teddy bear back.

839
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,840
Isn't that strange?

840
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,199
When I think of Tofu,

841
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,439
I think of a teddy bear.

842
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,920
Right.

843
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,800
What should I be

844
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,760
when you think of me?

845
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,720
A dog, since you're like a puppy.

846
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,960
Then you have to be a tick
and stick with me forever.

847
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,920
-You're a tick. A tick. My tick.
-A tick?

848
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,439
Hey, stop it.

849
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,079
I'm getting emotional.

850
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:40,119
Prib.

851
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:44,039
I guess

852
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,880
Tofu must have been a great guy.

853
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,720
Everyone seems to love him so much.

854
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:56,039
I love who Tofu was.

855
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,600
I believe that everyone
wants their own Tofu.

856
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:02,279
That's why I made these.

857
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,079
But actually,

858
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,960
I think

859
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,760
we should be our own Tofus,

860
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,760
and be a Tofu for other people.

861
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:00,960
Here.

862
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:05,720
Nut.

863
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,640
Here.

864
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,920
Right. I don't have my own Tofu.

865
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,760
Come on.

866
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:23,039
Then I wish

867
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,239
that you find your own Tofu soon.

868
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,359
Hello.

869
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:46,319
Which one do you like?

870
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:06,199
Well,

871
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,399
I saw on the Once Upon Our Time page

872
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:12,960
that you were selling stuff here.

873
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:20,680
Right.

874
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,199
I posted that just five minutes ago.

875
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:27,840
Do you live around here?

876
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,159
No.

877
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,640
I just wanted to take a Tofu Bear home.

878
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,760
Your post caught my eye right away.

879
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,159
Just the way I like it.

880
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:42,199
"Just the way I like it."

881
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,720
That's right.

882
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:51,520
You're "Mittraphap Is A Road Name."

883
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,000
Yes, that's me.

884
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,079
Thank you for always engaging
with my posts.

885
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:09,479
You've been doing it since I started.

886
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:14,279
I like your artwork.

887
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:17,000
I wanted to support you,
so you can continue drawing.

888
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,319
Thank you.

889
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,079
Right.

890
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,079
Which one are you interested in?

891
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,840
This one is really cute.

892
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,479
Finally, Prib found her own Tofu.

893
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,079
You didn't have to walk me home.
We're neighbors.

894
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,680
I wanted to.

895
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,239
It's the first time
I came all the way to your house.

896
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,600
Thank you.

897
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:09,800
Do you still miss Tofu?

898
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,279
Would you be mad

899
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:18,720
if I missed him?

900
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:22,359
No.

901
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,800
I should thank him

902
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,560
for getting your mother to open up
and to get over what other people think.

903
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,399
It's not strange for men to fall in love.

904
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,800
If society says it is,

905
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,520
I think that's what's strange.

906
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,239
I should thank you too.

907
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,359
You gave me strength

908
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,199
and the courage to choose my happiness.

909
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,800
You helped make me who I am today.

910
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,520
Didn't I tell you?

911
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,279
I'm happy

912
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,199
to see you happy.

913
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:11,159
Whether you agree to marry--

914
01:21:11,239 --> 01:21:12,520
I do.

915
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,199
Even though we can't do it legally,

916
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:23,720
my heart

917
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,479
married you a long time ago.

918
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:35,520
Nut once told me,

919
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,960
a good screenplay should leave a trace
in the audience's hearts.

920
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:42,600
They should never forget it.

921
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:44,960
No matter how many years later,

922
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:49,279
they will still think of those stories

923
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,119
and dig up that trace to remember.

924
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,600
I guess that's what Tatarn is to Nut.

925
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,920
I also hope

926
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,039
that I'm like that too.

927
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,520
Are you done with the plot?

928
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:48,239
Tofu

929
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,399
Are you jealous of Tarn again?

930
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:54,000
Are you trying to make me think of you?

931
01:22:56,359 --> 01:22:57,920
Even if you're jealous,

932
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,319
I know you won't get mad
if I get back together with him.

933
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,039
No matter what,

934
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,319
you'll always be in my heart.

935
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,840
I told you before,

936
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,479
miracle is just
another way of saying hard work.

937
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:21,760
Maybe the miracle that occurred

938
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:26,279
was a result of someone's hard work,

939
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,880
or even many.

940
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,720
Nut.

941
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,920
Nut.

942
01:24:26,039 --> 01:24:27,279
Tofu.

943
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,840
Is it not enough to stay in my heart?

944
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:45,680
Is that why you're here?

945
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,680
I told you to wait for me,

946
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,479
but you didn't.

947
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:02,680
You shouldn't have gone to Jan's.

948
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,880
Everything was already decided.

949
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,439
I'm sorry

950
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,840
that I couldn't wait to see you.

951
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:20,359
That's why I came back today.

952
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,560
You came on a rainy day, just like Mio.

953
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,880
I'll disappear like Mio too.

954
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,880
Before I go,

955
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,079
I want to tell you something.

956
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,560
Don't worry.

957
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:48,720
Don't feel bad.

958
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,920
I'll be so happy

959
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,760
if Tatarn is the one by your side.

960
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,800
I'm also glad

961
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,319
that you're no longer stuck in the past.

962
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:15,000
I am the way I am

963
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,680
because of you.

964
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,800
I'll continue living my life for you.

965
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,520
I'll be happy in your stead.

966
01:26:29,319 --> 01:26:31,079
I love you, Tofu.

967
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:35,760
I love you too.

968
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,720
I'm happy

969
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,159
to see you smile.

970
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,760
Please be very happy.

971
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,000
Yes, Juea.

972
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,960
It has been approved, Nut!

973
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:20,399
What?

974
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,680
The plot you submitted this morning
was approved.

975
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,920
Are you serious?

976
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,840
Of course!
You can start writing the script now.

977
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,000
Sure thing.

978
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:33,279
Tofu! It was approved!

979
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:45,520
THE MIRACLE… THAT MORNING

980
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:00,920
I kept my promise.

981
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:04,520
Your story is being made into a series.

982
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:07,920
I'm going to celebrate with Tarn and Mom.

983
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,800
Don't be jealous, my boy.

984
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,039
I'll enjoy the food for you.

985
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,239
I know Nut will always think of me.

986
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:22,359
Whatever he faces from now on,

987
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,479
he'll be fine,

988
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:27,279
because I'm cheering him on from here.

989
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,399
I hope Nut is happy in the real world

990
01:31:32,199 --> 01:31:35,000
without the need for any more miracles.

991
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:42,079
