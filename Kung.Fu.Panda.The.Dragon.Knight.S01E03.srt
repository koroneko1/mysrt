00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,258
[whimpers]

356
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
[groans]

357
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,098
[atmospheric music plays]

358
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,689
[Zhen] Right here.

359
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,652
We freed you. Now, tell us what you saw.

360
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,612
Deal's a deal.

361
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,323
I saw them steal a scroll.

362
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,616
Which one?

363
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,618
The Tianshang Weapons.

364
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,953
Huh. [grunts]

365
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,414
In a time before the Lotus,

366
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,958
before history,

367
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,669
the world was one great landmass.

368
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,795
[Zhen] Pangaea.

369
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,463
Kind of a dopey name.

370
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,425
Anyway, some of the people
who lived there had a great power.

371
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,845
They could control the elements.

372
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,849
And for a long time, everything was cool.

373
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,059
Until it wasn't.

374
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,187
Because one day, a group of them decided--

375
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,440
Well, I'm not totally sure
what they decided.

376
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,819
But they basically wanted to
rule Pangaea with an iron fist,

377
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,573
and destroy anyone in their way.

378
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:23,495
But, a team of elemental warriors
banded together to stop them.

379
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,997
They used their own magic

380
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,085
to create four weapons that
could trap those evil guys inside forever.

381
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,421
-[whirring]
-[dramatic music plays]

382
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,509
[Zhen] But when they did,
the elements were thrown off balance,

383
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,220
and the world split apart.

384
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,016
-[Blade] What were these weapons?
-[Zhen] One was a helmet.

385
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,767
There was some sort of glove.

386
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,061
-[Blade] It's a gauntlet.
-[Zhen] Whatever.

387
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,940
And, like, a fire whip, or something.

388
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,151
And one other. I don't remember.

389
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,112
I'm not the expert here.

390
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,198
That's quite literally what you are.

391
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,491
But anyway, there's four of them.

392
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,577
[atmospheric music plays]

393
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,999
[Zhen] They were scattered,
so no one could have this power again.

394
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,420
Then lost to time.

395
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,425
Separately, they are all dangerous.

396
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,510
Together? Oh, boy!

397
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,306
Klaus and Veruca must be after all four.

398
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,100
Wait, wait.
Did you say one of them was a whip?

399
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,479
A whip of flame, a whip of flame…
That sounds so familiar!

400
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,191
She's escaped!
The Dragon Master and Zhen are in cahoots!

401
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,193
-We have to move.
-They'll see us!

402
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,861
Wait. Where's Zhen?

403
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,364
[fireworks whizz]

404
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,574
[Zhen] Woohoo!

405
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,701
This'll keep them occupied!

406
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,121
[gasps] So,
you did do all those other things?

407
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,082
You do know what fireworks are.

408
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,877
Oh, and it feels so right, baby! [laughs]

409
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,087

[atmospheric music plays]

411
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,968
Po, we need to leave. Now.

[emotional music plays]

413
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,140
[sobbing]

414
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,021
Dragon Master, how could you?

415
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,191
Po.

416
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,402
Yeah, I'm coming.

417
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,204
Four weapons. Four!
I thought I had a chance.

418
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,666
But now we've lost the trail,
and they're just getting started.

419
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,128
If we follow the thumb,
we'll always be one step behind them.

420
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,297
We'll always be too late.

421
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,425
[gasps] Unless we know
where they're heading!

422
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,846
Hm, the Whip of Endless Flame…

423
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,764
[gasps, exclaims]

424
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,225
The whip… Aha, aha!

425
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,187
Look at this. Huh?

426
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,649
Fictional drawings for children.

427
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,695
We prefer the term graphic novel,
and it's based on fact.

428
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,781
Okay, Whip of Endless Flame.

429
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,284
Uh… Here! Here, here, here.

430
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,787
[Po] The Whip of Endless Flame,
like Zhen was talking about!

431
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,792
Too powerful for any one man to use,
so it must be hidden from the world.

[intriguing music plays]

433
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,545
"Master Long-Tooth,

434
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:22,632
now that I have the Whip of Endless Flame,
I know exactly where to hide it."

435
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,092
Told you this wasn't junk!

436
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,472
Our answer lies on the very next page!
