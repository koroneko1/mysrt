1
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,000
What the…!

2
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:50,666
DAENG PHRA KHANONG

3
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,583
Where the hell are the fish?

4
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,541
Damn lizards ate them all.

5
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,916
They might gobble me up next.

6
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,708
Daddy…

7
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,000
Mommy…

8
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,416
Daddy…

9
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,500
Mommy…

10
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,916
Daeng?

11
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,791
Is that you?

12
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,916
Daddy.

13
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,166
Mommy.

14
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,083
Daeng?

15
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,125
Come on, don't jump out at me like that.

16
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,875
You're ghostly pale.

17
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,166
I'm spooked, boy.

18
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,250
Didn't catch any fish today, Uncle Eiang?

19
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,291
You can have my food.

20
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,375
Thanks…

21
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,750
Daeng.

22
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,875
What are you doing? Come play with us.

23
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,041
Come on.

24
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,708
Stop playing with the bell.

25
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,625
You're riling up my bird, little brat.

26
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:53,666
Come here and eat.

27
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,125
Where're you going?

28
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,750
Stupid bird.

29
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,166
Take a shower then,
you're so hard to please.

30
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:09,541
Husband, have you sent some food to Daeng?

31
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,833
Don't worry about him.

32
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:16,166
Even if we don't feed him,
somebody here will.

33
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,833
Chief!

34
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,291
What's wrong with him?

35
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,291
What is it, Eiang?

36
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,375
It's Daeng. His arms are so long…

37
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,750
Gave me the creeps.

38
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,041
Creeps or crap?

39
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,208
I mean Daeng stretched his
super-long arms from the bank.

40
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,125
So what? Did he give you food?

41
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,041
Yeah.

42
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,000
So why did you freak out?

43
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,708
Get used to it already.

44
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,291
He likes joking around.

45
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,500
Don't be such a chicken.

46
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,625
Did he ever break your legs or your dick?

47
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,583
No.

48
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,791
Right. No need to be scared of him.

49
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,125
I can't help it.

50
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,458
Your face is more horrifying than his.

51
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,291
If you're done here, get out.

52
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,875
I have a lot to do.

53
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,833
You go and give a hand at the temple. Go!

54
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,791
Hard labor.

55
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,625
I'm going now.

56
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,416
I'm not Buddha, don't do that to me.

57
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,958
You want me to be more casual?

58
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go, bro.

59
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,375
Too much.

60
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,958
I'm not your bro.

61
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,458
Everyone, get back to work.

62
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,541
Samlee, what're you doing?

63
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,458
It's my groove.

64
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,208
Guys, wait up.

65
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,291
Uncle Inn, today you'll be dead.

66
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh yeah?

67
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,666
Five Elements!

68
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:57,958
Earth.

69
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,041
Earth?

70
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,708
Water.

71
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,250
Wind.

72
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,333
Earth is okay, wind is disgusting.

73
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,291
Fire.

74
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,041
Wood.

75
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,750
Let's get him.

76
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,250
Mali.

77
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,708
Time to go home.

78
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,125
Yes, Mom.

79
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,916
Daeng, see you tomorrow.

80
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,666
I'm going home too.

81
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,583
Wait for me, Heng.

82
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,666
Daeng, see you.

83
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,000
Bye, Daeng.

84
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,250
Bye, Daeng. Bye, Uncle Inn.

85
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,583
Uncle Inn, which way is my house?

86
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,500
Very funny, damn you.

87
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,750
Daeng,

88
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,500
you can play with me.

89
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,625
It's okay.

90
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,958
I can play by myself.

91
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,708
You can go.

92
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:08,916
Guess I'll go get drunk at the temple.

93
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,041
Now where's the kid asking the way home?

94
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,291
What a brat!

95
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,000
Heng.

96
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

97
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,791
Did you see the fire in Daeng's hand?

98
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,708
No way. Something's wrong with your eyes?

99
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,083
Yeah, probably.

100
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,291
But I'm sure I saw it.

101
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,625
That's messed up.

102
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,625
It's weird.

103
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,875
Where did you come from?

104
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,666
I'm from Bang Kapi, sir.

105
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,583
Your temple, Wat Mahabut,
has a fine reputation.

106
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,541
I'd like you to take me in.

107
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,166
You mean you want to crash here?

108
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,375
This isn't a hotel.

109
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,625
I mean,

110
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,791
I would like to stay here

111
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,833
and focus on my dhamma studies.

112
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,500
I see.

113
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,125
Study hard,
so your eyes will see the light of Buddha.

114
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,208
Yes, Venerable Abbot.

115
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,791
Didn't you shop around for a temple
before getting into monkhood?

116
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,666
Just doing it now?

117
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,458
Inn, go get drunk somewhere else.

118
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:39,041
But your temple
is great for drinking, sir.

119
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,750
Damn me.

120
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,291
Stray monk.

121
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,583
"Stray" is for dogs.

122
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,708
And monks too.

123
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
You should check him out.

124
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,375
Leave me alone!

125
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,083
Drunk as a skunk.

126
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,083
Shut up or I'll shit in your alms bowl.

127
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,541
Now I'll have to clean up his mess.

128
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,250
Just like every day.

129
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,458
The aggregate of mental formations
is called sankhara.

130
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,666
The aggregate of consciousness
is called vijnana.

131
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:22,750
Visible form and corporeality
can be led astray

132
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,125
by bad intentions

133
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,583
and desires of the mind.

134
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,625
The aggregate of mental formations
is called sankhara.

135
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:47,041
Visible form and corporeality…

136
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,875
The aggregate of mental formations
is called sankhara.

137
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,250
The aggregate of consciousness
is called vijnana.

138
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,375
Abbot!

139
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,250
Sir, what are you doing?

140
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,416
I was having a sweet dream.

141
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,666
Sir.

142
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,708
Fai, open the door.

143
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:00,583
Open the door.

144
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,416
Where are you going?

145
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,041
Daeng, my boy.

146
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,208
I told you not to show up like this.

147
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,916
You're scaring me.

148
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,791
Please stay and talk to me.

149
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,125
Okay.

150
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
Missing your mom and dad again?

151
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,000
When will I see them?

152
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,583
That I don't know.

153
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,666
Well, we have a new monk here.

154
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,916
Why don't you go and give him
a spooky welcome?

155
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,833
Sounds good, sir.

156
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,958
Daeng!

157
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,416
Daeng.

158
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,708
Daeng.

159
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:57,875
Daeng!

160
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,750
I know it's you.

161
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,208
You can't scare me. Show yourself.

162
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,375
Darn, this is no fun.

163
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,666
Daeng, why are you here?

164
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,500
I need your help.

165
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,833
All my life,
I've never met my mom and dad.

166
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,250
I'll help you.

167
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,125
You promise?

168
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,791
I'll find a way for you
to reunite with your parents.

169
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,958
Thank you.

170
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,833
Now you're blessed.

171
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,083
Sadhu…

172
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,583
Chan, move away.

173
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,041
I'm scared.

174
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,083
Venerable Abbot,

175
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,875
does the whole village
know the truth about Daeng?

176
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,875
Not exactly.
The adults haven't told their kids.

177
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,333
They don't want to scare them.

178
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,791
Sir.

179
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,916
Sprinkling the holy water
won't do me good.

180
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,875
Let me take a gulp.

181
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,083
Chan.

182
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,000
Chan!

183
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:28,083
You're spilling it!

184
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,083
Chan!

185
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,166
Behave yourself.

186
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,000
Sit back there.

187
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't want to sleep alone tonight.

188
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,750
Let me sleep next to you, sir.

189
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,208
Look, my room is more comfy.

190
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,666
And I'll take care of you.

191
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,458
In your dreams, dickhead.

192
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,000
Or you want to sleep with the abbot?

193
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,416
Sir, don't you worry about Daeng.

194
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,791
I'll keep him company tonight.

195
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,625
Good. So, he won't come give me a fright.

196
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,833
Daeng, I brought you some boiled chicken.

197
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,166
Here you are. My wife made it.

198
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,333
And a sweet coconut from Min Buri.

199
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,791
Thank you.

200
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,875
I was about to put kratom leaves
in the chicken,

201
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
so you can go in the sun.

202
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,708
But nah, you'd get dizzy instead.

203
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,833
So anyway, enjoy it.

204
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,791
Let's go.

205
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,291
Kratom leaves can help me stand sunlight?

206
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,583
We will love one another.

207
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,333
We will forgive one another.

208
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,583
We will be together till death do us part.

209
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,000
Bless us.

210
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,500
Harry Potter.

211
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,291
Potter my ass! This is Daeng.

212
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,791
The glasses are pretty convincing though.

213
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,666
Let's go. Get up.

214
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,625
Come on, Daeng.

215
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,250
No need to hit me on the head.

216
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,333
Now I feel dizzy.

217
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,916
I could get a brain tumor.

218
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't be glum, make some noise! What?

219
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,375
Be my chorus.

220
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,416
"Hey, oh hey hey." Like this.

221
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,125
Let's be merry.

222
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,750
Time to give your donations!

223
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,000
Time to give your donations!

224
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,416
Everyone…

225
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,625
Every folk…

226
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,833
Good Buddhists put money in a box.

227
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,875
All Buddhists put money in a box.

228
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,250
When monks are not there

229
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
The box disappears.

230
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,875
Stop!

231
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,208
Why?

232
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
This song is so uncool.

233
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,708
Uncool?

234
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,041
Watch your big mouth.

235
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,583
Who gave you that mouth, huh?

236
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,500
Your parents didn't teach you to behave?

237
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,166
I did, but he's a daft kid.

238
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,791
-Dad.
-What, son?

239
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,625
I want to go play with Daeng and Mali.

240
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,708
-You do?
-Yes.

241
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,708
Watch out for grass.

242
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,666
Why?

243
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,666
It's full of blades.

244
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,041
Okay, lame.

245
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,166
-Dad.
-What?

246
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,833
Please stop trying to be funny.

247
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,750
It's embarrassing.

248
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,250
A waste of my time.

249
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,958
What did he say again?

250
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,291
Where were we?

251
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,583
Whoa, that hurts.

252
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,166
What the hell are you doing?

253
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,750
Huh?

254
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,208
Why're you sitting here?

255
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,416
Because I want to.

256
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,791
It's the abbot's seat.

257
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,416
Scram, you drunk.

258
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,791
No need to yell.

259
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,625
Don't be such a thug.

260
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,791
I'm going now.

261
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,916
You're drunk from morning till night.

262
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,875
He needs a kick in the butt
from time to time.

263
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,958
Chief Kluay.

264
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,958
Don't mind the mad and the drunk.

265
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,666
He's the Drunkard of the Year.

266
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,500
We're at the temple

267
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,291
Yes, we're at the temple

268
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:25,041
Sir, this year we have more people
coming to help out.

269
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,708
Yes.

270
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,833
Heng.

271
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,416
What?

272
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,833
Are we the third wheel?

273
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,541
Yup, definitely.

274
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,708
Let's go then.

275
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,208
Gosh, I'll have diabetes soon.

276
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,416
You already have it.

277
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,625
I feel sorry for Daeng.

278
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,166
Remember.

279
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,458
Don't tell your children
what Daeng really is.

280
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,125
If they know the truth,

281
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,958
Daeng won't have any friends left.

282
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:20,958
Got it?

283
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,416
Yes, Chief.

284
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,125
Please begin the sermon.

285
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,250
Where has everyone gone?

286
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,375
This side, sir.

287
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,666
This village is cursed.

288
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:50,291
Be happy in a home, in hell,
in jail, and in a warm hole.

289
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,000
This is a weird sermon, sir.

290
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,375
Never heard it in my life.

291
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,500
"Happy in a home"?

292
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,916
That's normal.

293
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,375
I got that. What about "Happy in hell"?

294
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,375
-Hell is kinda fun, don't you think?
-Right.

295
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,541
"Happy in jail."

296
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:04,541
Jail is even more fun.

297
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,958
What about "Happy in a warm hole"?

298
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,083
Why not in a warm hole?

299
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,958
What warm hole?

300
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,166
In our mother's womb, for heaven's sake!

301
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,833
As you wish.

302
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,000
Piece of work…

303
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,375
You do that, I'll do the preaching.

304
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,375
Whaddyacallit…

305
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:29,541
Buddha thingamajig…

306
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,541
Gibberish Buddhist Puddagig

307
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,708
Just give me your robe, it'll be easier.

308
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,625
You just sit there!

309
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,458
Go on, sir.

310
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,208
Dirty little shit.

311
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:03,208
Yo, Daeng digs Mali, Mali digs Daeng.

312
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,166
Let me tell you, man.

313
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,625
You're so sick to dig that chick.

314
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,875
Mali will get a kick from Daeng

315
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,208
This is so wicked
and Daeng's so slick, yo.

316
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,500
What's that strange song, Samlee?

317
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,291
You don't know it yet.

318
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,250
In a hundred years, it will be a classic.

319
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:33,500
I swear before the sand pagoda

320
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,666
that I will love you
until the last day of my life.

321
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,791
If I break my oath,

322
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,666
if I so much as glance at another chick,

323
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,916
may my good eye go crooked forever.

324
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,125
Sadhu.

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,041
I guess the pagoda is rotten.

326
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,416
The rancid smell hurts my brain.

327
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,708
Hey.

328
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,500
What was that?

329
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,875
Help me pick this one.

330
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:45,875
Sure.

331
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,541
Have a bite.

332
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,541
It's spicy.

333
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,041
I'll have a bite too.

334
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:09,125
One bite each and it'll be so sweet.

335
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:10,791
Crazy.

336
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,916
You're crazy.

337
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,208
They're driving me crazy.

338
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,333
I can't stand it.

339
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,625
Can't stand what?

340
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:29,458
There. Love birds give me stomachache.

341
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,916
I'm jealous.

342
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:34,500
I wonder when I'll meet my soulmate.

343
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,458
When your skin turns white.

344
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,416
That's forever.

345
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:47,500
Mali.

346
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,666
If I wasn't a human,

347
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,166
would we still be friends?

348
00:26:56,958 --> 00:27:00,708
If you weren't a human,
then what would you be?

349
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,791
Maybe…

350
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,125
you are…

351
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,000
an alien?

352
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,500
Can you shoot laser beams?

353
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,166
Come on, show me.

354
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,583
Just pick the chilis.

355
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,083
Laser beams, please.

356
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,166
Chilis, please.

357
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,291
There's something weird about Daeng,
I'm telling you.

358
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,000
Back at the temple,
I saw him stretch his arm super long.

359
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,708
Nonsense.

360
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,416
Nobody can do that.

361
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,250
Yeah, shut up.

362
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,333
Here's a grilled fish.

363
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,333
Let's wait for Samlee.

364
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,166
Where did you get it?

365
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,041
-It's an offering.
-What?

366
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,458
No, no.

367
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,708
I mean Uncle Chief gave it to me.

368
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,875
Just in time.

369
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,416
Now dig in.

370
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,875
Wash your hands first.

371
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,250
They're all black.

372
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,125
Which part of me isn't, huh?

373
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,458
Think before you speak.

374
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,708
Don't make me hit you.

375
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,416
Now eat.

376
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,250
Wait…

377
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,583
Today we have a grilled fish.

378
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,875
Tomorrow we'll have a barbequed pig.

379
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,041
But there's no pigs around here.

380
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,208
Sometimes your jokes are just mean.

381
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,625
It's not funny at all.

382
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:47,958
I'm not your food.

383
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,125
Come on, eat.

384
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,083
Wait for me.

385
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:58,083
Easy, man.

386
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,208
Hope I can get one today.

387
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,500
There must be some here.

388
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,333
There it is.

389
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,875
Don't go anywhere.

390
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:17,541
Gotcha.

391
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,875
There you are.

392
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,833
There you are.

393
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:28,583
Slippery, eh?

394
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:32,083
You can't escape my eyes.

395
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:39,166
Stop moving.

396
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,333
I've got a big one.

397
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,500
Oh another.

398
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,833
My lucky day.

399
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,958
Gotcha!

400
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,708
Thanks to my sharp eyes.

401
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,416
Any more out here?

402
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,875
I'm so lucky today.

403
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:21,958
Looks familiar.

404
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,583
This mudskipper is huge.

405
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,583
It went this way.

406
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:36,333
There you are. My favorite.

407
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:43,208
Don't move. I'll make a soup out of you.

408
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,750
Gotcha.

409
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,833
My favorite.

410
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,375
What?

411
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:57,083
It's not a fish?

412
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,708
A ghost!

413
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,000
Daeng's ghost!

414
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,416
Daeng's ghost!

415
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,291
What's that sound?

416
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,208
Who's that?

417
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,166
I don't know.

418
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:27,916
Wait here.

419
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,583
Hey.

420
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,583
God damn it!

421
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,375
It's Mai.

422
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,500
Chief!

423
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,458
What's up with you?

424
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,833
It's Daeng.

425
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:51,333
He tried to kill me.

426
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:55,291
What?

427
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,625
Are you sure it's him?

428
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,625
I saw him with my own eyes.

429
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,041
I don't trust his eyes.

430
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,166
Where did you see him?

431
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,916
I was looking for mudskippers
in the banana grove.

432
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,875
Where?

433
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,375
The banana grove
by the pond near the forest

434
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,416
after the river by the temple.

435
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,083
You have to deal with
Daeng's ghost, Chief.

436
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:25,250
Okay.

437
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,958
I'll set up a night patrol.

438
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,916
So the whole village can sleep soundly.

439
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,416
Are you sure?

440
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
I saw him with my own two eyes.

441
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,625
Where?

442
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,500
The banana grove
by the pond near the forest

443
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,291
after the river by the temple.

444
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,250
Get a hold of yourself.

445
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,333
There's a Buddha here, don't be a sissy.

446
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,625
Let go of my leg.

447
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,625
See the Buddha statue?

448
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,625
I'm creeped out.

449
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,416
Was it really Daeng?

450
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:13,708
Look, little love birds.

451
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,458
Hey, come join us.

452
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,083
You two have fun.

453
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,375
We'll be looking forward to your wedding.

454
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,500
Yeah.

455
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:27,250
We'll crash your party real bad, yo.

456
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,333
Hey guys.

457
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,291
What?

458
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,125
What's that?

459
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,333
Keep your voice down.

460
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,208
This is my father's Buddha amulet.

461
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,875
If Daeng is really a ghost,

462
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,125
when we put this around his neck

463
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,666
he'll scream in burning pain.

464
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,583
Really?

465
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,166
Follow me.

466
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,333
Let's see.

467
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,250
Daeng.

468
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,333
What?

469
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,708
You live by yourself,

470
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,791
you should have a protection.

471
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,791
Thanks.

472
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,625
How come he's not in pain?

473
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:17,208
I think your father's amulet is fake.

474
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:22,333
Sri, I don't need it.

475
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,208
Samlee, come here.

476
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,250
What's up?

477
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,166
You should have this.

478
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,583
You look like you're possessed.

479
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,583
"Possessed" is kinda vague,
just say I'm Black.

480
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,041
Maybe…

481
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,000
Samlee is a ghost.

482
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,208
Ghost my ass!

483
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:52,666
I stepped on a splinter!

484
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,333
Squeeze it out.

485
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,666
Sit still!

486
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,625
It hurts!

487
00:34:58,458 --> 00:34:59,916
Dumbass.

488
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,291
Your stupid amulet is bad luck!

489
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:13,958
I've lost big money, damn it.

490
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:17,125
Next time you'll win some back.

491
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,791
There is no friggin next time.

492
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,708
Don't move.

493
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,666
What is it?

494
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:29,708
Daeng!

495
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:32,291
Take that!

496
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:33,666
Why did you hit me?

497
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,958
I didn't hit you.

498
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,416
I hit Daeng's ghost.

499
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:44,291
Don't move.

500
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,208
Why did you hit me?

501
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,250
I didn't hit you. I hit Daeng's ghost.

502
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,916
You bashed me squarely on the head.

503
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,333
Daeng, Daeng!

504
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,041
Why did you hit me?

505
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,083
Why did you hit me?

506
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:06,625
I didn't hit you. I hit Daeng's ghost.

507
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,666
Are you sure it was Daeng?

508
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,333
Sure as hell, Chief.

509
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,125
But don't you worry.

510
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,291
We got him real good.

511
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,500
The rascal won't bother us
for a long time.

512
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,583
Well, looking at you two,

513
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,916
I think it's Daeng who got you good.

514
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,458
You two are liars.

515
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,541
I should kick your sorry asses.

516
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,666
Easy, honey.

517
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,000
Daeng has never harmed anyone.

518
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:45,458
Are you two trying to protect the devil?

519
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,625
Who are you clowns?

520
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,000
Watch your mouth, intruders!

521
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,375
Easy, don't hurt yourself even more.

522
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,750
I'm Khuay.

523
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:05,750
You're Khuay!

524
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:07,833
Khuay who?

525
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:12,875
Khuay, the great sorcerer
and vanquisher of evil.

526
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,250
And why are you here?

527
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,791
Like I said, I hunt ghosts,

528
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,208
you think I'm here to make cupcakes?

529
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,708
I'll help you get rid of Daeng.

530
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,625
Free of charge.

531
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,916
Free of charge?

532
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,166
Or maybe a little.

533
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,208
Just a little?

534
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,291
Maybe a lot.

535
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,416
There's no ghost for you to hunt here,
so leave.

536
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,291
You can keep fooling yourself.

537
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,166
But one day you will need me.

538
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:46,541
Khuay.

539
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:47,750
Let's go.

540
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,583
He's gone bananas.

541
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:09,666
Leave me alone, would you?

542
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,833
-Samlee.
-What?

543
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,750
What do you want to be when you grow up?

544
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,416
I want to be a grownup.

545
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,166
I mean for a job, stupid.

546
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:23,750
Here.

547
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,083
Thanks.

548
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,166
I'm not bad-looking, eh.

549
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,875
I'll get you, Daeng.

550
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,166
Checked.

551
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,166
Shit. Moron.

552
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,541
Samlee, Heng, come here!

553
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:31,958
What's wrong?

554
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:32,958
Come.

555
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:36,208
My fat is killing me.

556
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,958
Daeng has no reflection in the mirror.

557
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,541
Come on, not this again.

558
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,416
My foot still hurts
because of your amulet.

559
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,458
I bet something's wrong with your eyes.

560
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,041
Like when you saw a fire in his hand.

561
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,875
Stop nitpicking him, will you?

562
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,375
But it's true.

563
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,666
See for yourself.

564
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:09,958
You were looking at a wall, moron.

565
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,375
How come?

566
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,625
Get back to work.

567
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:14,875
You're wasting my time.

568
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,291
I really need to lose some weight .

569
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:24,250
How's that possible?
Something's really wrong with my eyes?

570
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,041
Where's the mirror?

571
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,041
I'll get you next time.

572
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,333
Over there.

573
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,833
What a mess.

574
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,375
Over here.

575
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,625
Sir.

576
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,291
Yes?

577
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,791
I've been wondering.

578
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:01,250
Daeng's mother, Nak, was already cremated.

579
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,583
But why is Daeng's body still out there?

580
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:06,291
A stillborn baby cannot be cremated.

581
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,416
It's bad luck.

582
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,958
So where is the boy's body now?

583
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,500
That I don't know.

584
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,791
It was buried somewhere.

585
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,333
To avoid being dug up
and used for black magic.

586
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,458
What black magic, sir?

587
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,791
Chan, behave.

588
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,416
Excuse me.

589
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,083
Black magic such as turning him
into a voodoo child.

590
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:48,291
Whoa, gives me goosebumps.

591
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,541
And you give me a bulge.

592
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,041
Wait for me, sir.

593
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,958
Samlee, I envy you.

594
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:27,708
You have a giant snake.

595
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,250
And I pity you.

596
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,500
Caterpillar.

597
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,333
Heng, Samlee.

598
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,333
What?

599
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,333
Do you think it's true?

600
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,916
They say if you look between your legs,

601
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:49,916
you can see ghosts?

602
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,750
Not again, stupid.

603
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,958
And who is "they"?

604
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,125
Why do you believe them?

605
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:00,333
Well, let me try it then.

606
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,500
Shit!

607
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,500
You saw it, right?

608
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,166
Crystal clear.

609
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,541
Daeng is a ghost?

610
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,041
No, my balls.

611
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,250
Shit.

612
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,666
I can't see anything past them.

613
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,250
My belly got in the way.

614
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:23,958
You two do it.

615
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,541
Do you see what I see?

616
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,000
With both eyes.

617
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,541
Daeng!

618
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,458
You're a ghost!

619
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:53,500
What now, Sri?

620
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,333
Mali, stay away from this devil.

621
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,458
Didn't your mom tell you

622
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,916
there's a ghost
wreaking havoc in our village?

623
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,791
It's him.

624
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,958
Yeah, my dad told me too.

625
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,958
Stop calling him a ghost.

626
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,166
I won't.
And I'm not going to play with a ghost.

627
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,416
What kind of ghost shows up
in broad daylight?

628
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,166
A daylight ghost!

629
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:18,875
I said he's not a ghost!

630
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,125
Then go on and have fun with him!

631
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,666
Sure, and you guys should scram!

632
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,125
If you don't believe us,

633
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,833
just look between your legs.

634
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,958
Then you'll see what he really is, yo.

635
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,750
Let's go.

636
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,041
We don't want to be here.

637
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,750
Heng, what're you waiting for?

638
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:03,708
Though I'm drunk from noon to night

639
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:09,083
You're still the apple of my eyes…

640
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:17,041
I feel sorry for you, Daeng.

641
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:21,583
You're an orphan ghost.

642
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,833
Left behind in this world.

643
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,416
Mak and Nak must have a reason.

644
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,625
But they will come back for you.

645
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:37,541
Your parents are like my own kids.

646
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,708
When Nak died,

647
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:45,458
I was the one who wrapped her
in a sacred shroud.

648
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:52,250
You were born
in the most unusual position.

649
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,833
You came out sideways.

650
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,500
Your mother suffered
such great pain and died.

651
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:03,958
Uncle Inn,

652
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,375
I want to be alone.

653
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,333
Please go away.

654
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:13,166
Should've told me earlier.

655
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,208
Could've saved my breath.

656
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,041
Okay, I'm going.

657
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh, in winter most girls
have cracked soles

658
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,291
It's not strange since they're cold…

659
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:31,250
I'm a poetic drunkard.

660
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:47,166
Samlee, what's wrong with you?

661
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,958
You're going to hurt your horse.

662
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,416
It's my groove, man.

663
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:53,541
Hey guys.

664
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,250
Winners get a piggyback ride home, okay?

665
00:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,333
Then no need to race.

666
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,458
You may as well just get on my back now.

667
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:03,250
Come on, don't give up yet.

668
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,000
Ready?

669
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,000
Ready.

670
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,541
One,

671
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,041
two…

672
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:18,208
Daeng, don't you realize that
we're not living in the same world?

673
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:20,666
You're shameless.

674
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,583
Guys, let's race to the temple.

675
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:26,750
Spoils my mood.

676
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,041
I'm sorry, Daeng.

677
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,333
Go left.

678
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,416
What's wrong, Daeng?

679
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,958
My friends don't want to play with me.

680
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,333
Because I'm a ghost.

681
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,375
True friends will never leave you.

682
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:50,833
I don't mind about Sri, Heng, and Samlee.

683
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:54,791
But I don't want Mali to know the truth.

684
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,083
Mali is the only friend I have now.

685
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:05,416
One day everyone will understand.

686
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:38,875
Daeng, please don't harm me.

687
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,208
Damn husband. Wait for me!

688
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,416
Oops, I dropped a lemon.

689
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,666
Never mind.

690
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:16,291
Daeng, it's getting late.

691
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,625
You're leaving?

692
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:30,583
I'll come play with you again tomorrow.

693
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:33,916
You promise?

694
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,375
I promise.

695
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:39,125
You go home. I'll clean up.

696
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:40,916
See you.

697
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,500
If you don't believe us,

698
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,000
just look between your legs.

699
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,000
You'll see what he really is.

700
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:16,041
Fatso!

701
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,625
Can I play with you?

702
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,375
What's your name?

703
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:34,833
Daeng.

704
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:35,916
I'm Mali.

705
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,541
We'll let you play, but you are it.

706
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,750
This is Samlee.

707
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:50,833
This is Sri.

708
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:54,625
And this is Heng.

709
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,166
This is why I don't want to fall in love.

710
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:16,541
Who's gonna love you anyway, Sea Cow?

711
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,958
My latest nickname, huh?

712
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,291
Next you'll call me Hippo, duh.

713
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,541
Mali, just get over him.

714
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,916
People and ghosts can't be together.

715
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:39,791
This love is impossible…

716
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,333
Stop it.

717
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:44,833
Have some decency.

718
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,416
My bad.

719
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,125
Listen, your task is to
spread terror in the village.

720
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,958
This time, hold nothing back.

721
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,500
Remember this,

722
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:46,791
there must be a dead body
in Phra Khanong tonight!

723
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:50,250
Go!

724
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:58,291
From now on, they will remember my name.

725
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:02,916
Khuay, the sorcerer
who defeated the ghost of Nak's son!

726
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,208
Daeng…

727
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,291
You look so sad.

728
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,583
What's wrong?

729
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,416
Can you take me to my mom and dad?

730
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:35,625
What has happened?

731
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,750
I don't want to be here anymore.

732
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,125
All right, I will help you.

733
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,083
But first you have to tell me

734
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,250
where your body was buried.

735
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:55,333
Your spirit is attached to your body.
That's why you're not free.

736
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:03,000
It's under the tree where your tent is.

737
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,583
My body is right there.

738
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:22,541
I'm too drunk to walk.

739
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,291
Oh, Inn.

740
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:28,000
Who are you?

741
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:28,916
It's me, Monk Ton.

742
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,625
Why aren't you in bed already?

743
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:36,833
You're drunk as a fish again.

744
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:39,958
I'm not a fish.

745
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,250
You're a liar.

746
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,500
Are you a real monk?

747
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,875
I mean you're drunk all day and night.

748
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:52,916
Yeah, you're right, man.

749
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,625
Who's drunk again?

750
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,416
Your sleeping quarters is there!

751
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:03,166
Who's drunk, Monk Ton?

752
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:09,000
Calm down.
You know, if I weren't a monk…

753
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,000
Daeng.

754
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:33,916
Don't be upset.

755
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:39,916
I know who's behind all of this.

756
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:45,958
Someone is turning the
whole village against you.

757
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:53,583
You're a good ghost.
I know you've never harmed anyone.

758
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:57,750
You should be admired.

759
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:02,041
You're like your mother, Nak.
She's also a kind spirit.

760
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:07,708
Don't give up. I'll support you.

761
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:08,875
Uncle Inn.

762
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,750
I want to be alone.

763
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,541
Please go away.

764
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:17,375
I knew you'd say that.

765
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,333
I should have just walked along.

766
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,666
Little rascal.

767
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:26,083
Back to where I belong.

768
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:31,583
Drunk as a skunk, in a funk.

769
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:35,916
Drunk with the monks, what a punk.

770
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,750
Drunk day and night, like a hunk.

771
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:46,208
Drink, drank, drunk, I'm a skunk.

772
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:49,708
Drunk but I can still find my rhymes.

773
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:10,791
I'm so friggin drunk.

774
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:14,208
But I'm so happy.

775
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,083
Don't worry, be happy.

776
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,541
Left and right.

777
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:23,958
Back and forth.

778
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:27,666
I can't even walk straight.

779
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,333
I gotta take a leak.

780
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,791
Who's that?

781
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,000
Daeng, right?

782
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:51,875
My dick!

783
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:57,375
Stop it.

784
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,125
Who are you?

785
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,666
It hurts!

786
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,458
What was that?

787
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:11,708
Uncle Eiang.

788
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,750
Stop it, Daeng!

789
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,875
What have you done?

790
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,625
I didn't do anything.

791
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,458
Go check on him.

792
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,333
Chief, he's dead.

793
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,625
Mali, are you okay?

794
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,625
You must've heard about what happened.

795
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,208
Do you think Daeng did it?

796
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:24,833
What should I do now, Mom?

797
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,791
I know how you feel.

798
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:36,958
It's like when all that happened
with his mom,

799
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,541
I was her best friend.

800
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,708
But I did her wrong

801
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,791
by abandoning her.

802
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:51,375
Why did everyone keep quiet about Daeng?

803
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:55,041
They pretended Daeng was a human being.

804
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:58,666
Because we weren't scared of him
like we were of his mother.

805
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:02,666
But it doesn't matter
if Daeng is a human or not.

806
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:08,250
These past ten years
Daeng has never harmed anyone.

807
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,500
Did he do anything to you?

808
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,333
Can I go see him?

809
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,291
Of course, sweetie.

810
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,250
Don't be scared.

811
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:33,958
Damn bananas!

812
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:47,916
Let's grill him and eat.

813
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,958
You sick bastard.

814
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,625
This isn't a time to joke around.

815
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:55,791
That's quite a smack.

816
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:56,875
Be useful for once.

817
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,791
This has gone too far.

818
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,833
Daeng is as evil as his mother.

819
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,791
Shut the hell up.

820
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,500
Why do you always try to protect him?

821
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:09,708
Enough already, all of you.

822
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,166
-You make me sick.
-My head's all red.

823
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,625
Not funny.

824
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,875
Get out of my sight.

825
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,458
Go away.

826
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,541
Drunk all the time.

827
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:22,333
Chief, you have to take care of it,

828
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,500
because I'm so scared.

829
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,750
Let me take care of it.

830
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,541
Why are you here?

831
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,000
To make more cupcakes, obviously!

832
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,291
Your husband has sent for me.

833
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:38,041
What's going on?

834
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,208
Don't argue with me.

835
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,208
Things have escalated.

836
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,333
We have to set things straight.

837
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:49,916
But I have to ask you one thing.

838
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:51,500
What is it?

839
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,208
Don't destroy Daeng's spirit.

840
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,916
That's Japanese for yes.

841
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,291
You have my word.

842
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,333
When will you start the ritual?

843
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:06,291
After sunset?

844
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,791
I've already started it.

845
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:12,500
Daeng…

846
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,208
Someone left this.

847
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,333
Nobody lost a snake?

848
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:42,333
Damn leaves are all over the place.

849
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:44,250
Over there, sir.

850
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,166
Catch him.

851
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,708
I'll get you, Sri!

852
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,791
Catch him.

853
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:56,916
Guys, listen up.

854
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,541
We have to help Daeng.

855
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:02,166
The witch doctor is going to catch him.

856
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,083
Why should I care?

857
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,125
Daeng is a ghost and he killed someone.

858
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,458
Daeng didn't do it.

859
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:11,708
Did it or did not,
it's got nothing to do with us. Yo!

860
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,291
And don't forget…

861
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,375
Daeng is a ghost.

862
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,750
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

863
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,333
Whatever he is, he is still our friend.

864
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:31,833
Fine, I'll go help him without you.

865
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:38,875
Mali.

866
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:45,666
Sri, you're a bright boy
but your heart is full of darkness.

867
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:50,583
Samlee, your heart
is even darker than your skin.

868
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:52,875
Wait for me.

869
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,250
I hate this shit.

870
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,291
Poor Daeng, you're in big trouble.

871
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:13,541
Can you go any slower?

872
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,208
We're not in a race, are we?

873
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,291
Shut up.

874
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,833
And stop bossing me around!

875
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,916
Mali, wait up.

876
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:36,958
Come on, Heng.

877
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:47,875
Here we are.

878
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,458
Witch doctor.

879
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,333
I thought you would catch Daeng
at his house.

880
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,958
Why are we here?

881
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:01,000
I'm going to perform the ritual here.

882
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:04,083
Do not hurt Daeng.

883
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:07,041
Stay out of this, Venerable Abbot.

884
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,625
This isn't your jurisdiction.

885
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:09,958
Go back to the temple.

886
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:14,208
No, sir! Please help Daeng first.

887
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:17,125
Right, this is temple grounds.

888
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,916
So it's my jurisdiction.

889
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,916
You have ugly faces,

890
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,291
and your hearts are even uglier.

891
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:27,250
Well, we're not very nice-looking

892
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:32,000
but we never go around
begging for food like you do!

893
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,583
Blasphemy!

894
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,833
I give alms to the monks everyday.

895
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:37,750
You're insulting me too!

896
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,916
Not you. I meant the abbot.

897
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,875
Sir.

898
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,708
Daeng went too far and killed someone.

899
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:50,583
We can't let him go unpunished.

900
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,166
Did you see with your own eyes
that he did it, Khuay?

901
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,250
Khuay's over there, sir.

902
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:58,958
I'm Kluay.

903
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:03,541
I've never seen Daeng
do such an awful thing.

904
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:09,083
Go easy on him, would you?

905
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:14,291
I can destroy his spirit right now.

906
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:17,291
A clown like you can do that?

907
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,625
Daeng would break your neck first.

908
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:24,750
Who's this?

909
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,250
Shit, Uncle Inn.

910
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,541
I didn't hear you coming.

911
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:33,083
You scared me so bad I went cross-eyed!

912
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,250
What're you looking at?

913
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:38,000
There.

914
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,625
What're they doing?

915
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:42,166
Go ask them yourself.

916
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,458
Okay. Hold this for me.

917
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,666
No problem.

918
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,416
What's going on there?

919
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,250
Be careful.

920
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,916
Watch me.

921
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,625
Have you got it?

922
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,291
Come out here!

923
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,500
Isn't that the new monk?

924
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,791
Monk my ass.

925
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,250
You're a bunch of idiots.

926
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:29,875
As stupid as a donkey
and a lizard and a sea turtle.

927
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:32,208
-Nothing wrong with donkeys.
-Whatever.

928
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:35,458
So you've got it?

929
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:36,875
Yes, Master.

930
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:39,916
Daeng's body.

931
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:50,375
You black-hearted, clam-faced, dog-shit!

932
01:13:50,458 --> 01:13:51,541
What was that?

933
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:54,500
Enough with the falsetto!

934
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,083
Daeng.

935
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,208
Heng, help him.

936
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,208
Daeng.

937
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,208
Thanks, Mali.

938
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,750
Friends have to help each other.

939
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:27,416
What happened to you?

940
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,083
I don't know.

941
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:32,458
Heng, go get help.

942
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:33,875
Where?

943
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,208
I don't know.

944
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,166
But I do.

945
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:40,958
Sri, Samlee!

946
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,041
Put him on my back.

947
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,458
Got him?

948
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:55,083
Heng, I may not be the brightest boy,

949
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:58,416
but my heart isn't full of darkness.

950
01:14:58,875 --> 01:15:00,208
Don't get sentimental now.

951
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,416
Let's go.

952
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:14,041
Don't do it.

953
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,958
Sri, go get Daeng's body.

954
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,291
Hang in there.

955
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:28,625
You'll be all right.

956
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,000
Lame ass.

957
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,208
Stupid.

958
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:11,208
I really have to shed a few pounds.

959
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,166
No!

960
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,291
My hand, sir.

961
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:34,125
Then why the hell are you laughing?

962
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,083
I thought we were done!

963
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,375
Hang in there.

964
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:46,583
Get off me!

965
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:47,708
I won't.

966
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,333
You hurt my friend!

967
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:02,458
Let go of me, asshole!

968
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,125
Samlee.

969
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:11,416
Mali.

970
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,625
Mali, run! Run, Mali!

971
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,625
Keep running.

972
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:22,958
Sri, wait for me!

973
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,041
What's that?

974
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:46,541
Stop it!

975
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,833
Want to have fun, sir?

976
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,375
You know martial arts?

977
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,333
From a friend at Shaolin Temple.

978
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:18,458
Wait until you see
the drunken boxer's moves.

979
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:22,250
It's okay, I get the picture.

980
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:28,708
Roast monkey?

981
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:33,041
Perfect with my moonshine.

982
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:36,875
Let's untie these threads.

983
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,000
Off they go.

984
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:43,541
Did they strangle this monkey?

985
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:01,125
Samlee, take Daeng's body to the shelter.

986
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:02,083
Right.

987
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,500
Sri, follow Samlee.

988
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,166
Heng, faster.

989
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,666
I'm a fatso. Don't push me!

990
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:19,666
Go now.

991
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:26,500
Daeng?

992
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:27,583
Are you Daeng?

993
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,458
No, my name is Ngern.

994
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,166
Ngern who?

995
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:38,000
Oh! So it's you!

996
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,708
You harassed the villagers
and made everyone think it was Daeng.

997
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:45,166
Damn kid. I'll give you a slap on the ear.

998
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:48,875
The witch doctor forced me to.
He locked up my spirit.

999
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:53,166
Thank you for setting me free.

1000
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,750
Now I can be reborn.

1001
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:58,000
Good for you. Now go.

1002
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,791
You've overstayed your welcome here.

1003
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,541
Go where you belong.

1004
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:02,625
Thank you.

1005
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:03,625
Go now.

1006
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,916
Hmm.

1007
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:08,708
Don't come back.

1008
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:11,166
Get out of here.

1009
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:16,458
But don't be reborn as my son.

1010
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:20,291
I already have one.

1011
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:25,375
He smokes weed all day
till his tongue turns green.

1012
01:20:25,458 --> 01:20:28,625
And smiles like an imbecile.

1013
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:33,458
Yup, like father like son.

1014
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,875
Where are the children?

1015
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,500
I don't know.

1016
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,750
What?

1017
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,916
If this doesn't end soon,
I'll be going home skinny.

1018
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:54,500
Untie the sacred thread from Daeng's body.

1019
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:55,583
All right.

1020
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,416
What's going on?

1021
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,291
Let's go.

1022
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,541
Running again?

1023
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:17,416
Ton, wait for me.

1024
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,250
There.

1025
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,833
How do you like that, bitch?

1026
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,791
You're a traitor.

1027
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,333
Helping those bastards.

1028
01:21:33,416 --> 01:21:34,541
Serves you right.

1029
01:21:49,416 --> 01:21:50,583
Here they are.

1030
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,583
What's going on?

1031
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:52,916
We've got Daeng's body.

1032
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,666
Give it to me.

1033
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,666
Or this girl is dead!

1034
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,958
Let me go!

1035
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,875
Mali!

1036
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,250
Khuay, you are a son of a bitch.

1037
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,458
Let the child go!

1038
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:06,916
I'll let her go

1039
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,625
after you give me Daeng's body.

1040
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:10,625
Right.

1041
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,416
Mali.

1042
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,250
Ton!

1043
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:17,958
A real solid hit, huh.

1044
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:19,416
I'll fight you one-on-one.

1045
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,708
Me? Meet my disciple first.

1046
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,041
Teach him a lesson.

1047
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,166
I think that's enough, sir.

1048
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:32,458
Don't play the hero.

1049
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:38,666
The whole of Phra Khanong
will be flattened!

1050
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:44,000
-Are you summoning Ngern?
-Yes.

1051
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:45,791
I've already set the boy free.

1052
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,750
-Already?
-Yup.

1053
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,458
Then brace yourself for my Plan B.

1054
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,916
Plan B?

1055
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,083
Be careful.

1056
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:30,791
Daeng!

1057
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:31,916
Daeng!

1058
01:23:34,166 --> 01:23:35,208
Where are you, Daeng?

1059
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,791
I was living in peace,

1060
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:47,375
but you turned the whole village
against me!

1061
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:48,583
Right.

1062
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:53,208
Now you'll witness my wrath.

1063
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:58,083
I'm not afraid of you, little devil.

1064
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:08,541
Daeng.

1065
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,208
Daeng.

1066
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,750
Watch out!

1067
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,916
That's cool, Daeng.

1068
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,375
Stop it, Daeng.

1069
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:35,000
It's time to end this cycle of karma.

1070
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,125
Who's that?

1071
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:39,458
Who is she?

1072
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:45,166
It's Nak! It's your mother.

1073
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:01,666
Mommy.

1074
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:16,666
I'm sorry.

1075
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,916
I miss you so much.

1076
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,708
I miss you too.

1077
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,041
Are you my dad?

1078
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,458
Heng, where's my dad?

1079
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,916
How would I know?

1080
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,500
I'm here to take you with me.

1081
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:07,583
Say goodbye to your friends.

1082
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,083
I love you, Samlee.

1083
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:25,500
I love you, Daeng.

1084
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,958
Do you want to come with me?

1085
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,583
Thanks but no thanks. I'm pretty busy.

1086
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:36,250
Daeng, I love you so much.

1087
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:37,916
Same here, Heng.

1088
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:41,000
I'll see you soon.

1089
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:42,333
When?

1090
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:43,833
Say, in 90 years.

1091
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:50,500
I'm not mad at you, Sri,

1092
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,916
for turning against me.

1093
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:55,250
I'm sorry.

1094
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:57,791
I really love you.

1095
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,583
Mali, if we happen
to meet in the next life,

1096
01:28:04,541 --> 01:28:06,166
will you still be my friend?

1097
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:50,833
Good luck, Daeng.

1098
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:56,625
Goodbye, Mali.

1099
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:29,583
Daeng, if I died and became a ghost,

1100
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:33,375
would you still be my friend?

1101
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:35,333
Yes.

1102
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:47,000
Run, Samlee, run!
