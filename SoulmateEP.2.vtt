00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.248
Do you know

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:18.722
Before I met your father

00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:21.513
I used to love someone

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.417
It’s my first love

00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:35.356

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:43.120
World made us meet

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.683
Or we believe that it’s a Destiny

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.518
But other people

00:06:52.893 --> 00:06:55.546
No one except us

00:06:57.397 --> 00:06:59.360

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:14.677
We are so strange for them

00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:18.648
No one gives us a chance

00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:21.240

00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:38.104
to let that person go

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.920

Your house is so beautiful and very good atmosphere

00:19:54.982 --> 00:19:56.586
Beautiful in every where in the house

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.625
I love it

00:19:59.742 --> 00:20:01.348
If you like just come more often

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.693
Ummm

00:20:31.287 --> 00:20:33.306
I figured out

00:20:33.306 --> 00:20:34.951
Uncle Dang shaved ice

00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:36.790
Very delicious

00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:39.166
f we missed it, so bad

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:41.895
P’James, we better go to eat

00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:44.342
I think he’s still have it

00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:46.809
Please P’James

00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:53.575
Are you hungry?

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:55.142
Need some banana?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.213
P’James

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.321
You’ve been looking at my banana for long time

00:21:26.775 --> 00:21:28.035
Take it

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:29.413
Don’t be considering

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:30.960
You mother bought it a lot

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.313
Take it

00:21:32.802 --> 00:21:34.097
Or you can take this one

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.042
What’s wrong with you?

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.355
So can we go to eat shaved ice?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.033
Wanna go?

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.359
I don’t know

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:44.480
Don’t know what? I asked you, wanna go?

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.079
Uncle Dang!

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:49.756
Yes, go

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:54.985
So what’s wrong with you?

00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:00.464
P’James

00:22:02.105 --> 00:22:03.013
P’James

00:22:03.676 --> 00:22:04.767
F*ckkkkk

00:22:04.767 --> 00:22:06.090
I can’t control it

00:22:07.138 --> 00:22:08.219
Sh*t

00:22:10.244 --> 00:22:11.278
Sky

00:22:13.164 --> 00:22:14.571
What?

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:16.971
Sky

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.169
No!

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:20.940
Just a second

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.717
What happened to you?

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:23.909
Please

00:22:25.697 --> 00:22:26.594
No!

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.846
So heartless

00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:30.580
Just help me a little bit

00:22:34.211 --> 00:22:35.819
Help what?

00:23:03.922 --> 00:23:05.124
What?

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.086
Do not smile

00:23:09.692 --> 00:23:11.208
Don’t even help me

00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:13.539
You’re not a good person

00:23:22.932 --> 00:23:24.920
But normally I never be like this

00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:27.712
Or strange place

00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:16.894
Well well, you’re so happy

00:24:17.383 --> 00:24:19.525
Vegetable and Fruit

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:22.840
All you like, my mom have all of it

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.210
Can find for you all

00:24:25.223 --> 00:24:26.981
Mom knows that I don’t like it

00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:28.205
But always want me to eat

00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:30.157
Are you my mom’s lovely son

00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:33.702
What’s this?

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:35.405
I saw you drink a lot in Bangkok

00:24:35.754 --> 00:24:36.654
Is that delicious ?

00:24:36.654 --> 00:24:38.493
It’s a juice from Tipco

00:24:38.493 --> 00:24:40.000
There’s orange pulp

00:24:40.698 --> 00:24:42.595
You can eat easier than fresh fruit

00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:45.180
And it’s really good for us because there’s no sugar

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.400
Wouldn’t fat

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.130
Am I fat?

00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:51.034
I want some

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.012
Can you feed me?

00:24:55.606 --> 00:24:56.499
Come on

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.660
How’s it?

00:25:04.928 --> 00:25:06.650
Its delicious and easy to drink

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.531
P’James

00:25:08.531 --> 00:25:10.016
I’ll show this picture

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.373
This one when I was a student at high school and I took this at this village

00:25:15.588 --> 00:25:18.400
You’re looking so good with the student uniform

00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:22.314
I wanted to u to see that I stayed in this village

00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:24.112
I see

00:25:26.556 --> 00:25:28.373
So do you have any plans today?

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:30.934
Ummm, so

00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:32.555
There’s a annual festival

00:25:32.555 --> 00:25:34.431
I want to take you there

00:25:35.094 --> 00:25:36.854
Annual festival

00:25:36.854 --> 00:25:38.289
Is that at the city hall?

00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:39.345
Yes yes that is

00:25:39.345 --> 00:25:42.300
I really miss that atmosphere of annual festival

00:25:42.998 --> 00:25:43.911
I have an idea

00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:44.678
P’James

00:25:44.678 --> 00:25:45.654
Do you see this necklace?

00:25:46.771 --> 00:25:48.963
It’s my favorite necklace

00:25:48.963 --> 00:25:50.723
I bought it from this festival

00:25:51.386 --> 00:25:52.946
But I lost it

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:55.615
If destiny is real

00:25:55.615 --> 00:25:57.403
I wish that merchant

00:25:57.403 --> 00:25:59.477
Will be there

00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:00.800
Don’t worry

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.477
I will go with you and buy a new one

00:26:03.861 --> 00:26:04.855
Really?

00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:05.355
Of course

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:06.024
Then go now

00:26:06.024 --> 00:26:06.869
Wait wait

00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:09.056
Who’s going to sell it at this time

00:26:12.963 --> 00:26:14.600
I forget it

00:26:17.044 --> 00:26:19.197
So we have many hours before go to the festival

00:26:19.616 --> 00:26:21.361
What should we do?

00:26:22.863 --> 00:26:23.898
Or

00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:26.726
We can do something in the bedroom

00:26:26.726 --> 00:26:28.058
Is that good idea?

00:26:29.175 --> 00:26:30.352
Assuming

00:26:30.596 --> 00:26:32.320
Assuming what?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.488
I mean

00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:35.780
Go to watch the movie in the bedroom

00:26:36.758 --> 00:26:38.433
What did you think?

00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:41.321
Just watch the tv

00:26:41.705 --> 00:26:42.725
Go now?

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.468
Let me drink it

00:26:44.468 --> 00:26:45.918
Come on

00:29:23.566 --> 00:29:25.589
And the end of the year like this

00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:27.842
Visiting the good place, good atmosphere like this

00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:29.865
For me

00:29:29.865 --> 00:29:32.800
I’m so bored the hustle of the city

00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:36.152
That’s true

00:29:36.885 --> 00:29:38.301
But

00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:40.236
The good atmosphere is not enough

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:41.787
Because

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.877
The person that beside me also important

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.358
I would be with you like this forever

00:29:53.523 --> 00:29:54.977
Beautiful house

00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:57.300
Good atmosphere

00:29:58.138 --> 00:29:59.544
And also have you

00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:04.769
So sweet talking, you’re super cute

00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:08.181
I think

00:30:08.181 --> 00:30:10.316
I should give you a reward

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.686
Seriously?

00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:20.163
When did you buy it?

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:24.526
 I bought it when I going to buy you a food

00:30:25.364 --> 00:30:27.642
Do you know that’s so hard to find it

00:30:29.493 --> 00:30:31.532
Do you believe me, this necklace

00:30:31.532 --> 00:30:32.975
It may look normal

00:30:33.429 --> 00:30:35.616
But for me, it’s a mental value

00:30:36.524 --> 00:30:37.890
Because a person I love

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:40.622
Bought it for me as a gift

00:30:40.622 --> 00:30:42.468
It’s my mother

00:30:45.297 --> 00:30:46.707
But

00:30:47.056 --> 00:30:48.619
I have something for you too

00:30:52.006 --> 00:30:53.012
What?

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.542
Wanna know? Then close your eyes

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.521
Why?

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.242
I’ll surprise you

00:30:59.696 --> 00:31:00.879
Ok

00:31:02.939 --> 00:31:05.135
Close your eyes

00:31:05.379 --> 00:31:07.068
Ok

00:31:07.068 --> 00:31:08.794
Do not cheating

00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:10.915
Come on, I’m ready

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.490
Hurry up

00:31:22.125 --> 00:31:23.781
Why just this

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.931
I need a little bit more

00:31:28.693 --> 00:31:30.538
Can’t give me more?

00:31:30.992 --> 00:31:32.411
Please

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.110
A bit more

00:31:34.529 --> 00:31:36.588
I want it harder

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.206
Please Sky

00:31:39.206 --> 00:31:40.394
Come on

00:31:41.057 --> 00:31:42.639
No one can see

00:31:43.023 --> 00:31:44.313
Only one time

00:31:44.313 --> 00:31:46.427
Around here

00:31:46.427 --> 00:31:48.679
Around your mouth

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.334
Come on

00:31:51.788 --> 00:31:53.592
I’ll close my eyes

00:31:53.592 --> 00:31:54.761
I closed it already

00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.763
I’m ready

00:31:55.763 --> 00:31:56.942
Come on

00:31:57.466 --> 00:31:58.560

I never thought that we gonna met each other again

00:32:26.134 --> 00:32:27.389
Because You

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.374

00:32:34.634 --> 00:32:36.020
Happy new year
