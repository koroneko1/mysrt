WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:04.670
<i> In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:04.770 --> 00:06.700
<i> Just a normal girl</i>
<i> with a normal life.</i>

00:07.940 --> 00:10.670
<i> But there's something about me</i>
<i> that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.840 --> 00:12.340
<i> Because I've got a secret.</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:15.510
<i> ♪ Miraculous! Simply the best!</i>

00:15.610 --> 00:16.580
<i> ♪ Up to the test</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.450

00:27.660 --> 00:28.990
<i> ♪ Miraculous! ♪</i>

00:29.990 --> 00:33.760
(Kwamis protest all at once)

00:33.960 --> 00:37.100
- It's not fair.
- Please! Please!

00:37.200 --> 00:39.170
You know why you can't come.

00:39.270 --> 00:42.370
When he made me the guardian,
his memory was magically erased.

00:42.470 --> 00:44.510
Now Master Fu
is just like everyone else.

00:44.610 --> 00:47.040
He can't know about
the Miraculous, my identity

00:47.140 --> 00:48.340
or you kwamis.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.710
Come on, Tikki, let's go!

00:50.410 --> 00:51.810
It's not fair!

00:51.880 --> 00:54.480
Why does Tikki
get to go and not us?

00:54.550 --> 00:57.050
I'm sorry, but you know
I can't leave Marinette,

00:57.190 --> 00:58.850
in case
she needs to transform!

00:58.920 --> 01:01.860
But what if we hide, too?
Then he'd never see us!

01:01.920 --> 01:05.730
- That'd be OK then, right?
- We want to make sure he's OK!

01:05.830 --> 01:08.430
He took care of us for
more than 100 years, you know!

01:08.530 --> 01:10.260
I know,
but you'll have to let him

01:10.370 --> 01:12.200
live his new life
with his soulmate.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.830
It's my turn
to take care of you!

01:13.900 --> 01:15.340
Marinette, even so,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.100
you know Master Fu trusted me

01:17.210 --> 01:18.940
to help him protect
the Miracle Box.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.910
I was more than just his kwami.
I was his friend.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.950
And I miss him so much!

01:25.050 --> 01:27.250
I understand, but...

01:28.120 --> 01:30.120
All right, you can come, Wayzz!

01:30.250 --> 01:34.590
(Other kwamis protest loudly)

01:34.690 --> 01:36.020
- I wanna go!
- Please!

01:36.090 --> 01:38.190
I just can't take
all of you at once!

01:38.760 --> 01:41.630
- Why not?
- Why, why, why, why, why?

01:41.730 --> 01:43.200
Because...

01:43.470 --> 01:44.970
Because the Miracle Box
has to be guarded.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.070
That's why!

01:46.640 --> 01:48.300
So what you're saying
is if one of us

01:48.440 --> 01:49.570
stays here to keep watch,

01:49.670 --> 01:51.610
the rest of us can come, right?

01:51.710 --> 01:55.440
- Huh? What? Of course not!
- (All protest)

01:55.540 --> 01:59.080
- How do we choose who stays?
- Let's let fate decide.

01:59.150 --> 02:02.580
- Yeah, let's do Kwami-kwawho!
- Kwa-what?

02:02.690 --> 02:06.450
Kwami, kweemi, kwoomi, who?
The special chosen one is you!

02:06.560 --> 02:09.490
- There! Marinette stays!
- Yeah!

02:10.390 --> 02:12.430
Oh, no, you don't!
That's cheating!

02:12.530 --> 02:16.060
Besides, I'm the guardian.
I get to decide! Period!

02:16.730 --> 02:19.630
- She leaves us no choice.
- Operation Kwami

02:19.740 --> 02:21.140
Baby-Doll Eyes!

02:21.240 --> 02:23.670
Please!

02:24.640 --> 02:26.670
(Sighs) Fine.

02:30.310 --> 02:34.180
(Sighs)
Any kwami willing to volunteer?

02:34.280 --> 02:35.720
The kid has a point.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.150
What if a villain
or a sentimonster shows up?

02:38.250 --> 02:41.590
I have a bad feeling about this!
You go! I'll keep watch!

02:41.860 --> 02:45.030
<i> - En garde, my lord!</i>
- Thank you, Baark!

02:45.130 --> 02:48.060
- Come on, everyone inside!
- Woohoo!

02:48.160 --> 02:51.000
But I'm warning you. Not even
a peep out of any of you!

02:51.100 --> 02:53.570
- Yeah!
- You're peeping!

02:56.770 --> 03:00.510
<i> By Jove, we are not</i>
<i> out of the woods yet, my lord!</i>

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
Ready?

03:07.580 --> 03:09.920
(Kwamis start singing)

03:12.250 --> 03:15.020
Ugh, this phone,
starting on its own again!

03:15.120 --> 03:18.430
If it doesn't stop now, I swear
it's gonna end up in the trash!

03:20.960 --> 03:23.600
- Uh...
- (Nervous laugh)

03:38.550 --> 03:41.320
- Hi, Marianne!
- Hello, Marinette!

03:41.380 --> 03:42.980
Do you remember her, my love?

03:43.420 --> 03:45.750
She's the girl who found
you after your boat accident.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.860
The accident
that caused your amnesia.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.960
I'm so happy to see you again,
Master... I mean... Mister Fu!

03:54.060 --> 03:58.100
My dear child, you reunited me
with my beloved Marianne.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.630
I can never thank you enough!

04:03.170 --> 04:06.210
Yes, life in London
has been quite wonderful.

04:06.310 --> 04:09.210
Wang discovered
a passion for painting!

04:09.310 --> 04:11.580
Actually, as a thank you
for helping me,

04:11.680 --> 04:13.480
I want to give you
this painting.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.220
Thank you. It's really...

04:17.950 --> 04:20.750
- Am I holding it the right way?
- Ha, ha, ha! Yes.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.760
I'm not sure myself
what it's supposed to represent.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.090
But when I think of you,
this is what I see.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.130
So, there you go.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.100
What's this?
That's such a cute little doll!

04:34.200 --> 04:36.970
- Is it yours?
- (Laughs)

04:37.110 --> 04:40.240
Yes, it probably fell out
when I took out the cake.

04:40.310 --> 04:43.410
- He touched me! He touched me!
- I didn't show you,

04:43.510 --> 04:48.280
it talks, too! Heh, heh, heh!
He touched me! He touched me!

04:48.380 --> 04:52.120
(Laughs) So, what are you gonna
do while you're visiting Paris?

04:52.220 --> 04:55.590
Paint, of course! Montmartre!
The Tuileries Garden!

04:55.660 --> 04:57.090
The banks of the Seine!

04:57.430 --> 05:00.490
Is there any better place
to paint than Paris?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.460
- Go on, don't mind me!
- (Laughter)

05:03.570 --> 05:06.270
- Another slice of cake?
- Please.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.810
He looked as strong as a tiger!

05:11.910 --> 05:14.940
- Unusual painting, though!
- Is there is still cake?

05:16.410 --> 05:18.380
Aaah!

05:20.920 --> 05:23.280
I told you
I had a bad feeling about this!

05:23.390 --> 05:27.150
How come you're in possession
of the Mother Box, young lady?

05:27.260 --> 05:28.360
Uh...

05:28.490 --> 05:29.860
Who are you?

05:29.960 --> 05:31.490
That's Grand Master Su-Han,

05:31.590 --> 05:33.590
the Celestial Guardian
of the Miracle Box!

05:33.660 --> 05:36.830
- But I'm the Guardian!
- The Celestial Guardian

05:36.930 --> 05:40.400
was in charge of it before that
"incident" caused by Master Fu!

05:40.740 --> 05:43.640
- How did you find me?
- Our staffs hold compasses

05:43.740 --> 05:46.110
that allow the boxes
to be tracked at all times.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.510
Hey, that's not fair!
Why didn't I get a staff?

05:48.610 --> 05:51.180
Precisely because
you are not a true guardian!

05:51.280 --> 05:54.350
This is all a misunderstanding.
The shape of the box proves it!

05:54.450 --> 05:57.280
But... I don't get it!
Master Fu entrusted it to me!

05:57.350 --> 06:00.820
Fu? As in "Wang Fu", also known
as "Whiny Chicken Leg"?

06:00.920 --> 06:04.320
That incompetent disciple unable
to spend one day without eating,

06:04.390 --> 06:05.660
or do finger push-ups?

06:06.030 --> 06:07.830
Fu should never have been
a guardian!

06:07.900 --> 06:09.730
That low-life
never lived up to the hopes

06:09.830 --> 06:12.370
- that were placed in him!
- He may have made mistakes

06:12.470 --> 06:15.340
when he was young, but
he protected the Box for years!

06:15.440 --> 06:18.170
He even sacrificed himself
and erased his own memory

06:18.240 --> 06:21.540
to save us! And now,
he's become a great painter!

06:21.640 --> 06:25.450
That old man
is Whiny Chicken Leg? Wait...

06:27.980 --> 06:31.550
- Some kwamis are missing.
- When Fu gave me the Box,

06:31.690 --> 06:34.690
he already lost Nooroo, Duusuu,
and their Miraculous,

06:34.790 --> 06:38.390
- the Butterfly and the Peacock!
- He's lost some Miraculous too?

06:38.490 --> 06:40.830
He's even more incompetent
than I thought!

06:41.560 --> 06:44.160
Plagg!
Young girl, where is Plagg?

06:44.230 --> 06:46.600
That I know!
Cat Noir is his holder!

06:46.700 --> 06:49.900
- And who is Cat Noir?
- Well, I don't know,

06:50.010 --> 06:53.310
since we're supposed to keep
our identities secret!

06:55.740 --> 06:58.040
So, this is the modern world,

06:58.150 --> 07:00.450
protected by
a group of careless fools!

07:00.580 --> 07:03.920
Guardians must never wear
Miraculous! Some jewels missing

07:04.020 --> 07:05.750
and Plagg roaming free?

07:05.890 --> 07:07.750
The end of dinosaurs
and dragons...

07:07.890 --> 07:09.420
Doesn't that alarm anyone?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.730
That's enough!
Kwamis, get in yin-yang pairs

07:12.830 --> 07:14.260
and back inside the Box.

07:18.270 --> 07:19.970
What are you doing?

07:21.240 --> 07:24.570
Let me remind you about some
of the precepts you have broken.

07:24.670 --> 07:28.110
Precept 14. Kwamis
must not live outside the Box.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.950
Precept 52. Guardians
must never lose a Miraculous.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.150
Precept 133. A guardian cannot,
under any circumstances,

07:36.250 --> 07:37.680
wear a Miraculous!

07:38.520 --> 07:40.590
But Master Fu wore one himself!

07:40.660 --> 07:43.590
Precisely! That just proves
what I've been saying all along.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.660
Neither you nor Fu
were up to the role of guardian.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.930
You have not respected
the ancient rules of our Order.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.600
Not to mention that no child
should be a keeper of kwamis.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.840
They are ultra-powerful
cosmic entities!

07:55.940 --> 08:00.670
One must manage them with
authority, which you cannot do!

08:00.780 --> 08:02.380
<i> En garde, my lord!</i>

08:02.480 --> 08:05.510
Challenging me is akin to
pulling on the tiger's whiskers,

08:05.650 --> 08:08.920
- you villain!
- Whoa! Easy, there! Calm down!

08:08.980 --> 08:12.320
- It's just a movie! See?
- Such a powerful spell!

08:12.450 --> 08:14.690
How did that warrior end up
in this prison

08:14.790 --> 08:16.190
of glass and metal?

08:16.290 --> 08:17.860
Anyway,
we must waste no more time!

08:17.960 --> 08:19.990
Take me to Cat Noir, young lady!

08:20.130 --> 08:21.760
Do you think
this is a good idea?

08:21.830 --> 08:24.000
I don't know. It might be best
to do as he says.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.030
After all,
he is the Celestial Guardian!

08:27.170 --> 08:28.470
I guess you're right.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.810
Tikki, spots on!

08:48.660 --> 08:50.390
What are you doing
to your weapon?

08:50.490 --> 08:53.360
Well, this is my Bugphone,
to talk to Cat Noir.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.360
You don't have to send doves
to communicate with each other?

08:56.470 --> 08:59.670
<i>We are not out of the woods yet,</i>
<i> my lord!</i>

09:05.990 --> 09:08.490
Hello, Milady!
Is this the wonderful guest

09:08.560 --> 09:12.860
- you mentioned in your message?
- Of course. Another child.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.530
- Cat Noir, this is --
- I am Grand Master Su-Han,

09:15.630 --> 09:17.370
the Celestial Guardian
of the Box!

09:17.470 --> 09:19.970
What? Aren't you
supposed to be the Guardian?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.870
When the lion speaks,
the cub listens!

09:22.310 --> 09:25.240
First off, you two are going to
hand over your Miraculous to me.

09:25.340 --> 09:29.010
What? That's a bad joke!
And I know all about bad jokes!

09:29.110 --> 09:30.410
But we can't do that!

09:30.520 --> 09:31.880
How will we defeat Shadow Moth

09:31.980 --> 09:33.250
without our Miraculous?

09:33.350 --> 09:35.090
I will reassign them

09:35.220 --> 09:37.690
to carefully selected adults,

09:37.790 --> 09:40.360
like any rightful,
responsible guardian would do.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.190
We can't just give
our Miraculous

09:42.260 --> 09:44.060
to some guy who just showed up!

09:44.200 --> 09:46.400
I... I don't know.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.770
The kwamis confirmed that he is
the real original guardian.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.500
Maybe Grand Master Su-Han is
right and Master Fu was wrong.

09:53.570 --> 09:56.710
Maybe that's the reason why
we can't defeat Shadow Moth.

09:56.810 --> 09:59.210
That's ridiculous!
You've always delivered!

09:59.310 --> 10:01.480
Trust yourself, Ladybug,
like I trust you.

10:01.580 --> 10:04.410
If I have to give my Miraculous
back, then fine, I will.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.050
But only if you ask me to.
You're the only guardian here.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.960
Then it's settled. Order him
to give you his Miraculous

10:12.060 --> 10:16.690
and let's be done with this.
Then I'll retrieve the Box.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.300
But if I do it,
won't my memories get erased?

10:21.530 --> 10:23.630
Does that mean
you won't remember me?

10:28.810 --> 10:31.780
You want my ring?
Then come and get it!

10:32.110 --> 10:34.740
- Fine.
- Cat Noir, calm down!

10:34.810 --> 10:37.850
That's a guardian!
We'll find a solution!

10:39.850 --> 10:42.590
Why do you think guardians study
for so many years?

10:42.650 --> 10:45.090
Just to hand the Miraculous
out to whomever?

10:45.160 --> 10:48.990
No! We are specially trained to
overpower the Miraculous holders

10:49.090 --> 10:52.130
who have gone rogue, like you!
Celestial Storm!

10:52.230 --> 10:55.770
The Thousand Fists of the Yama
bring the Nefarious One down!

10:58.470 --> 11:02.970
- Master Fu was much nicer!
- His mirakung-fu was worse!

11:07.250 --> 11:10.980
Grand Master! The last I heard,
I was the Guardian.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.850
And I say that Cat Noir keeps
his Miraculous and I keep mine!

11:15.150 --> 11:18.760
Insolent subordinate!
Stream of Justice!

11:18.820 --> 11:21.620
Blows rain down and submerges
the Enemy Armies!

11:22.090 --> 11:24.990
I don't know how, but he's
guessing our moves in advance!

11:25.100 --> 11:27.130
(Battle cries)

11:27.230 --> 11:29.600
My mirakung-fu is like water,
it adapts

11:29.670 --> 11:31.230
and it finds its way anywhere.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.410
And you are barely afloat at
the mercy of the river current!

11:38.910 --> 11:39.980
Ugh!

11:41.110 --> 11:42.750
Cat Noir, grab his staff!

11:45.020 --> 11:46.820
The claws of the cat
are powerless

11:46.890 --> 11:49.390
against the milkman's iron pot!

11:53.530 --> 11:56.230
<i> - En garde, my lord!</i>
- Has the warrior escaped?

11:58.130 --> 11:59.360
- Got it!
- What?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.060
Bye-bye!

12:12.540 --> 12:17.510
If you challenge the clouds,
you will face the thunder!

12:19.620 --> 12:22.520
I feel a mixture
of mysterious emotions.

12:23.050 --> 12:26.890
A scorned authority...
A confused man, defeated...

12:26.990 --> 12:31.030
But most of all,
an anger ready to explode!

12:32.160 --> 12:35.930
Fly away, my evil akuma,
and let the lava of punishment

12:36.030 --> 12:38.540
erupt from his volcanic heart!

12:47.150 --> 12:52.220
Argh! If I still had my staff,
I'd hunt you down in no time!

12:53.490 --> 12:54.480
Fu!

12:58.820 --> 13:00.790
Hand over your staff!

13:00.930 --> 13:03.590
- You don't deserve it anyway!
- Have you lost your mind?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.090
Leave my partner alone!

13:07.900 --> 13:10.070
An akuma! Whirlwind of Wisdom!

13:10.140 --> 13:12.300
The Virtuous Wind
resists the Temptation!

13:12.640 --> 13:14.570
My anger is mine,
but I am not my anger.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.410
My anger is mine,
but I am not my anger.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.080
Enough! Fool, you're making me
lose precious time.

13:27.190 --> 13:30.090
Marianne! Are you OK?

13:31.790 --> 13:33.490
Where do you think you're going?

13:33.590 --> 13:35.330
You will apologise to my partner

13:35.430 --> 13:37.130
and give my cane back at once,

13:37.230 --> 13:39.300
- you boor!
- Oh...

13:39.400 --> 13:41.730
everything is not lost
after all.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.870
Turn around, my little akuma!

13:49.240 --> 13:53.340
- Fu, we meet again!
- Do I know you?

13:53.480 --> 13:56.150
Furious Fu, I am Shadow Moth.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.180
That heartless thief
has disrespected

13:58.320 --> 13:59.550
you and your partner.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.650
I'm giving you the power
to make him pay!

14:01.750 --> 14:03.620
Show him who is in charge!

14:03.720 --> 14:07.260
All I ask in return are Ladybug
and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

14:07.830 --> 14:10.930
Could you repeat that once more?
I didn't catch all of it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.760
(Sighs) Do you want to get
revenge on this man

14:13.830 --> 14:16.600
- and get your cane back?
- Do I ever!

14:16.670 --> 14:18.230
Then let's proceed!

14:24.980 --> 14:26.410
(Gasps)

14:27.010 --> 14:29.010
Which way did he go?

14:29.110 --> 14:31.150
My love, please,
it's not worth it!

14:31.250 --> 14:33.950
That reckless toad will not spit
in the dragon's face

14:34.020 --> 14:35.320
without apologising!

14:38.460 --> 14:39.560
Find!

14:47.680 --> 14:49.280
at do we do?
Should we hide it?

14:49.350 --> 14:51.280
And then what?
He knows who I am anyway.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.820
He knows where I live!

14:52.920 --> 14:54.420
Ladybug! Cat Noir!

14:54.490 --> 14:56.590
Give me the Box
and your Miraculous!

14:56.960 --> 14:58.590
Return them to the right hands!

14:58.660 --> 15:01.230
Hey! That's Master Fu's cane!

15:03.030 --> 15:05.570
I want my cane! And an apology!

15:08.500 --> 15:09.800
Thunderbolt!

15:17.680 --> 15:19.750
- Give it!
- Never!

15:27.990 --> 15:30.420
Furious Fu! Bring me that box!

15:47.680 --> 15:49.040
Goal!

15:50.810 --> 15:51.840
Hey!

15:55.480 --> 15:57.020
Teleportation!

16:04.830 --> 16:06.760
1-0, Ladybug!

16:06.860 --> 16:09.700
Red card! He touched
the ball with his hand!

16:20.980 --> 16:23.780
No! Higher! Watch out!

16:23.880 --> 16:25.550
No, not like that!

16:25.650 --> 16:29.080
You're so slow!
Come on! Not that way!

16:31.090 --> 16:33.720
Hey, Bossy Pants, would it
kill you to help us out here?

16:34.090 --> 16:36.260
Mirakung-fu
is designed to neutralise

16:36.360 --> 16:39.060
rebellious Miraculous holders,
not to fight villains

16:39.160 --> 16:40.890
created through magic.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.300
So we're supposed to
fix your mistakes?

16:44.870 --> 16:46.570
Phantom Palms of the Awakened!

16:46.670 --> 16:50.000
The wise man moves mountains
without touching them!

16:51.170 --> 16:52.810
You're next.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.010
The Hundred Thousand
Dragon Talons!

17:00.080 --> 17:02.280
The Pagoda-Breaker Iron Feet!

17:02.380 --> 17:05.020
The Rage of the Centipede
with Ingrown Nails!

17:05.490 --> 17:07.620
Statue! Finally!

17:07.720 --> 17:10.820
Well done, Furious Fu!
Now you must keep your word

17:10.960 --> 17:13.290
and bring me Ladybug
and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

17:13.400 --> 17:16.560
Very well! So, I have to take
the wingless bat's bell, right?

17:16.630 --> 17:21.500
- No, not his bell! His ring!
- I am not a wingless bat!

17:21.840 --> 17:24.240
Cat Noir, wait!
We'll never defeat him.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.970
- What?
- We just need him

17:26.070 --> 17:29.010
- not to defeat us either!
- You lost me!

17:29.140 --> 17:32.110
- I must make a call! Cover me!
- That I can do!

17:37.620 --> 17:39.420
The kitten
can miaow all he wants,

17:39.490 --> 17:42.520
but he will never
roar like the tiger!

17:44.630 --> 17:46.490
Lucky charm!

18:01.640 --> 18:02.840
Perfect!

18:08.650 --> 18:10.180
What is she up to?

18:16.320 --> 18:17.360
Vision!

18:22.530 --> 18:25.670
Oh, so this is
your silly little plan?

18:25.770 --> 18:27.700
I know what you gonna do!

18:31.010 --> 18:32.000
We're not done yet!

18:38.180 --> 18:39.710
Cataclysm!

18:39.810 --> 18:41.580
No!

18:43.890 --> 18:46.420
You're going to turn yourself
into cat food!

18:46.650 --> 18:50.090
Take this! And that!

18:54.130 --> 18:56.560
There! Voilà! We win!

18:56.660 --> 18:59.230
Win? You foolish beetle!
We're just stuck, now!

18:59.330 --> 19:01.530
I can't defeat you,
but you can't defeat me!

19:01.640 --> 19:04.770
Oh, but my plan was
never to defeat you myself!

19:04.910 --> 19:06.910
Sorry, I need to borrow that.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.940
There, exactly like you said
on the phone, Ladybug!

19:12.050 --> 19:14.580
Thank you, Marianne!
That was perfect!

19:14.950 --> 19:17.250
No more evil-doing
for you, little akuma!

19:21.090 --> 19:23.160
Time to de-evilise!

19:26.690 --> 19:27.660
Gotcha!

19:29.200 --> 19:30.930
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

19:33.430 --> 19:36.340
Miraculous Ladybug!

19:40.910 --> 19:42.780
- Pound...
- Oops! sorry!

19:44.910 --> 19:46.110
Pound it!

19:54.120 --> 19:57.160
Here. Carry this
with you at all times.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.090
It will protect you
from attacks.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.590
And it will remind me
of you every day!

20:01.660 --> 20:03.800
Thank you,
Lady Beetle and Mister Bat.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.230
(Laughs)

20:05.300 --> 20:06.400
I'm terribly sorry.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.140
Forgive me, Whiny Ch... Uh! Sir!

20:09.800 --> 20:13.870
I... I mistook you for someone
who has been long gone.

20:14.810 --> 20:17.440
Don't worry about it.
It's already forgotten.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.280
Be careful with your Magic Box,
Guardian of the Miraculous,

20:24.350 --> 20:26.790
you wouldn't want
to lose it again.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.230
The Bat and the Red Beetle
were incredible.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.130
Paris is always filled
with people

20:34.200 --> 20:36.630
ready to devote themselves
for the greater good.

20:36.730 --> 20:40.270
- Like you, Marinette!
- You should thank Marianne.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.670
From what I heard, she was
the true superhero of the day!

20:47.810 --> 20:50.680
Involving Marianne in the fight,
a human without powers,

20:50.780 --> 20:53.850
was against the precepts too!
This has proven two things...

20:53.950 --> 20:57.180
First, you have the audacity
to invent your own rules!

20:57.290 --> 21:00.990
And as crazy as it may seem,
somehow they all work!

21:02.160 --> 21:05.960
Second, your natural instincts
tell you who can trust,

21:06.030 --> 21:08.160
an essential quality
for a guardian.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.930
Whiny Chicken...
Sorry, Master Fu

21:11.030 --> 21:14.300
may not have made
such a bad choice after all.

21:14.370 --> 21:17.340
The Miracle Box
is the mother of all boxes.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.410
It's the very first one
that was created

21:19.510 --> 21:22.210
and the one that holds
the most powerful magic jewels.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.840
I cannot imagine
what would happen if it fell

21:24.950 --> 21:27.050
into the wrong hands.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.910
But I am going to trust you.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.720
I'll watch you from a distance.

21:32.820 --> 21:37.460
But be weary. One failure
and I'll take the Box back.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.860
I will make the most
of my time here in Paris

21:41.930 --> 21:43.630
to get accustomed
to modern life.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.430
How can I be a good guardian

21:45.530 --> 21:47.700
if I don't try to understand
the world around me?

21:47.770 --> 21:50.500
Thank you, Master.
I have something for you too!

21:50.570 --> 21:52.610
I think you're gonna need these!

21:56.510 --> 21:58.480
(Laughter)

22:01.550 --> 22:02.230
(Miraculous theme)
