1
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,706
Ooh. Minion!

2
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:04,999
Freeze! AVL!

3
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,502
Hey! Hey!

4
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,470
- Stop right there!
- Grab her!

5
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,641
Oh. Ah!

6
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,844
- Yeah, baby!
- Attention, all units.

7
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:22,549
Whoa!

8
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,919
Look out!

9
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,888
- You like that?
- Hey!

10
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,528
Repeating, all units,
villain is heading westbound...

11
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,604
Ooh, baby!

12
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,340
The Anti-Villain League
can't catch this.

13
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:49,442
Guess who stole the map.

14
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,582
Hallelujah!

15
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,921
Yeah! I got this.

16
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,861
Good work.

17
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,033
The map to the legendary
Zodiac Stone.

18
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,970
We will become the most
powerful villains in the world.

19
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,439
Okay, let's get a move on.

20
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,374
We leave for Asia tonight.

21
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,805
Okay, let's see here.

22
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,529
I'm in.

23
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,858
Hello, beautiful.

24
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,074
Whoa!

25
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,641
What?

26
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,782
Oh.

27
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,943
Ha ha! Yes!

28
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:38,645
The Zodiac Stone.

29
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,016
Whoa.

30
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,125
Soon, the power
of these unstoppable beasts

31
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,094
will be ours.

32
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,535
Ah, for crying out loud.

33
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,945
Oh.

34
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,881
Whoa.

35
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,818
Whoa.

36
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:30,164
Hurry up. I got a bunch of
deadly tchotchkes on my tail.

37
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,166
Roger that on the copy.

38
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,567
Step on it, sister.

39
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,043
Hurry up! Come on!

40
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,914
Off! Off!

41
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,756
I got it. I got the stone.

42
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,358
Party's over, old man.

43
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,861
The Vicious Six has
a new head honcho.

44
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:04,631
You just got played
for a sucker!

45
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,234
Whoa! Hold on.
I started this group.

46
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,070
We're a team.

47
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,771
Where's your loyalty?

48
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,740
Oh, please. We're villains.

49
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,641
There's no such thing.

50
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,944
It's time
for the next generation.

51
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:37,158
<i>Quiet down, class.</i>

52
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:40,294
<i>Quiet down, class.</i>

53
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,030
People, people.

54
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,698
So, what do you want to be

55
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,210
- when you grow up?
- Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

56
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,737
- Samantha.
- I want to be a doctor.

57
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,005
- Wonderful.
- Oh, oh!

58
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:51,872
Bradley.

59
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,207
I want to be a teacher.

60
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,042
No, you do not.

61
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,777
- Ooh! Me, me!
- Yes.

62
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,913
I want to be a fireman
who is also the president

63
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,081
and-and also drives race cars.
Yeah.

64
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:02,917
Exciting.

65
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,219
And what about you, Gru?

66
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,254
Gru?

67
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:09,223
Me?

68
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,326
I want to be...

69
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,229
a supervillain.

70
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,865
Supervillain?

71
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,800
- Supervillain.
- Loser!

72
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,508
- Kelly!
- Daddy!

73
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,077
- Brett!
- Mom!

74
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,345
Gru!

75
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,013
Kiss-a la mama!

76
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:36,250
Oh. My favorite tiny relatives.

77
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,453
Eh, oh, no. Guys, come on.

78
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,488
Hey.

79
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,824
I got an image to uphold here.

80
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,962
Okay.

81
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,863
Hey, are you guys pumped
for the movie?

82
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,199
Let's go!

83
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,397
Oh, no!

84
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,182
Shark! A shark!

85
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,514
Oh!

86
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,049
I am a pinball wizard.

87
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,954
Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish. Swish.

88
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,389
Swish. Swish.

89
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,924
Swish. Swish. Swish. Swish.

90
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,131
- Bello. -Bello.
- Bello.

91
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,867
- Bello. Bello.
- Bello. -Bello.

92
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,541
Everything you got.

93
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,209
A little more. Come on.

94
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,012
Put some of
those sprinkles on there.

95
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,815
I like those sprinkles.

96
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,386
Cheese-Ray! Cheese-Ray!

97
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,855
Cheese-Ray!

98
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,824
Don't cheese me, bro.

99
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,097
Pank you!

100
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,935
Mmm!
So creamy, so delicious.

101
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,604
Worth every calorie.

102
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,040
Ah, mmm!

103
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,614
Bills, magazines,

104
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,416
S&H Green Stamps.

105
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,551
Huh?

106
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,419
Ooh!

107
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,090
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

108
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,392
Holy guacamole!

109
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,128
Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?

110
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,205
Hello, Mr. Gru.

111
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,907
We've received your application
to the world's best

112
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,377
supervillain team,
the Vicious Six.

113
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,513
A recent opening
has become available,

114
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,281
- and...
- And?

115
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,251
...your interview is tomorrow at noon.

116
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,953
Dyn-o-mite!

117
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:31,258
Please go to 417 Main Street.

118
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,129
The password is:
"You're no good."

119
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,297
"You're no good." Mm-hmm.

120
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,199
Now, get up on the down stroke,

121
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:42,369
'cause this invitation
is gonna explode, baby.

122
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,171
Explode? Oh.

123
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,540
Oh, no, no, no, no!

124
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,181
Oot!

125
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,482
Oot! Oot!

126
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,551
Oot! Oot!

127
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,153
Ooh. Very big news, Mom!

128
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,390
Mom?

129
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:09,696
Mom?

130
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,708
What?

131
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,744
Mom, who is this sweaty guy?

132
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,645
He's stinking up the house.

133
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,346
I thought you were
cooking cabbage.

134
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,649
He's my new guru.

135
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,455
Tell your weird buddies
they'd better start

136
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,423
pulling their weight
around here,

137
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,991
or I'm kicking them out.

138
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,161
They are killing
my mellow vibes.

139
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,733
Hey! I heard that!

140
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:54,274
Come on. Let's go tell
the troops the good news.

141
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,644
Gentlemen, to the basement,

142
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:00,347
aka our new evil lair.

143
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:05,352
This is fantastic!

144
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,755
Oh, construction
looks great, guys.

145
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:31,245
My first evil lair.

146
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,748
Goose bumps!

147
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:38,385
Well, you've got to break
a few eggs to make an omelet.

148
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,254
Am I right?

149
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,589
- Oh, great job, Ryan.
- Wh-Wh-What?

150
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,825
I said great job!

151
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,793
- Wh-What?
- Never mind.

152
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,629
Adrien, Mack, looking good.

153
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,770
Ah.

154
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:57,337
Joe, how's the family?

155
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,807
Hey. Good, good.

156
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,676
Okay, everybody, get over here.

157
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,681
Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

158
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,616
Hold on to your goggles.

159
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,352
The Vicious Six wants
to meet me.

160
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,655
Tomorrow.

161
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,292
Mini-Boss!

162
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,093
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

163
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,796
All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

164
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:23,430
Please stop calling me that.

165
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,733
And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

166
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,305
Hello, Otto. What is it?

167
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,475
Blah, blah, blah.

168
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,745
Uh-huh. Well, th-that...

169
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,246
Yes, I...

170
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,416
Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,818
I... Okay.

172
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,319
You know what would be fun?

173
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,187
Let's play the quiet game.

174
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,222
Oh, oh! The quiet game! Si, si!

175
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,126
Anyway, thanks for
the hard work today, everyone.

176
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,329
I got to go get some rest.

177
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,165
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of my life.

178
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,300
Watch out, world.

179
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,636
Here comes Gru!

180
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,672
- Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!
- I'm not...

181
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,508
Mini-Boss! Mini-Boss!

182
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,748
Oh!

183
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,925
Oh, these guys are the best.

184
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,659
I can't believe it.

185
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,631
Uh, Mini-Boss?

186
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,702
Yeah, I get it, but I need

187
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,871
a good night's sleep,
so get out.

188
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,238
Oh.

189
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,376
Okay, fine, fine.

190
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,745
Because you had a nightmare.

191
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,748
But just tonight.

192
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,753
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

193
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,791
Uh, uh, excuse-a.

194
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,394
Oh, really? You, too?

195
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,896
- Mm-hmm.
- Get in.

196
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:06,299
- Good night.
- Good night.

197
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,970
Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

198
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,538
- Good night!
- Oh!

199
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,509
Oh, I just want
to get some sleep.

200
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,949
Breaking news:
The Vicious Six is ready

201
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,952
to rewrite the rules
of villainy.

202
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,620
Villains of the world,

203
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,257
in three days,
when the clock strikes midnight

204
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,526
and the Chinese New Year begins,

205
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,463
this bad boy's power is
gonna be unleashed.

206
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,833
With the power of the Zodiac,

207
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:42,536
we're gonna take out
the Anti-Villain League.

208
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,306
And the Vicious Six will be

209
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,342
the most powerful villains
on the planet.

210
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,379
Can you dig it?

211
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,515
Do I dig it? Do I dig it?

212
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,752
I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

213
00:16:57,785 --> 00:17:00,320
They thought they could
leave me for dead, huh?

214
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,724
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat?

215
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:05,492
Oh, they got no idea
what's coming.

216
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,730
- Um...
- Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

217
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:10,473
- for what they've done to me.
- Uh, Mr. Knuckles?

218
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,866
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mr. Knuckles.

219
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,300
What?

220
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,577
We, uh, just wanted to make sure

221
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,403
we'd be getting paid this week.

222
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,905
What a mouth on you.

223
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,807
I'm paying you with knowledge.

224
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:21,508
You are? Oh!

225
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,678
Lesson one: Always be prepared.

226
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:30,484
Lesson two: The Belgian
five-armed nose pick.

227
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:34,922
And lesson three:
The Lithuanian haircut.

228
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,807
That's worth
all the money in the world.

229
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,408
Hey, guys, forget about it.

230
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,633
You're gonna get paid.

231
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,536
But first, we got to get
my stone back.

232
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,514
Yee-haw!

233
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,433
Guys!

234
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,671
Oh, you want to come.

235
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,040
Yeah.

236
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,942
Right, right.

237
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:30,077
Okay.

238
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,679
When you guys tracked me down

239
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:35,850
and responded
to my "help wanted" ad...

240
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,487
<i>...I was like,
"Who are these tiny tater tots?</i>

241
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,656
<i>And where did they get
so much denim?"</i>

242
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,599
<i>And you just wouldn't quit.</i>

243
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,716
All right, I surrender.

244
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,483
Come on in.

245
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,356
Huh?

246
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,593
We've had some great times
since then,

247
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,596
but the thing is,
the Vicious Six,

248
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,032
they're the big leagues,

249
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:28,135
and you guys are...

250
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,805
great, and so...

251
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,141
Uh, the job you did
on the lair...

252
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,177
A-plus.

253
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,779
It's just,
what I was thinking is that

254
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:41,749
there are a lot of
other villains in the world.

255
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,117
You know?

256
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,052
Uh...

257
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:49,589
Never mind.

258
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:53,027
Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

259
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,495
See you later, alligators.

260
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,167
Uh, Kevin? Kevin!

261
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:11,611
Uh, Ot-Ot-Otto. O-Otto.

262
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,763
Go, go, go!

263
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,469
Hey, I'm walking here!

264
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,639
Wow!

265
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,576
Ooh! Here we go.

266
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,080
Oh!

267
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:56,190
Excuse me. Sir?

268
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:01,695
I was just wondering
if you're... no good.

269
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,498
You're good. My mistake.

270
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,136
Oh, oh. Oh, sorry.

271
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,838
I didn't mean to scare you.

272
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:14,541
I was just, uh, trying out
this new invention of mine.

273
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:17,510
I call it Sticky Fingers.

274
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,512
Or Smart Goo.

275
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,249
I-I haven't quite landed
on the name yet.

276
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:23,951
Come here.

277
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,890
I overheard you were looking
for something...

278
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:31,524
special.

279
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,961
Ah, yes. I was hoping...

280
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:36,864
you're no good.

281
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,736
I think you'll enjoy listening

282
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:44,905
in booth three.

283
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:47,742
Right this way.

284
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,013
Aha!

285
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:02,189
This is it. Mum's the word.

286
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,690
Keep it down. Good luck.

287
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,092
Let 'em have it, son.

288
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,560
Thanks, Mister...

289
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,263
Nefario.

290
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:12,665
That's Dr. Nefario.

291
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,835
- Here, take this.
- Uh...

292
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,771
If you ever get famous,
remember who gave you

293
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:18,538
your first gadget.

294
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,574
Okay.

295
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,587
Try backwards.

296
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,323
Ah.

297
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:41,328
Welcome to the Vicious Six.

298
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:42,897
Whoa.

299
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,866
That is pretty... Whoa!

300
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,578
Hello.

301
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,054
Everybody here
for the interview?

302
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:08,989
Me, too.

303
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,092
So, what do you guys got
going on later?

304
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,359
Are you up to no good?

305
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:15,096
You gonna get
into some mischief?

306
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay.

307
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,936
Send the first one in.

308
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,905
They're ready
to see you, Mr. Gru.

309
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:26,307
Oh, good.

310
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,708
Great.

311
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh...

312
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:01,775
Distinguished villains,

313
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,111
my name is Gru.

314
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,847
I feel like I'm talking too loud

315
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:09,783
even though our proximity

316
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,786
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

317
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,161
If you told me when I was ten

318
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,796
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

319
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,899
of my favorite villain ever,

320
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,368
Wild Knuckles, I would say,

321
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,270
"You got rocks in your head."

322
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,972
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

323
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,441
it makes a lot more sense.

324
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,911
All right, who let the kid in?

325
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:39,246
I thought he was a tiny man.

326
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,482
What's wrong with you?

327
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:46,921
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

328
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:48,189
Um, yes.

329
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:50,357
I-I am pretty despicable.

330
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:52,493
You don't want to cross me.

331
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,396
Evil is for adults

332
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:59,500
who steal powerful
ancient stones and wreak havoc.

333
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,437
And not for tubby little punks

334
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,241
who should be at school,
learning,

335
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,276
taking a recess,

336
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,045
sucking his thumb.

337
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:13,847
"Sucking his..."

338
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,751
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

339
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:20,254
Who's next?

340
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,990
I am Wing Man,

341
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,392
the next member
of the Vicious Six.

342
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:28,996
Behold, the power of flight!

343
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:34,001
All right, joke's over.

344
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,936
Showtime.

345
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,242
This is a big one.

346
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,278
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,846
To the left. That's right.

348
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,265
Bring him in,
bring him in, boys.

349
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,767
Everybody pile on!

350
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,137
He took the stone!

351
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,340
I'll get him!

352
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,842
Oh! Ah!

353
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,545
Lock down the building.

354
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,519
Oh! Oh!

355
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:28,155
- Huh?
- What? -Uh...

356
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:31,158
Nothing to see here.

357
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,993
- Oh.
- Oh, look at you.

358
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:35,262
<i>Frampton Comes Alive!</i>
Nice choice.

359
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:38,966
I...

360
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:42,336
Just keep walking.

361
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,547
Who the heck is that? A kid?

362
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,451
Oh, guys.

363
00:26:57,484 --> 00:26:59,553
- Bello.
- Mini-Boss!

364
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,488
What are you doing here?

365
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,591
Okay, just get on.

366
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,460
Which way did he go?

367
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:07,895
There's that little thief!

368
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:09,596
Go! Go, go, go!

369
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,899
Split up!

370
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,549
Knock, knock. Delivery.

371
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,097
That demon child!

372
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,407
Otto, take the stone
back to the lair.

373
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,899
I'll distract them.

374
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,901
Go! Go, go, go!

375
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,006
Uh, uh... Ooh!

376
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,245
Oh, not now.

377
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,381
Come on, come on!

378
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,386
Oh!

379
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:21,034
Yeah, baby.

380
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,206
I'll handle this.

381
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:34,515
Hope you enjoy the rest
of your short life.

382
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,049
Please work.

383
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,652
Come on, come on, come on!

384
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:42,523
Yay!

385
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,500
We're coming for you, tiny man.

386
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:56,069
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

387
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,477
Josh, pump it up.

388
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,645
Up, up, up!

389
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:13,987
They all said the kid
couldn't be a real villain.

390
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,556
Well...

391
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,325
this kid just stole something

392
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:21,695
from the worst villains
in the world.

393
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:27,034
When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say...

394
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:31,071
"We have made
a terrible mistake.

395
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,540
Please join us. Please, Gru."

396
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:36,210
And I will say, "Yes!

397
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:40,647
I will be the newest member
of the Vicious Six."

398
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,650
Now all I need is Otto.

399
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,085
Where is Otto?

400
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,553
Uh, uh, Otto le come-ay.

401
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,088
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

402
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,157
He needs to "come-ay" now.

403
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,463
- Otto!
- Mini-Boss!

404
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,766
There you are.

405
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,534
Ah. You got it?

406
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:08,141
Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?

407
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:10,644
Otto, where is the stone?

408
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:12,780
Le scone? Ah, si, le scone.

409
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:15,182
Ooh...

410
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,666
Over there.

411
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,471
<i>Oh, no!</i>

412
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:51,418
Oh.

413
00:31:02,229 --> 00:31:04,665
Mi amor. Mi amor.

414
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:09,704
I... love... you.

415
00:31:23,183 --> 00:31:24,284
Huh?

416
00:31:25,485 --> 00:31:29,222
Did you just trade my future

417
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:31,592
for a Pet Rock?!

418
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,828
Uh... si?

419
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:35,329
Okay.

420
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:38,131
Otto, where was
this birthday party?

421
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:40,367
Uh, uh...

422
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,638
This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

423
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,574
I told you guys
that you weren't ready

424
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,644
for the big leagues,
and you have proven me correct.

425
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,816
All you do is mess
everything up.

426
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:57,317
Up? Pump it up!

427
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,289
No play-a music a! Ah!

428
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,893
My mom was right.

429
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,228
You do not belong here.

430
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,497
You're fired!

431
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,701
I'm going to find that stone.

432
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:17,170
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

433
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,505
Mini-Boss...

434
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:21,208
And, Otto, close your yapper!

435
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,710
Oh.

436
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:25,913
Josh.

437
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:27,514
Si, si.

438
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,290
Uh, Gru.

439
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:38,893
Por favor. Por favor.

440
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:41,929
Kevin, no.

441
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:43,898
I will be better off on my own.

442
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:29,443
Mini-Boss!

443
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,246
Oh, no.

444
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,616
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

445
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,452
I thought you'd be impressed.

446
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,822
Could I just speak
to Belle Bottom? She'll...

447
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,261
Wild Knuckles!

448
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,831
Oh! Oh!

449
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,665
You're alive?

450
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,736
Wow. My favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

451
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,938
This could be
a great opportunity

452
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,006
if you don't kill me.

453
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,875
Shut up and give me the stone.

454
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:03,443
Oh, yes, the stone.

455
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:05,880
Here's the thing about that.

456
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,514
Kind of a funny story.

457
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:09,616
Give it to him!

458
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:15,757
And it's all going to go south

459
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,458
very quickly.

460
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,630
What the heck is this?

461
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,379
Where is it, boy?

462
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,681
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

463
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,650
I know you're hiding it
somewhere.

464
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:45,318
I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

465
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,654
Cross my heart and hope to die,
stick a needle in my eye.

466
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,056
Don't actually do that, though.

467
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,558
Somebody bring me a phone.

468
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,362
Call home.

469
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,964
It's ransom time.

470
00:34:56,998 --> 00:35:00,534
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!

471
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,369
Good one.

472
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,838
Call!

473
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:25,960
La telefono.

474
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:30,865
Huh?

475
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:39,406
Bello. La casa de Mini-Boss.

476
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,842
- Who is this?
- Kevin.

477
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:41,976
Kevin, uh, le Minion.

478
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,510
"Kevin le" what?

479
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:45,079
- Le Minion.
- You kidding me?

480
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,714
You got henchmen?

481
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:48,582
Well, that's the end of that.

482
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:50,051
M-Mini-Boss?

483
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,854
Listen, you, bring the stone
to me in San Francisco.

484
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:55,990
6830 Green Street. Got it?

485
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:59,093
Now, you got two days,
or you are never going to see

486
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:02,462
your little boss again.

487
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,598
Bello? Bello. Aah!

488
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,402
Otto...

489
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,038
Uh...

490
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,145
Ah! Okay, okay, okay.

491
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,747
Mm, hmm.

492
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Ah?

493
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:31,458
Otto...

494
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:34,694
O-Okay. Si, si.

495
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,540
Otto...

496
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:49,509
- Uh, uh, si, si.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

497
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,750
Oh?

498
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:56,984
Oh!

499
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,551
Oh, the stone!

500
00:36:58,585 --> 00:37:00,955
Uh, si.

501
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,223
Gave that to my uncle.

502
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:03,925
It's more his style.

503
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:08,628
Oh.

504
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:19,073
La-la... la stone-a!

505
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,241
K-Kevin! Kevin!

506
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:26,914
La stone-a!

507
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,718
I told you.

508
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,754
I don't know where he went,
you stupid Twinkies.

509
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,029
Uh, okay.

510
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:44,698
Uh, pank you. Eh, bye-bye.

511
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,168
Huh?

512
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:50,037
Oh, not cool, man.

513
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,084
San Pan-pisco. Oh!

514
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,167
Let's rock and roll.

515
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,869
Time to get our stone back.

516
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:24,872
We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.

517
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:26,741
Hallelujah!

518
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:33,047
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop!

519
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,551
Smash! Smash!

520
00:38:56,871 --> 00:38:59,907
Flight 1109 will now depart

521
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,176
at gate 27B.

522
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,643
Ah. Bello.

523
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,013
Uh, trey ticket-as
por San Pan-pisco.

524
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,848
San Francisco? Okay.

525
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,649
- How will you be paying?
- Ah.

526
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,152
Uh...

527
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,054
No problemo.

528
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,789
Oh, great.

529
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,357
You know, if you have
any hair balls,

530
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,326
we can upgrade you
to first class.

531
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,729
Get out.

532
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,003
So there I was.
We lost thrust in both engines,

533
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,604
and I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.

534
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,809
Ooh-la-la.

535
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,243
- Hey, Sally.
- Hey.

536
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,344
Hmm.

537
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:40,347
Ah.

538
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,259
Okay. Vamos.

539
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,199
Ooh.

540
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,240
Bello.

541
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,142
- Peanut?
- Oh. Yes, please.

542
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,743
Ah...

543
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,379
Mm. Uh, peanut.

544
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:14,715
- Peanut.
- Uh...

545
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,350
Peanut? Peanut.

546
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,818
Peanut?

547
00:40:17,852 --> 00:40:19,386
Hey, baby, peanut?

548
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,122
Ah? Ah?

549
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:22,756
Uh... aw.

550
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,726
Hey!

551
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,766
Huh?

552
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,417
Hmm?

553
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,303
Huh?

554
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:11,372
Hmm.

555
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,710
Uh, uh...

556
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,179
Ah.

557
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,714
Oh, bello!

558
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:23,050
Bello.

559
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,194
Oh, uh...

560
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:36,964
Ah.

561
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,748
You see me, you see me not.

562
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,073
You see me, you see me not.

563
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:48,108
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

564
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:10,130
No. No ha-ha.

565
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:15,970
You got real moxie, kid,
stealing from the Vicious Six.

566
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:17,504
I got moxie, really?

567
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:21,242
Did I just receive a
compliment from Wild Knuckles?

568
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:22,843
Oh, all my dreams...

569
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,845
are coming true right now!

570
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,114
Well, it's about to become
your nightmare.

571
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,850
Welcome to my newest
torture device,

572
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,152
the Disco Inferno.

573
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:39,393
Your Minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow,

574
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:42,997
because if 48 hours of disco
don't kill you,

575
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,531
the blade will.

576
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,035
No, no, no, no, no!

577
00:43:00,014 --> 00:43:01,048
Stone-a! Stone-a!

578
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,417
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

579
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,287
Stone-a!

580
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,521
Stone-a! Stone-a!

581
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:11,859
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

582
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,527
- Stone-a! Stone-a!
- Hey!

583
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,396
Stone-a! Stone-a!

584
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,934
Stone-a! Stone-a!

585
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:23,304
Stone-a! Stone-a...

586
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,912
Look-a the map-a.

587
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,049
Gru...

588
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:56,837
Bello!

589
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:07,014
Next stop, Green Street.

590
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,384
Bye-bye.

591
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:13,487
Huh?

592
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,090
Hey, hey. Look-a.

593
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:21,995
Come-ay! Come-ay!

594
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,540
Mini-Boss.

595
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,681
Stuart.

596
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:44,451
- Mini-Boss.
- No, no, no.

597
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:45,986
Okay, okay.

598
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,137
Uh, uh...

599
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,275
Okay. Go, go, go.

600
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:13,013
Hmm.

601
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:14,982
Hey. Go, go, go.

602
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:18,619
Huh?

603
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:21,688
Hey, wait a minute.

604
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:24,024
Bello.

605
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,426
Oh, no!

606
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:33,200
Trespassers!

607
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,034
Get 'em!

608
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:35,169
Hey, you. Come back here!

609
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:40,407
Go, go!

610
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,451
Kevin! Oh, okay.

611
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:12,206
Get your little butts back here!

612
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:22,349
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

613
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,224
Got you now.

614
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:33,627
Time to break some bones.

615
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:42,336
Any plans for the weekend?

616
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:51,245
Take five deep breaths.

617
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,213
I'll be right back.

618
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,315
Hey!

619
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,285
You like picking
on little guys, huh?

620
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,822
Go take a nap, old lady.

621
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:02,422
Old lady?

622
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:15,636
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

623
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:16,704
Ah.

624
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:29,516
Huh?

625
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,157
Ha-ha!

626
00:47:47,735 --> 00:47:49,871
Get lost!

627
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,844
If you come back
to our place, you're dead.

628
00:47:56,878 --> 00:47:58,545
Uh, come-ay.

629
00:48:02,683 --> 00:48:04,151
Oh, pank you.

630
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:06,119
Pank you...

631
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:09,690
You can thank me by going away.

632
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:11,158
I'm working.

633
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:13,728
...kung fu...

634
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:16,330
You want to learn kung fu?

635
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,535
Bello, chica.

636
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,537
...kung fu
por smoochie, smoochie?

637
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,539
Mm, mm.

638
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:32,679
My teaching days are over.

639
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:35,315
This is my life now.

640
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:43,223
...kung fu para...
para save-a le Mini-Boss.

641
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,459
P-Por favor.

642
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:53,567
Ai-ya.

643
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,736
Fine.

644
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:56,336
I will teach you.

645
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:01,575
Hey!

646
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:02,820
Those are not for you.

647
00:49:02,844 --> 00:49:04,411
Uh, excuse-a, excuse-a.

648
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:07,247
The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell!

649
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,664
What?!

650
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,341
Where's Gru?

651
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:35,810
Huh? How should I know?

652
00:49:35,843 --> 00:49:37,310
What's with the costumes?

653
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:39,279
Halloween was four months ago.

654
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:41,281
You look stupid. Buzz off.

655
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:42,416
Shoo!

656
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,251
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

657
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:46,420
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

658
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:47,955
Uh-uh-uh. Don't touch me.

659
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,589
Now, where's the boy?

660
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,261
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

661
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:56,964
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

662
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:58,933
We just want to...

663
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:00,701
hire him.

664
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,238
Where is he?

665
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:07,240
Wild Knuckles, San Pan-pisco.

666
00:50:07,274 --> 00:50:08,976
Wild Knuckles is alive?

667
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,012
And working with the kid.

668
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,412
- Hmm.
- Oh.

669
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:14,281
We're going to San Francisco.

670
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:16,851
Let's hit it.

671
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,524
You had better be paying
for my roof.

672
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:26,861
Ay, ay, ay.

673
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:29,997
- Ooh.
- Pretty groovy, huh?

674
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:39,473
We begin with a basic kick.

675
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:41,743
Now you.

676
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,314
Okay.

677
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:48,582
No kicking.

678
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:51,351
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

679
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:53,988
This is Fred.
He is a dummy.

680
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:56,690
Never underestimate a dummy.

681
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:59,326
- Ha. Dummy.
- Bello, Fred.

682
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,295
Now attack!

683
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,538
Stuart! Stuart!

684
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:23,316
Fred.

685
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,788
Doubt tells me
I cannot break this wood.

686
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:27,922
Uh-huh.

687
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:30,457
But doubt exists
only in the mind.

688
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,094
You know what I say to my mind?

689
00:51:35,096 --> 00:51:36,998
Now you.

690
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:38,431
Uh, uh...

691
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:39,834
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

692
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:49,110
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

693
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:09,997
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

694
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:11,966
Let's just train.

695
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:28,983
Oh, whoa, whoa,
okay, okay, okay.

696
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,495
Hoo!

697
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:49,636
- Huh?
- Rest up.

698
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,540
Tomorrow's going to be
even worse.

699
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:55,642
<i>What, you're quitting?</i>

700
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:58,012
I told you,
when I get that stone,

701
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,546
we're gonna be unstoppable.

702
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,015
I have had enough!

703
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:03,918
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

704
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,853
So long, old man!

705
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:07,420
Guys, come on.

706
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,489
We're a team.

707
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:23,170
Is this heaven?

708
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:25,006
I just had to fire my henchmen.

709
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,508
You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

710
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,477
Okay, I'm just gonna
untie you now

711
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,913
because I-I, uh...

712
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:34,882
I-I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

713
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:38,152
And it might be, you know, uh,
kind of nice to have a...

714
00:53:38,185 --> 00:53:40,054
a little company around here.

715
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,488
Oh. Oh, yeah.

716
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:44,859
Two villains
just doing some chores.

717
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:47,527
Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into?

718
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,832
What's that?
That's your evil chuckle?

719
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,634
- Obviously.
- Well, it stinks.

720
00:53:54,668 --> 00:53:56,771
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

721
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:58,906
Really?
Well, you look like a wizard

722
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,242
going through
an end-of-life crisis.

723
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:03,811
Easy there, Don Rickles.

724
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:06,446
Who's Don Rickles?

725
00:54:08,548 --> 00:54:10,718
Stone-a.

726
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,788
Stone-a.

727
00:54:16,257 --> 00:54:18,625
Stone-a!

728
00:54:20,294 --> 00:54:23,496
Stone-a...

729
00:54:27,634 --> 00:54:29,770
Dude.

730
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:31,906
Ah, I thought we lost you there
for a minute.

731
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:34,008
Hey, chill, chill,
ch-chill, ch...

732
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,846
Hey, you want to try this on,
little dude?

733
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:42,783
La stone-a!

734
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,720
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother,
where you jettin' off to?

735
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,989
...San Pan-pisco.

736
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,857
Ha! Frisco disco!

737
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,959
- Wow.
- It's your lucky day, kid.

738
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:52,927
I'm headed up the coast.

739
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,029
I could drop you off on the way.

740
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:56,964
Yee-haw!

741
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:05,840
...la stone-a!

742
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:09,542
Oh, look-a!

743
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:17,084
Huh? Hey.

744
00:55:41,674 --> 00:55:42,943
Start with the pool.

745
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:44,644
This place has got to be
spick-and-span.

746
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:45,880
What are you doing?

747
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:47,614
You look like
the overcooked turkey

748
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:49,350
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

749
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,652
Oh, God.

750
00:55:52,685 --> 00:55:54,855
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to mention,

751
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,259
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

752
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:03,663
Yeah, well, well,
doesn't scare me.

753
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,102
Be careful.
I can't have you lose an arm,

754
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:10,938
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

755
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:14,175
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

756
00:56:15,843 --> 00:56:17,912
Betsy, knock it off.

757
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,281
Hey!

758
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:22,116
Whoa! Oh, no.

759
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:27,221
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

760
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:30,758
Whoa. Help! Oh, no.

761
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,993
The net!

762
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:35,996
I got you! I got you!

763
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,933
I don't got you.

764
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:43,636
Take my hand.

765
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,240
Whoa. Whoa.

766
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:48,142
I got you!

767
00:56:57,718 --> 00:57:00,287
You could've run,
but you... but you didn't.

768
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:04,657
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

769
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:08,129
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

770
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,965
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

771
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:15,136
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

772
00:57:15,169 --> 00:57:18,272
That's all I ever wanted.

773
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:21,008
You want, uh...
I don't know, you want me...

774
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,744
you want me to teach you
a thing or two?

775
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,080
Mm-hmm-hmm!

776
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:29,717
Many fighters have asked me,

777
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,187
how did I become a great master?

778
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,889
Hey, look-a!

779
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:49,170
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

780
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:51,438
You just dig down deep,

781
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:54,441
find your inner beast, and...

782
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,049
Uh... gesundheit?

783
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:04,084
Now you try.

784
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:05,386
Uh...

785
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,102
Find your inner beast!

786
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:25,472
Stop this kick.

787
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,848
We have a lot more work to do.

788
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,845
Eh? Eh?

789
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:48,289
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

790
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,560
No, no, no, no, no!

791
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:57,331
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

792
00:59:57,364 --> 01:00:00,034
They're dead.

793
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:08,275
First rule of heists:
always stay in character.

794
01:00:08,309 --> 01:00:10,177
Got it, Grandpa.

795
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,182
Say, do you mind
if we use the john?

796
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:18,452
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

797
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:20,154
Uh-huh.

798
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,602
The Bank of Evil.

799
01:00:46,046 --> 01:00:48,015
It's showtime, kid.

800
01:00:48,048 --> 01:00:51,051
Follow my lead,
and don't forget your cue.

801
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:55,089
Hello. I, uh...
I just need to cash this.

802
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:58,025
Oh, wowie zowie!
What a big bank.

803
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:00,928
How many security guards
are in here?

804
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,262
Who's this little guy?

805
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:05,099
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

806
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:08,302
that children should be seen
and not heard.

807
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:10,037
Kids.

808
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,106
I actually have a son of my own.

809
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:14,341
He looks weird.

810
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,477
Oh, don't listen to him.

811
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,980
Your son is very, uh, cute.

812
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:21,548
Hmm.

813
01:01:21,582 --> 01:01:24,017
Oh, no!

814
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,552
Oh.

815
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:28,021
Oh, help!
I'm seeing a white light.

816
01:01:28,055 --> 01:01:31,959
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

817
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,964
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

818
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,198
Oh. Help!

819
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:41,135
Help my-my pop-pop!

820
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:43,670
Somebody help him!

821
01:01:43,705 --> 01:01:45,005
Huh?

822
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,240
My grandpa!

823
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:47,584
We need a doctor!

824
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:49,643
This is the big one.

825
01:01:49,676 --> 01:01:52,212
- Whoa!
- Oh.

826
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,115
You hear that?

827
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:57,451
It's the sweet sound of angels.

828
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:00,587
Help!

829
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:02,022
Do something!

830
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,425
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

831
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:19,173
No, no, no. The other way.

832
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:20,974
The other way.

833
01:02:24,645 --> 01:02:26,313
All right, everyone stand back.

834
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:28,282
Uh-oh.

835
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:29,675
- Clear!
- No, wait a minute. Wait.

836
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:35,055
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

837
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:36,690
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

838
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:39,426
Clear!

839
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,328
Maximum charge.

840
01:02:41,361 --> 01:02:43,063
- Clear!
- Thank you.

841
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,299
You saved my grandpa.

842
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:48,068
Uh, did we...
did we do the heist?

843
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:52,606
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

844
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:54,608
- You dropped these.
- Um...

845
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,147
Look what I got!

846
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,015
Hey. Not bad.

847
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:03,484
Not bad at all.

848
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:05,052
We make a good team.

849
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,353
We do?

850
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,489
Oh, yeah.
Hey, we got to keep at it.

851
01:03:08,522 --> 01:03:10,758
Wait till you see what
I'm gonna teach you next.

852
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:13,126
I cannot wait.

853
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,996
<i>Oh, this is gonna be fun.</i>

854
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:22,069
Mm-hmm.

855
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:45,158
Yoo-hoo. Mini-Boss.

856
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:46,761
Okay, Stuart...

857
01:03:46,794 --> 01:03:48,428
Bob...

858
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:51,031
Time to strike!

859
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:55,536
- Mini-Boss!
- Yoo-hoo.

860
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:23,564
Aah! They're not here.

861
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,465
Fan out and find them.

862
01:04:41,515 --> 01:04:43,517
Something big's going down
in Frisco.

863
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,553
Look-a. Ooh.

864
01:04:52,626 --> 01:04:55,228
- Whoo, there it is.
- Whoa.

865
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:01,468
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

866
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:02,737
Ah, dude.

867
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:05,672
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

868
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:09,576
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

869
01:05:17,919 --> 01:05:20,487
Wow.

870
01:05:24,892 --> 01:05:26,560
Oh...

871
01:05:27,795 --> 01:05:28,896
Ooh.

872
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,267
My friend, you're now

873
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,637
gonna learn from the old school.

874
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:44,712
Oh, no.

875
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:04,197
I can't believe
they did this to me!

876
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:06,934
I-I taught them
everything they know!

877
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:09,937
We were a team!

878
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:13,173
I give up.

879
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:18,780
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

880
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:21,248
and they are stupid idiots.

881
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,950
Only dream I ever had

882
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:26,319
was doing bad stuff
with my buddies.

883
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:29,824
Now look at me: old, alone.

884
01:06:29,857 --> 01:06:32,426
Well, you are old,

885
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:34,594
but you're not alone.

886
01:06:37,597 --> 01:06:38,833
All right.

887
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,768
Listen up, buster.

888
01:06:40,802 --> 01:06:42,870
We are starting a new team,

889
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:46,974
and it's going to be called
The Terrible Twos.

890
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:48,710
We can find a better name later,

891
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:52,546
but right now
we're going to find that stone

892
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:55,482
and show everybody
that you still got it.

893
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:58,418
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

894
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:00,988
It's over. Go home.

895
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:03,623
- But you said we...
- Go home!

896
01:07:43,064 --> 01:07:45,298
Come on, come on. Let's go!

897
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:49,837
Whoa!

898
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:53,540
Otto?

899
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:58,445
Otto!

900
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:00,447
- Yee-haw!
- Otto!

901
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,549
Hyah! Hyah!

902
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:04,852
Hey!

903
01:08:04,886 --> 01:08:07,420
Otto! It's Mini-Boss!

904
01:08:07,454 --> 01:08:09,056
Ah! Mini-Boss!

905
01:08:11,558 --> 01:08:13,761
- Mini-Boss!
- Otto!

906
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:16,931
Look-a! Look-a!

907
01:08:16,964 --> 01:08:19,801
Stone-a.

908
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:21,334
You found the stone.

909
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,370
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

910
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,539
Oh...

911
01:08:25,572 --> 01:08:26,941
All right,
we don't have much time.

912
01:08:26,974 --> 01:08:28,819
- We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.
- Oh, okay.

913
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:30,377
Okay.

914
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:31,946
Get him!

915
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,518
Go, go, go!

916
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:44,792
Long time, no see, punk.

917
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:49,496
I'll take that.

918
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,601
Yes!

919
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:56,804
Don't move!

920
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:58,371
- Huh?
- Right there! Freeze!

921
01:08:58,405 --> 01:09:00,041
Anti-Villain League.

922
01:09:00,074 --> 01:09:02,442
You are under arrest.

923
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:09,482
Whoa, whoa, whoa, everybody.

924
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,853
Did you forget what time it is?

925
01:09:25,565 --> 01:09:27,701
Happy New Year!

926
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,507
Fire!

927
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,798
Stand your ground.

928
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:01,401
- Look out!
- Whoa!

929
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,647
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

930
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,482
no, no, no, no, no!

931
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,585
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

932
01:10:18,618 --> 01:10:22,823
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

933
01:10:28,695 --> 01:10:31,698
Enjoy being torn apart.

934
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:34,068
Hey!
...Mini-Boss!

935
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:35,535
Guys!

936
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:38,505
Oh. Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

937
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:52,652
Oh, you thought I was serious.

938
01:10:52,686 --> 01:10:54,789
Run!

939
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:00,627
No!

940
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,099
Hello, traitors.

941
01:11:06,067 --> 01:11:08,002
Remember me?

942
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,738
You.

943
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:12,505
You can leave me for dead,

944
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:14,541
you can destroy
everything I own,

945
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:17,544
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

946
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:19,679
Oh, so you're gonna
save the kid?

947
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:22,116
Yeah, you and what army?

948
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:24,986
This army!

949
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:26,988
Okay. This army.

950
01:12:27,882 --> 01:12:30,751
<i>Dig down deep.</i>

951
01:12:30,785 --> 01:12:33,888
<i>Find your inner beast.</i>

952
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:11,959
Mmm.

953
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:52,900
Otto!

954
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,336
Hurry! Faster!

955
01:13:57,071 --> 01:13:58,739
No!

956
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:08,749
Got you.

957
01:14:12,086 --> 01:14:14,288
Go, go, go!

958
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:27,801
No.

959
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,046
Get away from him!

960
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:40,447
Destroy the kid.

961
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:51,825
Oh!

962
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:00,501
No!

963
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:04,872
Hey, hey.
How does it feel to be beaten

964
01:15:04,905 --> 01:15:07,074
by a tubby little punk?

965
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,881
You guys were amazing!

966
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:16,483
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

967
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:18,953
Obviously, you guys are rehired.

968
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:23,023
- Oh.
- Stuart!

969
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:45,246
It's all yours, sir.

970
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,947
Where do you want it?

971
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:48,482
Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

972
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,452
Oh, no.

973
01:15:51,485 --> 01:15:53,954
Wild Knuckles.

974
01:15:56,156 --> 01:15:57,558
Hey.

975
01:15:57,591 --> 01:15:59,560
Y-You're gonna be okay, right?

976
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:01,895
Don't worry about me, kid.

977
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:03,330
I'll be fine.

978
01:16:03,364 --> 01:16:04,932
Finally.

979
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:08,269
You're going away
for a long, long time.

980
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:11,305
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

981
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:13,574
No.

982
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:16,543
See you soon, kiddo.

983
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:22,549
Ooh-la-la.

984
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:54,915
Wild Knuckles was
my favorite villain.

985
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:59,019
We didn't have much time
together,

986
01:16:59,053 --> 01:17:01,021
but the time we did have,

987
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,058
I'm so grateful for.

988
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:07,394
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

989
01:17:07,428 --> 01:17:09,596
or be there for
all the terrible things

990
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,965
that I'm going to do.

991
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:14,401
And believe me,
there are gonna be

992
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:16,837
some awful things.

993
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,215
But I'm going to make you proud.

994
01:17:28,248 --> 01:17:31,552
I'm going to be
the best villain ever

995
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:33,454
because of you.

996
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:37,057
Because you taught me
what matters.

997
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:39,960
You can't do anything alone.

998
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:43,063
Find your tribe,

999
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:47,401
and never, ever let them go.

1000
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:49,269
Otto?

1001
01:17:49,303 --> 01:17:51,505
Si.

1002
01:18:34,181 --> 01:18:37,117
You better stay out
of trouble, kid.

1003
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:41,422
I will lead a good
and honest life.

1004
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,492
You're alive?

1005
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:48,061
Oh!

1006
01:18:48,730 --> 01:18:50,497
You just blew my mind.

1007
01:18:50,531 --> 01:18:51,733
How did you do that?

1008
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,569
I cannot wait
to fake my own death

1009
01:18:55,602 --> 01:18:57,471
to avoid the authorities.

1010
01:18:57,504 --> 01:18:59,173
Shoot for the moon, kid.

1011
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:00,941
Shoot for the moon.

1012
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,577
See you later, suckers!

1013
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:38,312
Sorry, we're closed.

1014
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:39,179
Whoa.

1015
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:42,449
I just wanted
to thank you for this.

1016
01:19:42,483 --> 01:19:44,351
Worked like a charm.

1017
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:46,353
All right, let me cut
to the chase here.

1018
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:48,288
I need a genius mad scientist.

1019
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:50,290
You want to come work for me?

1020
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:52,626
No, I am done with villainy.

1021
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:55,162
Off to happier horizons.

1022
01:19:55,195 --> 01:19:57,364
Goodbye, little chap.

1023
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:59,399
Por favor.

1024
01:20:09,711 --> 01:20:12,145
Oh, all right, all right.

1025
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:14,381
Fine. Stop with the face.

1026
01:20:14,414 --> 01:20:16,049
I'm in.

1027
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,452
Want to see something cool?

1028
01:20:25,392 --> 01:20:28,095
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1029
01:20:35,302 --> 01:20:38,539
Big Boss!
Big Boss! Big Boss! Big Boss!

1030
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:40,407
"Big Boss." I like that.
