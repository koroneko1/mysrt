1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,838
(Previously)

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,919
I love Phoon.

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,800
And there's no way I'll change my mind.

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,679
Give me a hug, Mom.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,399
It's only been a second, but I already miss you.

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm willing to resign.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
Boo!

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,359
Teddy's back!

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,320
Teddy actually hurried back home today!

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,118
Is there anything to eat?

11
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,439
Teddy is starving right now!

12
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,960
I'm sorry that I didn't give you a proper goodbye.

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,200
I don't think I can handle it.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,560
(Close Friend 2)

15
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,480
("Close Your Eyes and Open Your Heart. Who Do You See?")

16
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,530
Goodbye, Jedi.

17
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Should I give you a hand?

18
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,120
I was going to remove them a while ago.

19
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,719
But I left them there since you seem to like them.

20
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Mom.

21
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,520
Mom.

22
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,199
You're not going to throw them away anymore?

23
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,680
I've changed my mind. I'll keep them. It's a waste.

24
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,479
Really.

25
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,049
Hasn't he seen any movies?

26
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,839
They say it'll be easier to forget if you throw everything away.

27
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,480
Oh dear.

28
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,279
Hi, everyone.

29
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,639
I'm sorry

30
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,279
for not announcing in advance I'll be live streaming in Meta VR.

31
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,959
I really want you to see me.

32
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,839
There's an urgent matter

33
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,439
that I have to tell you,

34
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,639
my Jedi Army.

35
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,239
(Cheer up. I'm rooting for you.)

36
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,279
(I'm so disappointed. This sucks.)

37
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,920
You've probably seen the news about me two days ago.

38
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,839
I'm sorry

39
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,600
for upsetting

40
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,879
or disappointing all of you,

41
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,319
including...

42
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,680
Ray.

43
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,360
He's the guy in the photos.

44
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,240
I hurt his feelings.

45
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
He's important to me.

46
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,639
I don't know

47
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,480
if Ray's watching this live stream.

48
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,279
But I want to let him know

49
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,160
that I'm very worried about him.

50
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,199
That's right.

51
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,839
Ray and I

52
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,600
are really in a relationship.

53
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,878
(- I'm so disappointed. This sucks. - Massive fail, Jedi.)

54
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,279
(Grabs popcorn...)

55
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,199
But please don't be angry with him.

56
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,240
If you're going to be angry with

57
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,560
or take it out on someone,

58
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,758
let it be me.

59
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,039
(- Oh, no... - Who is he?)

60
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,318
(I hate it %^#+*&!?)

61
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,879
I'm admitting to all my faults.

62
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,879
I understand

63
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,519
if you don't want to support me anymore.

64
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,839
But I won't lie to myself any longer.

65
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,560
In this life,

66
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,959
I can't live without Ray.

67
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,319
But now,

68
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,079
I'm about to lose him.

69
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,199
Tell me what you know about Ray and Jedi.

70
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,279
Ray and I have been friends since high school.

71
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,000
He's a lovely person and is unbelievably serious.

72
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,879
If Ray is interested in doing something, he'll do it

73
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,879
and become entirely focused on it,

74
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
especially when it comes to Jedi.

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
I think he's one of Jedi's first fans.

76
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,319
Since before Jedi was famous.

77
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,240
He actually went as far as taking a barista course

78
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
because he wanted to make Jedi's favorite coffee.

79
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,399
But I still don't understand. Does such a person actually exist?

80
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,600
He actually expected to be in a relationship with a celebrity?

81
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,960
Well, no.

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,090
I don't think Ray expected something like that.

83
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,639
Jedi probably inspired him

84
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,450
to try new things

85
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,919
and to do something different in his life.

86
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,000
A fan's love for their favorite artist

87
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,519
isn't the same kind of love people would usually think of.

88
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,679
It's about giving

89
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,679
without expecting anything in return,

90
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,360
except for getting to see your favorite artist be happy,

91
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,330
have a job, and be successful. That's all.

92
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,399
And how come there's still drama?

93
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,480
Like when a celebrity does something

94
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,639
but it doesn't go along with their fans' expectations.

95
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,279
That's it. There are no expectations.

96
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,480
But then again, there still are.

97
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,399
I think it's similar to parental love.

98
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,330
Parents expect their kids to be happy.

99
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,799
And they feel disappointed

100
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,279
when their kids misbehave.

101
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,960
But they probably won't stop loving them. They're just shocked.

102
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,480
It might take some time for them to understand

103
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,799
and adapt in order to accept.

104
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,210
Apart from his obsession with Jedi, does this guy have special skills?

105
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,799
He's good at dancing. He even used to teach it.

106
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,519
Tina, there's trouble. Jedi's doing a live stream in Meta VR.

107
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,210
By the looks of it, he seems to be doing it on both social media

108
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,450
and the fans' VR.

109
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,210
Jedi!

110
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,519
What's going on?

111
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,720
What is Aun doing?

112
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,200
Why is he letting Jedi do this?

113
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,039
I'll call him.

114
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,360
Right. Typhoon,

115
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
can you try calling Ray?

116
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,879
- Okay. - No need.

117
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Just let him be for now.

118
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,720
And let's see how far it can go.

119
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,679
- Pai. - Pai.

120
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,278
Ray, check out the front of the house.

121
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,120
- Mom? - Take a look. Have you seen it?

122
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,919
- See? - What?

123
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,879
Who's that?

124
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,960
Ray!

125
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,759
Can you come out and talk to me?

126
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,519
- Hey! - What's wrong?

127
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,440
Why did he come here?

128
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,679
Is he really at the front of the house?

129
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,399
What is he doing?

130
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,159
Oh my gosh! What's up with him?

131
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,759
Why is he here?

132
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,158
Mom, did you lock the door?

133
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,559
- Yes. - Okay.

134
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,519
How strange.

135
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,840
Come out and talk to me.

136
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,360
Please? Pretty please?

137
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Please? Okay?

138
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,360
Please, Ray?

139
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,440
Please? It won't take long.

140
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,080
Please? Please? Please?

141
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,799
Ray?

142
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,840
You're really watching.

143
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,200
Can you come down and talk to me?

144
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,759
It won't be long. Okay?

145
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
- Okay? I want to talk to you. - Stop the live stream first.

146
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,239
- What? - I don't know if it's actually you.

147
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
- Stop the live stream first. - What did you say?

148
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,440
Stop the live stream first, or I'm not going to talk to you.

149
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
Okay.

150
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,919
Were you followed?

151
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,320
I didn't see anyone.

152
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,759
How did you find out where my mom's house is?

153
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,120
I know everything when it comes to you, Mr. Ray.

154
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
You're obviously a stalker.

155
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,080
That's right. I'm a stalker.

156
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,679
Come inside. We'll get in trouble again if someone sees us.

157
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,559
Sit.

158
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,679
Sit down!

159
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay.

160
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,799
What's up with you, causing a scene in someone else's front yard?

161
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,200
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello there.

162
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,600
I remember you. Jedi Army.

163
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,399
Don't act like you're a man of the people.

164
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,240
Have a seat, okay?

165
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,200
Well, I'm happy to see you.

166
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,080
Shut it.

167
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,480
I told you. It's over between us.

168
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:39,879
But it's not over for me.

169
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,840
It has to be over.

170
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,480
Otherwise, you won't have a career, future, or fans left.

171
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,559
I don't care.

172
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,159
No, you have to.

173
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,080
Come on, Jedi. Can you stop acting like you're crazy in love already?

174
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,720
What's up with you?

175
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,639
You said we have to keep it secret because you're worried about work.

176
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,200
So why don't you care now?

177
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,799
Because it has always been what you want,

178
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,960
and...

179
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,879
I'm scared to lose you.

180
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,919
Even if I have to give everything up,

181
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,278
I'm happy to do so.

182
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
Jedi, can you not say that?

183
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,559
It's too much.

184
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
I won't be able to bear the responsibility.

185
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,600
Then don't.

186
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,159
I can't stand

187
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,240
not being myself either.

188
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
If I can't be with the person I love,

189
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,080
then why should I bother having everything else?

190
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,679
All that's left in the end

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
is just emptiness.

192
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,519
What about your fans? Jedi Army?

193
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,919
I don't want them to be disappointed.

194
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,440
That's why I don't want to lie to them anymore.

195
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm sorry

196
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,890
for making you lie as well.

197
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
You've probably been feeling uncomfortable

198
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,170
and...

199
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,519
lonely because you were left alone so often.

200
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,359
Ma'am.

201
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,519
I'm Jedi.

202
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,759
I'm Ray's boyfriend.

203
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,079
I'd like to take him back to my place.

204
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,559
I promise

205
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,200
that I'll take good care of him.

206
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,799
And I won't hurt his feelings again.

207
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,599
Jedi, why did you say that to her?

208
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,890
Do you want to go, Ray?

209
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,680
You'll probably have to talk it out with him yourself, Jedi.

210
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,359
This guy's name is Ray.

211
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,359
Hey! Jedi, why did you start streaming?

212
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,650
No! Turn it off!

213
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,599
He's my boyfriend.

214
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,119
He's short

215
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,890
and has squishy cheeks. When he smiles,

216
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,000
you can see his dimples too.

217
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,480
Let me tell you. He's very cute.

218
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,559
I just found out today

219
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,039
that he gets his cuteness from his mom.

220
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Isn't that right, ma'am?

221
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,799
You're embarrassing me.

222
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,359
Come on.

223
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,440
Stop live streaming already.

224
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,439
He's timid.

225
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,239
But he really loves to dance

226
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,169
and is a very good dancer too.

227
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,680
I've also told him

228
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,519
that he makes very good coffee.

229
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,279
But I lied.

230
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,839
He actually sucks.

231
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,079
But what I like

232
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,240
is him.

233
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,480
He always thinks that he's my true fan

234
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,519
and knows everything about me.

235
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,839
He really does.

236
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,279
But what he doesn't know

237
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,920
is that...

238
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,559
I'm also a fan of his.

239
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,480
I used to think

240
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,480
that I...

241
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,200
love him the most.

242
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,170
But today, I realized

243
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,039
that I can love him even more.

244
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,680
He always says

245
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,119
that I'm crazy in love.

246
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,480
That's right.

247
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm very crazy in love...

248
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,039
with Ray.

249
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,650
I hope I've made it clear.

250
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,239
(Jedi and Ray)

251
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,479
(Ray Jedi)

252
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,599
(Je&Ray. I like that.)

253
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,410
That's mean.

254
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:15,960
You're meaner.

255
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,720
I didn't know you had this photo.

256
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,039
I haven't seen it in ages.

257
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Cute, right?

258
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,839
Mom's here.

259
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,119
It's been a year, I think.

260
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,890
What photo album is that, Mom?

261
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,920
Photos of you when you were young.

262
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,410
Hey! No! You can't see those!

263
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,359
Then can I take a selfie with him?

264
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,480
I'm also part of Jedi Army.

265
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,720
Since when?

266
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
You've always left merchandise around the house.

267
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,079
He's quite lovely,

268
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
so I started following him.

269
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,720
Okay? Come. Let's take a selfie.

270
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,440
Well then. Let's take a photo of the three of us.

271
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
All right.

272
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,519
- You're so lovely. - One more?

273
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,720
- One more? - Yes.

274
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,680
What about me?

275
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,880
Will I be removed from this project?

276
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,640
Calm down, Milin.

277
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,599
Let's listen to the team's PR plan first.

278
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,119
The ship has sailed.

279
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,920
The spotlight is on Jedi and Ray now.

280
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,400
No one cares about me anymore.

281
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,359
I agree.

282
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,160
If we keep promoting Milin and Jedi,

283
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,920
it'll be detrimental.

284
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,758
But Pai...

285
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,079
I mean Jedi and Ray's popularity.

286
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,759
Aun, you should plan to promote the real couple

287
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,319
rather than Milin and Jedi.

288
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,798
We haven't promoted Milin much. We can still turn her around.

289
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,720
But the popularity of Jedi and Ray

290
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,440
is on the rise now.

291
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,480
Jedi's popularity

292
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,279
is winning the hearts of his fans internationally.

293
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,039
All right, Pierce.

294
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,799
You haven't finished with the song, have you?

295
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,240
I haven't. I only proposed it during our last meeting.

296
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:31,200
Well then. Change it to a solo for Jedi.

297
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,160
I also heard

298
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,279
that Ray's good at dancing, Tina?

299
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,199
That's right. I've already worked it out with the team.

300
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
We're ready to present the idea to you.

301
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,680
We're very lucky that Typhoon has all the insights.

302
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,279
So we were able to plan it swiftly.

303
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,960
After yesterday, Ray has gained almost 20,000 followers.

304
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,639
As for the comments, they're mainly positive.

305
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,759
People are showing him support and want to know him better.

306
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,318
As for the hashtag, #JediRay.

307
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,919
It's been the most trending on social media for several hours.

308
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,160
And it's still in the top ten.

309
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,640
We should turn this crisis into an opportunity.

310
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,960
Good. Let's come up with a fun beat that people can dance to.

311
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,479
And let's get Ray in the music video, Aun.

312
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,680
But...

313
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,960
What about me?

314
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,879
It's a ship pairing project.

315
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Who is going to pair with me?

316
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,279
Excuse me. I dozed off.

317
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,079
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,279
Here.

319
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,200
We'll come up with a new song.

320
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,839
Milin feat. Marc.

321
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,359
His songs are famous.

322
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,680
This is Marc?

323
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,519
That's me.

324
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,920
I like your music.

325
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,640
I think I've heard that somewhere before.

326
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,960
Who was that?

327
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,319
- Milin! - Milin!

328
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,519
Oh, Milin!

329
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,720
Milin, you forgot your bag!

330
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,839
Marc's got terrible timing.

331
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,480
People often take it out on him.

332
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,480
Then it's settled.

333
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
Well done, everyone.

334
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,839
Are you up for working on two projects?

335
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
Let's get started and not waste any more time.

336
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,599
I need the concept behind the new song this evening, Pierce.

337
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,319
Sure. I can tell you now, actually. I already have an idea.

338
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
I have an idea as well.

339
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,160
I came up with it when I talked to Typhoon yesterday.

340
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Pai and Pierce, what do you think

341
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,480
if this song is about the love

342
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
between the fans and the artist.

343
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Love

344
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,640
and expectations.

345
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,160
Secrets

346
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,240
and acceptance.

347
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,319
With love,

348
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,640
a person has a goal in life

349
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,200
and wants to become a better person.

350
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,640
Tell me. I'm waiting.

351
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,519
- Hi! - Jedi?

352
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,039
What did the company say? Were you chastised?

353
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
No, I wasn't.

354
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Mr. Ray,

355
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,960
do you have any dance shoes for rehearsal yet?

356
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,640
- Dance shoes? - Yes.

357
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,359
Why are you asking?

358
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,839
If you don't have them, then we should go shopping.

359
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,838
From now on,

360
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:01,599
you have to rehearse every day, you know?

361
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,240
Every day?

362
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,160
- Yes. - But why?

363
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,720
Well...

364
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,359
You're going to be in a music video with me.

365
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,960
- What? A music video? - Yes.

366
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,880
Congratulations.

367
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,839
What? I'll be in a music video.

368
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,758
No, I can't dance that well.

369
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,640
What should I do, Phoon?

370
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,200
You can do it. Just believe in yourself.

371
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,319
But I'm not that good at dancing.

372
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:33,359
That's right. I saw you dancing in the video Typhoon took.

373
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,440
You've definitely got some cool moves. Well done.

374
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,359
I thought you were SV5.

375
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,880
How did you get your hands on that video anyway?

376
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,798
Hey.

377
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
Come on. Is this your poker face?

378
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,200
It's the video where you were drunk.

379
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,240
You sure can move.

380
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,480
If it was Phoon, his joints would be cracking with the tiniest movement.

381
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Pierce.

382
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Just kidding.

383
00:27:58,839 --> 00:27:59,880
Well then.

384
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Let's go home.

385
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,400
Gosh, look at the lovebirds.

386
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,240
It's so sweet ants are going to haul you away.

387
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,839
You obviously don't have a sweet tooth.

388
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I prefer low-fat.

389
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,999
Come on. Let's hurry home,

390
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,518
or they might become more lovey-dovey than us.

391
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,758
Should we watch an Ohm-Fluke TV series tonight?

392
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,160
- It's popular right now. - It's so sweet you'll get diabetes.

393
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,880
Wow, this is so beautiful.

394
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,758
Good.

395
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,799
It's pretty.

396
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,400
You're so lucky, Winn.

397
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,079
Seonmin is good-looking

398
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,838
and extremely talented.

399
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,519
He's the epitome of perfection.

400
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,839
Yes, I think so too.

401
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,839
Yes, that's right.

402
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,119
I'll get back to work.

403
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
Oh.

404
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,920
That's very nice.

405
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,960
- Amazing. - Okay. Good job.

406
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,640
Okay. Thank you.

407
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
What's this?

408
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,240
Jedi's newest music video.

409
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,720
And who's this guy?

410
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,680
His name is Ray. He is Jedi's boyfriend.

411
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:11,960
Are they actually in a relationship?

412
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,200
They just went public.

413
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,880
But people are really into them.

414
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,160
It was trending on social media in Thailand for days.

415
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,160
Cool.

416
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,559
Are you thinking of going back to Thailand now?

417
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,359
The photographer said he's going to shoot the next set.

418
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,039
Let's do it.

419
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Please handle this for me, Mr. Manager.

420
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,640
(Close Friend 2)

421
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,759
You can put the phone down for now.

422
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,999
- Just let the viewers see, Ray. - No.

423
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,319
All right. I'll put it down.

424
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,200
- Why? Isn't it enough? - No.

425
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,039
- Just like at the cafe. - Keep talking.

426
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,199
Are you really that mad?

427
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,319
- Gosh. - Are you mad?
