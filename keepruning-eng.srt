1
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:48,458
Being a JROTC cadet
is not only about discipline,

2
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,791
but also generosity.

3
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,666
That is important.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,708
Especially the latter one.

5
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,166
If you overlook it...

6
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,666
you should reconsider who you are.

7
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,416
-Do you copy?
-Yes, sir!

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,458
Copy?

9
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,416
Yes, sir!

10
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,291
Have you ever heard...

11
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,208
there was a student
beaten to death here?

12
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,916
ONE YEAR LATER

13
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,541
Yes, I have.

14
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,500
I heard this young man

15
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,791
had a heart condition,
but he kept it secret.

16
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:52,541
Until Instructor Danai
punished him severely.

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,625
In the end,

18
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,416
he died in the tent.

19
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,750
Shit!

20
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,208
Is that gonna happen to us?

21
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:19,125
I think no one is
as mean as Instructor Danai.

22
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,000
You know well what happened last year.

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,583
Do you guys know
how Instructor Danai died?

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,041
It's rumor that he stepped on

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,750
a landmine in the woods.

26
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:56,291
Nobody knows why he went there that night.

27
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,416
It's so mysterious.

28
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,833
Nick.

29
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,041
Are you okay?

30
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,000
What's wrong?

31
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,125
Nick, are you all right?

32
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,791
-Nick.
-Nick!

33
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,833
Nick!

34
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,458
Nick!

35
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,208
What's wrong with you?

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,083
Where is it?

37
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,083
What are you doing?

38
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,083
We're telling ghost stories.

39
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,250
And the ghost appeared over there.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,166
Nonsense!

41
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,583
Get down!

42
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,583
Look, see what others are doing?

43
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,583
Is it the right time?

44
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,541
Those who are in this squad,

45
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,333
don't you want to help your friends?

46
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,875
Get up!

47
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,208
Asshole.

48
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,791
Company...

49
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,208
Attention!

50
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,416
Such assholes.

51
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,416
Bee, you're saying we're assholes ?

52
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,708
No.

53
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,666
Ling, I'm warning you.
If you keep getting us in trouble,

54
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,000
there'll be no peace for the last
four days

55
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,333
we have left here.

56
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,875
If you do anything to us,
we're all in deep shit,

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,458
Stop bullshitting.

58
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,166
Pu!

59
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,375
What do you want?

60
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,166
Stop!

61
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,291
Why are you fighting?

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,416
We'll all be punished.

63
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm tired of all of this.

64
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,125
You guys sort this out over there.

65
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,833
What bitches!

66
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,333
I miss my mom.

67
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,250
Stop being so dramatic.

68
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,791
I want her to know all the stories.

69
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,291
I'll run slowly when I get back.

70
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,375
Why so?

71
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,125
So she can catch up.

72
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,125
Isn't that funny?

73
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:18,166
Nick, Win is just making a lousy joke.

74
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,458
Don't take it seriously.

75
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,083
-There, there.
-Honor! Discipline!

76
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,875
Courage! Patience! Discipline!

77
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,750
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah!

78
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,541
Country! Honor! Discipline!

79
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,416
Courage! Patience! Unity!

80
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,250
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah!

81
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,041
Country! Honor! Discipline!

82
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,916
Courage! Patience! Unity!

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah!

84
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,750
Who is that?

85
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,708
Yeah.

86
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,666
It's only us that got punished
in the camp.

87
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,125
Country! Honor! Discipline!

88
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,791
Courage! Patience! Unity!

89
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,416
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah!

90
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,083
Country! Honor! Discipline!

91
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,541
Courage! Patience! Unity!

92
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,708
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah!

93
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,833
Run! Quickly!

94
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,708
Bed time, now!

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,291
Bed time.

96
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,708
Hurry up.

97
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,666
Hurry up.

98
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,666
-Is everything okay?
-Of course.

99
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,916
Me too.

100
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,791
What are you doing? It's so loud.

101
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,166
Be quiet,
I'm using an app to scan for ghosts.

102
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,958
You believe in this shit?

103
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,958
Come on, I've just downloaded it.
I'm trying it out.

104
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Being stuck in this squad is so tiring.

105
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,750
Just my luck.

106
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,250
You know Ling is a jinx.

107
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,250
I wanna punch his face!

108
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,833
You remember that time, right?

109
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,625
Yeah, just let it go.

110
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,083
Let's smoke, I'm stressed.

111
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,333
Are you really going?

112
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,375
Yeah, I'm itching to go. Can't wait.

113
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,000
All right.

114
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,583
I saw TT had his eyes on me.

115
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,541
He must have had a feeling for me.

116
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,500
It's glittering-twinkle!

117
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,916
You bastard sleep with his eyes open.

118
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,500
Scary as hell.

119
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:42,875
First... second... third.

120
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,666
What's wrong?

121
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,875
I got some money.

122
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,958
I knew you would find it funny.

123
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,375
It amused you, right? It worked!

124
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,916
You're such a good friend.

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,416
Whatever I do, you always find it funny.

126
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,625
No, I don't.

127
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,166
What?

128
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,458
I was told that I look handsome
when smiling.

129
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,416
So I smile frequently.

130
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,375
You asshole.

131
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,291
Asshole.

132
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,666
Bastard.

133
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,750
That hurts!

134
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,541
Shit... That really hurts.

135
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,666
I'm so tired.

136
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,541
When will I finish all the sets?

137
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,833
Your workout is easy.

138
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,958
Try plucking your hair off the nipples.

139
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,125
That hurts like hell.

140
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,416
I almost had crossed eyes.

141
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,583
Should I do it for you?

142
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,708
Then you do it for me.

143
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,750
Are you sure?

144
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,041
Yes.

145
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,083
Fine, then we're even.

146
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,500
-Yeah.
-Bam!

147
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,416
What should we do?

148
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,750
I don't know.

149
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,541
Shit!

150
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,958
No shit. It's me, Bos.

151
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,875
Bos!

152
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,083
Are you scared of ghosts, Bos?

153
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,541
You have your own tent, why come to us?

154
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,791
I'm kind of lonely.

155
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,458
I'm the leftover,
so I've gotta sleep alone.

156
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,541
I would have had a good night's sleep.

157
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,041
No need to share space with anyone,
you idiot.

158
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,666
Come on.

159
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,708
Bos.

160
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,333
What?

161
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,958
Seriously,
why do you hang out with those bastards?

162
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,083
Why have you become their underling?

163
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,166
I think you better ask yourself.

164
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,958
You should know better than me.

165
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:03,000
In position, left and right.

166
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,458
And left.

167
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:11,375
The birdy sings, she shakes her wings.

168
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,791
She wiggles her tails, she can swing.

169
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you doing?

170
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,458
Get back to dancing.

171
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,458
In position, one-two-three.

172
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,333
Ling, clear the table.

173
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,291
Ling.

174
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,375
Finish the homework.

175
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,666
Please, can you take a photo with us?

176
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,541
Me! This way!

177
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,791
This way.

178
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,125
All right, you all get a chance.

179
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,333
Pussy.

180
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,375
You know the reason why.

181
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,416
You can still walk away.

182
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,875
I'll be damned.

183
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,083
What's wrong?

184
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:19,791
I have to poop.

185
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,791
Walk me to the toilet.

186
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,916
Shit, it's far away.

187
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,500
You're on your own.

188
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,791
I can't wait for the toilet now.

189
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,541
The enemy is knocking on the door,
come on!

190
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,833
That's terrible, you poop-shit.

191
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,375
Ugh, it's up to my throat.

192
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,541
Asshole.

193
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,291
That's pretty big.

194
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,666
Why would you look at my penis?

195
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,791
Finish your business.

196
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,416
It's dark out here. Spooky shit.

197
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,166
Are you scared of ghosts?

198
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,041
I think, at this moment...

199
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,208
The instructors are scarier.

200
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,791
Hey, are you done taking a piss?

201
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,166
Wait for me.

202
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,750
Yeah, hurry up and dump your shit.

203
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,791
What's wrong with you?

204
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,750
Shall we go now?

205
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,958
I can't move.

206
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,166
Shit!

207
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,416
It's not shit.

208
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,791
It's a ghost.

209
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,750
It is. Run!

210
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,791
Help me, I can't move my foot.

211
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,541
Shit!

212
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,750
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

214
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,916
Go back to your tent.

215
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,125
Yes, sir.

216
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait for me.

217
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,208
Assholes.

218
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,166
Hurry up.

219
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,583
Last night...

220
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,875
There are some of you who think that...

221
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,000
you're strong enough...

222
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,916
to practice today.

223
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,000
So, I will...

224
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:15,000
let those rest, without routine practice.

225
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But...

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,708
By midday, the bathrooms, the toilets,

227
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,208
and the instructor's rooms
have to be tidied up.

228
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,125
Copy?

229
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,833
Yes, sir!

230
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,583
Now that you heard.

231
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,416
These guys' squad, go to work with them.

232
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,458
Get up!

233
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:47,458
The rest, follow me to the station.

234
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,500
Get up!

235
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,958
Bos, the rubbish bag.

236
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,875
Guys...

237
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,541
Check this out.

238
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,500
So nice.

239
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,916
Win, what the hell are you doing?

240
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,333
I'm just feeling him.

241
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,041
He's dead, leave it.

242
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,500
Asshole.

243
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,500
What the hell are you doing?

244
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,291
Look what the others are doing.

245
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,625
Guys...

246
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,500
I still remember that vividly.

247
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,583
Left turn!

248
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,833
Pay respect to Instructor Danai.

249
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,041
Atten-tion!

250
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,458
Rest!

251
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:13,750
Sophomores, get in the truck!

252
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,708
Prepare yourselves to return home.

253
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,083
Copy?

254
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,083
Yes, sir!

255
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,833
He was that scary as a man.

256
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,666
Imagine him as a ghost...

257
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,750
How scary would that be?

258
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,458
Why would you say that, Nick?

259
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,750
I say what I think, what's the problem?

260
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,458
Bastard.

261
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,375
Come on.

262
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,166
What's the matter?

263
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,041
-Don't fight.
-Calm down.

264
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,375
-No.
-What's wrong?

265
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,125
Are you finished?

266
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,625
Almost done, sir.

267
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,833
Good. Get back to work.

268
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,791
-Copy?
-Yes, sir!

269
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,625
Come on!

270
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,791
Quick, morons.

271
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,083
Wow!

272
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,666
TT! He's hot!

273
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,166
Fourth, are you ready?

274
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,791
Yes, man.

275
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,708
And two-three!

276
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,708
TT!

277
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,041
So hot!

278
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,333
I'm shivering.

279
00:24:58,916 --> 00:24:59,791
I like it.

280
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,375
Wait!

281
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,833
I'm not a top gay.

282
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,291
Do you think I'm a USB plug?

283
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,958
That I'd want to plug in every hole I see?

284
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:14,958
Jerk, go away!

285
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,458
Bitch.

286
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:23,708
Hey TT, come on here, darling.

287
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:39,041
Now I know why the bathroom is bustling.

288
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,166
This is such a beautiful thing
that happened today.

289
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:53,833
I think we should go to look closer.

290
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,791
I give up.

291
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,250
Hey!

292
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,375
Why is it so noisy?

293
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,083
You don't like peaceful showers, huh?

294
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,250
Your phone, give it to me.

295
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:37,416
Take it back when you are done training.

296
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,916
All right. You'll get it.

297
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,416
One hundred push-ups.

298
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,416
Ready!

299
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,916
One...

300
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,291
Two...

301
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,625
Three...

302
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,083
Four...

303
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:01,666
Five...

304
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,833
Nu Lek, why do you keep biting my ass.

305
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,625
I'm so sorry.

306
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,166
Why are you always so polite, Nu Lek?

307
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,708
Seriously, have you ever been angry?

308
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:17,750
My mom taught me to be polite and sweet.

309
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,791
You mom probably didn't.

310
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,166
Fourteen...

311
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,708
Fifteen...

312
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,708
Sixteen...

313
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
Sorry.

314
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,875
Looking cute. Looking delicious.

315
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,791
Nice ass.

316
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:40,750
Twenty...

317
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,958
My arms hurt.

318
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,541
Damn 100 pushups.

319
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,416
What took you guys so long?

320
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,500
Look, there's nobody around.

321
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,291
I didn't take a long shower,
I took a long shit.

322
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,833
Can't you wait for me?

323
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,833
I'm scared of ghosts.

324
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,958
Long shit my ass, I saw you jerk off.

325
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,750
Yeah?

326
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,500
Come on, guys. It's late. It looks scary.

327
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,000
Let's get back to the tent.

328
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,583
Who's that?

329
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:27,583
A ghost!

330
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,625
A ghost!

331
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,083
Hey!

332
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,125
Your dong!

333
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,208
What are they scared of?

334
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,583
I have no idea.

335
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,458
But I think I know.

336
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,083
They're scared of your face!

337
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,791
I don't think so.

338
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,625
Did...

339
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,041
Did you see what I saw?

340
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,375
No.

341
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,583
Should we have a look closer then?

342
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,208
I think we'd better not.

343
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,333
Why did you hit me?

344
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,458
You two were filming in the bathroom.

345
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:50,916
And we all get punished.

346
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,208
Yeah, assholes.

347
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,333
Why did you hit me?

348
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,416
It's a promotion, free stuff.

349
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,625
Jackass.

350
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,625
This is intense.

351
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,416
Water, check!

352
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,833
Soda, check!

353
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,333
You even brought sour sausages?

354
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,875
Chips.

355
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,416
Peanuts.

356
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,083
Did you bring the whole store?

357
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,000
Damn!

358
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,791
Where did you get all of these?

359
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,166
It's JROTC camp here.

360
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,250
JROTC camp is like 7-11.

361
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,125
I can find everything.

362
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,583
Awesome!

363
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,458
Let's drink. What are you waiting for?

364
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,208
Bos, you like nuts, don't you?

365
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:49,666
Yeah, I love nuts in my mouth.

366
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,000
Let's drink.

367
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,625
Bring me the glass, mix it up.

368
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,875
Come on, cheers.

369
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,208
Bottoms up.

370
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,458
A half is enough.

371
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,791
A half my ass, drink it all.

372
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:08,875
You're nasty.

373
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,375
We have to drink sneakily here.

374
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,166
I'll go full on when I get back,

375
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,625
at the bungalow.

376
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,416
Damn, we ran out of ice.

377
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,916
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

378
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,375
I'm all right.

379
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,208
What about you?

380
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,791
-I'm fine.
-And you?

381
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,125
I'm okay.

382
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,375
Nothing's wrong with anyone.

383
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,750
Nothing is wrong,
then where is my whiskey?

384
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:13,791
I don't know.

385
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,750
I don't know.

386
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,416
Shit! He's looking at me.

387
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:19,625
Oh, thank you.

388
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,791
What are you doing here?

389
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,208
Is that the right thing?

390
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:49,666
They sent you out here to train,
but you're partying?

391
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:54,208
You punks, get back to your tent.

392
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,791
Yes, sir!

393
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,083
-Go!
-Move!

394
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,625
These punks haven't finished it.

395
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,000
This looks tempting.

396
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,541
Damn! No water, no tissue paper.

397
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,833
What should I do?

398
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,750
Lucky me.

399
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,708
Would he have some left to share?

400
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,833
Yes, I can give you some.

401
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:57,291
Lucky me! That's a sexy voice too.

402
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:58,875
What's your name?

403
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,791
My name is Ying.

404
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,666
Hello, my name is Aoy.

405
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:05,791
Nice to meet you.

406
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,583
Nice to meet you too.

407
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,583
But I didn't speak it out loud.

408
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,458
How could he answer me?

409
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,291
I will count from one to three,

410
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,416
and I will bring you tissue paper.

411
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:26,625
One...

412
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,875
Two...

413
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,791
Three!

414
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,916
Here it is.

415
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,291
I don't want it.

416
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,375
Come on, take it.

417
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,166
No, I don't want it.

418
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,583
Or I'll wipe for you.

419
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,041
-No, I'll do it myself.
-Come on.

420
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,750
I don't need it. You're a ghost.

421
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,833
I told you I'll wipe it.

422
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,791
I'll wipe it myself, don't you hear?

423
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,708
Aoy, what's wrong?

424
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,041
Ghost!

425
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,666
Hey, it's okay.

426
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,208
Damn, a ghost again?

427
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,708
Shit, that hurts.

428
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,166
Due to what happened,

429
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:24,041
Your squad has to take responsibility
and guard tonight.

430
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,625
Copy?

431
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,916
Yes, sir!

432
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:33,625
Crap, I haven't wiped my ass.

433
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,041
Bitch.

434
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,291
I'm so tired, been guarding for hours.

435
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,958
I haven't gotten any sleep.

436
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,291
Are we in the wrong tent?

437
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,250
No, those are our bags.

438
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:06,750
It's clearly the same tent.

439
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:13,583
I think, when we have a man
laying down in our tent...

440
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:18,500
It means he wants to get laid with us.

441
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,708
This is such a beautiful thing
that happened today.

442
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,875
Tight ass.

443
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,375
It makes me want to see his face.

444
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,708
Damn! The phone got taken...

445
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,166
What am I going to use for recording?

446
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,791
The upload deadline is tomorrow.

447
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,541
Why would you worry about this now?

448
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:28,833
Just get through tonight, all right?

449
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,541
He's right.

450
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,916
I'm sleepy.

451
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,583
Don't you sleep.

452
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,333
Why not?

453
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,625
You know the story about Danai.

454
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,208
I read on the internet

455
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,291
that if someone sleeps
during the night shift,

456
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:53,375
his ghost will come to punish you.

457
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,666
Win, so many excuses.

458
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,125
It's getting annoying.

459
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:01,625
I think you'd better shut up.

460
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,166
It's my mouth, not yours.

461
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,666
Stay out of this, asshole.

462
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,833
-Want a fight?
-Pe, don't!

463
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,166
Win, enough.

464
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,958
What the hell.

465
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,250
Who is sleeping?

466
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,416
It's just us here.

467
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,625
Yes, here.

468
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,083
Nick can sleep with his eyes open.

469
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,833
I've seen it before.

470
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,125
-Are you sure?
-Watch this.

471
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,666
See, you guys believe me now?

472
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,375
That's some scary shit.

473
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,750
We're in trouble.

474
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,541
Who's sleeping on duty?

475
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,000
I can hear you snore from afar.

476
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,000
Atten-tion!

477
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,833
Country! Honor! Discipline!

478
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,375
Courage! Patience! Unity!

479
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,291
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah.

480
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,291
Do you think it's him?

481
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:21,125
Shut up.

482
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,958
Ling, go and have a look.

483
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,416
Why me?

484
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Do it!

485
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:27,875
All right.

486
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's him.

487
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,166
Country! Honor! Discipline!

488
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,916
Courage! Patience! Unity!

489
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Fight till the last breath, Hooyah.

490
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:39,416
Why is everyone stuck in here?

491
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,083
Get back to your tent now.

492
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:44,708
Get up!

493
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:45,791
Yes.

494
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,500
It's me. Can I sleep here?

495
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,291
Squad four!

496
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,708
Squad four!

497
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,375
Forming Forward.

498
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,708
Forming Forward.

499
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:48,916
March.

500
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,416
March.

501
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,125
-Simultaneously.
-Simultaneously.

502
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,916
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

503
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,083
Aoy!

504
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,500
Aoy!

505
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,375
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

506
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:18,458
Did you hurt anything?

507
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,666
Aoy, bitch!

508
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,125
How long will you be there?

509
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,708
Get up! Hurry!

510
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,541
TT, you're cruel!

511
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:34,958
Let's go!

512
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:38,083
Hooyah!, Hooyah!, Hooyah!

513
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,000
Hooyah! Hooyah!

514
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,833
Hooyah! Hooyah!

515
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:56,416
Naen.

516
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,375
Seriously, why are you mad at me?

517
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,375
If you did your job well that night,

518
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,666
-It wouldn't have happened.
-You asked me to go.

519
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,291
And why did you offer yourself?

520
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:13,041
If you can't do what you promise,
you deserve that.

521
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,041
But I'm not the one who made Danai...

522
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,708
Do you think we'll see him again?

523
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:16,125
Scary as hell.

524
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,083
Hey, I'm just saying, all right?

525
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,666
You look frightened as shit.

526
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,083
I think this doesn't look right.

527
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,333
Did you get us lost, Ling?

528
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,708
Just calm down.

529
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,041
I'm just following the way they told us.

530
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,208
Pu, use the compass app, will you?

531
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,708
Yeah, do it.

532
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,416
Wait, even though we know the direction...

533
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:51,291
We still don't know the way out, right?

534
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,666
Yeah, you're right.

535
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:57,666
This way.

536
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,291
-There.
-The instructor.

537
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,833
Let's go!

538
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,666
Why did you stop?

539
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,166
-Why don't you go?
-Why did you stop?

540
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,458
Do you think that sounds familiar?

541
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,708
Yeah!

542
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:19,333
Get back!

543
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,333
Hurry!

544
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:36,958
Nick, why are you still there?

545
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:44,833
I have an idea.

546
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:47,750
The commander is here!

547
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,791
Present Arms!

548
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:50,750
Attention!

549
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,041
Shit!

550
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,833
Quickly.

551
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:11,916
Go, go.

552
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,958
Shit.

553
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,583
How dare you fool me!

554
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:39,083
Hey, let's count.

555
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,166
See if we are all here.

556
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,875
-One.
-Two.

557
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,458
-Three.
-Four.

558
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,791
-Five.
-Six.

559
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:45,791
-Seven.
-Eight.

560
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,166
-Nine.
-Ten.

561
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,125
Eleven.

562
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,083
Twelve.

563
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,666
Why don't you follow us? Respect him.

564
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:14,833
Assholes.

565
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,166
You think you are funny?

566
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,125
We can't just run around like this.

567
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,416
We have to fight.

568
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,416
Fight what? That's a ghost.

569
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,000
Come on, I have an idea.

570
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,083
What idea?

571
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,708
Fart at him.

572
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,416
What?

573
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:43,750
Idiot!

574
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,375
If you can fart him away...

575
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,041
it will rock the black magic world.

576
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,250
-Let's go.
-Stupid ass.

577
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,375
Brainless.

578
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:53,083
-Asshole!
-Idiot.

579
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,500
Bullshit, dimwit.

580
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,208
I shouldn't have.

581
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,791
Guys, wait up!

582
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:05,625
Stop!

583
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,583
Tee, why did you stop?

584
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,625
Pu, can I borrow your phone?

585
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,041
What for?

586
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:19,208
I think it's near the deadline
for sending in the video clip.

587
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,125
What are you going to do?

588
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,333
Make a video clip.

589
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,875
Are you not scared of Danai?

590
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:30,208
We've come this far,
he won't catch up.

591
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,000
Shit!

592
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,041
And three - four!

593
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,125
You don't need to say goodbye,

594
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,416
I can see it in your eyes.

595
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,791
Every move you make

596
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,000
is telling me that you're leaving.

597
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:55,041
You don't need to say,
I can see it in your eyes.

598
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,875
It hurts enough without saying,

599
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,291
hurts even more when you do.

600
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:01,458
I know you don't love me.

601
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,208
You don't understand anymore.

602
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,000
I can see you want to leave.

603
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,541
Look, I told you.

604
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:14,833
If we follow this squad,
there must be something fun.

605
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:18,166
This is such a beautiful thing
that happened today.

606
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,833
Nu Lek thinks we should go look closer.

607
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,250
Wait up.

608
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:29,333
Ploy Suay thinks your face
is a bit too white, Nu Lek.

609
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,791
Not at all.

610
00:49:31,916 --> 00:49:37,000
I think I look very natural tonight.

611
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,958
Yeah, very!

612
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,375
Med Noon, Ploy Suay, Nu Lek.

613
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:43,833
Get back to your tent.

614
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,458
Your wifey is here.

615
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:47,458
Yours, not mine.

616
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:50,291
No, he is not mine.

617
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,541
He has come to my lap against my will.

618
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:56,333
But you both screwed him, I didn't.

619
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,791
Crazy bitch. I did it gently.

620
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,958
Yeah, I just poked him.

621
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:01,958
Quick!

622
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,666
Back to your tent.

623
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,375
Fine, whatever.

624
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,250
Hurry up.

625
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,416
Take it easy.

626
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,500
That's it.

627
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,583
I look great.

628
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:29,166
What's that?

629
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,125
Where?

630
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,041
Where, where is it?

631
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,208
Here.

632
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:53,541
Help!

633
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,833
Help us, Instructor Thep.

634
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:12,958
Lieutenant,

635
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,458
Let me handle these youngsters.

636
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:20,208
How dare you give me an order!

637
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,083
What's your rank?

638
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,375
Staff Sergeant, sir.

639
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,166
-Louder!
-Staff Sergeant, sir!

640
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,750
And how dare you
give an order to a commander?

641
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,000
A hundred Push-ups.

642
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,333
-Now!
-Yes, sir!

643
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:42,916
One.

644
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,333
Two.

645
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:45,791
Three.

646
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,500
Four.

647
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,916
Five.

648
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,666
-Six.
-Louder!

649
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,625
Seven.

650
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:52,833
Eight.

651
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:53,958
Nine.

652
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,416
Ten.

653
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:56,791
Eleven.

654
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:59,083
-Twelve.
-All the way up, all the way down.

655
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,041
Thirteen.

656
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,708
Fourteen.

657
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,250
Fifteen.

658
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,500
Louder!

659
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,625
Sixteen.

660
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07,958
Stronger!

661
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,458
Eighteen.

662
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,083
Nineteen.

663
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Twenty.

664
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:14,750
Hurry up.

665
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:15,708
Shit!

666
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,250
Shit!

667
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,083
Come on, upload faster.

668
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,166
Aoy, are you okay?

669
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:30,333
My leg hurts.

670
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,041
How are you?

671
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,291
Can you walk?

672
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,583
I can't.

673
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,750
Let me carry you.

674
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,125
So romantic!

675
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,916
Such a gentleman.

676
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,583
Let's go, go!

677
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,458
Do we know where to go?

678
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,416
I don't know. Ling led us here.

679
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,541
I'm sorry that I pissed on your head
the other day.

680
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:15,083
But it's enough.
We've seen ghosts the whole day.

681
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,916
I'm not here to haunt you.

682
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,125
I saw that you are looking for a way out.

683
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,750
I want to help.

684
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,083
But you'll have to help me.

685
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,916
What can we do for you?

686
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:36,916
Let me go back to Bangkok with you guys.

687
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,291
How?

688
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:42,375
Aoy.

689
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:43,625
Wiped your ass yet?

690
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:48,875
Aoy!

691
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,416
How did you die?

692
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,750
Have you heard about a JROTC cadet

693
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,958
that was beaten up to death by Lt. Danai?

694
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:04,916
What?

695
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,750
Don't tell us that you are...

696
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,083
Yes, that's me.

697
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:19,041
But it's not what everyone thinks.

698
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,125
Are you sleeping on duty?

699
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,541
-No, sir.
-Liar.

700
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Get up!

701
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,375
And look how you dress!

702
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,833
Is it that hot,
so you have to fold your sleeves?

703
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,250
-No, sir.
-Get down!

704
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,166
Ten rolls to the right.

705
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,916
Ten rolls to the left.

706
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,958
Ten to the right, Ten to the left.

707
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:58,041
Go!

708
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:01,833
Count!

709
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,916
One.

710
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,000
Two.

711
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,750
-Three.
-Come back, And in position.

712
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:09,875
In position!

713
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:10,916
Fifty sets!

714
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,875
Fifty sets!

715
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,500
-Fifty sets!
-Fifty sets!

716
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,833
-Go!
-One-two-three-one!

717
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,166
One-two-three-two!

718
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,125
Push-ups, in position.

719
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,166
In position!

720
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,916
Your gun, where is your gun?

721
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,458
-One hundred!
-One hundred!

722
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:27,708
-One hundred!
-One hundred!

723
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,000
Go!

724
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:31,583
One...

725
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:33,833
Two...

726
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,458
Three...

727
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:39,916
Four...

728
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,583
Lieutenant, I can't do it anymore.

729
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,708
You can't do it?

730
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,833
You made a mistake, take responsibility.

731
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,166
One hundred more.

732
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,416
One hundred more.

733
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:01,750
Go!

734
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:05,875
One...

735
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,875
Two...

736
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,291
Louder!

737
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,583
Seventy-five...

738
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,041
I had a heart condition.

739
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,333
Seventy-six...

740
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,958
but nobody knew.

741
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,791
I tried to tell him,
but he didn't listen.

742
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,041
Ying, are you okay?

743
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:34,250
Guys, come help Ying!

744
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,083
Ying, what's wrong? Ying!

745
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,708
Push-ups, in position.

746
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:40,916
One hundred!

747
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:44,000
Take responsibility for your mistake!

748
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,500
Ying, what's wrong?

749
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:49,500
Guys, come help Ying!

750
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,791
Ying!

751
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,500
Where are you guys? Help!

752
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,458
But the most important thing is...

753
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,166
Danai's reason.

754
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,791
Are you still mad at him?

755
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,791
Of course I am.

756
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,000
But then what?

757
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,875
I was just someone who was controlled.

758
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,291
Is there anything else I can do?

759
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,875
For Danai...

760
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,416
You don't have to be afraid of him.

761
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:41,791
If you are not afraid of ghosts like us,

762
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:44,500
We can't harm you.

763
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,708
But I'm scared of ghosts.

764
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,041
Yeah.

765
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:06,208
Walk through the waterfall,
you'll find the way out.

766
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,625
Not far now.

767
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,833
Run! The ghost is coming.

768
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm out of here.

769
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,500
I...

770
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,416
am sorry.

771
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,708
Pussy.

772
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,250
You don't even know how to smoke.

773
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:04,958
Go be the lookout then.

774
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:20,166
What are you doing?

775
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,625
Do you think you can run away from me?

776
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,916
DANGER: LAND MINES

777
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,875
Shit.

778
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:57,375
Don't go in.

779
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:01,000
It's dangerous, get out!

780
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:04,166
Don't go in, it's dangerous.

781
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,500
Get out of there!

782
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,333
No!

783
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,083
Help...

784
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,416
...me.

785
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,291
Pay respect to Instructor Danai!

786
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,333
Attention!

787
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,250
It was you!

788
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,125
That night...

789
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,083
I didn't mean it.

790
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,208
But tonight...

791
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,541
I mean it!

792
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,541
-What do we do?
-You go.

793
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:02,500
You go.

794
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:06,166
Why don't you help him? He's your friend.

795
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,875
Run!

796
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,250
Go!

797
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,291
Naen, hurry up!

798
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,125
Hurry up!

799
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,958
You have a lot more time
to practice after death, huh?

800
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,916
You should give up training
and get reborn.

801
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,500
How dare you talk shit to me!

802
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,333
I'm your trainer.

803
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:50,791
We're all dead.

804
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:52,916
There's no trainer or trainee.

805
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:09,083
Get up.

806
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:10,125
Fight me.

807
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,583
Get up.

808
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:14,833
I told you to get up.

809
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,500
Can't escape that way, what's going on?

810
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:49,750
Instructor Thep.

811
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,250
What's going on?

812
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,208
Squad four, are you all here?

813
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:01,583
Yes, sir!

814
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,083
All right, you can go to bed.

815
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,333
Copy?

816
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:05,625
Yes, sir!

817
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,708
Instructor Thep, what's wrong?

818
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,791
You're okay now?

819
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,458
Sort of.

820
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:31,875
Wanna come stay in my tent tonight then?

821
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,666
Asshole, I'm not a homo.

822
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,750
I forgot to tell you guys.

823
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,791
When I said I was going home with you...

824
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:48,000
I have to possess someone.

825
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,875
You just...

826
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,708
made the right choice!

827
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,833
Let's go.

828
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,750
Hooyah!

829
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,333
-Hooyah!
-Go, jump!

830
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,291
Oh my god!

831
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,541
-Are you jumping?
-I'm not ready!

832
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,833
Ready or not... go!

833
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,708
I wanna go to the toilet.

834
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:30,791
It's down there, go!

835
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,500
-Jump.
-No.

836
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:35,458
Jump.

837
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,708
-No, sir.
-Jump.

838
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:39,833
-No, I won't.
-Jump.

839
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,291
No.

840
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:45,791
Go ahead, it's quick.

841
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,625
Shit, who screamed so loud?

842
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:54,583
Fresh.

843
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,166
-So gay.
-So loud.

844
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,958
-That's so gay.
-That was so loud.

845
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:05,833
Why are you guys screaming like gays?

846
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:07,125
Aren't you embarrassed?

847
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,541
How about you? What's wrong?

848
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:11,208
Are you possessed or something?

849
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,208
You guys are idiots!

850
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,416
Is he out of his mind?

851
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,708
What's wrong?

852
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,166
He's so crazy. Is he drunk?

853
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,125
Ling.

854
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:33,875
What's up?

855
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:35,583
Come with me.

856
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,708
I think I lost my ring
at the jumping tower.

857
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,166
You have to help me find it.

858
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:42,250
Let's go.

859
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah.

860
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,291
Hey!

861
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,000
I don't think it's down here.

862
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,333
Let's go search up there.

863
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:52,083
Naen.

864
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,416
I think we should go back.

865
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,750
If they find us, we'll be in trouble.

866
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:00,708
Let's go.

867
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,500
Are you scared of them?

868
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:06,750
This ring is important to me.

869
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,708
Don't you understand?

870
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:14,083
Calm down, I'm just saying.

871
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:25,708
People like you guys
who never want to help others

872
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,916
should not live.

873
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,208
Naen, what the hell are you doing?

874
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,791
To be a JROTC cadet...

875
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,041
is not only about discipline,

876
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,541
but also generosity.

877
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,375
That's important.

878
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,375
Especially the latter one.

879
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:06,458
If you overlook it,

880
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,625
You...

881
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,041
should reconsider who you are.

882
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,458
Do you copy?

883
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:16,750
Yes, sir!

884
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:17,708
Copy?

885
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:18,666
Yes, sir!

886
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:28,500
So now you get the meaning of unity.

887
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,041
All three of you...

888
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,333
fell down here together!

889
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:47,583
Nak Naen!

890
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,666
What the hell? We're friends!

891
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,708
You guys wait here, let me handle this.

892
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:57,666
Quickly.

893
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,541
Wait.

894
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,208
Are you going to be Aoy or Yingroab?

895
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:05,000
Both.

896
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,375
Bitch!

897
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,291
What should we do?

898
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,916
Let's get those instructors to help.

899
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,041
Come on. Hurry.

900
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,458
Hurry!

901
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:19,541
They're going down.

902
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:26,000
I'll help you right away
to get the black ballot.

903
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,083
INSTRUCTOR THEP,
HELP US AT THE JUMPING TOWER

904
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:36,916
Why these kids are training at night?

905
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,791
Mom, I survived.

906
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,000
He replied!

907
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,041
Oh my god!

908
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,708
What do we do?

909
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,625
Please let us go.

910
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:05,250
You know, if we helped you back then...

911
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:07,291
we would be dead too.

912
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:12,541
Dead then or now

913
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,500
makes no difference.

914
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,791
Instructor Danai, I'm sorry.

915
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,375
I'm sorry.

916
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,333
-I'm sorry.
-I don't care if you're sorry.

917
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,791
You are soldiers. You made mistakes...

918
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:26,375
so take responsibility!

919
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,208
What should we do?

920
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:51,666
For Danai,
you don't have to be afraid of him.

921
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:55,708
Ghosts like us, if you are not afraid...

922
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,458
we can't do you any harm.

923
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,458
Naen...

924
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,750
Don't be afraid of him.

925
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:20,625
If you aren't afraid,
he can't control you.

926
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:02,458
Naen!

927
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:17,625
Naen!

928
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,166
Naen!

929
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:25,500
Naen!

930
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,750
Please don't die.

931
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,750
Naen.

932
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:36,750
I'm...

933
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,291
sorry...

934
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:56,291
that I caused the death...

935
01:13:58,958 --> 01:13:59,833
of Danai.

936
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,500
And that got...

937
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:11,541
you guys....

938
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
in trouble.

939
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,166
Forgive...

940
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,333
me...

941
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:34,875
please.

942
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,125
Naen!

943
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,958
-Naen!
-Naen!

944
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,375
Stay with us.

945
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,375
Naen!

946
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:46,458
Naen!

947
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,791
Hey, wait a second.

948
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:30,583
See you in Bangkok.

949
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,458
Naen, get well soon.

950
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,375
We'll go visit you.

951
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,416
Good luck.

952
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,166
-See you soon.
-Good luck.

953
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,541
What's wrong with him?

954
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,583
Why did he go to the hospital?
And who is that?

955
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,333
Where have you been?

956
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,666
Why didn't you take care of them?

957
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,750
They got injured.
What kind of instructor are you?

958
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,541
You guys too.

959
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:17,958
What are you supposed to do?

960
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,208
Something went wrong,
and you still don't realize?

961
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:28,333
You brought your friends out
and got injured.

962
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:32,333
This whole squad

963
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:36,541
won't pass this year!

964
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,833
Come again next year.

965
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:44,791
Get lost!

966
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,541
I said get lost!

967
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,583
I don't know if this situation with Danai

968
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,125
that almost got me and my friends killed

969
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:23,416
made us realize
what we did wrong at JROTC camp,

970
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:27,500
or brought us back together
after the fallout

971
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:29,791
to be united again.

972
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,291
I really don't know.

973
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:38,208
I only know that I feel blessed
that we survived.
