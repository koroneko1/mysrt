&lrm;What you did for Alya
&lrm;was very cool, Marinette

&lrm;You think?

&lrm;Well, congratulations.
&lrm;She must be very proud.

&lrm;Mylene was exaggerating at all.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.140
&lrm;Thank you.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.540
&lrm;I fixed the tear in it.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.820
&lrm;I also sewed the pocket
&lrm;on the inside.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.180
&lrm;That's perfect.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.100
&lrm;Thanks to you,

&lrm;[shouting] <i>&lrm;Where are you?</i>

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.060
&lrm;I know.

&lrm;The bus leaves in half an hour.
&lrm;I'll be there.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.380
&lrm;That was the play's director.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.140
&lrm;She's nervous about the premiere.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.020
&lrm;She's ready to blow a fuse.
&lrm;I better get going.

&lrm;-See you tonight, girls.
&lrm;-We can't wait.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.260
&lrm;Love you, dad.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.380
&lrm;What's his excuse this time?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.060
&lrm;He said had to get his hat
&lrm;from a repair shop.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.580
&lrm;Well, he's a convincing actor.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.860
&lrm;Actually, he is a great actor,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.260
&lrm;but he makes excuses for being late...

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.420
&lrm;For falling asleep during rehearsals.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.860
&lrm;for leaving early,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.260
&lrm;for missing parts of his costume.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.380
&lrm;Come on, Sarah,
&lrm;when are you going to wake up?

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060
&lrm;But it's up to you
&lrm;if you want the show to suffer.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.180
&lrm;Look, you're his understudy.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.940
&lrm;Be ready to replace him
&lrm;just in case, okay?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.260
&lrm;I won't let you down, Sarah.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.980
&lrm;Thanks.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.260

&lrm;It's my mom, I'll call her back.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.620
&lrm;Mylene, you wanna see a cool video?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.180
&lrm;No!

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.020
&lrm;You wouldn't want her to be late
&lrm;for her dad's show.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.580
&lrm;Marinette's right, I gotta go.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.100
&lrm;OK, I'll go with you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.460

&lrm;No, it's Chris.

&lrm;Sarah asked me to call you

&lrm;The bus is picking us up
&lrm;in 10 minutes at the Louvre.

&lrm;That's on the other side of town.

&lrm;Yes, but it's closer
&lrm;to the Eiffel Tower.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.180
&lrm;Well... OK.
&lrm;Luckily, I'll just make it on time.

&lrm;Where's my phone?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.660
&lrm;You stole Alya's phone?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.140
&lrm;I... I borrowed it.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.220
&lrm;Look, all I need to do is
&lrm;transform into Ladybug

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.300
&lrm;and film myself doing
&lrm;the exact same thing.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.740
&lrm;Then I'll give it back.

&lrm;I don't know.
&lrm;Maybe it's better to come clean now.

&lrm;You might be digging a bigger hole.

&lrm;See ya.

&lrm;Don't look at me like that.

&lrm;I think.

&lrm;I'm on time... at the Louvre.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.100
&lrm;What? Why would we meet there?

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.860
&lrm;I-I thought
&lrm;the meeting place changed.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.580
&lrm;Fred, I don't want to hear
&lrm;you lame excuses.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.180
&lrm;-But Chris...
&lrm;-I don't care.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.500
&lrm;It's not just this excuse,
&lrm;there's always an excuse.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.860
<i>&lrm;Enough is enough.</i>
<i>&lrm;Chris will be the lead tonight.</i>

&lrm;[she sighs]

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.020
&lrm;An actor who misses his premiere.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.900
&lrm;Now that's a tragedy.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.140
&lrm;Go, my evil Akuma.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.180
&lrm;Let's hand this actor
&lrm;the role of a lifetime!

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.980
&lrm;Okey-dokey, here we go.

&lrm;Hey! No!

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.980
&lrm;Get away!

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.700
&lrm;That is so gross.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.660
&lrm;Cats are nothing but trouble.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.980
&lrm;[sobbing] What did I do?

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.700
&lrm;You're going to be
&lrm;so disappointed in me.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.940
&lrm;Mime,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.860
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.340
&lrm;I'm giving you the power

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.780
&lrm;to make whatever you gesture
&lrm;come to life.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.300
&lrm;Destroy this premiere performance.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.860
&lrm;You may be a mime

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.780
&lrm;but they can't silence you!

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.900
&lrm;However, in return,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.300
&lrm;you must bring me back Ladybug's
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.740
&lrm;So, shall we get on with the show?

&lrm;Are you OK?

&lrm;Looks like Mylene's dad's hat.

&lrm;If you're ticked off.
&lrm;We can talk about it.

&lrm;My dad's flaking, isn't he?

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.220
&lrm;Let me guess,
&lrm;something came up.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.140
&lrm;Yes, but he reserved
&lrm;the best seats in the house.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.580
&lrm;As usual, the best money can buy.

&lrm;-No time.

&lrm;but he can have it back,
&lrm;I don't care anymore.

&lrm;Just keep us safe.

&lrm;Of course,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.580
&lrm;we have to make him really angry.

&lrm;Do your thing.

&lrm;That is true.

&lrm;[screaming]

&lrm;Yes! Remember he can only mime
&lrm;one thing at a time.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.420
&lrm;So he's cornered.
&lrm;Good thinking, Milady.

&lrm;I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

&lrm;I'm sorry too.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.660
&lrm;I was so desperate to perform

&lrm;[bleeping] Your earrings.

&lrm;-Just you and me.
&lrm;-Thanks, but I have other plans.

&lrm;The show's not over yet, Ladybug.
&lrm;You just wait.

&lrm;Got it!

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:58.780

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.780
&lrm;I don't know which I liked more,
&lrm;the show or Adrien.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.180
&lrm;Give him a call
&lrm;and ask him out to a movie.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.780
&lrm;Speaking of calling
&lrm;I've something to tell you.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.300
&lrm;I... accidentally erased
&lrm;your Ladybug video,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.220
&lrm;then I dropped your phone in a bin,

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.900
&lrm;and now it stinks,
&lrm;like really really bad...

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.060
&lrm;and I'm sorry, so so sorry.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.100
&lrm;I know that video meant a lot.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.660
&lrm;I'm a lame friend.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.220
&lrm;[she giggles] Chillax, lady.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.540
&lrm;If anyone knows
&lrm;about your legendary clumsiness,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.140
&lrm;it's me, your BFF.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.980
&lrm;So... You're not angry?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.620
&lrm;Well... you should have come clean
&lrm;and told me, but no, we're cool.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.380
&lrm;Besides, I'd already uploaded it
&lrm;to my blog.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.860
&lrm;I'm so lucky
&lrm;to have a friend like you.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.140
&lrm;So you probably don't care
&lrm;about my surprise.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.660
&lrm;Screw up or no screw up,
&lrm;you know I love surprises.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.780
&lrm;Ok. You see that theatre?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.020
&lrm;There's something inside for you,
&lrm;on the stage.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.660
&lrm;Hello, Alya right?

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.780
&lrm;Last time, I was in a hurry.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.980
&lrm;I've got more time now
&lrm;if you want to interview me.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.300
&lrm;[she gasps] No? Seriously?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.060
&lrm;Do I? Do I!

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.500
&lrm;Have a seat.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.060
&lrm;You don't know me but FYI, this is like

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.260
<i>&lrm;the biggest moment of my life.</i>

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.300
&lrm;Alya's lucky to have you
&lrm;as a friend too.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.700
&lrm;-Well? Show me!
&lrm;-Only after I've put it on my blog.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.060
&lrm;-I'm not gonna lose this video.
&lrm;-Hey!

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.500
