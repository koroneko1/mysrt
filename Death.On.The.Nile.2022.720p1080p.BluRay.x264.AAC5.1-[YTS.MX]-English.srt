a week before opening

that God intended.

How?

1129
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:14,406
I'm afraid Jacqueline de Bellefort
has made good on her threat.

1130
01:06:14,573 --> 01:06:16,453
No, that's impossible.
I was with her all night.

even for a moment?

1134
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:24,666
Did you leave her side or sleep at all?

1135
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:27,002
No, not a minute. No. Not a wink.

1136
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:29,755
And even if I had,
I was scared she might hurt herself,

1137
01:06:29,922 --> 01:06:32,966
so I gave her enough morphia
to fell an elephant.

after bringing her to Miss Bowers?

ROSALIE: We came back here
to pick up the gun and lock it away.

1145

I kicked it under the couch,

but when we came back,
we couldn't find it.

Simon was with the doctor
and Jackie was with the nurse.

1152

I just figured it was
an awful lovers' quarrel

1153

and not a case for the detective.

Ah, but the mysterious case

in the moments between you bringing
Mr. Doyle to the doctor and your return,

1157
01:07:10,796 --> 01:07:14,675

to commit the murder of Linnet Doyle

01:13:41,227 --> 01:13:45,857
Much of the world lacks access to modern
medicine we take for granted, Poirot.

1271
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:49,194
Most nobility enjoy their nobility more.

1272
01:13:49,361 --> 01:13:51,571
Linnet used to tease me for that.

1273
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,825
Said I shouldn't expect her to honeymoon
in a mud hut.

1274
01:13:59,496 --> 01:14:02,582
Your thoughts to her were always tender.
What of the husband?

1275
01:14:03,124 --> 01:14:04,709
I don't know him well.

1276
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:06,795
What I do know, I can't recommend.

1277
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,171
This is appropriate.

1278
01:14:08,254 --> 01:14:10,590
Mr. Doyle would have us
focus our suspicions on you.

1279
01:14:10,674 --> 01:14:11,716
WINDLESHAM: Me?

1280
01:14:12,217 --> 01:14:13,760
I was with him all last night.

1281
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:15,863
POIROT: Indeed. You gave him
a strong opiate injection.

1282
01:14:15,887 --> 01:14:16,888
He was asleep.

1283
01:14:16,971 --> 01:14:19,516
You could have left him at any time
and not been observed.

1284
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:21,810
- Did he ask for the drug?
- He was in pain.

1285
01:14:21,976 --> 01:14:25,021
There are less powerful pain medications
in your bag which would suffice.

1286
01:14:25,188 --> 01:14:27,107
You created for yourself an opportunity.

1287
01:14:27,273 --> 01:14:29,776
- I didn't create an opportunity.
- POIROT: She was unkind, no?

1288
01:14:29,859 --> 01:14:32,612
She flaunted her new love,
yet still called you like the puppy dog.

1289
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:33,947
Seeing them pained you,

1290
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:37,117
and like the strong opiate injection,
you could end your pain with a bullet.

1291
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:38,785
Lords demand to get what they want,

1292
01:14:38,868 --> 01:14:39,911
and you are still a lord.

1293
01:14:39,994 --> 01:14:41,538
(SHOUTING)
What do you want me to say?

1294
01:14:41,705 --> 01:14:43,289
What do you want me to say?

1295
01:14:43,456 --> 01:14:44,999
That I know I'm ridiculous?

1296
01:14:49,129 --> 01:14:50,547
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1297
01:14:52,716 --> 01:14:54,092
I'm not a fool.

1298
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:58,054
I knew she was settling for me.

1299
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:00,306
I didn't mind.

1300
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:04,978
When she married Simon,

1301
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:08,565
I actually thought
about ending my own life.

1302
01:15:10,233 --> 01:15:12,861
They all thought our engagement
was for the families,

1303
01:15:13,027 --> 01:15:16,239
the papers, for the damn aristocratic
theatrics of it all.

1304
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,952
The shame of it is...

1305
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:24,497
I loved her.

1306
01:15:29,043 --> 01:15:31,755
POIROT:
Little Linny and cousin Andrew.

1307
01:15:32,422 --> 01:15:35,258
ANDREW: I knew her
since we were children.

1308
01:15:35,675 --> 01:15:38,011
Were you aware of any grudges
against the family?

1309
01:15:38,178 --> 01:15:39,763
More than many.

1310
01:15:39,929 --> 01:15:42,223
Her father got rich
making rich people poor.

1311
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:44,100
Linny continued the practice.

1312
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:46,162
Did you hear anything
of the commotion last night?

1313
01:15:46,186 --> 01:15:47,353
I was all snores by 11:00.

1314
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,120
And the contracts you wished her to sign,
they are very important?

1315
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,776
Yes. They are. Were.

1316
01:15:53,443 --> 01:15:56,154
With Linny gone, the, uh,
estate will have to be redrawn.

1317
01:15:56,237 --> 01:15:57,238
May I see them?

1318
01:15:57,322 --> 01:15:59,449
Forgive me. These are confidential.

1319
01:16:00,492 --> 01:16:02,035
I must insist.

1320
01:16:02,202 --> 01:16:04,138
- Respect for the deceased.
- No matter, I know what they contain.

1321
01:16:04,162 --> 01:16:05,163
I doubt that very much.

1322
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:08,708
I believe they extend your stewardship
of Madam Doyle's estate,

1323
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:10,376
despite her marriage, no?

1324
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,586
(SCOFFS) Who told you?

1325
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:13,546
I am Hercule Poirot.

1326
01:16:13,713 --> 01:16:15,691
I do not need to be told.
I have eyes and they see.

1327
01:16:15,715 --> 01:16:18,426
A brain and it thinks.
It now thinks somewhat poorly of you.

1328
01:16:21,137 --> 01:16:23,223
- You think I killed her?
- Did you kill her?

1329
01:16:23,389 --> 01:16:26,351
I don't benefit a dime
from her death, Mr. Poirot.

1330
01:16:26,518 --> 01:16:28,102
You can look at the will I revised.

1331
01:16:28,269 --> 01:16:30,396
A godmother stands to inherit.

1332
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:32,857
Her husband legally gets the rest.

1333
01:16:33,024 --> 01:16:34,651
You won't see my name anywhere.

1334
01:16:34,818 --> 01:16:39,155
Perhaps the intention was not to inherit,
but to conceal.

1335
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:42,784
You executed control
over her vast fortune.

1336
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:45,954
Not a concern, so long as
there is no impropriety,

1337
01:16:46,663 --> 01:16:49,958
no speculation by loyal cousin Andrew,

1338
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,918
in a time of market decline.

1339
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:54,125
This is not a kind of thing
you can prove on a boat.

1340
01:16:54,254 --> 01:16:57,549
You endeavored to obtain a signature

1341
01:16:57,715 --> 01:17:02,262
by trickery, from Little Linny,
and you failed.

1342
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:05,181
You knew it was only a matter of time

1343
01:17:05,348 --> 01:17:08,643
before her keen eyes
uncovered your thievery,

1344
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,689
unless her eyes were closed forever.

1345
01:17:15,316 --> 01:17:19,237
You see, in my position, Mr. Poirot,

1346
01:17:19,404 --> 01:17:23,700
I often have to transport items
such as canvases worth millions.

1347
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:26,077
And they need security.

1348
01:17:26,244 --> 01:17:28,705
So, if I wanted to Kill her,

1349
01:17:28,872 --> 01:17:30,665
I would have used this.

1350
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:36,963
A .45.

1351
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,339
Yes.

1352
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:39,549
You may go.

1353
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:47,932
BOUC: A .45.

1354
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:50,202
Why would he risk going back
for Jackie's gun if he had that?

1355
01:17:50,226 --> 01:17:51,352
POIROT: He would not.

1356
01:17:52,854 --> 01:17:55,231
Miss Bowers, if I might trouble you.

1357
01:17:55,398 --> 01:17:58,568
He wants to speak with me?
I'm laying down a corner.

1358
01:17:58,651 --> 01:18:00,880
There's nothing to fear.
Only you might know something of value.

1359
01:18:00,904 --> 01:18:02,614
That would be the shocking twist.

1360
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:04,300
If you wouldn't mind her coming alone.

1361
01:18:04,407 --> 01:18:06,284
I damn well would.

When you kept vigil with
Mademoiselle de Bellefort,

1366
01:18:16,085 --> 01:18:19,422
did she make threats against Linnet Doyle?

1367
01:18:19,589 --> 01:18:21,466
No, her threats were against herself.

1368
01:18:22,091 --> 01:18:24,677
She wanted to pitch herself
into the drink and not come up.

1369
01:18:24,844 --> 01:18:26,721
That's why I gave her all the morphia.

Um... Well, coming on 10 years.

and here, you moon over truffle
and king crabs.

So, too, your gown, Chanel,

your luggage, Vuitton,
your shoes, Perugia.

you had caviar, did you say?

Many lost fortunes in the crash.

1385
01:19:13,810 --> 01:19:17,814
Many of them due to Papa Ridge way
and his unscrupulous business practices.

Well, I don't care for it. Or for you.

that you are a key beneficiary
in Linnet Doyle's will.

01:21:14,514 --> 01:21:16,432
I don't give a fig for money.

1426
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:19,894
I see no reason to continue
this conversation. Come on, Bowers.

1427
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:23,397
The stewards on this ship keep
an excellent room. Have you noticed?

1428
01:21:23,606 --> 01:21:27,068
A truly first-rate housekeeping staff.

1429
01:21:27,235 --> 01:21:28,444
He's off his rails.

1430
01:21:28,611 --> 01:21:29,779
Beds made every day,

1431
01:21:29,946 --> 01:21:33,908
sheets folded in marvelously precise
45-degree hospital corners, I must say.

1432
01:21:34,075 --> 01:21:37,161
Unlike, for example, the day we departed,

1433
01:21:37,328 --> 01:21:43,000
when the beds were made
in the flowing edged bedspread style.

1434
01:21:43,918 --> 01:21:46,003
But, you know, when I saw
Mademoiselle de Bellefort

1435
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:49,715
asleep in Miss Bowers' room
on our third day aboard,

1436
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:54,512
<i>the bed was as it had been on our first.</i>

1437
01:21:54,679 --> 01:21:57,265
As yet unslept in.

1438
01:21:58,516 --> 01:21:59,809
Bouc,

1439
01:21:59,976 --> 01:22:03,771
where did you find Miss Bowers
when you sought her aid?

1440
01:22:03,938 --> 01:22:05,982
In Mrs. Van Schuyler's room.

1441
01:22:08,151 --> 01:22:09,360
My mind asks...

1442
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:15,283
Here is a woman for whom the fire against
class and materialism burns so hot

1443
01:22:15,449 --> 01:22:17,743
and yet she keeps a servant?

1444
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:19,620
No.

1445
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:23,207
Her servant is no servant...

1446
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,712
nor nurse, only companion.

1447
01:22:28,588 --> 01:22:30,548
Let us name the reason.

1448
01:22:30,715 --> 01:22:31,883
Love.

1449
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:36,345
(SHAKILY) Don't worry.

1450
01:22:38,723 --> 01:22:39,891
POIROT: And I know this.

1451
01:22:40,057 --> 01:22:41,517
It's all right.

1452
01:22:42,185 --> 01:22:46,939
People kill for love.

1453
01:22:47,106 --> 01:22:48,666
MAN: (IN DISTANCE)

1455
01:22:50,193 --> 01:22:51,194
BOWERS: What?

1456
01:22:51,277 --> 01:22:53,196
MAN: They found something!

1457
01:22:53,613 --> 01:22:54,864
Monsieur Poirot.

1458
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:58,552
CAPTAIN MAHMOUD: Well done, young man.
Go and get yourself cleaned up.

1459
01:22:58,576 --> 01:22:59,577
MAN 2: Yes, sir.

1460
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:00,786
BOWERS: It's your scarf.

1461
01:23:01,537 --> 01:23:04,248
But it went missing.
I've been looking for it since the temple.

1462
01:23:04,415 --> 01:23:06,709
BOWERS: It's true.
We couldn't find it anywhere.

1463
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:14,425
POIROT: It has had
an adventure in your absence.

1464
01:23:14,592 --> 01:23:17,553
Your scarf, complete with bullet holes...

1465
01:23:20,306 --> 01:23:22,350
Used to dampen the noise of a shot.

1466
01:23:22,516 --> 01:23:23,956
POIROT: Also a bloodied handkerchief

1467
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:27,647
and the .22 derringer
belonging to Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1468
01:23:29,482 --> 01:23:31,025
- Two bullets fired.
- (BELL DINGING)

1469
01:23:31,108 --> 01:23:33,778
CAPTAIN MAHMOUD:
<i>We return immediately to Assouan.</i>

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

1471
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,325
Ooh, I like this.

1472
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:42,078
The full force of his forceful attention.

1473
01:23:42,245 --> 01:23:44,580
The great mind, all mine.

1474
01:23:44,997 --> 01:23:47,291
Flirtation, however delightful,
will have no effect.

1475
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,127
A woman shows you a direct bit of interest

1476
01:23:50,294 --> 01:23:52,505
and you assume
it can only be to hide guilt.

1477
01:23:52,964 --> 01:23:54,173
(CHUCKLES)

1478
01:23:54,257 --> 01:23:57,051
Whoever she was
must've done a number on you.

1479
01:23:57,218 --> 01:24:00,805
That mask covers your whole face,
doesn't it?

1480
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:07,311
You knew Linnet Doyle before you came
to entertain us, yes?

1481
01:24:07,478 --> 01:24:09,480
- Paths crossed.
- You did not like her?

1482
01:24:09,563 --> 01:24:10,564
I stay polite.

1483
01:24:10,648 --> 01:24:14,193
Monsieur Doyle mentioned an incident
with the victim long ago.

1484
01:24:14,485 --> 01:24:17,280
A reason for possible animosity.

1485
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,742
Poolside, Kennebunkport.

1486
01:24:21,909 --> 01:24:24,578
Summer of '24, before I was someone.

1487
01:24:24,745 --> 01:24:26,414
I played a show at the hotel

1488
01:24:26,497 --> 01:24:29,625
and thought to take Rosie
for a swim before packing.

1489
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:32,420
A young girl complained to her papa

1490
01:24:32,503 --> 01:24:34,880
about having to share the pool
with a colored.

1491
01:24:35,047 --> 01:24:38,175
We were told to leave,
and when I did not abide,

1492
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:39,760
I was made to.

1493
01:24:40,636 --> 01:24:44,432
I wasn't sure she'd even remember it.
I do.

1494
01:24:44,598 --> 01:24:45,766
It was '25.

1495
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:48,686
So does she.

1496
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:51,230
Mademoiselle.

1497
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:56,110
She shamed you in front of your ward.

1498
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:57,278
SALOME: Monsieur Poirot,

1499
01:24:57,445 --> 01:24:59,989
if I put a bullet in everyone
who took a potshot at me

1500
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:01,949
for not keeping to my place,

1501
01:25:02,116 --> 01:25:05,494
the world would be littered
with dead white ladies.

1502
01:25:05,661 --> 01:25:07,788
ROSALIE: Linnet was just a kid back then.

1503
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:10,916
Taught by a bad daddy.

1504
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,919
But she became my friend
in boarding school.

1505
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,048
Gave the other girls license
to do the same.

1506
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:19,633
Truth to tell...

1507
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:23,637
Linnet was as easy to hate as love.

1508
01:25:25,056 --> 01:25:26,557
I might have done both.

1509
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,935
That is a very honest reply.

1510
01:25:31,187 --> 01:25:32,938
I thank you both for your time, mesdames.

1511
01:25:33,105 --> 01:25:36,233
There was one final question.
It is a curiosity of mine.

1512
01:25:36,442 --> 01:25:38,903
Your hat. (CHUCKLING)
In the turban style.

1513
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,697
As many times as I have seen you,
you have always worn one like I,

1514
01:25:41,864 --> 01:25:43,184
but it is out of the fashion, no?

1515
01:25:43,991 --> 01:25:45,993
Not when I wear it.

1516
01:25:46,744 --> 01:25:51,165
If you would indulge me,
please, to remove it.

1517
01:25:51,248 --> 01:25:53,918
- ROSALIE: Mm-mm.
- Oh! It's all right, Rosie.

1518
01:25:54,085 --> 01:25:56,879
He's driving at an answer
he already knows.

1519
01:26:03,302 --> 01:26:06,597
.22 caliber, like the one
that killed Linnet Doyle.

1520
01:26:06,764 --> 01:26:08,724
I've used it, if you wanna ask.

1521
01:26:08,891 --> 01:26:11,435
Twice in defense, once in anger.

1522
01:26:11,602 --> 01:26:13,979
Last night was not that once.

1523
01:26:14,397 --> 01:26:15,856
You tell me if I'm lying.

1524
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:17,566
Mr. Poirot.

1525
01:26:17,775 --> 01:26:18,776
Monsieur.

1526
01:26:18,859 --> 01:26:20,528
You interrupt at a poor time, madame.

1527
01:26:20,736 --> 01:26:22,047
You're meant to be the detective,

1528
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:25,074
yet I found this.

1529
01:26:28,411 --> 01:26:31,747
It was there,
right in my vanity drawer,

1530
01:26:31,914 --> 01:26:33,666
face up like a yolk.

1531
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,795
You know I didn't take it.

1532
01:26:37,962 --> 01:26:39,797
No. Which is why
our killer has remanded it

1533
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,090
to your custody to return.

1534
01:26:41,257 --> 01:26:42,442
BOUC: Thank you.
POIROT: Unless...

1535
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:43,819
BOUC: Poirot.
EUPHEMIA: Unless what?

1536
01:26:43,843 --> 01:26:46,887
Unless you took the necklace
to steer suspicion away from you.

1537
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:49,765
Evidence is easily disposed of
over the ship's railing.

1538
01:26:49,932 --> 01:26:53,436
Whoever did this made a show of discovery.

1539
01:26:53,602 --> 01:26:55,354
Why would my mother murder Linnet?

1540
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:58,375
POIROT: Bouc, you said your mother was
furious with Linnet for making you a pair.

1541
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:00,609
Madame, it was Linnet Doyle
who introduced your son

1542
01:27:00,693 --> 01:27:03,112
- to a woman you distrust, no?
- (SCOFFS) Rest assured,

1543
01:27:03,195 --> 01:27:06,365
if I had a bullet in my pocket
to correct my son's poor taste,

1544
01:27:06,532 --> 01:27:08,200
I would not spend it on Mrs. Doyle.

1545
01:27:08,367 --> 01:27:09,807
Mother, please, that is not helping.

1546
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:12,329
Perhaps. But I have seen
your excellent landscapes.

1547
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:16,375
You are a patient woman who achieves
every effect she intends in time.

1548
01:27:16,542 --> 01:27:20,504
Who so diligently planned
to have me aboard this ship,

1549
01:27:20,671 --> 01:27:25,259
yet with my suspicions
diverted in another direction.

1550
01:27:25,426 --> 01:27:26,594
That is a private affair.

1551
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,345
That is a concluded affair, madame.

1552
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,347
- Enough.
- Enough indeed.

1553
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:32,516
I am now prepared
to present the conclusions

1554
01:27:32,683 --> 01:27:35,936
of my other, more secret case
and put it to rest.

1555
01:27:36,353 --> 01:27:37,855
Secret case?
What?

1556
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:39,940
What does he mean?

1557
01:27:40,024 --> 01:27:41,567
- (INHALES SHARPLY)
- Mother?

1558
01:27:45,696 --> 01:27:47,531
- Monsieur.
- Mademoiselle.

1559
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:54,413
Mesdames, thank you for joining us.

1560
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,789
Bouc.

1561
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,043
I will make my own confession.

1562
01:27:59,627 --> 01:28:03,255
When we met in Giza, I told you
I was on vacation from my detective work

1563
01:28:03,422 --> 01:28:07,635
when in fact,
I was and have been on a case.

1564
01:28:07,801 --> 01:28:09,011
- What case?
- (EUPHEMIA SIGHS)

1565
01:28:09,845 --> 01:28:10,846
You.

1566
01:28:11,514 --> 01:28:13,390
At the request of your mother,
Madame Bouc,

1567
01:28:13,474 --> 01:28:16,101
who cabled me in distress
some weeks ago.

1568
01:28:16,268 --> 01:28:17,937
My mother, in distress?

1569
01:28:18,103 --> 01:28:19,663
I was bidden to follow the Otterbournes

1570
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:23,442
to determine the character and fitness
of the show business woman

1571
01:28:23,609 --> 01:28:24,777
who had stolen your heart.

1572
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:27,029
You did this to me?

1573
01:28:27,196 --> 01:28:28,989
I'm your mother. I've done far worse.

1574
01:28:29,156 --> 01:28:30,241
POIROT: To observe them,

1575
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:33,118
I had to consume many doses
of the bluesy music,

1576
01:28:33,285 --> 01:28:35,538
which, I confess,
I did not expect to enjoy,

1577
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:36,956
but, in fact, I did very much

1578
01:28:37,122 --> 01:28:38,517
as performed by Madame Otterbourne.

1579
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:41,043
It was unusual for me,
but it was very nice.

1580
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:42,753
That's why you were in Giza.

1581
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,880
How we met "accidentally."

1582
01:28:45,047 --> 01:28:46,048
I am sorry.

1583
01:28:46,215 --> 01:28:47,883
I had to make you see what she is.

1584
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,260
Tell him, Detective.

1585
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:51,053
I will tell you, Bouc.

1586
01:28:53,514 --> 01:28:55,182
Having observed Rosalie Otterbourne,

1587
01:28:55,349 --> 01:28:57,059
having inspected
her books of accounting...

1588
01:28:57,268 --> 01:28:59,228
<i>Yes, I know, please forgive me, madame.</i>

1589
01:28:59,395 --> 01:29:00,396
What?

1590
01:29:00,563 --> 01:29:02,523
POIROT: ...I can tell you,
she gambles frequently,

1591
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:04,066
though frequently wins.

1592
01:29:04,233 --> 01:29:07,611
She drinks little, she tips well,
she pays her employees,

1593
01:29:07,778 --> 01:29:10,823
and her taxes on time to the dime.

1594
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:13,659
She is diligent, she is forthright.

1595
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:16,203
In business, perhaps even virtuosic.

1596
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:18,122
Though at piano, sadly, amateur.

1597
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:19,290
(SCOFFS)

1598
01:29:19,999 --> 01:29:23,085
As for her adopted mother,
she drinks to excess twice a week or more.

1599
01:29:23,252 --> 01:29:26,171
She smokes cigarettes
of various compositions.

1600
01:29:26,338 --> 01:29:28,716
And I believe that at least two
of her marriages were not...

1601
01:29:28,799 --> 01:29:30,217
I think, strictly legally ended.

1602
01:29:30,384 --> 01:29:33,596
But she is a magnificent personality.

1603
01:29:33,971 --> 01:29:34,972
SALOME: Mm.

1604
01:29:35,055 --> 01:29:38,601
I do not yet know
who murdered Linnet Doyle.

1605
01:29:39,685 --> 01:29:41,061
But I do know this...

1606
01:29:41,645 --> 01:29:45,983
Rosalie Otterbourne is irrevocably in love
with your son and is his better in virtue.

1607
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:48,902
She is more than fit.
She is a find.

1608
01:29:52,948 --> 01:29:54,867
It wasn't enough that we're happy.

1609
01:29:55,034 --> 01:29:58,871
I did not trust her.
Despite the detective, I still don't.

1610
01:29:59,038 --> 01:30:01,624
I love her.
That has to count for something.

1611
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,875
Why should it?

1612
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:05,294
Corinthians had it wrong on every point.

1613
01:30:05,461 --> 01:30:06,962
Love isn't patient or kind.

1614
01:30:07,129 --> 01:30:09,882
It envies and boasts and doesn't care
who gets mowed down.

1615
01:30:10,049 --> 01:30:12,384
It angers, it is irritable,
it keeps record

1616
01:30:12,468 --> 01:30:13,828
of every transgression against it,

1617
01:30:13,969 --> 01:30:15,929
and good God, it fails.

1618
01:30:16,096 --> 01:30:18,766
Sure as a face ages, love fails.

1619
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:21,894
He really wants your permission,
but he doesn't need it.

1620
01:30:22,394 --> 01:30:24,647
Any more than I need
to meet your standard.

1621
01:30:24,813 --> 01:30:26,065
Or yours.

1622
01:30:27,191 --> 01:30:29,026
I've had a chance to observe you.

1623
01:30:31,028 --> 01:30:32,988
Wanna know what I make of your character?

1624
01:30:34,865 --> 01:30:39,662
He is obsessive,
IS vain, is smug,

1625
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:42,122
is lonely for a reason.

1626
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:46,085
A detestable, tiresome, bombastic,

1627
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:48,212
egocentric little freak.

1628
01:30:50,047 --> 01:30:51,507
How dare you?

1629
01:30:53,467 --> 01:30:54,802
Get out of my way.

1630
01:30:55,302 --> 01:30:56,862
- Mademoiselle, if I may.
- SALOME: Ooh.

1631
01:30:57,388 --> 01:30:59,890
Miss Otterbourne,
I owe you an explanation.

1632
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,477
Please. Allow me to apologize.

1633
01:31:03,644 --> 01:31:04,812
Have you ever met a man

1634
01:31:04,895 --> 01:31:06,730
who says his own name
as many times

1635
01:31:06,814 --> 01:31:08,023
- as Hercule Poirot...

POIROT: <i>Confirmed.</i>

1638
01:31:31,505 --> 01:31:33,924
<i>It is Louise Bourget.</i>

1639
01:31:34,466 --> 01:31:35,985
WINDLESHAM:
There's no sign of drowning.

1640
01:31:36,009 --> 01:31:37,344
They threw the body in after.

1641
01:31:37,511 --> 01:31:39,888
She must have got caught up in the paddle.

1642
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:42,307
She was murdered on board.

1643
01:31:42,766 --> 01:31:44,601
Within the last hour.

1644
01:31:47,271 --> 01:31:48,397
Money.

1645
01:31:49,231 --> 01:31:50,649
Covered in blood.

1646
01:31:52,234 --> 01:31:55,320
Louise Bourget hinted that

1647
01:31:55,487 --> 01:31:59,491
she might have seen
the killer make an escape.

1648
01:32:00,826 --> 01:32:06,623
If indeed she had, she might have
offered her silence for a sum of money.

1649
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:08,459
A blackmail.

1650
01:32:10,627 --> 01:32:13,756
Only the killer preferred
her silence absolute.

1651
01:32:15,841 --> 01:32:18,343
Her throat, cut clean. The blade...

1652
01:32:20,304 --> 01:32:21,305
short.

1653
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:24,683
Very sharp. Like a...

1654
01:32:27,686 --> 01:32:28,854
Like a scalpel.

1655
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:34,151
You!

1656
01:32:34,693 --> 01:32:35,778
You killed them!

1657
01:32:36,695 --> 01:32:38,739
It was... It was his scalpel!

1658
01:32:39,448 --> 01:32:41,241
He killed Louise!

1659
01:32:41,408 --> 01:32:43,285
And she saw him leaving Linny's cabin.

1660
01:32:44,077 --> 01:32:46,163
You've been lying ever since.

1661
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:49,082
You're the one
Linnet should never have trusted.

1662
01:32:49,249 --> 01:32:52,503
I always told her your firm
was bilking her for millions.

He's trying.

Well, he'd better try harder,

1676

or we'll all wind up
in an Egyptian jail cell.

No.

1679
01:34:08,203 --> 01:34:09,872
He loved Linnet too much.

1680
01:34:10,581 --> 01:34:11,861
There's your motive right there.

1681

Look, all of you just keep quiet
and let Poirot work.

In any case,
we'll reach the port by morning.

For now, it's safest if we
just keep to our own cabins

01:34:54,374 --> 01:34:57,044
and let him know that she's...
gone.

1688

to color the clarity of my thoughts

I must ask you to remain
as witness to this interview.

We weren't close, just familiar.

My parents considered her parents
their equals,

1707

SO we grew up at the same parties
and wound up kissing each other's friends.

POIROT: Her husband was shot.

1716

You have such sympathy

of Louise Bourget.

1718

You wish to inform him of her fate.

Yet, you do not spare
the same sympathy for Linnet.

I thought she would be asleep.

1721

She said that she had taken
a sleeping pill.

- BOUC: No, I didn't.

1731
01:37:23,899 --> 01:37:26,902
You returned to the parlor alone,
to find the gun and you did.

1732
01:37:27,069 --> 01:37:30,238
You then went to the Doyles' cabin
to inform Linnet about Simon.

1733
01:37:30,864 --> 01:37:33,909
She was sleeping. You saw the necklace.
You were assaulted by temptation.

But she woke, catching you,
so you shot her.

Linnet Doyle's murder was premeditated.

1745
01:38:01,228 --> 01:38:03,522
It required exact timing, a stolen scarf.

1746

You did not kill her, but
you did go to the Doyles' cabin

01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:10,737
and found Linnet already dead.

But instead of calling for help...

you took the necklace.

1751
01:38:25,085 --> 01:38:27,879
After I told you of the cabin search,
you attempted to return it.

1752
01:38:28,046 --> 01:38:32,759
But you came upon Louise Bourget
arguing with someone, demanding money.

1753
01:38:32,926 --> 01:38:34,719
You saw her throat cut.

not without admitting you stole,

1758

Believing that she would catch no blame.

01:47:48,022 --> 01:47:50,775
Or what he did in the moments
after we believed that he was.

1897
01:47:51,776 --> 01:47:52,860
Consider...

1898
01:47:53,027 --> 01:47:55,547
Madame Doyle reported her husband was
cross with Louise over some nail polish

1899
01:47:55,571 --> 01:47:57,323
left at the hotel.
Why should he care?

1900
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:59,909
<i>Because Madame Doyle wore
blood red nail polish,</i>

1901
01:48:00,076 --> 01:48:01,869
which had, for him, an intended use.

1902
01:48:02,036 --> 01:48:03,955
This gone,
Madame Bouc's paint would have to do.

1903
01:48:04,122 --> 01:48:06,762
He also did not expect his wife
to invite a detective to the party.

1904
01:48:06,874 --> 01:48:09,836
<i>So, to be safe, he puts me to sleep.
A single glass of champagne</i>

1905
01:48:10,002 --> 01:48:12,672
at his insistence sends me to my bed
with my head spinning.

1906
01:48:12,839 --> 01:48:14,590
Drugged for his performance.

1907
01:48:14,757 --> 01:48:16,467
Miss Otterbourne, you saw a gun fired.

1908
01:48:17,844 --> 01:48:18,845
You saw Simon collapse.

1909
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:21,681
<i>A blood-soaked handkerchief to his leg.
At which point you left him.</i>

1910
01:48:21,848 --> 01:48:23,474
Busy with Jackie and finding the doctor.

1911
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:25,321
This gives the murderer but moments alone.

1912
01:48:25,393 --> 01:48:28,271
Moments are all he needs.
He picks up the pistol.

1913
01:48:30,356 --> 01:48:32,233
<i>He runs to his wife's cabin.</i>

1914

<i>through the temple.</i>

1917
01:48:41,993 --> 01:48:44,120
There were scorch marks
on Linnet Doyle's wounds.

1918
01:48:44,287 --> 01:48:46,080
The missing scarf
would have eliminated them,

1919
01:48:46,164 --> 01:48:47,248
but it was not used on her.

1920
01:48:47,415 --> 01:48:50,334
It was instead used here
to muffle the sound of another shot.

1921
01:48:50,501 --> 01:48:52,312
- What's the matter, Bouc?
- There's been an accident.

1922
01:48:52,336 --> 01:48:53,546
POIROT: <i>He returns here</i>

1923
01:48:53,713 --> 01:48:56,674
<i>to retrieve the scarf
which he had previously hidden.</i>

1924
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:00,094
Where he took the gun one more time
and fired it into his own leg.

- (MUFFLED GUNSHOT)
- (GROANS)

1926
01:49:03,473 --> 01:49:04,992
POIROT: After which,
he replaced one bullet

1927
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:06,392
into the gun so if it was found,

1928
01:49:06,559 --> 01:49:07,685
we could count not three,

1929
01:49:07,769 --> 01:49:09,896
but the two shots
that we believed had been fired.

1930
01:49:10,396 --> 01:49:13,357
<i>He then wraps the handkerchief,
the scarf, and the gun</i>

<i>and throws them
into the waters of the Nile.</i>

<i>Then makes himself ready

Your alibi secured, you avoid suspicion.

1936

Indeed, you ensured
a multitude of suspects.

Encouraging a guest list
not merely of friends and family,

or grievance against your wife.

All passing
as a new husband's thoughtfulness.

Blame deflected in every direction
except at you.

1942

You are mad.

1943
01:49:46,974 --> 01:49:52,730
That I would shoot myself,
and then somehow kill Louise and Bouc.

1944
01:49:54,065 --> 01:49:57,193
He's right. He couldn't have killed them.

1945
01:49:57,693 --> 01:49:59,195
He did not kill them.

1946
01:50:00,029 --> 01:50:03,282
The second and third murders
were committed

1947
01:50:03,366 --> 01:50:04,606
by his accomplice in the first,

1948
01:50:04,784 --> 01:50:10,039

behind this entire ingenious plot.

His lover once. His lover still.

1952
01:50:21,968 --> 01:50:25,012
Introducing the couple. Stalking them.
Finding them aboard this ship.

1953
01:50:25,179 --> 01:50:27,348
Shooting Simon with a blank.

1954
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:30,142
All to create two unassailable alibis.

1955
01:50:30,309 --> 01:50:32,037
The grieving husband
left to inherit his wife's fortune

1956
01:50:32,061 --> 01:50:34,605
and then, in time,
to marry the woman he loves.

1957
01:50:35,523 --> 01:50:37,525
Has always loved.

1958
01:50:38,192 --> 01:50:41,821
When I asked Louise Bourget if she had
seen anything, she gave a curious answer.

1959
01:50:41,988 --> 01:50:45,199
"If I had come outside my cabin,
I might have seen the killer."

1960
01:50:45,366 --> 01:50:49,453
Not yes, not no,
but a veiled threat to Linnet's killer,

<i>who was present in the room.</i>

1962

Simon Doyle.

1963
01:50:53,583 --> 01:50:56,586
Who then assured her that Louise
would be taken care of.

1964
01:50:56,752 --> 01:50:57,962
<i>Indeed, she was.</i>

1965
01:50:58,129 --> 01:51:01,591
<i>As soon as he was able, Simon,
no doubt, sent a message to Jacqueline,</i>

1966
01:51:01,757 --> 01:51:04,302
<i>warning her of the new danger.</i>

1967
01:51:04,468 --> 01:51:06,470
<i>Telling her where to find a weapon.</i>

1968
01:51:08,472 --> 01:51:09,807
And then, when Bouc...

1969
01:51:23,237 --> 01:51:28,701
When Bouc detected who had killed Louise,
Simon shouted...

1970
01:51:28,868 --> 01:51:29,869
SIMON: Come on!

1971
01:51:30,453 --> 01:51:34,165
...a warning to his accessory...

wiped of fingerprints, yes.

The handkerchief.

1984

The warm waters of the Nile in springtime

1985

would set the color of blood
to a dull brown.
