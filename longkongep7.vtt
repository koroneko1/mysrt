00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.359
So who is it…

2
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.519
that you are protecting?

3
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.199
UNIVERSITY SPORTS COMPLEX

4
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.840
Ya.

5
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.639
Ya.

6
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.719
Why didn't you answer the phone?

7
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.120
No reply on LINE,

8
00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.599
no updates on Facebook or Instagram.

9
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.840
I deactivated them all.

10
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.960
Social media detox.

11
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.520
I'm worried about you, Ya.

12
00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.639
Don't worry, Lin.

13
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.039
I just want to lay low for a while.

14
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.039
I'll contact you when I feel better.

15
00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.759
I have to go.

16
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.120
Aya.

17
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800
You won't believe
what I'm about to tell you.

18
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.960
But there is one thing

19
00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.039
I'd like to warn you about.

20
00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.360
Well…

21
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.840
Praewa practices black magic.

22
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.800
She got it from her adoptive mom.

23
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.240
She came back to get her revenge.

24
00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.599
Do people still practice black magic
in this day and age?

25
00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.159
Right.

26
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.639
That sounds like a fantasy.

27
00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.160
I understand that this sounds ridiculous.

28
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.399
But I just want you guys to be careful.

29
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.279
You don't have to believe me now.

30
00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.000
I just wanted to tell you.

31
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:26.079
And I don't know who's going to be next.

32
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.319
Myself,

33
00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:29.800
Lilin,

34
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.720
Aya,

35
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.439
or you.

36
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.240
You should stick together for now.

37
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.160
Don't ever split up.

38
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.399
Okay,

39
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.120
I have to go.

40
00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.279
I promise I'll be all right.

41
00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:57.639
Okay,

42
00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.639
I believe you.

43
00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:03.439
Take care of her, Brave.

44
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.399
Yes.

45
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.160
See you later.

46
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.839
What's wrong?

47
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Are you worried about what Dan said?

48
00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.079
Do you remember the dark shadow
that I saw before Ping died?

49
00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.040
Of course.

50
00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.040
Do you think Praewa was behind it?

51
00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.040
Is she really going to kill us?

52
00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:58.800
Ya.

53
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.399
Don't worry.

54
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.600
It was all an accident.

55
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.199
What are we going to do if it's true?

56
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.120
Why didn't she come after us first?

57
00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.519
Are you afraid of her?

58
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.240
Like you aren't?

59
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.319
Mom said low-level black magic
can't harm me.

60
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Where did you get that?

61
00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.959
Mom got it from a monk.

62
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.199
She is worried, so she made me wear this.

63
00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:39.560
Shit!

64
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.160
What the fuck?

65
00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:45.959
Shit!

66
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.959
What was that?

67
00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.360
I don't know.

68
00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.040
-Ya.
-What?

69
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.519
I'll go check it out.

70
00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.279
Hey!

71
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.480
Don't go.

72
00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.480
It's all right.

73
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.879
Aya.

74
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.560
Shit!

75
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.720
Ya?

76
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.040
Ya!

77
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.639
Good morning, Aya.

78
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.360
Did you sleep well?

79
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.080
Brave.

80
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.279
Brave!

81
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.759
What the fuck are you doing?

82
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.120
What am I doing?

83
00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.519
Let me go!

84
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
Let me and Brave go now.

85
00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.039
What the fuck are you doing, Praewa?

86
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.000
My dad will come after you, Praewa.

87
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.679
Daddy this, Daddy that.

88
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.879
I really want to know…

89
00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.960
For a fuckhead like you…

90
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.639
if your dad drops dead,

91
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.240
is your life

92
00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:31.559
going to turn into absolute shit?

93
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.960
Trash like you can't talk to us like that.

94
00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:38.360
Then who can?

95
00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.840
What kind of people can?

96
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.480
People who think highly
of themselves like you?

97
00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:54.039
Aya.

98
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.799
Aya.

99
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.960
If you think you are so much better,

100
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.600
I'll be you, then.

101
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.600
How about that?

102
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.919
Trash like you,
do you think you can be me?

103
00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.399
Be you…

104
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.240
and steal your boyfriend.

105
00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.679
As if someone like me…

106
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.799
would want a guy like him.

107
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.320
I'm not stupid like you.

108
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.600
Fucking idiot!

109
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.360
You bitch!

110
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.840
Did you just call me a bitch?

111
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
Why don't we play a game?

112
00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.960
Between myself

113
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.080
and you two…

114
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.159
Who's the shittiest one?

115
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:05.480
I'm not playing.

116
00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:12.240
Why not?

117
00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.159
If you don't….

118
00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:25.320
What the fuck are you doing?

119
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.720
What the fuck are you doing?

120
00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:28.960
Do you know this bitch?

121
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.519
This bitch,

122
00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.000
do you know her true colors?

123
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.279
Do you?

124
00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:44.039
Do you?

125
00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:47.320
Do you think she's a good person?

126
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.360
Is she a good person?

127
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.039
She is good to me

128
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.320
and everyone else

129
00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.200
except to a bitch like you.

130
00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:11.840
And yourself?

131
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.159
What did I ever do to you?

132
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.159
Is she the only one you're banging?

133
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.720
What do you want?

134
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.279
Are you afraid of the truth, Aya?

135
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.799
Don't be afraid.

136
00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:39.960
Don't be.

137
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.320
I only have Ya.

138
00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:45.120
And that shitty clip.

139
00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:54.919
And you!

140
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480
You…

141
00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.559
You killed Ping.

142
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.720
You killed Ping.

143
00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.759
You killed Ping.

144
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.879
You killed her.

145
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.840
I didn't.

146
00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:07.759
You killed her.

147
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.200
-I said I didn't!
-You killed her!

148
00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.519
I said I didn't!

149
00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.200
It was all around Ping.

150
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.320
It was terrifying, Officer.

151
00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:30.200
It killed Ping.

152
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.679
Was it you?

153
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.879
Correct!

154
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.039
Correct.

155
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120
Correct!

156
00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.799
Good job, Aya.

157
00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:18.919
Good job.

158
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.159
And you?

159
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.679
Next question.

160
00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.039
I already answered.

161
00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.200
But I want to ask again.

162
00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:37.679
You like fucking women

163
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.320
and filming clips, don't you?

164
00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.519
Then you'd share them with Nat.

165
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.639
You sent them to Nat, right?

166
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.240
Answer me.

167
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.240
Look at her face.

168
00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:57.679
Look at her face and answer!

169
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.679
What?

170
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.639
Damn.

171
00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:16.519
How did you do it?

172
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.919
I don't know.

173
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.480
But it was pretty easy.

174
00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.840
Wow.

175
00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:24.919
I salute you.

176
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.919
Grand master.

177
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.320
Give me a review.

178
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.120
How is this one?

179
00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.039
Ten for the body.

180
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.480
But as for the performance,

181
00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.039
she's got a lot to learn.

182
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.559
Anyway, I want to give her another lesson.

183
00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:41.639
Damn.

184
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.360
I have to give it to you this time.

185
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.639
Next time, it'll be my turn.

186
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.840
Bring it on.

187
00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.320
I sent it to you.

188
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.640
Aya, gosh.

189
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.640
That's not even the worst of it.

190
00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.240
You know?

191
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.720
He's even worse than you might think.

192
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.119
In those clips,

193
00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.519
you are in them as well.

194
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.359
Your boyfriend

195
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.200
fucked you

196
00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:34.359
and showed the clips to Nat.

197
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.119
Is this the guy

198
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.480
you are so possessive of?

199
00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.720
Enough! I said enough!

200
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.240
Is this the man you love?

201
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.759
He can't even respect his girlfriend.

202
00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:51.480
If he's not a piece of shit, then what is?

203
00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:52.960
I said enough!

204
00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:07.519
Now tell me.

205
00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:10.960
Who is the girl in that clip?

206
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.640
It's you.

207
00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.519
Do you still think it's me?

208
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200
Why are you protecting that bitch?

209
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.920
Just say it!

210
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.680
I see.

211
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.920
Are you afraid

212
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.279
that you might die like Nat?

213
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.599
You're afraid of a death potion?

214
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.279
What do you mean?

215
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.400
What death potion?

216
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.920
What the fuck are you doing now?

217
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.079
Praewa, what are you doing?

218
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.039
Taking out that shitty black magic
he got himself in.

219
00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.279
Now,

220
00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.680
tell me the truth!

221
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.599
Bitch, let me go!

222
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.079
Brave.

223
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.839
You should confess, Brave.

224
00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:57.200
Now this is what you deserve.

225
00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:23.319
Rodtang.

226
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.079
What the fuck are you going to do?

227
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.279
Brave.

228
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.559
The amulet you have on your neck

229
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.160
can protect you from black magic.

230
00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:54.039
But it can't protect you from dog bites.

231
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.640
Brave!

232
00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:11.240
Brave!

233
00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:29.720
Brave!

234
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.240
Brave!

235
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.200
Brave!

236
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.759
Brave!

237
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.880
Now, can you stop being an idiot?

238
00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:19.759
Why?

239
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.519
Why are you doing this to me?

240
00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:30.359
Because nobody loves you, Aya.

241
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.519
You are not the one they love or protect.

242
00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:39.559
Everybody is just using your stupidity

243
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.079
to protect themselves.

244
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.640
You're a fucking devil.

245
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.119
What are you really?

246
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.920
Didn't you make me what I am?

247
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.039
-Hello ma'am.
-Hello.

248
00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.880
Lin, thanks for coming.

249
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.559
Where is Aya?

250
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.880
She's upstairs.

251
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.200
What happened?

252
00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.039
I don't know.

253
00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:52.799
When she came back last night,

254
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.240
she kept crying for Brave.

255
00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:57.200
When I asked what happened,

256
00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.039
she wouldn't tell me anything.

257
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.400
Let's get inside.

258
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.920
You shameless bitch, get out!

259
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.119
Ya!

260
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.079
Ya!

261
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.599
-Aya!
-Ya!

262
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.079
Aya, what's wrong?

263
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.640
Aya, calm down.

264
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.960
Leave me alone!

265
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.519
I hate you.

266
00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:36.039
Calm down, Aya.

267
00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.200
Calm down?

268
00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.440
I know the truth, you shitty friend.

269
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.160
I trusted you.

270
00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.440
I trusted you the most, Lilin.

271
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.720
How could you lie to my face?

272
00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:57.839
I can explain, Aya.

273
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.880
Explain what?

274
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.519
Stop pretending.

275
00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:02.240
Just stop it.

276
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.839
Brave died because of you.

277
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:14.680
What?

278
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.079
Brave is dead.

279
00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.839
Why did you guys do this to me?

280
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.079
How could you?

281
00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:40.359
Praewa is going to kill you next.

282
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
Brave died because of you.

283
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.440
-Ya.
-Aya.

284
00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:48.759
Aya, calm down.

285
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.599
Calm down, honey.

286
00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:53.000
Aya.

287
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.880
You won't get away with this, Lin.

288
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.400
You won't!

289
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.559
It's all right, Lin.

290
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.279
Let's wait until she calms down.

291
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.960
Then we can explain it to her.

292
00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:40.759
If we hadn't been drunk that night,

293
00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:43.680
none of this would have happened.

294
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.119
Don't think too much.

295
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.400
Nobody wanted any of this to happen.

296
00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:51.240
And you are the victim.

297
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.440
I'm the cause of all of this.

298
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.400
But I can't help anyone.

299
00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:13.640
Dan.

300
00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.880
Now...

301
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.839
I only have you left.

302
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.559
You won't tell anyone about this, right?

303
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.160
Yes.

304
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.400
Trust me, Lin.

305
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.799
I'll do anything for you.

306
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.839
Brave, you bastard!

307
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.119
Dan, stop!

308
00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:25.880
Dan, stop. I said stop.

309
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.559
-Dan.
-What's wrong with you?

310
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.640
Ask yourself. What the fuck did you do?

311
00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:37.720
I don't know.

312
00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:39.759
We were both drunk, okay?

313
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:41.240
You said you don't know?

314
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.079
Dan, stop.

315
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.680
I'm sorry.

316
00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:39.960
Don't worry.

317
00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:41.440
I'll do my best to help.

318
00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:46.519
Don't cry, Lilin.

319
00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:50.880
From now on, you will no longer
be the girl in the clip.

320
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.960
I will write a statement
explaining that the people in the clip

321
00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.720
are Brave and…

322
00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.519
Praewa.

323
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.079
I agree.

324
00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:09.000
Dan.

325
00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:11.400
Praewa is already being accused

326
00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:14.079
of stealing Brave from Aya.

327
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.200
When the rumor comes out,

328
00:33:17.839 --> 00:33:19.559
the woman will take a harder hit.

329
00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:23.000
And it's not clear
who the woman in the clip is.

330
00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:25.400
We can pin it on someone else.

331
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.920
Do you think people would believe that?

332
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.039
Don't you think that Praewa

333
00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:35.119
already has a bad reputation?

334
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.519
Whatever she says,

335
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.400
nobody would take her side.

336
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.640
But…

337
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.319
Let's just say that…

338
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.440
you two will do as I have planned.

339
00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.400
Yes.

340
00:34:03.599 --> 00:34:04.799
Dan.

341
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.280
Have you ever heard

342
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.159
of…

343
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.039
a death potion?

344
00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.119
What do you mean?

345
00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.719
Can you do it for me?

346
00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.079
Can you make sure that

347
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.480
nobody talks about it again?

348
00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.400
Please, Dan?

349
00:34:58.119 --> 00:34:59.360
Okay.

350
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840
If it makes you feel better.

351
00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:56.719
Hey, young man.

352
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.840
I'm here for Master Khuek.

353
00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:14.599
What should we do, Dan?

354
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:18.039
It's like there's nothing we can do.

355
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:25.239
Praewa will try to use black magic
on us anyway.

356
00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:35.480
If we can't run,

357
00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.559
then we must fight.

358
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.519
But she has all these powers.

359
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.840
How can we fight her?

360
00:37:57.559 --> 00:37:58.960
Long time no see.

361
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.519
I need help from you, Master.

362
00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:04.159
Is it about the death potion?

363
00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:09.800
Once you get into this cycle,
it's hard to get out.

364
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:16.079
The black magic you are fighting right now

365
00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:17.679
is getting weaker.

366
00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:19.760
What does that mean?

367
00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:21.239
What can I do?

368
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.679
She has strong powers,

369
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.639
but only half of them.

370
00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:28.599
The more she uses black magic,

371
00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:32.360
the more it consumes her body and soul.

372
00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:37.800
You must deal with her now

373
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.719
before she gains full powers.

374
00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:42.840
Find her personal belongings and photos.

375
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.880
Bring them to me before the dark moon.

376
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.079
On that day,

377
00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:48.679
her powers will be the strongest.

378
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.239
Okay.

379
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.559
Ya, sweetie.

380
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.400
Eat something and take your medicine.

381
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:06.440
Ya.

382
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.400
Why are you here?

383
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.599
Can I take a look at Khaimook's camera?

384
00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:51.599
Did her parents take it?

385
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.079
Her mom will arrive tomorrow.
What do you want to do with it?

386
00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:56.880
Khaimook is dead.

387
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.400
What else do you need from her?

388
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.719
I'm trying to help everyone.

389
00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:05.920
Trust me, Jiewliew.

390
00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:08.000
I just need her camera.

391
00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:48.280
Luang Por,

392
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.239
what do I have to do?

393
00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:52.480
Your daughter

394
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.079
is being controlled by black magic.

395
00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:02.039
Black magic can only be defeated

396
00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:04.480
by a heart that's pure.

397
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.360
Leave her here to observe precepts.

398
00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:12.519
The Triple Gem

399
00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:16.360
will protect and cure her soul.

400
00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:20.679
If her soul remains in this state,

401
00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.039
it makes her more vulnerable
to black magic.

402
00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:36.039
Please help my daughter.

403
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.920
Very good. I'll take it from here.

404
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.880
You should hurry and find your friend.

405
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.400
It seems she is doomed.

406
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.639
It's dangerous.

407
00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.199
Hey, young man.

408
00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:21.360
Keep this with you.

409
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.440
I cast a spell on it.

410
00:43:23.519 --> 00:43:24.760
If you need to kill,

411
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.000
use this magic knife.

412
00:44:53.039 --> 00:44:54.079
Aya!

413
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.199
Aya?

414
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.440
Aya?

415
00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:10.079
Where are you, sweetie?

416
00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:11.760
-Aya?
-Aya?

417
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.280
Aya, where are you?

418
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.360
Aya?

419
00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:18.280
Aya, where are you?

420
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.559
-Aya?
-She's not here.

421
00:45:20.639 --> 00:45:24.360
Aya, where are you? Aya?

422
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.280
-Aya?
-Lin.

423
00:45:30.199 --> 00:45:32.519
Where is Aya?

424
00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:35.039
She disappeared.

425
00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:57.119
