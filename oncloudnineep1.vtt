00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.200
How are you, Tiewkhao (mountain)?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.720
How are you, Saimork (fog)?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.080
How are you, Tonmai (tree)?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
Can you hear me?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.840
I miss you so much!!

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.480
Do you still hear me?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980
Do you miss me?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I'm fine!

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.580
What!?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
Do we know each other?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.980
Just two of us now...

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980
Whom am I talking to?

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.720
If you miss someone, just tell...

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.700
That person will probably wait for you.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
Hmm, thanks.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760
Always be the same...

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.220
What did you say?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.700
Nope! Nothing...

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.700
I have to go.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700
I feel like we'll meet each other again.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.700
Bye...

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.620
Oh, I miss you so...

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.820
Nice weather!

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820
Yea...

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820
Absolutely!

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.080
It's you again!!!!

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.900
We're like-minded, aren't we?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.300
Tell me the truth

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300
You didn't follow me, did you?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.120
I don't know...

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.440
This place is so nice, isn't it?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.560
Will you allow me to travel with you?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.560
Why I have to travel with you?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.300
Go together is better than go alone.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.300
No, thanks.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.420
We don't know each other.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.360
Going together makes us know each other more and more.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.180
Where is my rucksack?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.980
Where is it?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.700
You'll get used to...

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.340
What did you do?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.320
I didn't do anything.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.320
Did you hide my rucksack?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Did I have time to hide your rucksack?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Hey, you!

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.600
Wait! Don't be mad at me!

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600
Forget it!

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.920
Anyway, will you let me go with you?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560
Wait!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.620
If I meet you again, you have to let me travel with you, okay?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.180
Hey! please wait!

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.180
Why don't you answer me?

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.180
No response, really?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.180
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.460
Where am I ?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800
There is no signal.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.700
So beautiful...

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
Are you interested in taking a photo with a handsome guy?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.040
Hey! It's you again!.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.040
You keep following me, don't you?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.220
I should ask you this question instead.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.840
How did you come to this place?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.860
This is a public place, anyone can come.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.860
Really?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.860
You think like that?

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.860
I think you're lonely.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860
I miss you...

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.600
Where is my phone?

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.900
Where is my phone?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.540
You're not used to...

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.120
Did you steal my phone?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.680
What! Again?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.840
You're robber!

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.400
That's why you're trying to get closer to me!

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.400
You're crazy!

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.780
If I'm a robber, 

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.140
I will steal not only your rucksack and your phone

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.760
I think you're...

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200
you're so small

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680
I can carry you...

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.380
What the hell are you talking about?

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.140
I didn't steal anything from you.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.140
If you don't believe me,

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.140
you can search me.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.120
I think you did.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.000
Oh! If you really want to hold me, just tell me...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You're crazy!

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.780
What the hell are you talking about?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.780
I see your cheeks are red.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:25.420
Anyway, do you believe me that I'm not the robber?

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.500
Yes, I do.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.460
So you allow me to travel with you, right?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.460
How can we communicate?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:44.300
I lost my rucksack and phone. I'm so unlucky!

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.140
Don't be serious! See you tomorrow.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.760
But how can I meet you?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.400
Don't worry

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.400
Just thinking of me...

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.800
I will come and see you...

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.300
Really?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.300
Do you like it?

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.300
So funny!

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.540
Can you tell me now where do you want to go?

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.500
I want to go somewhere with a good atmosphere, 

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.500
good food,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.500
delicious food?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500
and a great atmosphere?

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.240
How about sitting in front of the mountain like...

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.880
Doi Luang Chiang Dao?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.400
Good idea! Let's go

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.400
Okay

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.400
I'll take you there...

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.660
Please don't move

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.580
Are you ready?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:30.960
Yes.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.920
1...2...

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.920
3...

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.280
Oh! Doi Luang Chiang Dao, seriously?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.280
How did we come here?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.420
Are you hungry?

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.420
Please wait a moment.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.740
I'm right here.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.120
Khao Soi (Northern Thai Coconut Curry Noodle Soup with Chicken), from traditional and famous shop here.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.480
What's wrong?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.480
You don't like it?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.480
Not really.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.040
You like Khao Soi, I guess.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.700
Am I right?

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.660
What are you thinking?

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.420
Nothing...

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:28.700
You seem so quiet.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.380
I don't know what to say.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.800
Whom are you thinking of?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800
Nope!

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.360
It's really tasty!

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.080
Your mouth is dirty.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080
Really?

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.880
Right here.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.480
Here?

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480
Right here... here....

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.940
Here?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.200
Right here

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.900
Here?

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.860
Right here

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.120
Here?

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Right here...

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.420
Here?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.420
Here...

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.340
Don't be slick!

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.440
Seduce me, don't you?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.440
You want love scene, don't you?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.440
You want me to clean you mouth.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.440
Really?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440
You're so narcissistic!

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.440
Actually, you want to clean it for me, right?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.440
Don't be narcissistic!

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.100
Red onion, if you don't eat it then give it to me.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.180
Where do you want to go next after your meal?

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.180
Why do you want to know?

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.920
If you want to go anywhere, just go alone.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.920
on your own.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480
I have to tell you one thing.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480
What?

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.240
If you arrive Chiang Mai, they say...

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.820
You must go to Tha Phae Gate.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.820
And then?

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.840
You have to walk along the wall...

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.840
until you're in front of the gate.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.840
That's it?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.620
If there is nothing special, why do I have to tell you?

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.140
Listen carefully.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.460
If someone can walk from the end of wall to the center of the Tha Phae Gate...

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.800
with 99 steps completely,

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.280
that person...

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.280
will find his soulmate.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.920
Really??? Is this a true story?

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.920
Who told you this story?

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.300
Someone told me...

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.260
Wait a minute...

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680
