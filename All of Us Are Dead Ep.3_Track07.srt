Why is nothing happening to me?

381

Because he has a cut on his hand.

And since there's an open wound,
it's probably gonna be different.

I know you always hated Gyeong-su,

Gyeong-su, you're going to wait
in the recording room for ten minutes.

I know it'll be hard,

but at least it's better
than people thinking you're infected.

It's only her.

[Dae-su] He won't come out?

Was it wrong to suspect him?

You did too. Everyone did.
It wasn't just me.

Well, I didn't. She's right.

But I didn't insult him like you did.

[Ms. Park]
You remember your promise, right?

719
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,741
After 30 minutes you'd apologize.

720

Okay.

721

I'm talking to you.

Oh, yo. They're talking.
That's good. Right?

00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,780
[Na-yeon] Why don't you answer me?

732

Apologize and get out.

Well, that's pretty bold of her.

738
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,473
[Na-yeon] I suspected you
because the situation called for it.

739
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,851
And I was really mad earlier.

It's fine. It's all in the past.
Let's just go.

I'm not apologizing.

You said to close the door
before anyone could get in.

You said it would be safer for us.

I saved you all, huh?

[Dae-su] Looks okay to me.

969
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,397
[Hyo-ryeong]
Why is he not coming out then?

970
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,857
[Su-hyeok] He won't come out?

971
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,817
[Cheong-san] I don't understand
why he's being so stubborn?

972
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,027
[Dae-su] He's too stubborn.

973
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,071
[Cheong-san sighs]
He's always like this.

974
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,659
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

975
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,331
No, I didn't.

976
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,459
You wiped that
on the scratches on Gyeong-su's hand.

977
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,670
-[Na-yeon] I did not.
-It's in your pocket.

978
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,213
-So what?
-Take it out.

979
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,923
-No.
-Take it out.

980
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,008
I said no.

981
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,761
Should I take it out?

982
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,971
-[both grunting]
-Fuck you!

983
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,806
Who the hell do you think you are?

984
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,683
Class president?
[grunts]

985
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,604
You never treated me like president.

986
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,230
Nam-ra, that's enough.

987
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,444
Nam-ra, do you realize
what you're saying right now?

988
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,446
If that is true,

989
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,699
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

990
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,284
[Nam-ra] It's true.

991
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,245
Na-yeon did it.

992
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,624
She killed him.

993
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,335
You fucking cunt.

994
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,338
There.

995
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,380
Happy?

996
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,762
This is blood.

997
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,722
I wiped Gyeong-su's hand.

998
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,099
This is his blood?

999
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,768
You can't tell?

1000
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,604
Then put it on your wound.

1001
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,026
Wipe yourself with it
if you're so confident.

1002
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,904
Like his blood is so clean?

1003
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,656
He was a zombie.

1004
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,036
He was just fine until you infected him
with your handkerchief.

1005
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,996
Na-yeon, you--

1006
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,873
Damn it! It wasn't me!

1007
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,667
[Na-yeon breathing heavily]

1008
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,214
Don't do it. Stop it.

1009
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,423
Let go.

1010
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,759
-I said to stop it.
-[whimpers]

1011
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,885
Give it to me.

1012
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,846
Leave me alone! Fuck!

1013
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,474
I should just die too then, huh?

1014
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,351
That's what you want, isn't it?

1015
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,855
[sighs]

1016
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,899
[whimpers]

1017
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,901
Why is Gyeong-su better than me?

1018
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,865
That dirty welfie pushed me.

1019
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,203
Na-yeon, you didn't…

1020
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,039
So, you did do it.

1021
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,624
How could you just fucking--

1022
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,293
I didn't kill him, okay?

1023
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,921
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

1024
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,048
[Na-yeon] He's still alive.

1025
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,134
He didn't die, he just turned.

1026
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
Are you kidding me right now?

1027
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,220
Stop ganging up on me.

1028
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,433
When I said he smelled, you all laughed.

1029
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,810
You all made fun of him too.

1030
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,520
Don't try to act innocent now.

1031
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,647
-Na-yeon…
-Cheong-san, stop.

1032
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,858
-How could you kill him?
-[gasps]

1033
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,859
[Ms. Park] Stop it.

1034
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,988
[breathing heavily]

1035
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,160
You're…

1036
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,164
a murderer.

1037
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,375
[whimpering]

1038

I…

1041
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,942
I have no friends at all.

1042
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,111
[Na-yeon sobbing]

1043
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,113
[Na-yeon] I don't need any of you.

1044
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,491
Fuck you.

1045

[somber music playing]

1049
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,062
[Ms. Park] Listen…

1050
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,360
No matter what happens, you stay alive.

1051
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,697
Also, you must never take a life.

1052

[growls, hisses]

1055
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,918
[Ms. Park] If you cause
someone else to die,

1056
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,255
life becomes completely meaningless.

1057
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,675
All right?

1058
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,820
Ms. Park! Wait.

1059
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,531
-Dae-su, don't go.
-[sobs]

1060
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,491
She's gone.
