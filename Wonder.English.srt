[woman 1 talking indistinctly on radio]

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,633
[woman 2 on radio] Stardust, go ahead.

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
[woman 1] Activate the V-10 recorder.

4
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,928
[woman 2] Copy.

5
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,692
[man talking indistinctly on radio]

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,778
Quarter activation complete.

7
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,070
[man 2] Copy. Thank you.

8
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,542
[Auggie] I know I'm not
an ordinary 10-year-old kid.

9
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,128
I mean, I do ordinary things.

10
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,965
Eat ice cream. Ride my bike.

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,176
I'm really good at playing sports.

12
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,638
Well, on my Xbox.

13
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:41,768
I love Minecraft, science
and dressing up for Halloween.

14
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,270
I love to lightsaber fight with my dad.

15
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,898
And watch Star Wars movies with him.

16
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,483
And drive my big sister crazy.

17
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,612
And dream about 
being in outer space, 

18
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,948
just like any ordinary kid.

19
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,785
I just don't look ordinary
when I'm doing these things.

20
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,162
Not even my birth was ordinary.

21
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,959
It was hilarious.

22
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,295
Now, how can a birth
be hilarious, you ask?

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,132
A teenage doctor helps.

24
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,550
This is my first day.

25
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,176
Nate!

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,972
[Auggie] A massive video camera
also aids the situation.

27
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,101
But to really be funny, you need
what all the best jokes have.

28
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,936
A punch line.

29
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,020
[doctor] He's coming!

30
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,106
[baby crying]

31
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,529
[crying fades]

32
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,740
[inaudible]

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,619
[baby continues crying]

34
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,997
Where's the baby going? Go with the baby!

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,248
-You need to go, sir.
-Oh, the baby.

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,963
[Auggie] I've had 27 surgeries since then.

37
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:56,551
They've helped me to breathe, to see, 
to hear without a hearing aid,

38
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,637
and some even helped me look a bit better.

39
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,640
But none of them 
have made me look ordinary.

40
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,018
[Nate] He said he doesn't want to go.

41
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,645
-But he's ready.
-[Nate] No, he's not ready.

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,647
I cannot homeschool him forever.

43
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,984
Every year that we wait,
it'll just be harder to start.

44
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,653
This is the first year
of middle school for everyone.

45
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,989
He will not be the only new kid.

46
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,743
[Nate] Okay, well, he's gonna be the
only new kid that looks like him.

47
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,621
Look, will you stop folding towels
for just one second and please listen?

48
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,499
It's like leading a lamb to the slaughter.
And you know it.

49
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,212
[Auggie] I know I'll never
just be an ordinary kid.

50
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,050
Ordinary kids don't make other
kids run away from playgrounds.

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,973
Ordinary kids don't get stared
at wherever they go.

52
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,769
But it's okay if you wanna stare, too.

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,030
My name is Auggie Pullman.

54
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,616
Next week, I start fifth grade.

55
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,704
And since I've never been
to real school before,

56
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,792
I'm pretty much totally
and completely petrified.

57
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,553
[sighs]

58
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,459
Mrs Pullman, so good to see you again.

59
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,754
And you must be Auggie.
What a pleasure to meet you.

60
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,172
I'm Mr Tushman.

61
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,551
You can laugh about that. Tushman.

62
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,803
I've heard 'em all.

63
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,887
Tushy.

64
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,807
-Butt man. Butt face.
-[chuckles] Oh.

65
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,475
Mr Tuchus.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,310
-[Auggie snorts]
-[laughs]

67
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,312
[Mr Tushman] And then

68
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,148
in the spring, we have a science fair.

69
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:19,652
And from what your homeschool teacher
tells me, you'll get first prize.

70
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
You hear that, Auggie?

71
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,615
Then right before graduation,
whole class takes a trip

72
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,993
to a nature reserve in Pennsylvania.

73
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,371
It is the highlight of the year.

74
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,998
-I promise you.
-[kids chattering]

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh, good, they're here.

76
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,177
Who are they?

77
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,095
Well, I thought
it would be helpful for you

78
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,639
to meet some of our students
before you start school, Auggie.

79
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,724
What do you think?

80
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,102
Other kids now?

81
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,479
[Mr Tushman] They were
in the elementary school

82
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,356
so they know their way around,
and they'll give you a nice tour.

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,110
It will be fine.

84
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,829
[Mr Tushman] Auggie, this is Jack Will,
Julian, and Charlotte.

85
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,873
Guys, this is Auggie Pullman.

86
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,918
-Hi.
-Hi.

87
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,711
Hey.

88
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,925
[Auggie] Meeting kids is harder
than meeting adults.

89
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,677
Everyone makes the same face at first.

90
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,305
But kids aren't as good at hiding it.

91
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,434
So I usually look down.

92
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,687
You can learn a lot
about people from their shoes.

93
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,191
I think these three are trust fund kid,

94
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,693
hand-me-down kid...

95
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,530
Uh-oh, crazy kid.

96
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,615
I act in TV commercials.

97
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,825
Really?

98
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,452
Yeah. Tide.

99
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,706
[Mr Tushman] Why don't you guys
take Auggie 'round the school a bit, huh?

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,459
Just be back here in, uh, a half hour?

101
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,765
[Charlotte] I started when I was two.

102
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,225
Local spots mostly.

103
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,520
Then when I was three
I booked my first national. NestlÃ© Quik.

104
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,856
It was hard,
because I'm lactose intolerant.

105
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,150
Anyway, have you ever heard
of a spit bucket?

106
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,153
So this is our homeroom.
We have Mr Browne.

107
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,489
My mom says he's a little weird.

108
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,159
[Charlotte] Then I was in the chorus

109
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,371
of the Radio City Music Hall
Christmas Spectacular.

110
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,415
I auditioned for Annie on Broadway.

111
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,918
I got two callbacks for Molly, but I guess
they went in a different direction.

112
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,044
Hey, Charlotte!

113
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,755
Don't you ever stop talking?

114
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,509
So this is the cafeteria.

115
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,971
The food here is okay for school food.

116
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,475
Or do you eat special food?

117
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,614
Wow! This reminds me
of my guess spot on Law &amp; Order.

118
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,202
So the science elective
is supposably really hard.

119
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,037
So you probably won't be
spending much time here.

120
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,040
No offence, but if you've never
been in a real school before...

121
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,167
Dude, he's been homeschooled.

122
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,002
Okay, I'm just saying.

123
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,379
Science is supposably really hard.

124
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,173
But you're taking it, too, right?

125
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
[chuckles] Hey,
maybe you could fail together.

126
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,221
Why don't you get out of the
way, so he can check it out?

127
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,806
Okay.

128
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,145
I mean, there's nothing much to see.
Desks. Chairs.

129
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,147
The incubator. Bunsen burners.

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,566
Those are some
really gross science posters.

131
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,736
Oh! And this is an eraser.

132
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,530
[Charlotte] He knows what an eraser is.

133
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,116
How am I supposed to know what he knows?
He doesn't say anything.

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,202
You know what an eraser is, right?

135
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,373
[whispers]
Dude, you have to say something.

136
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,584
Yeah, I know what an eraser is.

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,757
Is... Is your name Jack or Jackwill?

138
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,385
[giggles] You thought his name
was Jackwill?

139
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,055
Yeah, a lot of people
call me by my first and last name.

140
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:17,682
I don't know why.

141
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,475
Got any other questions?

142
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,727
Actually, I've got a question for Auggie.

143
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,313
What's the deal with your face?

144
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,273
Dude!

145
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,857
I mean, were you
in a car crash or something?

146
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,150
Julian!

147
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,361
What? Tushman said we could
ask questions if we wanted to.

148
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,404
Not rude questions.

149
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,240
Besides, he was born
like that, Mr Tushman said.

150
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,035
Yeah, I know. I just thought maybe
he was, like, in a fire, too.

151
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,704
Hey, Julian, shut up.

152
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,621
You shut up!

153
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,123
[shouts] Why don't we all shut up?

154
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,459
No, I wasn't in a fire.

155
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,047
And the word's "supposedly."

156
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,718
What?

157
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,346
You said that science
is supposably really hard.

158
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,639
Twice.

159
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,184
The word's "supposedly." With a "D."

160
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,315
Maybe my mom can homeschool you, too.

161
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,624
Do you wanna tell us yet
how you felt about the tour?

162
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,916
Today?

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,170
Mr Tushman went out of his way
to tell me how sweet those kids were

164
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,631
and that Julian
is apparently quite the dream.

165
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,176
[sighs] No.

166
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,260
[Isabel] Not a dream?

167
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,388
Is he one of those kids that acts
one way in front of grown-ups

168
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,265
and then another way in front of kids?

169
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,017
Yeah, I guess.

170
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,520
Well, I know it's hard,
but you have to understand that

171
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,398
he probably feels badly about himself.

172
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,444
And when someone acts small, you just
have to be the bigger person, all right?

173
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,112
-Right.
-Right.

174
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,241
Via, I'll get the pizza.

175
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,994
[whispers] Look at me, Auggie.

176
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,663
That kid sounds like a real jerk.

177
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,082
If someone pushes you, push back.

178
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,583
Don't be afraid of anyone.

179
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
[whispers] Why are we whispering?

180
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,628
Because I'm afraid of Mom.

181
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,758
You just gotta be a bigger person
and rise above it. It's that easy.

182
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:22,139
Auggie, I do believe that this
is the best year for you to start school

183
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,682
because everybody is going to be new.

184
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,102
But if you really don't wanna go...

185
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,146
No. It's okay. I wanna go.

186
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,983
You do?

187
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,485
[Auggie] Mmm-hmm.

188
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,654
[Isabel] What changed your mind?

189
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,073
Well they have a really good
science elective.

190
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,493
And I need a better science teacher.

191
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,536
[Nate chuckles] Oh!

192
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,372
-Oh, wow. There's that.
-[Nate] Whoa! Whoa!

193
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,207
Are you gonna take that, Mom?

194
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,166
Can I get some backup here?

195
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,543
You gonna let him talk
to your wife like this?

196
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,044
[Nate] I'm not gonna let him
talk to my wife like that.

197
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,130
[Auggie] Please!
[Nate] Get him! Come on, Via.

198
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,757
-Get in there. Get in there. Get in there.
-[indistinct conversations]

199
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,788
I'll meet you right here after school.

200
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,623
Okay? Right here.

201
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,294
[whispers] I love you.

202
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,503
[Auggie] Love you, too.

203
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,672
I'll see you later.

204
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,429
Can you hear me?

205
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,273
We're gonna have a little man-to-man.

206
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,486
Now, I gotta stop here, because
past this point is a No Dad Zone

207
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,156
and you don't wanna walk up with
your parents because it's not cool.

208
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,240
[Auggie] But you're cool.

209
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,408
[sighs]

210
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,704
I know I am,
but technically most dads aren't, so...

211
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,790
And neither are these helmets.

212
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,212
Hey.

213
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:21,091
Two rules. First, only raise
your hand once a class,

214
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,468
no matter how many answers you know.

215
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,763
Except for science. Crush that one.

216
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,056
Check.

217
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,684
Second, you're gonna feel like
you're all alone, Auggie.

218
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,186
But you're not.

219
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,730
Check.

220
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,859
Should we lose this? Come on,
costumes are for Halloween.

221
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,362
Prepare for blastoff.

222
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,159
[kids chattering]

223
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,747
I love you.

224
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,123
Love you, too.

225
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,751
-Have fun.
-[Auggie] Bye.

226
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,633
[woman on radio] Have an
excellent mission and Godspeed.

227
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,426
[man on radio] We are ready
to proceed at this time.

228
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,806
[woman] Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

229
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,475
Dear God, please,
make them be nice to him.

230
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,563
[woman] Four. Three. Two. One.

231
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
[rocket blasting off]

232
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,489
[Auggie] My mom always said,

233
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,703
"If you don't like where you are,
just picture where you wanna be."

234
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,002
[all chanting] Auggie! Auggie! Auggie!

235
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,922
Auggie! Auggie! Auggie! Auggie! Auggie!

236
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,299
[chanting continues]

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,721
[locker slams shut]

238
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,435
[Auggie] I can't wait till Halloween.

239
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,820
[all chattering]

240
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,166
All right, let's settle down.

241
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,751
Everybody settle down.

242
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,086
Uh... Saved.

243
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,880
Sorry.

244
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,132
[Mr Browne] Everybody find your seats?

245
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,175
Yes?

246
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,428
Finding our seats.

247
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,679
Great.

248
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,892
[school bell rings]

249
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,812
All right. Now, some of us are lucky
enough to know each other. Yeah?

250
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,773
And, and others are new. Hi, there.

251
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:47,363
Okay, my name is Mr Browne
and you're late.

252
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,325
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

253
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,495
I was just helping set up chairs
for the assembly.

254
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,373
Don't worry about it.
Can anybody tell me what this word means?

255
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,416
Anybody? No?

256
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,252
Precepts are rules
for really important things.

257
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,462
Like mottos.

258
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,173
Like mottos. Or like famous quotes.

259
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,927
Or like, um, lines
from a fortune cookie. Right?

260
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,721
Precepts can help motivate us.

261
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,723
They can help guide us when
we have to make decisions

262
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,433
about really important things. Okay?

263
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,851
"So why are you talking to me
about precepts

264
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,520
this early in the morning, Mr Browne?"

265
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,729
Well, let me tell you.

266
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,899
Because precepts also can
tell us a lot about ourselves.

267
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,568
Who is it that I aspire to be?

268
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,238
That is the question that we should
be asking ourselves all the time.

269
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,657
What kind of person am I?

270
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,075
So, this is what we're gonna do.

271
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,494
Um, everyone's gonna come up
with two things

272
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,288
that they think everybody else
should know about them.

273
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,540
All right? I'll go first.

274
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,457
Number one,

275
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,460
I used to work on Wall Street.
For a long time.

276
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,590
And two, I left Wall Street
to pursue my dream and teach.

277
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,509
Boom, who's next?

278
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes.

279
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,596
Julian Albans.

280
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,349
And I think it's cool
how you're pursuing your dream.

281
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,394
Thank you very much, Julian.
Let's hear your two things.

282
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,062
Okay.

283
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,483
One, I just got Battleground Mystic
on my Wii and it's totally awesome.

284
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,279
And number two,
we got a ping pong table this summer.

285
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,781
Amazing. Any questions for Julian?

286
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,575
Yes?

287
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,536
Is Battleground Mystic
multiplayer or single player?

288
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,496
Let's not those kinda questions.

289
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,082
-[all laugh]
-Okay, uh...

290
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,257
[sighs]

291
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,845
Hi.

292
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:38,432
My name's August Pullman.

293
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,558
Auggie.

294
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,351
And, um...

295
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,023
I have a sister named Via
and a dog named Daisy.

296
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,359
I love Star Wars.

297
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,113
And I just said three things. Yeah. Sorry.

298
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,408
That sounds like a bonus to me.
Three things.

299
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,036
Thank you very much, Auggie,
that was perfect. Who's next?

300
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,830
Oh! I actually have a question for Auggie.

301
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,250
What's the deal with the braid
in the back of your hair?

302
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,960
Is it like a Padawan thing?

303
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,379
What's a Padawan thing?

304
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh. It's from Star Wars.
Padawan is a Jedi apprentice.

305
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
Who's your favourite character, Auggie?

306
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,805
Boba Fett.

307
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,265
What about Darth Sidious? Do you like him?

308
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,396
Ouch.

309
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,150
Okay, can we talk about
Star Wars at recess? Yes?

310
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,068
All right.

311
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,445
Who wants to read this month's precept?

312
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,822
[all] Me! Me! Me!

313
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,406
Me! Me! Me!

314
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,160
What about you? What's your name?

315
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,162
Summer.

316
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,622
Summer.

317
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,706
Want to give it a shot?

318
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,462
"When given the choice between
being right or being kind,

319
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,048
choose kind."

320
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,341
[school bell rings]

321
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,922
[Julian] Hey, can I sit there?

322
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,215
Sure!

323
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,636
You eat like the sarlacc monster,
my young Padawan.

324
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,390
[chuckling]

325
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,566
Newton's first law of motion.

326
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,698
An object in motion
will stay in motion unless...

327
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,869
It's okay, I didn't expect you
to know that on the first day.

328
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,622
Acted on by another force.

329
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,541
Acted on by another force.

330
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,919
Very good.

331
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,295
Here's how it works.

332
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,926
A moving object will only
change its speed or direction

333
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,179
if something else causes it to do that.

334
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,654
Hey Darth Hideous, did you hear?

335
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,073
Padawan braids were lame 15 years ago.

336
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,950
Supposedly. With a "D."

337
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,410
Dude! More like they were always lame.

338
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,870
[Julian] See you tomorrow.

339
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,206
[Miles] Later, Barf Hideous!

340
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,378
-Hey.
-[Auggie] Hey, Mom.

341
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,223
Auggie, you're supposed to knock.

342
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,101
I'm serious this time.

343
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,108
Wait, did someone make fun of it?

344
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
I, for one, had a great day.

345
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,633
[softly] Just trying to lighten the mood.

346
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,219
Right, Daisy? Right. Good girl.

347
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,891
Well, I went to, um, Kinko's today

348
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,936
to see if they could get my thesis
off this.

349
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,440
You're gonna finish your dissertation?

350
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,191
[Via] What is that?

351
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,401
It's a floppy disk.

352
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,527
A what?

353
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,529
Come on! You, it, a floppy...

354
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:06,283
These kids today.
[stammers] It's basically an iPhone.

355
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,785
You know, it doesn't play music
or, you can't call, but...

356
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,203
They couldn't get the file.

357
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,289
That's okay. You'll find a place.

358
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,167
Well, I think it's great, Mom.

359
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,085
Maybe. Thank you.

360
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,969
So Auggie...

361
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,679
[Auggie] Yeah?

362
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,393
Hi.

363
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,855
How was your first day of school?

364
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,283
Earth to Auggie. We asked you a question.

365
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,535
Come on, how was your day?

366
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,870
Good.

367
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,123
Good how? Good like it was good?

368
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,250
Or good like it was bad and
you just don't wanna tell us?

369
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,462
It was good, okay? I just don't know
what you want me to say? It was good!

370
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,839
Okay, okay, hey! If you're mad at Mom

371
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,424
about going to school,
it was my idea, too.

372
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,094
Why can't I just say "good"
like anybody else?

373
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,984
Batting a thousand today.

374
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,408
Are they gonna ask about my day?

375
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,750
That is not the way we leave the table.

376
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,796
Hey, come on. Talk to me.

377
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,091
Sit down.

378
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,143
Take that off, please.

379
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,445
-[voice breaking] I'm sorry.
-[Isabel] It's okay.

380
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,656
It'll be okay.

381
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,367
Why do I have to be so ugly?

382
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,245
You are not ugly, Auggie.

383
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,290
You just have to say that
because you're my mom.

384
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,834
Oh, because I'm your mom,
it doesn't count?

385
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,335
Yeah.

386
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,882
Because I'm your mom, it counts
the most because I know you the most.

387
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:31,928
You are not ugly and anyone
who cares to know you will see that.

388
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,347
They won't even talk to me.

389
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,435
It matters that I look different.

390
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,396
I try to pretend that it doesn't,
but it does.

391
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:42,939
I know.

392
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,320
Is it always gonna matter?

393
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,907
I don't know.

394
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,206
Honey, listen...

395
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,422
Look at me. We all have marks on our face.

396
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,468
I have this wrinkle here
from your first surgery.

397
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,930
I have these wrinkles here
from your last surgery.

398
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,185
This is the map that shows us
where we're going.

399
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,941
And this is the map that
shows us where we've been.

400
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,819
And it's never ever ugly.

401
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,156
But what about your grey hair?

402
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,408
[chuckling softly]

403
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,497
That's compliments of your dad, I think.

404
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,998
[chuckles]

405
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,471
And as though we summoned him.

406
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,182
-[chuckles]
-[Auggie] How was your day?

407
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:04,062
My day is really good right now.

408
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:15,073
So they went to Florida,
where Gollum was living in Miami. And...

409
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,533
Oh, you know what it is?

410
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,118
Daddy doesn't have his glasses on.

411
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,703
You're making this up.

412
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,121
[all laughing]

413
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,218
[Via] August is the sun.

414
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,056
My mom and dad and me
are planets orbiting the sun.

415
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,477
But I love my brother and I'm used
to the way this universe works.

416
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:54,154
My mom says that on my fourth birthday
I wished for a little brother.

417
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:59,451
And when he was born, it only took me
a few seconds and I was all over him.

418
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,663
Can you hear me?

419
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,208
If they stare, let them stare.

420
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:11,087
You can't blend in when you
were born to stand out.

421
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,928
I've never asked my mom
for help with my homework.

422
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,557
I never needed my dad to
remind me to study for a test.

423
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,353
I just did most of my studying
in waiting rooms and hospitals.

424
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:30,273
Mom and Dad would always say I was 
the most understanding girl in the world.

425
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,277
I don't know about that.

426
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,280
I just knew my family
couldn't take one more thing.

427
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,285
I know my family loves me, 
but ever since my grandma died,

428
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,205
my best friend Miranda 
is the only person who knows me.

429
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,541
Miranda!

430
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,379
Wow. Look at you.

431
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:53,922
Hey, Via.

432
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,132
I've texted you, like, a thousand times.

433
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,425
When'd you get back from camp?

434
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,552
Two weeks ago.

435
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,639
Two weeks?

436
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,558
Sorry, it's been crazy. You know?

437
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,727
Yeah, no, that's okay.

438
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,606
What'd you do to your hair?

439
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,149
Do you like it?

440
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,404
Yeah. Yeah. It looks wild.

441
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,281
Just trying something different, you know.

442
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,575
I'll catch you later.

443
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,288
-Hey, Ella.
-Hey.

444
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,268
[sighs]

445
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,944
Thinking about signing up?

446
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,156
-For what?
-[Justin] The drama club.

447
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,409
They study theatre in the fall
and do a play in the spring.

448
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,119
Um...

449
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,748
No, not really. I'm not a theatre nerd.

450
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,625
[chuckles] Well, that's too bad. I am.

451
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,253
I'm Justin by the way.

452
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,507
Sorry, that was... That was rude. Um...

453
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,759
I'm Via. Olivia.

454
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,304
First days suck, don't they?

455
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,518
[sighs] Yeah. Yeah, they do.

456
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,063
My mom tried to walk me here
from the subway.

457
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,815
I literally had to ditch her
at the traffic light.

458
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,276
My mom still doesn't think
I can use a MetroCard.

459
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,487
You an only child, too?

460
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,073
Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,576
They never listen.
This one time I told my mom

462
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,370
I wanted to take guitar lessons
and play like Jimi Hendrix.

463
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,705
What happened?

464
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,292
[chuckles]

465
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,254
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Via. Olivia.

466
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,382
Yeah. It was nice
to meet you, too, Justin.

467
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,426
Maybe I'll see you around.

468
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
Though not onstage, clearly.

469
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,158
[knock on door]

470
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,243
Come in.

471
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,329
[softly] Good night, honey.

472
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,832
Where's Mom?

473
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,625
She fell asleep.

474
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,210
Oh. Okay.

475
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,463
How's Auggie?

476
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,756
[sighs]

477
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,175
There's some bully, you know.

478
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,556
How was your first day?

479
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,643
It was... It was really good.

480
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,811
It was good?

481
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,271
Yeah.

482
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,855
Say hi to Miranda for us.

483
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,567
I will.

484
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,651
Sweet dreams.

485
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,735
Good night.

486
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,779
[door closes]

487
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,407
[sighs]

488
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:31,139
[Via] My mom put her life
on hold for my brother.

489
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,351
She always wanted to be a children's
book illustrator and teach art.

490
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:40,231
She was one thesis shy of getting
her master's when Auggie was born.

491
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,817
Then she stopped writing it.

492
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,738
She stopped a lot of things
when Auggie was born.

493
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,367
But she is still great at drawing.

494
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,370
I don't know if she even realizes that

495
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,790
she makes Auggie the centre
of every universe she draws.

496
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,504
Miranda used to joke that
my house was like the Earth.

497
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,259
It revolved around the son.
Not the daughter.

498
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,473
That doesn't change the fact
that my mother has a great eye.

499
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,315
I just wish that one time, 
she would use it to look at me.

500
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,617
[Mr Davenport] Yeah, good job, good job.

501
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,668
Miranda?

502
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,964
Via? What are you doing here?

503
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,301
Just trying something new.

504
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,302
You?

505
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,221
Uh, same.

506
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,598
[Mr Davenport]
All right, everybody, let's go!

507
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,891
Time for vocal warm-up.

508
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,935
Bring it in!
Bring it in, people, let's go!

509
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,938
Everybody, hands up! Reach high! And...

510
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,356
[flapping lips]

511
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
[all flapping lips]

512
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,983
[Mr Davenport] Guys, can you please...

513
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,778
[indistinct chattering]

514
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:14,117
Okay. You... You guys, skooch.
Sit. Just be closer.

515
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,493
Ladies and gentlemen.

516
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,620
Stay. Stay, good.

517
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,666
Hey, hey. What's your name?

518
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,792
Auggie.

519
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,836
Nice boots.

520
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,631
Great. Thanks.

521
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,847
Okay, everybody, here we go.
We're skooching and say, "Cheese."

522
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,057
[all] Cheese!

523
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,688
[Auggie] School became...
Well, I got used to it.

524
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,565
Except for dodgeball.

525
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,859
What evil man invented dodgeball?

526
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:54,323
But my least favourite zone at school 
is courtyard.

527
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,367
Because the whole school's there.

528
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,497
No one does anything mean.
Or says anything. Or laughs.

529
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,668
They all just look, then look away, 
then look back.

530
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,503
They're just being normal kids.

531
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:12,050
I kinda wanna tell them, 
"Hey, I know I look weird, but it's okay."

532
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,762
I mean, if Chewbacca started
going to school here one day,

533
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,889
I'd probably stare at him a bit, too.

534
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,515
[Chewbacca gurgles throatily]

535
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,486
I'm sorry if my staring
made you feel weird.

536
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,112
[grunting]

537
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,996
In order for any of us to see,
we need light.

538
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,752
So, right now light is bouncing off
this card travelling through the air,

539
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,712
through the glass, to your eye.

540
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,340
But what if we added water?

541
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,057
-[all] Whoa!
-[chuckles]

542
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,600
Whoa, indeed.

543
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:08,523
Any time light passes from one material
or medium to another, it bends.

544
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,734
This bending of light is also known as...

545
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,572
Refraction.

546
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,698
Very good, Auggie.

547
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,576
Jack, you okay?

548
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,787
-Yeah, yeah, refraction.
-Good.

549
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,832
Clear your desks. Pop quiz.

550
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,625
[all groaning]

551
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,871
[whispers] Hurry.

552
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,152
[kids chattering]

553
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,864
Hey, Jack, come sit here.

554
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,870
In a sec.

555
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,498
Where's he going?

556
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,251
Hey.

557
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,836
Thanks for your help today.

558
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,546
No problem.

559
00:36:56,297 --> 00:37:00,009
And don't worry, I got a couple
wrong so Ms Petosa wouldn't know.

560
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,970
I'm not worried.
The worst they can do is kick me out.

561
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,891
Not loving school either, huh?

562
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,226
Oh, it's great.

563
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,145
[chuckles] I wanted to go to Wayne Middle.

564
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,980
The one with the great sports teams.

565
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,607
Then why'd you come here?

566
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,193
They gave me the scholarship.

567
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:26,244
Well, if you need help in science,
you can come to my house after school.

568
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,829
You know, if you want.

569
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,539
Great. Thanks!

570
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,002
What's wrong?

571
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,005
I just don't like eating
in front of people.

572
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,590
What do you mean?

573
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,759
It's a long story, but when I eat,

574
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,012
I think I chew
like some prehistoric swamp turtle.

575
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,139
No joke? Me too!

576
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,976
[both laughing]

577
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,811
[Auggie] Now there's tuna on your face.

578
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,938
Yeah! Tuna, man!

579
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,232
No, no, no, let me show you how it's done.

580
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,568
-[chuckles]
-[mimics chomping]

581
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,112
[both chucking]

582
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,155
Dude, that's even more gross.

583
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,256
I'm going as Boba Fett this year.

584
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,801
I like Halloween,
but Christmas is still the best holiday.

585
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,387
[Auggie] No way. Halloween is the best.

586
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,056
A pillowcase of candy
versus two weeks off school.

587
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,057
You're nuts.

588
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,852
-[barks]
-You see?

589
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,811
Even your dog agrees.

590
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,565
Hey, Mom, is it okay if Jack comes over?

591
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,152
Yes!

592
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,903
Thanks, Mrs P.

593
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,197
I mean, you get snow on Christmas.

594
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,116
But you can get snow on Halloween.

595
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,702
-[Jack] How?
-If you live in Alaska

596
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,078
or there's a blizzard.

597
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,122
[exhales] I've got to be cool.

598
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,461
[both grunting]

599
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,599
You ever thought about
having plastic surgery?

600
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,310
No, I've never thought about it. Why?

601
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
[chuckles]

602
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,231
Dude, this is after plastic surgery!

603
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,817
It takes a lot of work to look this good.

604
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,737
-[both laughing]
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

605
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,821
[Auggie and Jake] One, two, 

606
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,199
three, four, I declare a thumb war.

607
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,910
Bow, kiss, begin.

608
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,430

609

Fire.

[inaudible]

611
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,780
Okay, everybody, if you can't see
the camera, the camera can't see you.

612
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,032
Now, let's improv like we know
what we're doing.

613
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,493
Okay, everybody say, "Stella!"

614
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,786
-[all] Stella!
-[camera clicks]

615
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,464
So I can't figure you out.

616
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,757
What?

617
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,052
Um, I can't figure you out.

618
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,220
Oh?

619
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,849
Well, most theatre people won't
stop talking about themselves.

620
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,392
But you don't talk.

621
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:38,894
I... I listen.

622
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,896
Me too.

623
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,189
I know.

624
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,234
Oh. [chuckles] So you do pay attention.

625
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,279
Okay, that's a start. Uh...

626
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,365
I'm a good listener, so tell me something.

627
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,075
Who are you gonna audition for?

628
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,996
Um, I'm not really the Our Town type.

629
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,416
Oh, come on.
Don't be the "run lights girl."

630
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,458
Should be Emily.

631
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,502
The lead?

632
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,088
Look, your family can't cheer
for you in a booth.

633
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,257
Oh, they're... They're pretty busy.

634
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,384
I don't think they would
cheer for me anyway.

635
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,303
Come on, there's not one person

636
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,346
in your family who would applaud you?

637
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,266
My grandmother.

638
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,810
There you go. Bring her.

639
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,229
I can't.

640
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,818
Well, then I'll applaud you.

641
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,739
Why are you being so nice to me?

642
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,910
Because you're an only child.
We have to stick together.

643
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,289
Think about it. Okay?

644
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,462
And, uh,
your grandmother's still cheering you on.

645
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,139
[grandmother] I know you.

646
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:03,062
And I love you more
than anything in the world.

647
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,358
What about Auggie?

648
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,276
I love your brother.

649
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,406
But he has a lot of angels
looking out for him.

650
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,826
And you have me.

651
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,081
Yeah.

652
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,293
You are everywhere.

653
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,921
And...

654
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,967
...you are my favourite.

655
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,428
You're my favourite, too, Grams.

656
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,291
Mom, Daisy ruined my Boba Fett costume!

657
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,502
What? Where have you been? It's very late.

658
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,254
-I'm sorry.
-She threw up all over it.

659
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,590
Okay, well, you'll just have
to wear your costume from last year.

660
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,343
But I told Jack
I was going as Boba Fett, not Ghostface.

661
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,305
Well, tomorrow is Halloween.
And all the shops are closed.

662
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,682
And my artistic hands are busy
making meatloaf.

663
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,641
So you do the math.

664
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,101
Fine!

665
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,022
Do you need some help, Mom?

666
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,315
What?

667
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,441
Some help.

668
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,943
Oh, uh, yes, thank you.

669
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,529
Er, mince that rosemary, please.

670
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,826
Where did you say you were?

671
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:46,332
I, uh... I went to Coney Island.

672
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,219
How about you stay home
from school tomorrow? Hmm?

673
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,139
It's Halloween.
We can make it a three-day weekend.

674
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,599
Spend some time together.

675
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,560
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really nice.

676
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,063
Yeah?

677
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,231
Okay, good.

678
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,027
Peppers? I don't want peppers.

679
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,279
-Peppers give Daddy gas.
-[chuckles]

680
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,577
[Auggie] I don't care what Jack Will 
says about Christmas.

681
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
[Nate] Hey, Auggie!

682
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:33,045
[Auggie] For me, Halloween
is the best holiday in the world.

683
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,257
It's so awesome
when I'm wearing the costume!

684
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,886
I usually walk with my head down 
to avoid being seen.

685
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,848
But on Halloween,
I walk with my head up high.

686
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,190
I don't even know who that was.

687
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,984
He didn't even know who I was. 
It's so cool.

688
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,320
Especially because people
don't like to touch me

689
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,739
because they think I'm contagious.

690
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh, yeah, Chewie! Up high!
Boom goes the dynamite!

691
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,457
[kids laughing]

692
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,503
It really does look like him.

693
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,130
-This part right?
-[Amos] Yeah.

694
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:19,675
[Julian] I mean, he's always reminded me
of, like, the shrunken head, you know?

695
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,968
[Amos] Or an orc.
[Julian] Yeah.

696
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,138
If I looked like him, I'd swear
I'd put a hood over my face every day.

697
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,391
[Jack] If I looked like him,
I think I'd kill myself.

698
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,976
Why do you hang out with him
so much, Jack?

699
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,811
[Miles] Yeah.
[Jack] I don't know.

700
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,815
Tushman asked me to be his welcome buddy

701
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,609
and now
he just follows me around everywhere.

702
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,154
[Julian] Well, that must stink!
That must stink.

703
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,447
[kids laughing]

704
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,198
[Amos] Oh, yeah. Just like him.

705
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,033
[kids continue laughing]

706
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,288
-[growls]
-[laughing]

707
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,423
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

708
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,639
Always blows my mind how much Daddy
looks like Patrick Swayze in this movie.

709
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,184
-Ew!
-[chuckling]

710
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,894
Ew, no!

711
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,772
Honey, tell me
what's going on with Miranda?

712
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,652
It's not... It's not just the pink hair.

713
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,404
She's just...

714
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,615
She won't even talk to me.

715
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:30,287
I had a friend in high school.
We went through this exact same thing.

716
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,373
And what I did, which fixed it
almost immediately...

717
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah?

718
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:40,797
Was, um, to eat an entire
jack-o'-lantern bucket of candy.

719
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,342
-[chuckles]
-[phone ringing]

720
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,846
Mmm. Hello.

721
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,349
Yes, Mr Tushman.

722
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,519
He's nauseous?

723
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,103
Does he have a fever?

724
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,105
What did the nurse say?

725
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,440
I'm so sorry.

726
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,319
All right. Okay. Thank you.
I will be right there.

727
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,239
Honey, I have to go,
your brother just threw up at school.

728
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,701
[indistinct chatter on TV]

729
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,870
[TV turns off]

730
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,291
[clattering]

731
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,801
[sobbing softly]

732
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,178
[Isabel] Nate, do you know
where his helmet is?

733
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,138
He's asking for it
and I've looked everywhere.

734
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,432
I don't know. Something at school.

735
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,309
He won't say.
He won't come out of his room.

736
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,645
And now he says he doesn't even
wanna go trick-or-treating.

737
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,691
I know. Okay. Thank you. Just get here.

738
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,833
[Via] Come on, get ready.

739
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,835
It's almost time for the Halloween parade.

740
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,336
You're supposed to knock!

741
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,382
-[knocks on table]
-Go away!

742
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,221
Mom says you won't say what happened.

743
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,390
Did someone say something?

744
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,559
Someone always says something!

745
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,810
Well, tell me what happened.

746
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,478
It's none of your business!

747
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,481
You took my day with Mom,
so it is my business.

748
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,195
I heard Jack Will talking
about me behind my back.

749
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,615
He said he'd kill himself
if he looked like me.

750
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,493
Jack Will? Isn't he the nice one?

751
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,704
[Auggie] There are no nice ones!

752
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,373
I wish I'd never gone
to school in the first place!

753
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,751
But you were liking school.
I know you were.

754
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,336
I hate it, okay? I hate it!

755
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,677
Auggie, I'm sorry, but you're not
the only one who has bad days.

756
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,474
Bad days? Do people avoid touching you?

757
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,852
When a person accidentally touches you,
do they call it "the plague"?

758
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,771
No.

759
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,481
Jack Will was all I had.

760
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,734
So just don't compare
your bad days at school to mine, okay?

761
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,027
Okay.

762
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,117
Hey.

763
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,245
Did you notice that Miranda
doesn't come around any more?

764
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,455
What?

765
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,957
You didn't. Shocker.

766
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,797
Yeah, she went away to camp this summer
and now she doesn't like me any more.

767
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,090
Why?

768
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,468
Because school sucks.

769
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,388
And people change.

770
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,100
So if you wanna be a normal kid,
Auggie, then those are the rules.

771
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,771
So, let's go trick-or-treating.

772
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,273
Okay?

773
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,361
Because right now
we're each other's best friends.

774
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:53,824
Really?

775
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,409
Yes.

776
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,453
So, come on.

777
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,957
I'll let you have all my Halloween candy.

778
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:06,920
[indistinct chatter]

779
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,380
[Auggie] I'll trade you my apples.

780
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,756
[Via] Okay, no.

781
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,758
I know that I said that
you could have all my candy,

782
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,344
but I was really just saying that
to get you out of the house.

783
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,429
[Auggie] What about the chocolate?

784
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,805
-[Via] No.
-And the Smarties?

785
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,307
Gummies, licorice, the Reese's,
the Hersheys.

786
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,851
-No!
-And everything else.

787
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,270
All right, I'll let you have all my candy.

788
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,444
[Mr Davenport] Okay, Via.

789
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,321
You are next, please.
Let's hear it for Via.

790
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,095
[exhales]

791
00:50:59,055 --> 00:50:59,931
Daisy,

792
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,770
do you wanna help me
take back my corner office?

793
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,823
Hey, Auggie! You feeling better?

794
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,246
Are you okay, Auggie?

795
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,290
Yeah.

796
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,502
Sure? 'Cause you're acting really weird.

797
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,920
I'm okay, Jack, okay?

798
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,508
Okay.

799
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,056
[sighs]

800
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,813
They want me to do what?

801
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,856
[sighs] Give a tour through the school.

802
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,027
-But, Mom, it's summer vacation.
-I know.

803
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,863
But your teachers told Mr Tushman
you're known as a good egg.

804
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,990
-No, I'm a bad egg.
-You're a good egg.

805
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,078
And I'm actually really proud
they thought of you for this.

806
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,080
Mom, enough with the guilt.

807
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,165
And you know
they gave you a scholarship, right?

808
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,000
Mom...

809
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,047
Who else is doing it?

810
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,550
Uh, Charlotte and Julian.

811
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,176
-No.
-Why, what's wrong?

812
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,596
Charlotte will just talk about Broadway
the whole time.

813
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,516
And Julian is the biggest
phony on the planet.

814
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,560
So I'm sorry, but no.

815
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,317
Jack, it's for that boy.

816
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,610
Who?

817
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,946
The one from the ice cream shop.

818
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,074
Oh.

819
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:42,868
Yeah.

820
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,997
So if a nice kid like your little brother
cries when he sees him,

821
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,666
what kind of a chance
do you think he has in middle school?

822
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,381
[sighs] Okay.

823
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,925
Thank you, kiddo.

824
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,685
[Jack] Four things I've learned
about Auggie Pullman.

825
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,230
First of all, you do get used to his face.

826
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:16,443
Now, it's not like regular ice.
You can't touch it with your hands, okay?

827
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,946
[Jack] Second, he's really smart.

828
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,866
He's ahead of me in everything.

829
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,744
In science, 
he's ahead of the whole school.

830
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,203
Everybody watching?

831
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,123
-Whoo!
-[all laugh]

832
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:34,002
[Jack] Third of all,
he's actually pretty funny.

833
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,505
But fourthly, now that I know him,

834
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,759
I would say I actually 
do wanna be friends with Auggie.

835
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,969
At first, I admit it,

836
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,389
I was only friendly to him because
my mom asked me to be nice.

837
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,853
But now I would choose
to hang out with him.

838
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,813
Like, he's a good friend.

839
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,484
Like if all the guys in fifth grade
were lined up against a wall

840
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:02,072
and I could choose anyone I wanted 
to hang out with, I would choose Auggie.

841
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,451
Hey, what's wrong?

842
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,036
Go away.

843
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,830
[Julian] Oh, hey, Jack, come sit with us.

844
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,248
Yeah, come on, man.

845
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,171
I wonder what happened.

846
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,465
[Ximena] Maybe Jack touched Auggie
and couldn't wash his hands in time.

847
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,008
Jack finally got "the plague."

848
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,344
[Charlotte] That's not very nice.

849
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,304
What? We didn't start it.

850
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,139
Where are you going?

851
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,565
Hi. I'm Summer.

852
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,985
I know. We're in the same homeroom.

853
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,487
You don't have to do this.

854
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,905
Do what?

855
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,199
You don't have to be my friend.

856
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,076
I know Tushman talked to you.

857
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,078
I don't know
what you're talking about, Auggie.

858
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,206
I know Tushman talked to some kids
before school started

859
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,291
and told them
they had to be friends with me.

860
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,960
He didn't talk to me.

861
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,294
Yeah, he did.

862
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,879
No, he did not.

863
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah, he did.

864
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,382
No, he didn't, I swear on my life!

865
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,969
[Auggie] Okay, okay.
You don't have to get mad.

866
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,638
I don't like
being accused of things, okay?

867
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,265
Okay. I'm sorry.

868
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,599
You should be.

869
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,937
-He really didn't talk to you?
-Auggie!

870
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,690
Okay, I just...
Why are you sitting here then?

871
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,069
Because I want some nice friends
for a change.

872
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,196
Me too.

873
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,656
Cool beans.

874
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,576
But you'll get "the plague."

875
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,453
Good.

876
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,082
Summer has "the plague."

877
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,043
Shut up!

878
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,839
So what happened with Jack Will?

879
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,175
Promise you won't tell?

880
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,222
I got it! I got the part!

881
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,058
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. [laughs]

882
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,521
[mimicking]
She got it! She got the part! Oh, my God!

883
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,731
Bet she got Emily.

884
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,608
-Yep.
-[sighs]

885
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,734
What'd you get?

886
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,445
Emily's understudy.

887
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,950
I'm not saying poison or anything,
but just a little Benadryl

888
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,410
-to knock Miranda out before the show.
-[laughs]

889
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,621
Okay, enough.

890
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,706
Look, just learn her lines

891
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,459
and it'll give us
an excuse to hang out more.

892
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,670
We can start rehearsing the kissing scene
on Page 110.

893
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,216
Wait. George and Emily?

894
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,931
There is no Page 110.

895
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:39,646
So I'm thinking,
I really wanna kiss you right now.

896
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,773
But I don't know how you'll respond.

897
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,708
What's wrong?

898
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,673
I'm not an only child.

899
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,053
Mom?

900
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,597
One sec, Via. Auggie, let's go!

901
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,228
I thought you were at the library.

902
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,897
Uh, um...

903
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,232
Yeah, change of plans.

904
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,442
Mmm-hmm.

905
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,610
Hi, I'm Justin.

906
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,112
-I'm Isabel.
-[door opens]

907
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,324
Daisy threw up again. Bucket loads.

908
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
[Isabel] Bucket loads.

909
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,958
[Via] Um, Justin, this is
my little brother Auggie.

910
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,545
-Hey, dude!
-[Auggie] Hey.

911
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,840
What's that in your case? A machine gun?

912
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,301
[laughs]

913
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,554
Er, no. It's a fiddle.

914
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,055
You should tell people it's a machine gun.

915
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,016
That's way cooler.

916
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,059
You know what?

917
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,936
That's a great idea, you're right.

918
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,521
We're on our way to the grocery.

919
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,107
-Mom's making-- What's it called?
-Feijoada.

920
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,443
-Mom's making feijoada.
-It's Dad's favourite.

921
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,403
You're welcome to stay
if you want, Justin.

922
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,072
Oh, thank you very much.
It was nice meeting you.

923
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,073
[Isabel] Nice to meet you, too.

924
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,205
Psst. Oy! [snaps fingers]

925
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,372
Bye, Auggie.

926
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,374
Nothing to see here.

927
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,420
[door opens and closes]

928
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,968
It's a gene. Well, it's sort of two genes,
but two genes that are identical.

929
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,137
And the trouble is that both of my parents

930
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,765
carry the gene at the same time,
which is...

931
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,768
Well essentially, he won the lottery.

932
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,478
Backwards or something.

933
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:48,858
And in another world, I'd look like him.

934
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,199
I'm sorry for telling you
that I was an only child.

935
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,870
Sometimes it's nice to hide a little.

936
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,998
I get it. It's okay.

937
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,843
[Via laughing]

938
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,572
[phone ringing]

939
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,701
Hello?

940
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,327
[Miranda on phone] Major Tom, is that you?

941
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,495
Miranda!

942
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,998
[Miranda]
It's so great to hear your voice again.

943
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,542
Sorry, Via's not here.

944
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,878
[Miranda] I was actually calling
to say hello to you.

945
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,879
How have you been?

946
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,757
Good. Did you know I'm going
to a regular school now?

947
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,675
[Miranda] No way.

948
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,427
Do you like it?

949
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,512
[Auggie] Yeah, I guess.

950
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,264
It's not as hard as Mom's homeschool.

951
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,224
[chuckles] Yeah, I'll bet.

952
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,352
How are the kids? Are they nice?

953
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,188
[Auggie] No. But I made one friend.

954
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,481
Her name's Summer.

955
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,525
We started a summer names club.

956
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,029
-Summer, August. Get it?
-[chuckles]

957
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,614
Good for you, Auggie. [chuckles]

958
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,201
Um, where's Via, anyway?

959
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,911
[Auggie] She's out with her boyfriend.

960
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,956
Really?

961
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,917
[Auggie] Yeah. We met him last week.
He's super nice.

962
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,507
I've missed you, Major Tom.

963
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:38,968
[Auggie] I miss you too, Miranda.

964
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,307
And can you tell Via
that I've missed her, too?

965
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,352
[Auggie] Well, 
but why don't you just tell her yourself?

966
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:53,900
Listen, I gotta go,
my mom's calling me, but, um,

967
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,152
you know that you can call me
any time, right?

968
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,236
[Auggie] Yeah.

969
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,866
Okay, so call me any time.

970
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,284
I will.

971
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,577
Merry Christmas, Auggie.

972
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,996
Merry Christmas, Miranda.

973
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,017
[lift dings]

974
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,939
-[Nate] Get after it.
-Open it. Rip it apart.

975
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,942
[Miranda] Via and I have been best friends
since kindergarten.

976
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,652
Oh, my God!

977
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,738
[Miranda] Her family's always been 
like my second family.

978
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,657
Auggie's always felt
like my little brother.

979
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,242
-[all laugh]
-How does it feel?

980
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,411
-Awesome.
-Good.

981
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,373
[Miranda] And for a few years even our
family's spent Christmas together.

982
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,291
[Isabel] Everybody say "Merry Christmas"!

983
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,502
[all] Merry Christmas!

984
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,590
[Miranda] But now my dad's busy
with his new wife.

985
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,551
Who was his old boss.

986
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,432
And my mom, well, 
she's busy not getting over that.

987
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,396
I got a job at a summer camp.

988
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,023
Just so I'd have somewhere
to go that wasn't home.

989
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:22,697
One day, and I swear
I didn't plan this, but...

990
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,493
I started playing this little make
believe game with the girls in the camp.

991
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,373
I said I lived in a huge brownstone.

992
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,250
On a nice street.

993
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,711
With my two awesome parents.

994
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,922
And my awesome dog named Daisy.

995
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:45,219
And my awesome little brother
with a facial deformity.

996
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,683
And, oh, my God, everyone went crazy.

997
01:02:50,766 --> 01:02:52,393
"What do you mean, deformity?

998
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,853
What does he look like?"

999
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,773
Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to me.

1000
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:02,236
And by the end of summer, 
I was the most popular girl in camp.

1001
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,074
When I got home, I wanted to call Via.

1002
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:11,245
But she would've asked me about
my parents and about camp.

1003
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,583
And then I saw Via audition for the play.

1004
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,127
And I remembered how cool she is.

1005
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:24,217
And how I understood why everyone in camp
loved me more when I pretended to be her.

1006
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,513
She used to let Auggie
hang out with us all the time.

1007
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,850
I was the one who bought him
his astronaut helmet.

1008
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,771
He was so into outer space.

1009
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,858
And I wanted him to know that 
the world was bigger than his room.

1010
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:47,365
And now he's out there.
And I didn't even know.

1011
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,535
I could've helped him.

1012
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,871
Maybe he could've helped me.

1013
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,666
I don't know.

1014
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,378
But I could sure use some help right now.

1015
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,214
[indistinct conversation and laughter]

1016
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,403
[Summer and Auggie whooping]

1017
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,364
[laughing]

1018
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,414
That was awesome!

1019
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,582
[chuckles]

1020
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,501
Hey, look, there's Jack Will.

1021
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,299
Let's find another hill.

1022
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:49,719
You can't just
keep avoiding him forever, Auggie.

1023
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:50,928
Come on, let's go!

1024
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:19,165
[crowd chanting] Nine. Eight. Seven.
Six. Five. Four.

1025
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:23,753
Three. Two. One. Happy New Year!

1026
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,880
[all cheering]

1027
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:28,591
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

1028
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:48,402
[grunting]

1029
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,119
Thanks for the help, Daisy.
Way to put your back into it.

1030
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,588
[Miles] What about you?

1031
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,549
Christmas was awesome.
We drove up into the mountains

1032
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,052
where they had the most
amazing snow I've ever seen.

1033
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,637
-It was like powder.
-Nice.

1034
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,721
What about you, Jack?

1035
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,849
I went up Skeleton Hill. It was the best.

1036
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:19,976
[Amos] Skeleton Hill?

1037
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,102
I hate that place!

1038
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,603
Should be called Garbage Hill.

1039
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:23,562
I know, right?

1040
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,148
I left my old lightning sled there
last time I was up.

1041
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,901
It was the crappiest piece of junk.

1042
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,278
Went back the next day
and someone had taken it.

1043
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,072
[Julian] Hey, maybe a homeless guy
wanted to go sledding.

1044
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,907
[Miles and Amos] Yeah.

1045
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,450
[Mr Browne] New precept.

1046
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,911
Your deeds are your monuments.

1047
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,996
Archaeologists found these words inscribed

1048
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,290
on the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb.

1049
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,834
Can anybody tell me what they mean?

1050
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,129
Summer?

1051
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,214
Oh, uh...

1052
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,511
I think it means that the things we do
are the things that matter most.

1053
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,723
[Mr Browne] Excellent. Anybody else?

1054
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,477
Hey, Summer?

1055
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,731
Hey. You okay?

1056
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,859
Yeah. Fine. Just...

1057
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,195
This is gonna sound stupid, but,

1058
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,657
do you know why Auggie stopped liking me?

1059
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,076
You should ask him.

1060
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,539
I have, but ever since Halloween,
he just won't talk to me.

1061
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,835
I mean... You know what?
I don't care. Sorry.

1062
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,253
Ghostface.

1063
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,506
Wait, wait, what?

1064
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,717
That's all I can tell you.

1065
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,639
Okay.

1066
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,475
Now that we've finished our tests,

1067
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,771
I want you all to start thinking about
our fifth grade science fair projects.

1068
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:50,691
Which you will need to work on
to have ready after spring break.

1069
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,111
Okay? Now, it could be about anything.

1070
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,237
[voice fades]

1071
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,198
[inaudible]

1072
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,712
[Ms Petosa] The point is to create
something you're excited about.

1073
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,631
Something you're proud to show.

1074
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,216
Mr Will?

1075
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,593
Mr Will?

1076
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,721
Something more important to think about?

1077
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,056
No.

1078
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,183
So, it'll be teams of two.

1079
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,435
Your partner will be your tablemate.

1080
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,562
[Julian] Uh, Ms Petosa?

1081
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,856
I know we're supposed to be in pairs,

1082
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,651
but Jack, Amos and I
had this science fair project idea

1083
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:35,152
that we wanted to work on together.

1084
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,195
[Ms Petosa] Okay, maybe we can switch.

1085
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,321
Uh, no.

1086
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,697
Sorry?

1087
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,824
What?

1088
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:44,203
No, um, it's... It's okay.
I'll stay with who I've got.

1089
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,664
I'll stick with Auggie.

1090
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,879
Hey! What did you do that for?

1091
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,673
Dude, I don't want to switch.

1092
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:59,009
Why not? Do you really
wanna be partners with that freak?

1093
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,309
[inaudible]

1094
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:12,064
[Jack] Dear Mr Tushman, 
I'm very sorry for punching Julian.

1095
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,816
It was wrong of me to do that.

1096
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,318
I know you may need to expel me,

1097
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:22,324
but I'd still rather not say
why I did what I did.

1098
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,702
It might get Julian in trouble, too,

1099
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,745
-and that's not fair.
-Stop!

1100
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,248
Sincerely, Jack Will.

1101
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:36,547
[Mr Tushman] Dear Mr Will, one thing
I've learned in 20 years in education

1102
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,925
is that there are two sides
to every story.

1103
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:44,221
So I think I can imagine
what started the fight.

1104
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,143
While nothing justifies
striking another student,

1105
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,938
I know good friends are worth defending.

1106
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,942
So, after your two-day suspension

1107
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,945
your scholarship will be waiting for you.

1108
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,616
Just keep up the good work.

1109
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,285
And keep being the fine boy
we all know you to be.

1110
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:10,247
Sincerely, Mr Tushman.

1111
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,838
[Via] What's so wrong with me
not telling you about a stupid play?

1112
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,090
I'm not even in it.
I'm just doing the lights.

1113
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,008
Well, your boyfriend is in it.

1114
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:22,927
And don't you think
we would like to see him?

1115
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,886
No, I don't!

1116
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,596
Look, let's all calm down for a second.

1117
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,599
You know, you've been really good
at leaving me alone my whole life.

1118
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,352
So why are you suddenly
so interested, huh?

1119
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,063
Are... Are you bored
now that Auggie's in school?

1120
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:36,065
Your thesis not going well?

1121
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:37,900
Nate, could you please excuse us?

1122
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:39,026
-Izzy, she doesn't mean it.
-Nate!

1123
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,075
[Isabel arguing indistinctly]

1124
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,910
What are they saying down there?

1125
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,829
[Nate] They, my friend,
are saying a lot of things.

1126
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,123
None of which concern us.

1127
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,376
Let's see your new Minecraft world.

1128
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,711
'Cause we might be moving to it.

1129
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:12,101
So, are we going to see the play?

1130
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,061
Um...

1131
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:17,147
I hadn't realized what the play was

1132
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,901
and I don't think it will be of
any interest to a kid your age.

1133
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,487
Yeah, uh, you'd get totally bored.

1134
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,824
[Auggie] Are you and Dad going?

1135
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,827
Daddy'll go.
And I'm gonna stay here with you.

1136
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,662
What?

1137
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:33,706
So now you're gonna punish me
by not going?

1138
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:37,042
Well, you didn't want me to go
in the first place, remember?

1139
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:40,045
Well, now that you know about it,
of course I want you to come.

1140
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:42,089
What are you talking about?

1141
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,257
-Nothing.
-[Via] Nothing.

1142
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,096
You're lying.

1143
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:51,765
It's just something to do
with Via's school, honey.

1144
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,059
You just don't want your
fancy high school friends

1145
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,352
to know your brother's a freak, huh?

1146
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,313
-[Isabel] Auggie!
-Auggie, that's not true.

1147
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,357
Stop lying to me, I'm not an idiot,
I know what's going on!

1148
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,322
[Daisy whimpering]

1149
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,869
Daisy girl?

1150
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,872
Auggie. Come on.

1151
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,040
[Auggie] It's okay, I don't wanna go

1152
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,333
to your stupid high school anyway.
I don't care.

1153
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,253
Auggie, not everything
in the world is about you.

1154
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,421
[Via sniffles]

1155
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,630
What's wrong?

1156
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,593
[Daisy whimpers]

1157
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,268
[Daisy whimpering]

1158
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,938
You're gonna be fine, girlie.

1159
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,399
Daddy's gonna meet me there.
Take care of your brother.

1160
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,442
[Via] Yeah.

1161
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,569
Okay. All right.

1162
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,588
Did Daisy really bite Mom?

1163
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:09,718
Well, um, she was whimpering.

1164
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,347
And then Mom tried to pick her up
and Daisy bit her.

1165
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,809
Do you think the vet can fix her?

1166
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,355
She was in a lot of pain, Auggie.

1167
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,067
She's really old.

1168
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,823
Auggie?

1169
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,702
I want you to come to my play. Okay?

1170
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,330
Really?

1171
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,457
Really.

1172
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,256
[door opens]

1173
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,300
[crying]

1174
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,937
[sniffles]

1175
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:59,161
[Auggie] Every time I came home
from the hospital, Daisy was here.

1176
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,166
She was a real friend.

1177
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,130
And real friends are hard to find.

1178
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,469
[beeps]

1179
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,242
[laughs]

1180
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,406
Excuse me.

1181
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:02,409
Sorry. Thank you.

1182
01:17:06,246 --> 01:17:09,166
-This is perfect.
-Here we go. Good seats.

1183
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,376
Here. See if you can find
Via's name in there, honey.

1184
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,757
Glasses. Oh, no! [gasps]
I think I forgot my glasses.

1185
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,677
Auggie, you're missing
a great episode of Hoarders right here.

1186
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,929
-Starring your mom's purse.
-[chuckles]

1187
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,143
You ready?

1188
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,312
Are you supposed to be
in the girls' dressing room?

1189
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:31,646
Just wanted to wish you good luck.

1190
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,649
"Break a leg," not "Good luck."

1191
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,400
You too.

1192
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,320
Anyone cheering you on tonight?

1193
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:43,158
Uh, yeah, my mom invited

1194
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,160
-the entire block.
-[chuckles]

1195
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,703
It's gonna be really embarrassing.

1196
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,997
-[both chuckle]
-You?

1197
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,793
Uh, my dad is on his belated honeymoon.

1198
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,252
And my mom's in a funk.

1199
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,338
But maybe she'll come tomorrow.

1200
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:02,010
Well, um, Via's family will cheer you on.

1201
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,472
You'll be great tonight.

1202
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:19,736
-[softly] Honey, just enjoy the play.
-Okay.

1203
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,658
All right, go get 'em.

1204
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:27,327
-Mr Davenport...
-Hmm.

1205
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,579
I'm really sorry,
but I can't go on tonight.

1206
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,373
I don't feel well.
I think I might throw up.

1207
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,666
Okay, everybody gets nervous.

1208
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:33,750
You know, when I did my Hamlet,

1209
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:35,585
I threw up every night.
You're gonna be fine.

1210
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,587
Just do it. You'll have
all of spring break to recover.

1211
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,173
Mr Davenport, you're not listening.
I'm not going on.

1212
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:45,178
Are you kidding me?

1213
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:49,057
I'm really sorry, but Via
knows all the lines. She can do it.

1214
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,519
Then go find her, then.

1215
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,438
Thank you.

1216
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,190
[exhales]

1217
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,277
-Hi.
-Hi.

1218
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,366
[mellow instrumental music playing]

1219
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,331
This play is called Our Town.

1220
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,625
It was written by Thornton Wilder.

1221
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:20,881
The name of our town
is Grover's Corners, New Hampshire.

1222
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:23,925
Just across the Massachusetts line.

1223
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,469
Is this... Is this really happening?

1224
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:28,138
Yes, you're going on as Emily.
Only you don't have much time.

1225
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:30,557
Well, I don't even know
if I'm gonna remember all of my lines.

1226
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,350
You'll be great.
Justin will help you through it.

1227
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:33,268
[Mr Davenport] Where is she?

1228
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:35,562
Via, you're on in two minutes.

1229
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:37,522
Why, why are you doing this?

1230
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,192
I told you. I feel sick.

1231
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:45,864
We've got a factory in our town, too.
You hear it?

1232
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,451
-Hey, it's okay. Hey, break a leg.
-[Justin] Makes blankets.

1233
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,537
Cartwrights own it
and it brung 'em a fortune.

1234
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,294
[Mrs Webb] Children, now I won't have it.

1235
01:19:59,377 --> 01:20:01,505
Breakfast is just as good
as any other meal.

1236
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,673
And I won't have you gobbling like wolves.

1237
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,217
It'll stunt your growth. That's a fact.

1238
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:07,761
[whispers] Miranda looks so different.

1239
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:10,347
[whispers] That's not Miranda, it's Via.

1240
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,557
-What?
-It's Via.

1241
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:14,226
Oh, great.

1242
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:19,439
[Mrs Webb] As for me, I'd rather have
my children healthy than bright.

1243
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:22,150
I'm both, Mama, you know I am.

1244
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,278
I'm the brightest girl
in school for my age.

1245
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,280
I have a wonderful memory.

1246
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,949
[Mrs Webb] Eat your breakfast.

1247
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:33,954
[play continues indistinctly]

1248
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:39,543
Hmm. Your stomach flu got better fast.

1249
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,962
Sorry, sir, just jitters.

1250
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,339
I'll be ready by tomorrow night.

1251
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,299
She's doing very well.

1252
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:55,976
I can't. I can't go on.

1253
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:01,815
It... it goes so fast.

1254
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,442
We don't even have time
to look at one another.

1255
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,362
I didn't realize.

1256
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:09,990
So all that was going on
and we never noticed?

1257
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:17,289
Take me back. Up the hill. To my grave.

1258
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:23,795
But first, wait, one more look.

1259
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:30,594
Goodbye. Goodbye, world.

1260
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,723
Goodbye, Grover's Corners.

1261
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,517
Mama.

1262
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:40,020
And Papa.

1263
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:43,315
Goodbye to clocks ticking.

1264
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:49,362
And food. And coffee.

1265
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:55,368
And hot baths. And sleeping.

1266
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,538
And waking up.

1267
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:04,920
Oh, Earth...

1268
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,966
You're too wonderful
for anybody to realize you.

1269
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:17,349
[softly] Blow out the candles. Ready?

1270
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,642
Take a big breath.

1271
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:19,809
[both inhale]

1272
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,106
Ha! We did it. Did you make a wish?

1273
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,400
I wished for a brother.

1274
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,027
You did?

1275
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,112
Mmm. Wow.

1276
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,908
-Happy birthday, honey.
-[Nate chuckles]

1277
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,869
[all cheering and applauding]

1278
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:00,558
[all cheering louder]

1279
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,270
Whoo!

1280
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,151
[talking indistinctly]

1281
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:21,788
[Nate] Via!

1282
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,458
That was incredible!

1283
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:27,085
-It was just a play.
-It wasn't "just" anything.

1284
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,670
-You were amazing!
-[Auggie] You were great, Via!

1285
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,672
-Amazing!
-[Via] Oh, Auggie.

1286
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,473
[sighs]

1287
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,647
[chuckles tearfully]

1288
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,865
[Isabel] And then there was the nurse...
[Nate] Yeah.

1289
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:00,368
...who farted, and I don't use
that word a lot, about a hundred times.

1290
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,579
-Honey, that was you.
-[all laugh]

1291
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,456
To put it delicately.

1292
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,082
I don't know how else to say it.

1293
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,500
It's not true.

1294
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,377
-Busted now!
-[Isabel] No, it's not...

1295
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,462
Anyone? Raise your hand

1296
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,964
if you wanna change the subject
and save us from this story.

1297
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:16,551
All right, I will. I will.
Um, what is that?

1298
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:20,722
Oh, that is, uh, Jack and Auggie's
science fair project.

1299
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,599
Not to be confused with an eyesore

1300
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:24,142
-in the middle of the room.
-[all laugh]

1301
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,852
No, but what is it?

1302
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,813
Well, I don't know.
I guess it's like a... Yeah.

1303
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,981
Follow me, you'll see.

1304
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:31,149
Oh, okay.

1305
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:32,525
[Auggie] Come on!

1306
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:33,902
[Justin] All right.

1307
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:35,904
-Sweet.
-What?

1308
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:39,616
Are you kidding me?
I cannot believe you just did that.

1309
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:42,243
Go, go, go. Okay. But just no kissing.

1310
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,329
Seen a lot of horror movies end this way.

1311
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:49,167
We're gonna open
the apertures in three, two, one.

1312
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,800
[chuckles] It's a camera obscura.

1313
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:58,968
Yeah. He's 10.

1314
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,139
Oh, my God, that was so cool.

1315
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,141
Cinema history come to life.

1316
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,936
All right, people, single file.

1317
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:11,231
Step right up
for an amazing camera obscura.

1318
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:14,859
Step right up to witness Earth's
greatest mystery, the volcano.

1319
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,779
Okay, we're gonna open the apertures in...

1320
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:20,114
[both] Three, two, one!

1321
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,159
[kids] Whoa!
[girl] That's awesome!

1322
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,744
[beeping]

1323
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:30,041
[beeps]

1324
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,045
Jack and Auggie.

1325
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,677
[both] Dude!

1326
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:44,055
-See, you have to go...
-No, I did.

1327
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,184
[all laughing]

1328
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:54,399

1333
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,081
[Auggie] Okay, now I'll go.

1334
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:12,458
-[burps]
-[all laugh]

1335
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:19,966
[kids chattering]

1336
01:26:27,181 --> 01:26:29,350
[Mr Browne] Let's go, let's go.

1337
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,518
Everybody get in here.

1338
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:31,561
Find your seats.

1339
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,148
We good today?
It's gonna be a good one, guys.

1340
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,818
All right. Everybody inside.

1341
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,570
Come on. New month, new precept.

1342
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:42,989
-[kids laughing]
-[boy] Look at him.

1343
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,741
[Julian] Hey, where's Auggie?

1344
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:45,867
Right there.

1345
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,247
Hey, hey, hey.
Why are we running in the hallway?

1346
01:26:59,005 --> 01:26:59,923
Auggie, you okay?

1347
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:04,677
Yeah. Everything's fine.
I'm late for class.

1348
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,387
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1349
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,848
Auggie, you know if you need help
you can ask for it.

1350
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,058
You're not alone.

1351
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:11,017
I know.

1352
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,234
Amos.

1353
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,489
You know something about this?

1354
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:32,330
[Mr Tushman] You understand?

1355
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:36,292
We take bullying
very seriously at this school.

1356
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,461
There is zero tolerance.

1357
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,341
Excuse me, can you explain
what's going on here?

1358
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,928
Wasn't Julian the one
who got punched in the mouth?

1359
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:49,264
If there's any bullying going on,
it isn't my son.

1360
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:01,734
[Julian's dad] You wrote that, Julian?

1361
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,903
Yes, sir.

1362
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,240
That one note was on the back
of a class photo.

1363
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,035
Your son photoshopped Auggie out of it.

1364
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:18,543
No. No, he didn't. I did.

1365
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:21,754
Of course, I didn't think that
he would bring it to school.

1366
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:23,840
But when our friends come over
and they see that picture,

1367
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:25,967
I want them to ask about our son.
Not the Pullmans'.

1368
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,886
[Mr Tushman] Mrs Albans.

1369
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:33,349
When we pressed Auggie,
he showed us these other notes

1370
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:38,313
that your son left in his locker
and his desk.

1371
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:42,358
Chair.

1372
01:28:48,072 --> 01:28:49,657
Okay, look, if no one else is gonna

1373
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,285
have the courage to say it,
then I guess I will.

1374
01:28:52,368 --> 01:28:55,121
These kids are too young to be
dealing with this sort of thing.

1375
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:57,457
Julian has had nightmares
because of that kid.

1376
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,791
-Did you know that?
-Sarah...

1377
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,710
We had to take him to a child psychologist

1378
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,670
to help him deal with his night terrors.

1379
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,297
It's just a two-day suspension.

1380
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,092
You'll stay home
from the nature preserve trip.

1381
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,010
That's all.

1382
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:12,680
Two days for a couple of notes from a kid?

1383
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,434
After all the money that we
have poured into this school?

1384
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,103
We have a lot of friends
on the school board, Mr Tushman.

1385
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,354
Oh. [sighs]

1386
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,316
[exhales] Well, I have more.

1387
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,151
[Sarah] So, what would you have us do?

1388
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:27,612
Bend over backwards for every
single person in the world?

1389
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,491
Nobody can get their feelings hurt ever?

1390
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,911
[chuckles]
You are not doing these kids any favours.

1391
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:38,831
[sighs] Mrs Albans,
Auggie can't change the way he looks.

1392
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,920
So, maybe we can change the way we see.

1393
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,094
[Sarah] Yes.

1394
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:54,055
I will be sure to tell that
to the real world.

1395
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:58,976
Thank you for this.
We won't be back in the fall.

1396
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:05,108
Mom. I like this school.

1397
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:08,694
-Mom. I have friends, Dad.
-[sighs]

1398
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:09,654
[Julian's dad] Let's go, Julian.

1399
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:12,073
Come on.

1400
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,414
[Julian] Mr Tushman.

1401
01:30:24,043 --> 01:30:25,378
I'm really sorry.

1402
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,966
I know you are, Julian.

1403
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,890
[kids chattering excitedly]

1404
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:48,442
-He's not even looking at us.
-Oh. [chuckles]

1405
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,724
This is gonna be epic. Race you!

1406
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,184

-[all cheering]

1408
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:11,651
[people screaming]

1409
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,327
[Isabel] The sound of joy!
[Nate] Ah...

1410
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:29,418
All right. I want you to close your eyes,
because I have a surprise for you.

1411
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,506
-Do you take requests?
-[laughing]

1412
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,092
Not before 9:45.

1413
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,052
Okay.

1414
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,513
Open your eyes.

1415
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,226
No! You... you finished your thesis?

1416
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,103
-Let's get drunk.
-[both laugh]

1417
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:49,355
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1418
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:54,360
Wait a minute.
A double surprise, surprise.

1419
01:32:55,361 --> 01:32:56,320
Okay.

1420
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,614
-Go ahead.
-Nothing's gonna

1421
01:32:58,698 --> 01:32:59,907
-jump out at me, is it?
-No.

1422
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,743
Giving me the eyes. [chuckles]

1423
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,079
What's in here? I'm kind of scared...

1424
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:06,497
[laughing]

1425
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:09,000
Good, right?

1426
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:12,086
I'm just gonna keep that
in the box for now.

1427
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:15,089
Does that merit a kiss? Come here.

1428
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,300
[Isabel] More than a kiss.

1429
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,218
Thank you.

1430
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:24,724
[man] All right, kids! Let's give a big

-Hello.

-Yay!

1441
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,086
[whispers] Hey, dude.
You wanna go outside?

1442
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,171
[whispers] Why?

1443
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:57,423
We can watch this movie anytime.

1444
01:33:57,506 --> 01:33:59,175
[movie continues playing]

1445
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,271
[Auggie and Jack laughing]

1446
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:16,650
Aw, man, I need to pee.

1447
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:18,361
Wanna go back?

1448
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:20,154
Nah, I'll just go over here.

1449
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:22,448
Like in the subways? That's gross.

1450
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:24,700
No. This is gross.

1451
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,328
[inhales and burps]

1452
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,080
[both laugh]

1453
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,378
Look at that.

1454
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,713
What? What are you looking at?

1455
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,384
I'm going up there someday.

1456
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:45,179
Well, I'm going down here right now, so...

1457
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:46,931
I gotta go, too, now.

1458
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:50,101
You go there. I'll go here. Don't look.

1459
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,560
[kids chattering]

1460
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:53,187
[Eddie] What do we got here?

1461
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:55,398
Couple of losers stinking up the woods.

1462
01:34:56,732 --> 01:35:00,152
-[gasps]
-Holy crap! Look at his face!

1463
01:35:00,236 --> 01:35:01,445
[boy] He's a freak!

1464
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,864
[Eddie] Jesus, I've never seen
anything that ugly in my life.

1465
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:04,865
[boy] Maybe it's an orc.

1466
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,492
-Dude, let's go.
-[Eddie] Go where?

1467
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,160
Hey, talking to you, Gollum.

1468
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:11,163
This the one mask to rule them all?
My precious.

1469
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:12,832
Hey, what's your problem?

1470
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:17,503
[groans]

1471
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:18,754
[Eddie] Your boyfriend's my problem.

1472
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,840
[Auggie] Hey! Leave him alone.

1473
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:22,800
[scoffs] What are you gonna do about it?

1474
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:25,845
-Get outta my way.
-No.

1475
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,596
[Eddie] I said get outta my way!

1476
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,099
I said no! [grunts]

1477
01:35:30,182 --> 01:35:31,350
[Amos] Yo, Jack, what's up, man?

1478
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,477
[Eddie] What's this? More little freaks?

1479
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,895
What you call us, hick?

1480
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:36,063
Come on, prep boy.

1481
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:38,357
[grunting]

[girl] Guys, stop!

1483
01:35:42,653 --> 01:35:43,779
Guys, stop it!

1484
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:46,532
Guys, stop!

1485
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:49,285
Just stop, please! Stop!

1486

[Auggie grunts]

1488
01:35:55,749 --> 01:35:59,378
Oh, man! Dude! Come on! Let's go!

1489
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,671
Let's get out!

1490
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,635
[both panting]

1491
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,474
-[Auggie] Are you okay?
-Uh...

1492
01:36:11,557 --> 01:36:13,142
Dude, you're bleeding.

1493
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:14,643
[rustling]

1494
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:16,645
What was that? Something's coming.

1495
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,398
Amos?

1496
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:20,566
[Amos] Jack!

1497
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:22,526
[Jack] Over here!
[Auggie] Amos, come on!

1498
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,489
They follow you?

1499
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,907
I think we lost 'em.

1500
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:30,159
Whoa!

1501
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,578
[all laughing]

1502
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,290
[Jack] How did you guys
know we needed help?

1503
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:37,791
We saw them follow you out of the lodge.

1504
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,544
I think they were seventh graders.
They were huge.

1505
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:42,588
-[all laugh]
-Thanks, guys.

1506
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,674
You totally saved our butts.

1507
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,343
Yeah, thanks, guys.

1508
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:54,183
You know, it was cool
how you stood your ground, little dude.

1509
01:37:01,774 --> 01:37:02,858
[sniffles]

-[fireworks bursting]
-[kids cheering]

1512
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:20,019
[Isabel] Hi!

1513
01:38:20,102 --> 01:38:23,355
Oh, my gosh, I missed you so much! Mmm.

1514
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,316
-See you later, Auggie!
-[Auggie] Bye!

1515
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:26,275
How are you?

1516
01:38:26,358 --> 01:38:28,110
Good. And guess what? I got in a fight.

1517
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:30,779
[gasps] Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
Are you okay?

1518
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:31,864
What happened?

1519
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,490
[Isabel] Auggie got in a fight.

1520
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,535
[Nate] That's terrible. I'm sorry.

1521
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,871
-Did you win?
-Nate!

1522
01:38:38,954 --> 01:38:41,707
Well, I'm getting a vibe
like maybe he won.

1523
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,626
Did you?

1524
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:47,087
Yeah. And guess what?
They were seventh graders.

1525
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:49,089
-[mimics explosion]
-Yes!

1526
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,549
[Miles] See you later, buddy!

1527
01:38:50,633 --> 01:38:51,467
Bye!

1528
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,095
[Nate] Fighting is bad, Auggie.

1529
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,640
-Bye, Mr and Mrs P.
-[Nate] Goodbye.

1530
01:38:57,723 --> 01:38:59,558
See you at graduation, Auggie.

1531
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:05,981
Looking sharp.

1532
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:07,149
Thanks, Dad.

1533
01:39:07,232 --> 01:39:08,651
I'm talking about me.

1534
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:11,945
Hey! Ah, you look good, too.

1535
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:16,700
I think it's safe to say
the Pullman men are crushing it today.

1536
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:22,748
-You've come a long way, huh?
-Yeah.

1537
01:39:25,834 --> 01:39:29,421
Auggie, I am proud of you
for sticking it out.

1538
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:30,964
You didn't think I would, did you?

1539
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:32,424
'Course I did.

1540
01:39:35,427 --> 01:39:36,387
Okay, well, come on.

1541
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,847
You gotta admit
when you started you were still wearing

1542
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:40,849
the astronaut helmet in public.

1543
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,728
I love that helmet.
I wish I knew where it was.

1544
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:49,817
It's in my office.

1545
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,654
What? Dad! That was a gift.
You had no right to hide it!

1546
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,531
Auggie, Auggie, please, don't be mad.

1547
01:39:55,614 --> 01:39:58,951
You gotta understand,
you were wearing it all the time.

1548
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,744
I never got to see you any more.

1549
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,996
I missed your face.

1550
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,791
I know you don't always like it,
but I love it.

1551
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,918
It's my son's face.

1552
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,631
I wanna see it.

1553
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:16,802
Do you forgive me?

1554
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,053
No.

1555
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,057
Yes.

1556
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,394
Does Mom know?

1557
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,062
[whispers] No. God, no, she'd kill me.

1558
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,608
But I can maybe find it,
if you need it back.

1559
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:32,735
That's okay.

1560
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,165
[choir singing]
Follow the day 

1561
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:51,336
Follow the day and reach for the sun!

1562
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,548
You don't see me flyin' to the red

1563
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:57,593
One more you're done

1564
01:40:57,676 --> 01:40:59,678
Just follow the day and...

1565
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,764
-[whispers] Mom.
-[whispers] Yes?

1566
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:03,056
Thank you.

1567
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:05,893
For what?

1568
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:07,603
Making me go to school.

1569
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:13,025
I was so mad at you sometimes.

1570
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:15,110
But I'm really happy to be here.

1571
01:41:17,654 --> 01:41:19,281
You really are a wonder, Auggie.

1572
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:22,284
You are a wonder.

1573
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,370
Follow the day

1574
01:41:27,706 --> 01:41:32,085
Follow the day and reach for the sun!

1575
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,265
Whoo! [chuckles]

1576
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:46,934
Thank you, choir.

1577
01:41:47,976 --> 01:41:49,269
That was beautiful.

1578
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:55,984
Ladies, gentlemen,
boys and girls, graduates.

1579
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:02,157
Final award this morning
is the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1580
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:08,080
to honour students
who have been notable or exemplary.

1581
01:42:09,122 --> 01:42:13,836
Usually, it's a "good works,"
a service award.

1582
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:18,215
But I came upon a passage that he wrote,

1583
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:21,510
which made me realize that good works

1584
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:24,388
come in many forms.

1585
01:42:26,765 --> 01:42:28,600
"Greatness," he wrote,

1586
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:31,979
"lies not in being strong

1587
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:36,984
but in the right using of strength.

1588
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:41,280
He or she is the greatest

1589
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:45,534
whose strength carries up the most hearts

1590
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:50,080
by the attraction of his own."

1591
01:42:54,126 --> 01:43:00,215
Without further ado, this year,
I am very proud

1592
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:04,845
to award the Henry Ward Beecher medal

1593
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:08,390
to the student whose quiet strength

1594
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:11,977
has carried up the most hearts.

1595
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,730
So,

1596
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:18,567
will August Pullman please come
up here to receive this award?

1597
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,736
[all cheering and applauding]

1598
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:26,325
Whoo!

1599
01:43:52,809 --> 01:43:54,311
You're the best, dude!

1600
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:03,737
[Auggie] Walking up towards 
that stage, I felt like I was floating.

1601
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:06,323
My heart was beating so fast.

1602
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:09,660
I didn't really understand
why I was getting a medal.

1603
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,037
It's not like I blew up the Death Star.

1604
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:17,250
All I did was get through fifth grade, 
just like everyone else here.

1605
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:18,377
Congratulations.

1606
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:22,839
Here you go. That's for you.

1607
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,342
[Auggie] Then again, 
maybe that's kind of the point.

1608
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:30,722
Maybe the truth is,
I'm really not so ordinary.

1609
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:34,851
Maybe if we knew 
what other people were thinking

1610
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:37,312
we'd know that no one's ordinary.

1611
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:41,692
And we all deserve a standing ovation
at least once in our lives.

1612
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:45,028
My friends do.

1613
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:51,243
My teachers do.

1614
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:54,746
My sister does
for always being there for me.

1615
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:59,167
My dad does for always making us laugh.

1616
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,170
And my mom does the most.

1617
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,090
For never giving up. On anything.

1618
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:06,341
Especially me.

1619
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:11,972
It's like that last precept
Mr Browne gave us.

1620
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,642
Be kind, 
for everyone is fighting a hard battle.

1621
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:19,104
And if you really wanna see
what people are,

1622
01:45:20,313 --> 01:45:24,276
all you have to do... is look.
