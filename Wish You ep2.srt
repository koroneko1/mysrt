What are you doing?

3
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,920
I guess I was mistaken.

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,759
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,549
Sang Yi. Over here.

6
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,379
Oh, okay.

7
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,170
Did everyone go home?

8
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,340
Yes, we called it a night.

9
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,709
So? Did it go well?

10
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,299
Did you take a photo with him?

11
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,670
You're so timid, aren't you?

12
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,879
Hey. Are you working?

13
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,420
I'll send you a video,
so check it now and let's talk.

14
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,129
Yes. I want to hear your opinion.

15
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,090
Okay.

16
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,169
Kang In Su. Do you want to make
music with me?

17
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,509
I like your songs.

18
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,419

Hey. Do you take me as an amateur?

46
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,379
You used the hook as the intro.
Must I keep listening?

47
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,339
Aren't you guys sick of making

Ma'am.

Thank you, ma'am!

70
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,959
- He's so handsome.
- I edited today's video.

71
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,959
- Check it out.
- Is that him?

72
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,839
- He's good-looking.
- I know.

73
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,879
- I know.
- Go ask for his number.

74
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,379
I'm too shy.

75
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,589
Why don't you ask him?

76
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,589
What are you talking about?

77
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,959
Here.

78
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,459
It's a special coffee
for today's star.

79
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,920
- You can leave it there.
- Come on, you're upsetting me.

80
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,959
Go on and taste it.

81
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,709
Isn't this place nice?

82
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:52,589
Yes.

83
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,089
I come here sometimes to walk
when I feel frustrated.

84
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,759
It's a hot place that I haven't told
anyone about,

85
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,839
and I'm showing it
especially to you.

86
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,050
Thank you.

87
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,259
There's a reason
why I brought you here.

88
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,420
Sang Yi.

89
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,509
I'm not good at
beating around the bush,

90
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:14,589
so I'll just say it.

91
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,800
Okay. What is it?

92
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:23,259
Do you want to do it with me?

93
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,379
Do you even feel thankful to me?

94
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,460
Why are you so cranky today?

95
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,299
Who made my cute Min Seong so angry?

96
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,379
Let go, In Su.
Before I punch you in the face.

97
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,710
Gosh, Min Seong. You're scaring me.

98
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,299
I told you to let go of me.

99
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,799
Excuse me. Can you...

100
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,509
Can you give me your number?

101
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,960
I really mustered up the courage
to come to ask you.

102
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,629
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- He does.

103
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:10,379
He has a girlfriend,
and he'll get married soon.

104
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,299
Oh... I'm sorry.

105
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,169
Hey. What are you talking about?
What girlfriend?

106
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,460
You're about to become a huge star.

107
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,509
You can't waste your time
dating someone.

108
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,340
No way.

109
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,759
Min Seong.

110
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,799
You really are my manager.

111
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,549
- You little...
- Hey.

112
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,960
Come on, seriously.

113
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,629
This has really become
a habit of yours.

114
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,960
- Hey, let go.
- You punk.

115
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,460
You can't date anyone. Let go.

116
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,549
Go get her back.

117
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,919
You're about to rip my cheeks off.

118
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,840
- I told you to let go.
- Let go.

119
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,129
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Kang In Su?

120
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,759
Surprise.

121
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,299
Sang Yi. I'd like to propose to you
officially.

122
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,090
Sorry?

123
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,799
To become an assistant
of the Planning Team.

124
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,340
You'll be paid twice
your current pay...

125
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,879
for the "Kang In Su Project".

126
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,840
Oh.

127
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,379
Why don't you stop working
part-time...

128
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,509
and work for me
as a regular employee?

129
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,960
Well...

130
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,460
Was the offer too shocking?

131
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,509
Are you saying...

132
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,169
- I've been hired as a regular...
- Oh, wait.

133
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,379
Hello?

134
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,509
Oh, okay. Thank you.

135
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,759
Okay.

136
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,549
Kang In Su, you're mine now!

137
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,629
Shall we go back to the office?

138
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,799
I'll try my best!

139
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,299
Hey. Isn't he pretty good at
playing the piano?

140
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,549
(Wish You)
