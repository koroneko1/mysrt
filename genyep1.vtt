A Campus Junior Beau and a Beau of Science Faculty on this

00:04:49.290  --> 00:04:50.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
One is so handsome, like an angel


00:04:50.450  --> 00:04:52.909 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and the other is also cute and charming.

00:05:22.580  --> 00:05:24.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle

Mark. Freshman Moon of Engineering Faculty.


00:05:42.790  --> 00:05:44.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Many people have their eyes on him.


00:05:44.200  --> 00:05:45.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But nobody has gotten him yet.


00:05:48.540  --> 00:05:50.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ahem!


00:05:51.700  --> 00:05:53.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is this? P'Jack. P'Jew.


00:05:53.620  --> 00:05:55.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Special benefit from the faculty,

00:05:58.540  --> 00:06:00.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Which faculty is he from, Jew?


00:06:00.200  --> 00:06:02.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cheer for me!


00:06:03.080  --> 00:06:05.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle

00:06:24.450  --> 00:06:26.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle

00:06:26.200  --> 00:06:27.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle

belle from those.


00:06:29.540  --> 00:06:31.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They keep flirting with you!


00:06:31.870  --> 00:06:33.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If any of them gets hurt by you,


00:06:33.750  --> 00:06:36.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
hand them over to us, we will treat them well.


00:06:37.450  --> 00:06:39.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry sir,


00:06:39.250  --> 00:06:40.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
there won't be anyone getting hurt.


00:06:40.700  --> 00:06:44.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cause I am super duper single. Guaranteed.


00:06:44.750  --> 00:06:46.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Really?


00:06:46.750  --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you lying?


00:06:48.950  --> 00:06:50.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I didn't lie to you.


00:06:50.370  --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just, I really don’t have one yet. Trust me!


00:06:52.620  --> 00:06:53.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's lying.


00:06:58.159  --> 00:07:00.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've never met the right one yet.


00:07:21.620  --> 00:07:24.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This theory's been called….


00:07:34.540  --> 00:07:36.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello professor.


00:07:39.700  --> 00:07:42.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Although this class is mixed with others faculties,


00:07:42.200  --> 00:07:45.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It would be good if you could come on time, please.


00:07:48.040  --> 00:07:49.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm sorry, Professor.


00:07:55.700  --> 00:07:56.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait.


00:08:08.950  --> 00:08:10.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nice flowers.


00:08:13.910  --> 00:08:14.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thanks.


00:08:34.289  --> 00:08:35.539 position:50% line:94% align:middle

00:08:35.539  --> 00:08:37.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That is for congratulating me, right?


00:08:38.580  --> 00:08:39.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not funny!


00:08:39.950  --> 00:08:42.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just a little joke, don't be so dramatic.


00:08:42.450  --> 00:08:44.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P'Pha, he's so full of package.


00:08:44.330  --> 00:08:46.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is there anything for me?


00:08:46.040  --> 00:08:48.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let me remind you that I'm your best friend bro!


00:08:49.580  --> 00:08:50.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, you know...


00:08:50.580  --> 00:08:52.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm going to treat you to dinner.


00:08:52.410  --> 00:08:53.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hah! Really?


00:08:54.410  --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes.


00:08:55.450  --> 00:08:59.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pha wanna celebrate you cause you got a beau award next to
him.


00:09:00.950  --> 00:09:02.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But it's alright if you can’t go.


00:09:02.120  --> 00:09:03.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ofcourse I'll go!


00:09:03.250  --> 00:09:05.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since you let me be a fishbone in your throat.


00:09:05.790  --> 00:09:09.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know what? I'll sit in the middle, between you and P'Pha.


00:09:10.950  --> 00:09:13.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who told you that it's gonna be only me and P'Pha?


00:09:15.370  --> 00:09:17.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P'Pha's best friend will also join us!


00:09:18.620  --> 00:09:20.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pha's best friend?


00:09:21.000  --> 00:09:22.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who?


00:09:22.040  --> 00:09:25.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! If you're bringing someone else,


00:09:25.080  --> 00:09:28.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
make sure he's worthy enough of my honourary  beauty award okay?


00:09:35.000  --> 00:09:36.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it him?


00:09:38.040  --> 00:09:39.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If Dr. Pharawee is the face.


00:09:39.950  --> 00:09:43.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Then, Dr. Kamjornkit must be the brain of the Medicine Faculty.


00:09:45.000  --> 00:09:46.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dr. Kit got top scores in every classes.


00:09:46.790  --> 00:09:48.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's the god of the faculty


00:09:53.950  --> 00:09:56.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's not only smart, but is very kind as well.


00:09:56.830  --> 00:09:59.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's why he's loved and respected by everyone.


00:10:07.000  --> 00:10:09.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He is the best friend of P'Pha.


00:10:09.120  --> 00:10:10.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So can you promise me...


00:10:10.790  --> 00:10:14.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
that you won't annoy him or do anything ridiculous to him?


00:11:14.910  --> 00:11:15.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kid!


00:11:17.370  --> 00:11:18.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah I'm talking to you, kid!


00:11:23.540  --> 00:11:25.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm Mark,


00:11:25.450  --> 00:11:26.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
from the Engineering Faculty.


00:11:26.870  --> 00:11:28.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I am the Campus Beau of this year.


00:11:52.080  --> 00:11:53.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I've come to see Dr. Pha.


00:11:53.700  --> 00:11:54.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you know him?


00:11:55.120  --> 00:11:57.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Freshman…


00:11:57.040  --> 00:11:59.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
what kind of right do you think you have to call me kid?


00:11:59.410  --> 00:12:02.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I address everyone who looks young as "Nong".


00:12:02.500  --> 00:12:04.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But if you want me to call you by your name,


00:12:04.160  --> 00:12:06.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
just introduce yourself to me, "kid"


00:12:09.250  --> 00:12:11.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Open your eyes!


00:12:11.160  --> 00:12:13.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And know that I am your senior!


00:12:13.450  --> 00:12:15.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't be a jackass calling me "nong" again.


00:12:16.660  --> 00:12:18.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, P'Kit.


00:12:19.250  --> 00:12:21.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I knew it.


00:12:21.540  --> 00:12:23.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm just messing with you.


00:12:23.790  --> 00:12:25.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't mind me, please.


00:12:25.330  --> 00:12:27.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't let me hear it again.


00:12:28.450  --> 00:12:30.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pha's already picked up Wayu.


00:12:30.040  --> 00:12:31.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You came late,


00:12:31.540  --> 00:12:32.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just join them at the restaurant.


00:12:32.750  --> 00:12:33.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait.


00:12:34.370  --> 00:12:35.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can I go with you, please.


00:12:36.200  --> 00:12:37.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you have a car?


00:12:37.040  --> 00:12:38.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, I do.


00:12:38.000  --> 00:12:39.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But I don’t know the way.


00:12:39.870  --> 00:12:42.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please… we're going the same way anyways.


00:12:42.250  --> 00:12:44.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Have mercy on a freshman, please.


00:12:47.910  --> 00:12:48.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Give me your phone.


00:12:57.450  --> 00:12:58.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Unlock it!


00:13:11.200  --> 00:13:13.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's the only mercy I can show you.


00:13:36.200  --> 00:13:38.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're the one who set my GPS,


00:13:38.160  --> 00:13:39.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
why did you just get here?


00:13:43.540  --> 00:13:45.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I drove behind you and saw that you made the wrong turn.


00:13:45.330  --> 00:13:47.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and saw that you did another wrong turn.


00:13:47.290  --> 00:13:49.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even when I wanted to tell you, I didn't know how.


00:13:49.290  --> 00:13:50.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't have your number.


00:13:50.790  --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Should we have each other's number?


00:13:52.290  --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
In case of an emergency?


00:14:00.250  --> 00:14:02.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can you stop disturbing me!


00:14:02.000  --> 00:14:03.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not disturbing you.


00:14:03.580  --> 00:14:05.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But you're standing in my way.


00:14:05.540  --> 00:14:07.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not.


00:14:07.000  --> 00:14:08.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But…


00:14:13.040  --> 00:14:14.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's written here "Pull" not "Push"


00:14:14.870  --> 00:14:17.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If I enter and break the door.


00:14:17.250  --> 00:14:18.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It'll be your responsibiity.


00:14:21.040  --> 00:14:22.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
After you...


00:14:28.040  --> 00:14:29.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit! Mark!


00:14:29.250  --> 00:14:30.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This way.


00:14:33.870  --> 00:14:35.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can't sit here.


00:14:35.870  --> 00:14:37.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's reserved.


00:14:55.790  --> 00:14:56.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where's Pha?


00:14:57.870  --> 00:15:00.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P'Pha is outside, on the phone with someone from home.


00:15:00.040  --> 00:15:02.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But he said we can start eating.


00:15:02.250  --> 00:15:03.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't wait for him.


00:15:04.910  --> 00:15:05.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey!


00:15:06.830  --> 00:15:09.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't be nosy!


00:15:25.540  --> 00:15:27.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So, P'Kit likes to eat liver?


00:15:30.370  --> 00:15:31.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can eat anything.


00:15:31.790  --> 00:15:33.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mind your own business.


00:15:35.950  --> 00:15:38.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's good if you can eat anything.


00:15:38.160  --> 00:15:39.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So my heart…


00:15:41.370  --> 00:15:43.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll give it to you okay?


00:15:50.580  --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you don't eat it.


00:15:52.660  --> 00:15:54.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can I get an onion, please?
(onion = homophone with kiss in Thai)


00:15:56.660  --> 00:15:58.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I mean the onion on your plate.


00:16:07.120  --> 00:16:08.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu.


00:16:08.120  --> 00:16:10.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry, I totally forgot about taking care of you.


00:16:10.910  --> 00:16:12.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here you go.


00:16:12.790  --> 00:16:14.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Phalo Egg.


00:16:16.000  --> 00:16:17.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P'Kit… Do you want some?


00:16:17.950  --> 00:16:19.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if it's too dark…


00:16:19.370  --> 00:16:21.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But it's nice.


00:16:30.620  --> 00:16:32.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Excuse me. Have you ordered drinks yet?


00:16:32.500  --> 00:16:35.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
May I have a "taro" juice for him, please?
(Taro = Homophone with ‘intrude’ in Thai)


00:16:35.790  --> 00:16:39.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry, sir. We don't have the Taro juice on our menu,


00:16:39.450  --> 00:16:41.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So may I have Longan juice instead, please?
(Longan means ‘be annoying’ in Thai)


00:16:41.830  --> 00:16:42.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
For me


00:16:42.950  --> 00:16:44.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want the Coconut water, please.


00:16:44.250  --> 00:16:45.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, could you possibly serve me a whole coconut?


00:16:45.410  --> 00:16:49.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cause I would throw it at some kid's contradicting head around


00:16:49.040  --> 00:16:50.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
May I have a young coconut, please?


00:16:50.950  --> 00:16:52.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Since this elder seems to like


00:16:52.620  --> 00:16:54.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
something younger.


00:16:59.080  --> 00:17:01.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ahh… Here comes P'Pha.


00:17:06.200  --> 00:17:09.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
P'Pha. This meal will make you broke.


00:17:09.040  --> 00:17:11.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Because both of us and your friend


00:17:11.250  --> 00:17:12.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
won't stop ordering food.


00:17:16.119  --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you know Pha! It won't hurt his pocket!


00:17:18.329  --> 00:17:19.869 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You can even take away home.


00:17:20.750  --> 00:17:23.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I want boiled egg fried in a sweet sauce.
(This food’s been called ‘son-in-law egg’)


00:17:23.700  --> 00:17:25.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But not for me actually.


00:17:25.410  --> 00:17:26.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's for this elder


00:17:26.450  --> 00:17:28.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so he can take it home to his parents.


00:17:30.870  --> 00:17:32.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay, sir.


00:17:50.450  --> 00:17:52.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Will you go back home or your dormitory today?


00:17:53.080  --> 00:17:54.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dorm.


00:17:54.620  --> 00:17:57.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's too late and I don’t like Pha driving too far.


00:17:57.000  --> 00:18:00.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whoa! Why don't you rest at Pha's dorm tonight?


00:18:00.040  --> 00:18:01.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I have my own.


00:18:01.620  --> 00:18:03.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll go back to my place.


00:18:03.330  --> 00:18:05.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why do I need to go to Pha's?


00:18:05.200  --> 00:18:07.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But you guys are boyfriends.


00:18:07.370  --> 00:18:10.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh…. Or…


00:18:10.120  --> 00:18:11.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You haven’t done it …. yet?


00:18:14.830  --> 00:18:16.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Really?


00:18:16.250  --> 00:18:18.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I really respect Pha.


00:18:18.410  --> 00:18:19.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seeing each other for a long time.


00:18:19.700  --> 00:18:21.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How can he still let you survive?


00:18:25.580  --> 00:18:28.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Look! You should start it first.


00:18:29.250  --> 00:18:30.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What!


00:18:30.250  --> 00:18:32.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What kind of person do you think I am?


00:18:32.160  --> 00:18:34.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Look at you!


00:18:34.040  --> 00:18:36.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you still act careless and let him go…


00:18:36.660  --> 00:18:38.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't blame me saying that I didn't warn you.


00:18:39.410  --> 00:18:42.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No way. I trust Pha!


00:18:45.750  --> 00:18:47.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Trust Pha?


00:18:54.330  --> 00:18:55.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm gonna go now.


00:18:55.370  --> 00:18:56.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:18:56.660  --> 00:18:57.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
By the way.


00:18:57.910  --> 00:19:00.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You messed with Kit too much today.


00:19:00.040  --> 00:19:01.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lower it down.


00:19:01.330  --> 00:19:02.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Think about me, please.


00:19:02.830  --> 00:19:04.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's Pha’s best friend, okay?


00:19:05.620  --> 00:19:06.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go home bro.


00:19:06.540  --> 00:19:07.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:19:08.200  --> 00:19:09.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
There… here he comes.


00:19:11.080  --> 00:19:12.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
See you.


00:19:12.080  --> 00:19:13.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bye.


00:19:13.080  --> 00:19:14.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't forget what I told you.


00:19:14.040  --> 00:19:15.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Got it.


00:19:21.500  --> 00:19:23.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry, Yu…


00:19:23.040  --> 00:19:26.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
About Kit, I can’t promise.


00:19:40.250  --> 00:19:42.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Everyone, take a break, take a break, please.


00:19:42.910  --> 00:19:44.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So sweaty and tired.


00:19:44.290  --> 00:19:45.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's relax and have Viva Plus.


00:19:45.660  --> 00:19:47.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on! Come on!


00:19:47.160  --> 00:19:49.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Everyone got it right? Over there?


00:19:52.830  --> 00:19:54.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You guys are good?


00:19:54.370  --> 00:19:55.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's true.


00:19:55.750  --> 00:19:58.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Just suck it and get 8 types of vitamin.


00:19:58.830  --> 00:20:02.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mainly sponsored by Wayu’s father.


00:20:04.200  --> 00:20:07.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm. Why do I feel like we are watching an advertisement?


00:20:07.620  --> 00:20:09.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah. You're right.


00:20:09.290  --> 00:20:11.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay. Everyone.


00:20:11.080  --> 00:20:11.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oops.


00:20:11.950  --> 00:20:16.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Our big senior will come to visit us here at our department
today.


00:20:16.330  --> 00:20:19.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please welcome Booko.


00:20:24.000  --> 00:20:25.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello


00:20:25.200  --> 00:20:27.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello! Hello!


00:20:27.620  --> 00:20:29.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What year did you graduated, sis?


00:20:29.910  --> 00:20:31.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What was that stupid question?


00:20:31.290  --> 00:20:32.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's already nonsense geez!


00:20:32.290  --> 00:20:35.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It’s enough to know that I'm the senior!


00:20:35.250  --> 00:20:37.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Understood right children?


00:20:40.330  --> 00:20:42.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is that Campus moon?


00:20:42.540  --> 00:20:44.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes.


00:20:45.120  --> 00:20:46.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is it sis?


00:20:48.040  --> 00:20:49.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come here… Let’s clean your face.


00:20:49.410  --> 00:20:51.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Woah! So obvious!


00:20:51.290  --> 00:20:53.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And for you, Let me clean it.


00:20:53.160  --> 00:20:55.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry that I came so late.


00:20:55.200  --> 00:20:58.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But it's okay. Once you finished the photo shoot,


00:20:58.040  --> 00:20:59.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
just come and get the water splash fish ball in my car okay?


00:20:59.830  --> 00:21:00.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sis!


00:21:00.410  --> 00:21:01.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Does it need to be in the car?


00:21:01.450  --> 00:21:02.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes


00:21:02.620  --> 00:21:04.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Oh dear! Sis!
- What!


00:21:04.080  --> 00:21:05.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is an academy.


00:21:05.580  --> 00:21:07.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You should bring it down a notch, sis.


00:21:07.450  --> 00:21:09.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But if he asks, I'll pay!


00:21:10.790  --> 00:21:12.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oops! I mean sway, baby.


00:21:12.830  --> 00:21:14.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Damn! It's all been revealed!


00:21:18.160  --> 00:21:20.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seven ways to smoothly bait your darling.


00:21:21.080  --> 00:21:23.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Seven ways to smoothly bait your darling!


00:21:26.040  --> 00:21:27.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What are you reading bro?


00:21:29.450  --> 00:21:30.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah! Just like what you said!


00:21:34.580  --> 00:21:36.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those things you told me last night.


00:21:37.120  --> 00:21:38.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I thought about it.


00:21:39.750  --> 00:21:41.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was overthinking


00:21:41.500  --> 00:21:42.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
until I couldn't sleep.


00:21:44.120  --> 00:21:46.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cause I… don't wanna lose Pha.


00:21:50.040  --> 00:21:53.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I think, this is useless though.


00:21:55.370  --> 00:21:56.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here, listen!


00:21:58.580  --> 00:22:00.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let me help you myself.


00:22:00.040  --> 00:22:01.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Will you?


00:22:01.750  --> 00:22:04.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 



00:22:06.040  --> 00:22:07.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What're you doing!


00:22:09.250  --> 00:22:12.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why do you have to be rude to me, Yu?


00:22:12.500  --> 00:22:15.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark! Stop it! You're so creepy! Piss off!


00:22:15.080  --> 00:22:16.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who's Mark?


00:22:16.330  --> 00:22:17.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm Pha.


00:22:17.700  --> 00:22:19.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you remember me?


00:22:21.040  --> 00:22:24.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Should I have to remind you again.


00:22:24.200  --> 00:22:25.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm?


00:22:25.200  --> 00:22:27.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You asshole, Mark!


00:22:27.040  --> 00:22:29.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That thing you just read.


00:22:29.250  --> 00:22:31.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's only a  theory.


00:22:31.620  --> 00:22:32.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I think..


00:22:32.620  --> 00:22:35.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We better skip it and head straight to the practical step.


00:22:35.500  --> 00:22:36.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark..


00:22:36.330  --> 00:22:37.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're stupid!


00:22:37.200  --> 00:22:38.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let me go. Mark!


00:22:39.250  --> 00:22:41.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! guys!


00:22:42.160  --> 00:22:43.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is  the activity room!


00:22:44.950  --> 00:22:47.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's not like what you saw Kit.


00:22:47.660  --> 00:22:48.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah. Well,


00:22:49.830  --> 00:22:53.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I just gave him a lesson to apply with Pha.


00:22:54.830  --> 00:22:56.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your lesson looks so real to me.


00:22:56.750  --> 00:22:58.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You seem to know.


00:22:58.200  --> 00:23:00.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What real looks like


00:23:06.080  --> 00:23:08.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I was  passing by  here,


00:23:08.370  --> 00:23:10.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So Pha asked me to give this to you.


00:23:10.580  --> 00:23:11.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thank you, sir.


00:23:12.660  --> 00:23:13.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I gotta go now.


00:23:13.700  --> 00:23:15.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey, P'kit.


00:23:15.660  --> 00:23:17.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please don't go yet.


00:23:17.700  --> 00:23:19.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I told you.


00:23:19.000  --> 00:23:20.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't ask for trouble.


00:23:21.450  --> 00:23:22.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's an adult's thing.


00:23:23.040  --> 00:23:24.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Nothing to do with an innocent child.


00:23:24.410  --> 00:23:25.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Back off.


00:23:33.620  --> 00:23:34.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh!


00:23:34.790  --> 00:23:38.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And don’t forget the thing I just taught you. Do it with Pha tonight.


00:23:41.040  --> 00:23:42.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Virgin no more.


00:23:43.290  --> 00:23:45.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You cheeky bugger! Just go!


00:24:00.250  --> 00:24:01.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit.


00:24:02.330  --> 00:24:03.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is that faculty?


00:24:03.790  --> 00:24:05.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Read it yourself.


00:24:06.250  --> 00:24:07.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whoa…


00:24:07.500  --> 00:24:08.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not gentle at all.


00:24:08.950  --> 00:24:10.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm a freshman.


00:24:10.660  --> 00:24:12.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're a sophomore, can't you suggest me something?


00:24:12.700  --> 00:24:14.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're not even from my faculty.


00:24:14.790  --> 00:24:16.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not my business.


00:24:16.660  --> 00:24:18.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go away and ask your own senior.


00:24:18.790  --> 00:24:19.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No.


00:24:19.830  --> 00:24:21.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
See. I totally got lost.


00:24:21.950  --> 00:24:24.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can't even find a way back to my faculty.


00:24:27.500  --> 00:24:29.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You sure you wanna cross that bridge.


00:24:31.500  --> 00:24:32.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why?


00:24:34.370  --> 00:24:36.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And why do you need to go around that way?


00:24:36.500  --> 00:24:40.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The red bridge is considered a sacred place of our Campus.


00:24:40.160  --> 00:24:42.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Only graduates can walk across.


00:24:42.950  --> 00:24:46.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Anyone who hasn’t yet graduated and crosses that bridge,


00:24:46.620  --> 00:24:49.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
will never graduate.


00:24:49.790  --> 00:24:50.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You wanna try?


00:24:54.910  --> 00:24:56.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm.


00:24:57.410  --> 00:24:59.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I better go around.


00:25:01.790  --> 00:25:02.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark!


00:25:04.620  --> 00:25:06.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you Mark?


00:25:10.620  --> 00:25:13.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you remember me? I'm Tonfern.


00:25:13.120  --> 00:25:16.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We used to study together in Chem with Professor Tu.


00:25:16.540  --> 00:25:17.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can’t you remember?


00:25:18.250  --> 00:25:19.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I see.


00:25:20.000  --> 00:25:21.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're also here, Tonfern?


00:25:21.250  --> 00:25:22.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah.


00:25:22.250  --> 00:25:23.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is your faculty.


00:25:23.830  --> 00:25:26.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I study at the Medicine faculty.


00:25:27.080  --> 00:25:29.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ah. So you are from the same faculty as….


00:25:30.250  --> 00:25:31.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit?


00:25:31.540  --> 00:25:33.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I just saw him walk away.


00:25:33.080  --> 00:25:35.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Guess he's in a hurry for class.


00:25:36.290  --> 00:25:38.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How about you, Mark?


00:25:38.200  --> 00:25:39.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why don’t we go have some coffee?


00:25:41.040  --> 00:25:41.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sure.


00:25:41.830  --> 00:25:43.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:25:44.000  --> 00:25:45.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go.


00:26:00.620  --> 00:26:01.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Ouch!
- Sorry.


00:26:01.950  --> 00:26:03.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you okay bro?


00:26:03.250  --> 00:26:03.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No. Don’t worry.


00:26:03.870  --> 00:26:07.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry. It's my fault. Oh! It's "Pull".


00:26:09.040  --> 00:26:10.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry! Sorry!


00:26:10.120  --> 00:26:10.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's okay.


00:26:10.700  --> 00:26:11.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't worry at all.


00:26:11.410  --> 00:26:12.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're not hurt right?


00:26:12.200  --> 00:26:13.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, sir.


00:26:18.040  --> 00:26:20.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why're you standing here, Phai?


00:26:21.870  --> 00:26:23.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come. Let me see.


00:26:36.830  --> 00:26:38.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, it's a bit red.


00:26:38.950  --> 00:26:41.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Lucky that you didn't bust your head.


00:26:47.790  --> 00:26:50.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How long you've been here, pal?


00:26:52.790  --> 00:26:55.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go inside.


00:27:01.830  --> 00:27:03.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello sir.


00:27:03.250  --> 00:27:06.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You guys are those who called and asked about internship
right?


00:27:06.370  --> 00:27:06.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, sir.


00:27:06.950  --> 00:27:09.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay. Wait here a sec.


00:27:09.040  --> 00:27:10.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll bring the details to you.


00:27:10.910  --> 00:27:11.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:27:15.250  --> 00:27:15.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
San.


00:27:16.950  --> 00:27:18.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark.


00:27:20.700  --> 00:27:22.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How are you?


00:27:22.540  --> 00:27:25.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Long time no see.


00:27:25.250  --> 00:27:26.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're taller than Yu now.


00:27:26.830  --> 00:27:28.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What brings you here?


00:27:28.870  --> 00:27:31.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm here submiting the internship's application with my
friend though.


00:27:31.870  --> 00:27:33.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm. Internship program.


00:27:33.250  --> 00:27:34.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So all of you are gonna apply?


00:27:34.700  --> 00:27:35.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, sir.


00:27:35.870  --> 00:27:37.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This is my friend. His name's Phai.


00:27:37.500  --> 00:27:39.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Hello sir.
- Hello.


00:27:39.040  --> 00:27:41.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
And this guy's name is San.


00:27:41.040  --> 00:27:42.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Like me.


00:27:42.450  --> 00:27:45.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
His firstname is Tisade. So we call him Sandee.


00:27:45.370  --> 00:27:47.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sandee…


00:27:47.040  --> 00:27:48.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This's Sandee..
(Dee = homophone with ‘good’ in Thai)


00:27:48.290  --> 00:27:49.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How about you? San... what?


00:27:49.580  --> 00:27:50.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I am San…


00:27:50.000  --> 00:27:52.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sansab!
(Sab means ‘bad’ in Thai)


00:27:52.750  --> 00:27:54.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sansab.


00:27:54.080  --> 00:27:55.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It suits him well.


00:27:55.700  --> 00:27:57.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
From now on.


00:27:57.080  --> 00:27:58.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm gonna call you


00:27:58.660  --> 00:28:00.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sab instead of San okay?


00:28:02.040  --> 00:28:03.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm leaving now.


00:28:04.080  --> 00:28:05.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You better continue flirting with her.


00:28:05.950  --> 00:28:08.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Flirting with who?


00:28:08.040  --> 00:28:10.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Piss off. Go.


00:28:10.790  --> 00:28:13.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 



00:28:13.870  --> 00:28:14.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My junior.


00:28:14.750  --> 00:28:15.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I see.


00:28:16.410  --> 00:28:17.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's try this. It's good.


00:28:17.540  --> 00:28:19.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:28:19.790  --> 00:28:20.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it good?


00:28:20.790  --> 00:28:21.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Very much.


00:28:21.250  --> 00:28:22.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 



00:28:31.330  --> 00:28:32.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Right.


00:28:32.500  --> 00:28:34.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shall we go again next time?


00:28:34.250  --> 00:28:36.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sure.


00:28:37.040  --> 00:28:38.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:28:38.450  --> 00:28:40.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Thanks a lot for bringing me here.


00:28:40.830  --> 00:28:44.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We'll probably see each other again around here.Right?


00:28:44.120  --> 00:28:46.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
See. You talked to me for an hour


00:28:46.250  --> 00:28:47.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
but you even said the name of that senior of my faculty


00:28:47.620  --> 00:28:49.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
more than mine.


00:28:49.500  --> 00:28:51.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No.


00:28:52.790  --> 00:28:55.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm leaving. See you around. Byebye.


00:29:00.830  --> 00:29:02.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You think you can avoid me?


00:29:12.500  --> 00:29:15.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You just left me.


00:29:18.450  --> 00:29:22.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
They say if two people meet each other twice in one day,


00:29:22.750  --> 00:29:24.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's because of…


00:29:25.410  --> 00:29:26.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
of fate.


00:29:42.870  --> 00:29:44.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey.


00:29:44.580  --> 00:29:46.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You have a dimple.


00:29:50.080  --> 00:29:52.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You are such a little cutie.


00:29:52.410  --> 00:29:53.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cutie my ass!


00:29:56.040  --> 00:29:57.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your height is just around my shoulder.


00:29:58.040  --> 00:29:59.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You're saying I'm short?


00:30:02.120  --> 00:30:03.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well…


00:30:03.120  --> 00:30:05.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Isn't it true?


00:30:05.080  --> 00:30:07.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if I look small


00:30:07.000  --> 00:30:08.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
that doesn't mean I'm short.


00:30:08.660  --> 00:30:10.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Take it back.


00:30:10.950  --> 00:30:12.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You mean now.


00:30:14.910  --> 00:30:16.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sure.


00:30:16.450  --> 00:30:18.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey. What are you doing?


00:30:18.290  --> 00:30:19.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey!


00:30:30.620  --> 00:30:33.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm trying to take back my words, just like you asked.


00:30:33.410  --> 00:30:34.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Unfortunately,


00:30:36.620  --> 00:30:38.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
it gets stuck here.


00:30:38.290  --> 00:30:39.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
At your dimple.


00:30:40.950  --> 00:30:44.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know something, you are so cute.


00:30:52.160  --> 00:30:54.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't let me see your face again!


00:30:54.160  --> 00:30:55.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Asshole.


00:31:12.410  --> 00:31:15.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu. I think I will try hitting on Kit.


00:31:35.410  --> 00:31:37.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you still want a lecture?


00:31:37.160  --> 00:31:40.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes. Yes. Yes.


00:31:40.750  --> 00:31:42.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Photocopy it.


00:33:18.450  --> 00:33:20.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Don't you dare.


00:33:22.000  --> 00:33:24.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Now, you know how I feel, right?


00:33:27.040  --> 00:33:29.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pha told me


00:33:29.000  --> 00:33:32.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
that you always held up and waited for him under his


00:33:33.370  --> 00:33:35.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You are so serious, right? About Kit?


00:33:36.540  --> 00:33:38.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I kept my eyes on him all the time.


00:33:38.500  --> 00:33:40.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you still think I did it for fun?


00:33:45.120  --> 00:33:48.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But, no matter how much I devoted myself, it's useless.


00:33:48.040  --> 00:33:50.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit never wants to talk to me at all.


00:33:50.750  --> 00:33:54.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Those dogs at his faculty care for me more.


00:33:55.120  --> 00:33:57.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Around this time of this month,


00:33:57.790  --> 00:33:59.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
the Medicine Faculty always have exams.


00:33:59.660  --> 00:34:01.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
A top score student like Kit,


00:34:01.080  --> 00:34:04.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He'll be so busy, surely he doesn't have time to talk to you.


00:34:04.870  --> 00:34:07.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Really?


00:34:08.040  --> 00:34:11.409 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's why all this time he finishes so late.


00:34:11.409  --> 00:34:13.159 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's gonna be last til this Friday.


00:34:13.159  --> 00:34:15.659 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You probably try again and see what will get.


00:34:15.659  --> 00:34:16.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay.


00:34:20.580  --> 00:34:23.699 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even if his faculty's all busy.


00:34:23.699  --> 00:34:27.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your supplies're still full though.


00:34:28.199  --> 00:34:30.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Cause he cares for me.


00:34:31.790  --> 00:34:34.159 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Geezzz. Don't let it be my turn.


00:34:34.580  --> 00:34:35.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well.


00:34:35.870  --> 00:34:38.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did you do that lesson with Pha yet?


00:34:41.949  --> 00:34:44.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on.


00:34:44.580  --> 00:34:46.659 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You did right?


00:34:46.659  --> 00:34:48.699 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tell me everything.


00:34:49.870  --> 00:34:51.159 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tell me!


00:34:52.449  --> 00:34:53.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So this is it,


00:34:53.870  --> 00:34:56.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You stop telling me anything now, right?


00:34:56.290  --> 00:34:58.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm still your friend.


00:34:58.160  --> 00:35:01.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tell me all about it, now.


00:35:01.200  --> 00:35:04.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on.


00:35:04.790  --> 00:35:07.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Quick.


00:35:11.040  --> 00:35:12.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll remember this!


00:35:25.750  --> 00:35:27.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dad gave this to me?


00:35:27.750  --> 00:35:29.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes.


00:35:31.040  --> 00:35:33.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Actually.


00:35:33.160  --> 00:35:35.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Your dad seems to know that you're busy studying


00:35:35.080  --> 00:35:36.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and rarely get back home.


00:35:36.290  --> 00:35:37.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So he's afraid that you probably get sick


00:35:37.540  --> 00:35:39.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and a lack of vitamins.


00:35:40.410  --> 00:35:41.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can get it myself from 7-Eleven.


00:35:48.160  --> 00:35:50.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You barely get back home.


00:35:51.370  --> 00:35:53.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did you sneak to somewhere else?


00:35:53.580  --> 00:35:55.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Tell me.


00:35:55.290  --> 00:35:57.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I promise not to tell anyone.


00:35:58.330  --> 00:35:59.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where could I go?


00:35:59.620  --> 00:36:00.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I just stayed at the dorm.


00:36:00.950  --> 00:36:03.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Whoa. Whose dorm?


00:36:03.950  --> 00:36:05.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mine.


00:36:05.120  --> 00:36:07.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ugh. You sure that it's not Pha's place?


00:36:08.370  --> 00:36:09.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey.


00:36:09.750  --> 00:36:11.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How do you know that?


00:36:11.620  --> 00:36:13.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark told me everything.


00:36:13.330  --> 00:36:15.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu already has a boyfriend. Name's Dr. Pha.


00:36:15.830  --> 00:36:17.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Pharawee Prapathanakul.


00:36:17.790  --> 00:36:21.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The Campus's hottest and most handsome senior of all time.


00:36:21.330  --> 00:36:25.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So in love and never left each other for a second.


00:36:27.910  --> 00:36:30.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark! You asshole!


00:36:32.830  --> 00:36:35.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu. Where are you going?


00:36:37.750  --> 00:36:39.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
To see Dr. Pha?


00:36:39.080  --> 00:36:40.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can I go with you?


00:36:40.950  --> 00:36:43.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No, You can't. It's an important appointment.


00:36:43.330  --> 00:36:45.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So jealous.


00:36:46.580  --> 00:36:48.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please Yu.


00:36:48.750  --> 00:36:51.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can I go see Dr. Pha's face?


00:36:51.410  --> 00:36:53.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No.


00:36:56.410  --> 00:36:59.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you can’t see Pha today,


00:36:59.620  --> 00:37:02.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why don't you just go ask Mark to see Dr. Kit instead?


00:37:02.620  --> 00:37:04.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dr. Kit.


00:37:04.080  --> 00:37:05.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who is he, Yu?


00:37:06.200  --> 00:37:09.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I saw someone with Mark at the coffee shop last time.


00:37:10.620  --> 00:37:14.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm. But it shouldn’t have been Dr. Kit


00:37:16.040  --> 00:37:18.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No. My name isn't Kit.


00:37:19.910  --> 00:37:22.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It means that Mark is still flirting around.


00:37:22.790  --> 00:37:24.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He's not the real one.


00:37:24.450  --> 00:37:26.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Real one?


00:37:26.120  --> 00:37:28.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Do you mean lover, Yu?


00:37:32.040  --> 00:37:35.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit should be finishing his exam by now.


00:37:35.790  --> 00:37:38.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark must be waiting for him at the Medicine Faculty.


00:37:39.080  --> 00:37:41.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Medicine Faculty?


00:37:43.500  --> 00:37:44.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm gonna leave you now, Yu.


00:37:44.790  --> 00:37:45.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
See ya.


00:37:50.870  --> 00:37:52.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh. Mark!


00:37:52.500  --> 00:37:55.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You started it first.


00:38:05.040  --> 00:38:06.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit, so your perfect skin


00:38:06.250  --> 00:38:07.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
comes from drinking a lot of water.


00:38:10.660  --> 00:38:12.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You finished the exam right?


00:38:12.040  --> 00:38:13.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well, let's go eat together.


00:38:13.540  --> 00:38:14.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's on me.


00:38:14.950  --> 00:38:16.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm. How about sushi?


00:38:16.370  --> 00:38:17.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark!


00:38:17.580  --> 00:38:18.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark!


00:38:21.120  --> 00:38:23.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu told me to see Mark's boyfriend.


00:38:23.330  --> 00:38:24.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
His name's….


00:38:24.750  --> 00:38:25.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dr. Kit.


00:38:25.750  --> 00:38:26.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here.


00:38:27.000  --> 00:38:28.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's him.


00:38:28.450  --> 00:38:29.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No!


00:38:30.700  --> 00:38:32.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But your name's Kit.


00:38:32.910  --> 00:38:33.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So what!


00:38:33.750  --> 00:38:34.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
My name's Kit.


00:38:34.750  --> 00:38:36.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But I'm surely not your boyfriend.


00:38:36.540  --> 00:38:37.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But Yu said


00:38:37.660  --> 00:38:38.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Dr. Kit is your boyfriend.


00:38:45.120  --> 00:38:48.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu! Wait for it! I'm gonna tell Pha everything.


00:38:48.950  --> 00:38:49.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huhh!


00:38:50.290  --> 00:38:51.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where are you going?


00:38:51.620  --> 00:38:52.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait for me, please.


00:38:54.290  --> 00:38:56.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You must go have sushi with me today.


00:38:57.450  --> 00:38:59.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I never said I would go with you.


00:38:59.870  --> 00:39:02.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sushi? Can I go with you guys?


00:39:02.660  --> 00:39:03.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please Mark…


00:39:04.330  --> 00:39:07.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit.., I wanna eat it.


00:39:07.750  --> 00:39:08.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sab, see…


00:39:09.330  --> 00:39:11.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If Kit doesn't join us.


00:39:11.410  --> 00:39:13.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why do I have to go?


00:39:15.200  --> 00:39:18.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit. I'm really craving for sushi.


00:39:19.290  --> 00:39:20.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please come.


00:39:21.160  --> 00:39:22.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please.


00:39:22.660  --> 00:39:23.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well.


00:39:23.160  --> 00:39:25.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
We go together now


00:39:25.080  --> 00:39:26.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
or... is it that actually...


00:39:27.040  --> 00:39:30.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you just wanna go alone with him?


00:39:30.700  --> 00:39:31.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Good.


00:39:31.580  --> 00:39:33.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Let's just go only both of us.
- No. I won't go with anyone.


00:39:33.830  --> 00:39:35.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yeah. because you're gonna go with both of us!


00:39:35.870  --> 00:39:38.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So it's a deal?


00:39:49.450  --> 00:39:52.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sab, my dear bro.


00:39:52.370  --> 00:39:54.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You are really a smartass.


00:39:54.750  --> 00:39:58.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So your type is bright skin, small


00:39:58.290  --> 00:39:59.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and tough.


00:39:59.700  --> 00:40:00.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yes, he's tough.


00:40:00.830  --> 00:40:04.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But when he smiles, it's so cute.


00:40:04.290  --> 00:40:06.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's go and finish it, bro


00:40:11.580  --> 00:40:13.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please…


00:40:15.080  --> 00:40:18.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This restaurant is so good. It's my regular place.


00:40:18.870  --> 00:40:20.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
After you.


00:40:20.450  --> 00:40:21.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey.


00:40:22.950  --> 00:40:24.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Please.


00:40:35.040  --> 00:40:36.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Medium Sashimi Set, please.


00:40:36.830  --> 00:40:39.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's get a big set. Kit will join us.


00:40:39.830  --> 00:40:41.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I won't eat.


00:40:41.160  --> 00:40:42.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
How about eating kid?


00:40:42.200  --> 00:40:43.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Including it.


00:41:14.620  --> 00:41:15.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit.


00:41:15.450  --> 00:41:16.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Mark.


00:41:16.370  --> 00:41:18.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let's play something fun.


00:41:18.410  --> 00:41:20.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's so popular at my school.


00:41:20.500  --> 00:41:22.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What game is it?


00:41:22.250  --> 00:41:23.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's Like King's cup game.


00:41:24.330  --> 00:41:27.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You write the order on the paper, not more than 3 words.


00:41:27.500  --> 00:41:29.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Anyone who draws it, must follow.


00:41:31.950  --> 00:41:35.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Even it wrote take off the shirt, we still need to do it
right?


00:41:35.700  --> 00:41:37.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Looks so fun.


00:41:37.290  --> 00:41:40.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can't wait to play it now.


00:41:40.410  --> 00:41:42.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You pervert. I don't think so.


00:41:43.040  --> 00:41:45.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Not particularly that much.


00:41:45.040  --> 00:41:47.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Every order needs to be checked by the king first.


00:41:47.660  --> 00:41:50.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If it's approved, then we can start drawing them.


00:41:50.450  --> 00:41:51.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll be the King.


00:41:52.080  --> 00:41:54.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm the King or I won't play.


00:41:56.700  --> 00:41:58.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Well. That's fine.


00:41:58.160  --> 00:41:59.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kit, you are the King.


00:42:00.700  --> 00:42:02.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Oh. I forgot to tell you something.


00:42:02.790  --> 00:42:05.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Apart from checking stuff.


00:42:05.370  --> 00:42:07.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If any player gives up by refusing to follow the order,


00:42:07.830  --> 00:42:12.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
The King has right to punish that one to do anything he
wants.


00:42:15.950  --> 00:42:16.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Good.


00:42:18.540  --> 00:42:21.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
…And follow that thing for him in replacement.


00:42:21.040  --> 00:42:22.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What!


00:42:22.450  --> 00:42:24.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Super!


00:42:24.290  --> 00:42:26.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you're afraid of losing, you don't have to play.


00:42:26.750  --> 00:42:29.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don't like to force anyone.


00:42:30.750  --> 00:42:31.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll play.


00:42:33.080  --> 00:42:35.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Okay, so let's get started.


00:42:41.200  --> 00:42:42.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Give it to me.


00:42:43.660  --> 00:42:44.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- "Fold the bird"
- "Eating sauce"


00:42:46.700  --> 00:42:47.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Kiss the cheek"


00:42:48.950  --> 00:42:49.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What is it?


00:42:50.080  --> 00:42:51.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Kiss the lips"


00:42:51.700  --> 00:42:53.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- "Kiss the neck"
- "Unbutton"


00:42:53.910  --> 00:42:56.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kissing. Are you mad!


00:42:56.290  --> 00:42:57.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Strip off"


00:42:59.830  --> 00:43:00.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Sit on lap"


00:43:00.500  --> 00:43:01.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sit on lap.


00:43:08.660  --> 00:43:09.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Smile sweetly"


00:43:11.290  --> 00:43:12.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Tie the hair"


00:43:15.410  --> 00:43:18.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! Hey!


00:43:18.540  --> 00:43:20.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Eat a vegetable.


00:43:22.700  --> 00:43:26.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I can eat for you, but you need to be punished.


00:43:32.200  --> 00:43:34.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bump a glass…


00:43:34.830  --> 00:43:36.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait.


00:43:37.040  --> 00:43:41.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
This one is from me and I didn't write bump a glass.


00:43:45.000  --> 00:43:46.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Bump a glass"


00:43:47.040  --> 00:43:48.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It is right. Bump a glass.


00:43:48.660  --> 00:43:50.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No.


00:43:50.620  --> 00:43:52.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Read it carefully.


00:43:54.200  --> 00:43:55.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bump a glass…


00:43:59.000  --> 00:44:00.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
"Bump a cheek"
(Cheek in Thai has similar pronunciation with glass.)


00:44:00.370  --> 00:44:01.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Huh?


00:44:02.200  --> 00:44:04.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it kinda greeting like French, Mark?


00:44:04.700  --> 00:44:05.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's right.


00:44:06.040  --> 00:44:08.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bonjour Monsieur


00:44:08.080  --> 00:44:11.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bonjour Muah! Muah!


00:44:12.910  --> 00:44:15.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Almost right.


00:44:15.080  --> 00:44:16.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But you must actually touch each other,


00:44:16.870  --> 00:44:18.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
not far away like that.


00:44:22.750  --> 00:44:25.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No pressure.


00:44:25.000  --> 00:44:28.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But you're King. If you won't do it


00:44:28.830  --> 00:44:30.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
just give up


00:44:30.410  --> 00:44:32.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and punish yourself for jumping jacks.


00:44:32.700  --> 00:44:34.660 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
No. I'll do it.


00:44:35.040  --> 00:44:38.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So do it with the person who wrote that paper.


00:44:46.700  --> 00:44:48.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Come on.


00:45:32.830  --> 00:45:34.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey.


00:45:34.370  --> 00:45:36.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Consider the game over.


00:45:36.080  --> 00:45:37.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll go back and continue reading textbooks.


00:45:37.910  --> 00:45:38.910 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll go with you.


00:45:38.910  --> 00:45:40.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wait.


00:45:40.040  --> 00:45:41.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'm not finished yet.


00:45:41.540  --> 00:45:43.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who's gonna pay this stuff if you guys leave?


00:45:46.580  --> 00:45:49.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hmm… confirmed!


00:45:50.540  --> 00:45:52.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Who dragged me here is responsible for it.


00:45:52.700  --> 00:45:53.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll go now.


00:46:03.040  --> 00:46:04.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Great.


00:46:07.120  --> 00:46:08.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey.


00:46:08.750  --> 00:46:12.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You better be my little brother instead of Yu's.


00:46:13.450  --> 00:46:14.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Order anything you want.


00:46:15.160  --> 00:46:18.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I'll pay for it all. It’s on me.


00:46:19.700  --> 00:46:21.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Shall we go eat Bingsu next


00:46:21.540  --> 00:46:22.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and then take me home?


00:46:23.700  --> 00:46:25.540 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I give you an inch,


00:46:25.540  --> 00:46:28.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
and you'll take a league.


00:46:28.580  --> 00:46:30.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Here. Finish it first.


00:46:31.620  --> 00:46:34.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Go on. Don’t be shy.


00:46:35.450  --> 00:46:36.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hello Yu.


00:46:36.950  --> 00:46:40.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I must thank you for sending Sab here today,


00:46:41.910  --> 00:46:46.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You know what? I just had lunch with Kit.


00:46:47.370  --> 00:46:50.950 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sab set the scene for me to get cheek by cheek with Kit
today


00:46:52.330  --> 00:46:54.500 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sab, he's so damn good.


00:46:58.160  --> 00:46:59.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why won't you get excited with me?


00:47:01.040  --> 00:47:02.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is there something wrong?


00:47:02.870  --> 00:47:07.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Are you with Pha? Am I bothering you?


00:47:10.910  --> 00:47:12.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yu.


00:47:12.660  --> 00:47:14.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's going on?


00:47:18.370  --> 00:47:20.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Why are you crying?


00:47:21.540  --> 00:47:24.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Did you get hurt? Tell me, Yu.


00:47:26.660  --> 00:47:28.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I just broke up with Pha.


00:47:30.500  --> 00:47:32.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
He left me.


00:48:06.580  --> 00:48:07.750 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Yesterday


00:48:07.750  --> 00:48:09.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
he still loved me.


00:48:10.870  --> 00:48:12.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
But why today


00:48:13.040  --> 00:48:15.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
he doesn't?


00:48:17.120  --> 00:48:19.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I don’t wanna talk to you now.


00:48:19.290  --> 00:48:21.290 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I didn't come to see you today.


00:48:21.910  --> 00:48:23.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I came to see Pha.


00:48:24.330  --> 00:48:25.580 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey. Tong.


00:48:28.500  --> 00:48:31.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's the definition of love between Sansab and Phai?


00:48:32.790  --> 00:48:34.830 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Um. Tell me why?


00:48:36.870  --> 00:48:40.410 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Ah. Pha didn’t come with you?


00:48:44.080  --> 00:48:46.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
- Well… I'm…
- Let me go.


00:48:58.080  --> 00:49:00.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Copter, what are you eating? It looks so good.


00:49:00.950  --> 00:49:02.620 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You mean this, Kim?


00:49:02.620  --> 00:49:04.120 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
It's Viva Plus.


00:49:04.120  --> 00:49:07.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So tasty, full of 8 types of vitamin


00:49:07.080  --> 00:49:08.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Let me try it too!


00:49:08.200  --> 00:49:09.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Hey! You're dirty, Kim.


00:49:09.700  --> 00:49:11.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
What's dirty?


00:49:11.000  --> 00:49:13.370 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
I mean Viva Plus looks


00:49:13.370  --> 00:49:15.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
so yummy, there's also 8 types of vitamins.


00:49:16.330  --> 00:49:17.330 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
That's why


00:49:17.330  --> 00:49:19.250 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
you look really fresh.


00:49:20.290  --> 00:49:22.000 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Is it because of this jelly?


00:49:22.450  --> 00:49:24.040 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Can I try?


00:49:27.950  --> 00:49:30.160 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Sorry bro. It's finished.


00:49:30.160  --> 00:49:31.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
If you wanna try.


00:49:31.910  --> 00:49:35.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
You better buy it from 7-Eleven.


00:49:35.790  --> 00:49:39.200 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
So sad. Why don’t you just keep some for me?


00:49:39.790  --> 00:49:40.790 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Bye.


00:49:40.790  --> 00:49:42.450 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Where are you going, Kim?


00:49:42.450  --> 00:49:44.080 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
7-Eleven.


00:49:44.080  --> 00:49:45.870 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Wanna buy Vivia Plus.


00:49:45.870  --> 00:49:48.700 position:50% line:94% align:middle 
Kim! Get some for me!
