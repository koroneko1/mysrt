4
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,960
When are you coming back?

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,611
I’ll be away for just two days. Will be back in no time.

6
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,958
I promise

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,699
I will be a good boy.

8
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:26,887
Teacher Prince is sick.

9
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:28,120
Aou is nursing him.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,240
Don’t let him be alone with Aou. Got it?

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,432
(Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?)

12
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,631
(I’m Kitty, his girlfriend.)

13
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:37,494
A girl called this number.

14
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:38,774
Teacher Prince took the call.

15
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:42,258
I will be so happy if you can climb the Himalayas again.

16
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:45,364
If that person can inspire you to climb again,

17
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:46,647
don’t let that person go.

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,049
I’m back.

19
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:49,740
You.

20
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,715
Don’t you have a birthday party to get to?

21
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:57,774
Ah!

22
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:00,311
My little brother has got something urgent to do.

23
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,218
So he postponed the party.

24
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:03,427
That’s why I hurried back.

25
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,529
Right.

26
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:07,575
Hey.

27
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:12,357
About last night…

28
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,754
Teacher Prince, we have a situation.

29
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,742
Wee-ah and Sompor are fighting.

30
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,590
What?

31
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:25,718
Sompor,

32
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,150
do you have anything to say to Wee-ah?

33
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,592
I’m sorry, Wee-ah.

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,803
Wee-ah,

35
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:36,520
do you have anything to say?

36
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,880
I’m not wrong. Why should I say sorry?

37
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,367
Wee-ah,

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,299
I heard the story from Sompor.

39
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,440
She said you broke your word.

40
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:50,480
You said you would buy her a birthday gift.

41
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,459
But you bought gifts for other girls too. Is that right?

42
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:59,184
But I don’t think Wee-ah did anything wrong.

43
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:00,577
What?

44
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,920
He promised to buy her a present.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,737
And he did.

46
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,098
Buying things for other people at the same time isn’t breaking the promise.

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,472
That’s right.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,245
Why are you mad?

49
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,928
Wee-ah,

50
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,224
this is about feeling.

51
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:24,541
Though you didn’t mean to, you let her down.

52
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,443
Aren’t you going to say sorry?

53
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,269
If you let someone down and don’t apologize,

54
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,840
you will grow up to be a bad adult.

55
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you talking about me?

56
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:48,848
No.

57
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:50,932
I’m talking to Wee-ah here.

58
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,080
You talked to him but looked at me.

59
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:58,543
If you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about.

60
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:00,965
See?

61
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:02,920
You were talking about me.

62
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,850
I said I was talking about the kids.

63
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,562
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

64
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:10,309
Talking about the kids? Then why did you say he would grow up to be a bad adult?

65
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:12,315
You’re referring to me.

66
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,720
Calm down.

67
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:48,120
Happy birthday, Dao.

68
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,929
Thank you.

69
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,873
I wish you a very good year.

70
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,736
It’s already good because you’re with me.

71
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:20,000
But let me sleep 10 more minutes, please.

72
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,042
Of course.

73
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,784
If the kids didn’t stop me,

74
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,513
I’d definitely fight him.

75
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,001
Do you guys get me?

76
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,635
I do.

77
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:48,708
But I think you’re still at fault this time.

78
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,458
You even had a guilty conscience.

79
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:51,473
What?

80
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:55,504
You promised him before you left you would behave.

81
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:57,384
But you got wasted

82
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,748
and that girl called and bothered him.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,655
Do you think that a good adult should be?

84
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,950
It wasn’t a big deal.

85
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,924
Besides,

86
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:12,001
He and I aren’t a thing.

87
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,231
You get me, don’t you, Mesa?

88
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:15,610
I do.

89
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,000
But if he’s nothing to you, why the heck did you give him the promise?

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,818
What?

91
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,554
You guys are my friends.

92
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:24,814
How about you take my side?

93
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:25,905
No.

94
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:31,648
Someone like you will never change no matter how much time passes.

95
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:32,626
You’re never regretful.

96
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,655
Make it up to him.

97
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,413
How would I do that?

98
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:44,306
All I got today was anger radiation from him

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,728
Like this.

100
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:49,558
Do what you do best, manipulate.

101
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,911
Pretend to get sick.

102
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,268
He will have a pity for you.

103
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:57,938
Interesting.

104
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,345
Did you just say I’m manipulative?

105
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:01,259
Just realized that?

106
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:03,360
Come on.

107
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:07,839
Tomorrow, pretend to be sick.

108
00:07:08,105 --> 00:07:10,368
I will tell the children you’re sick.

109
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,483
And they will spread the news.

110
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,622
It’s more reliable that way.

111
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:15,937
He will believe you’re really sick.

112
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:24,219
Gosh! Dr. Fah has a serious stomach ache?

113
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,489
Keep it between us.

114
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,952
Don’t make people panic.

115
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:28,369
Trust me on that.

116
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,703
Hot news!

117
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:33,520
What? Dr. Fah is pregnant?

118
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,388
What?

119
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,916
Teacher Prince.

120
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:46,160
Is it true that Dr. Fah is sick and you are pregnant?

121
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:48,707
Sompor.

122
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:54,463
I think there’re some misunderstandings here.

123
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:00,665
Doctor.

124
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:02,191
Hey.

125
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:06,737
Did you spread a weird rumor to the kids?

126
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,106
Hey!

127
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,212
JJ.

128
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,761
Why are you here?

129
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:14,322
Teacher Prince.

130
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,783
I’m in charge here for Kuafah.

131
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,416
And…

132
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,031
where is he?

133
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:24,601
He has a stomach ache.

134
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:25,767
He’s resting at his house alone.

135
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:27,856
Poor him.

136
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,565
He’s a doctor.

137
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,631
But when a doctor gets sick, no one takes care of him.

138
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,474
It’s me.

139
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,472
Are you in?

140
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,866
Ouch!

141
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,328
I am.

142
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,863
I brought you congee and antacid.

143
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,637
I heard you have acid reflux.

144
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,060
Thank you.

145
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:08,432
Argh!

146
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,980
Ouch!

147
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,045
Are you okay?

148
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:12,097
I am.

149
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,358
Oh!

150
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:21,210
Ouch!

151
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,288
You don’t look okay at all.

152
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:24,730
Here.

153
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,799
Let me help.

154
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,608
Is it all right?

155
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,342
Of course.

156
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,299
It’s good.

157
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:59,726
Take the medicine and get some rest.

158
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,504
I’ll just leave now.

159
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:02,599
Hold on.

160
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:06,937
I’ve got something to say to you.

161
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,204
What is it?

162
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:14,554
I…

163
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,966
I want to explain about the other night.

164
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,506
You don’t have to.

165
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,440
Just get some rest.

166
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:23,787
I can’t.

167
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:27,319
If I don’t get this out, I won’t be able to sleep.

168
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,153
That night, I didn’t mean to go out and get drunk.

169
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:37,635
My brother’s boyfriend took me there.

170
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,054
And how old are you now?

171
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:42,360
Don’t you know how to say no?

172
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,194
I went out just to drink.

173
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:47,867
I just didn’t think I’d be that drunk.

174
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:53,653
And the girl who called you took my phone when I was using the restroom.

175
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:55,769
What she said was all nonsense.

176
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:57,066
She isn’t my girlfriend.

177
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:03,920
What she is to you doesn’t concern me.

178
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:05,171
It does.

179
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:07,655
You’re mad at me.

180
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,166
I’m not.

181
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:11,900
You are.

182
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,513
I can tell from your voice you’re mad.

183
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:19,625
If I didn’t pretend I was sick to get you here,
I wouldn’t know you’re this mad.

184
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:20,650
Oops!

185
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,410
It’s not that.

186
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,039
I mean…

187
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,769
Do you think I’m that silly?

188
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,793
I didn’t mean it that way.

189
00:12:29,793 --> 00:12:32,822
I just don’t want you to be jealous over nothing.

190
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:35,420
Damn!

191
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,348
You’re a jerk and a narcissist.

192
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:40,842
What a waste of time.

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,264
Hey.

194
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:44,292
Hey.

195
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,175
I heard there was a fight.

196
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,809
Pretty bad.

197
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,766
You should help him with the sports day thing.

198
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:53,959
That way you can be close to him.

199
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,985
Let’s make it fun then.

200
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,704
I will help you with that.

201
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,389
Thank you.

202
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:35,556
Hey.

203
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:36,726
Mesa.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,269
Did you forget something?

205
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:40,198
No.

206
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,043
I came to talk to you.

207
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:45,616
I heard there was a fight.

208
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:48,143
Yes.

209
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:49,804
Pretty bad.

210
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,482
That’s what I heard.

211
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:57,164
If you want my help, feel free to ask.

212
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,155
Are you sure?

213
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:02,622
Of course.

214
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:04,784
I know both parties.

215
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:07,258
I don’t want the fight to keep going.

216
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,936
I’d like to ask you one thing then.

217
00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:24,296
Can you hand this to the village chief for me?

218
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,620
You wrote a letter to my friend…

219
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,122
Wait.

220
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,236
The village chief?

221
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,207
Yes.

222
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:36,094
This is a permission letter to organize a sports day in the village.

223
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:38,289
A sports day?

224
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,781
Because of the fight between Wee-ah and Sompor.

225
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:46,936
This idea is to amend their relationship.

226
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:52,225
So the fight you mentioned…

227
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,645
It’s Wee-ah and Sompor.

228
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,051
Wee-ah and Sompor.

229
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:57,475
Yes.

230
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,926
So this is for the village chief.

231
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,019
Yes.

232
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:03,871
Got it.

233
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,789
So he’s only concerned with the kids fighting.

234
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,324
He doesn’t even care about you at all.

235
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:17,800
Hell yes.

236
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:19,259
I’m so pissed.

237
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,630
How do I patch things up with him?

238
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:24,313
I already faked my sickness.

239
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:27,337
How about you fake your death this time?

240
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,676
Maybe he’ll forgive you.

241
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:31,879
What a smart idea.

242
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,555
Fah!

243
00:15:37,328 --> 00:15:39,128
How on earth did you come up with that?

244
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:40,383
One more scoop, please.

245
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:45,835
I think you should help him with the sports day thing.

246
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:47,670
That way you can be close to him.

247
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,657
That’s right.

248
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,586
Good idea.

249
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:52,604
Show him your hard work. He might come around.

250
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,252
Fine.

251
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,169
I will try.

252
00:15:58,278 --> 00:15:59,501
Thank you guys so much.

253
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,278
Here is your reward.

254
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,159
Argh!

255
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:07,928
The kids should be so proud to have such a caring teacher.

256
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,311
No.

257
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,863
You’re the one who cares about them.

258
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,191
You’ve brought them lots of snacks.

259
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,099
They should be so happy.

260
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:18,905
I’m happy too

261
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,567
to see you smile.

262
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:25,416
I mean I’m happy to see the kids smile.

263
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,286
Excuse me.

264
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:38,729
You’ve got the paint there.

265
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:48,956
Okay.

266
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,711
Hey, Dr. Fah.

267
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,692
Are you here to help?

268
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,170
Yes.

269
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,524
But I see there’s nothing for me to do.

270
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,211
I’m not needed.

271
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:07,752
You are.

272
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:09,305
There’s a lot left to do.

273
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:10,312
Please.

274
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:16,898
Here.

275
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,189
Yes.

276
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,813
Where should I paint?

277
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,146
That’s not for painting.

278
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,866
Please clean it for me.

279
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,242
I will change the colors.

280
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,274
Let’s not bother him.

281
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:32,256
He’s a doctor.

282
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,611
He has to take care of many people.

283
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,613
I can do it.

284
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,280
Unless someone doesn’t want me to.

285
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,797
Everyone wants your help.

286
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,991
There’s a lot left to do.

287
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,410
Please help.

288
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:48,688
Sure.

289
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,321
Thanks for having me.

290
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:58,456
Everyone has the paper with the team name on it.

291
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,245
According to the lucky draw,

292
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,501
there will be the blue and the white team.

293
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,557
Open it and see.

294
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:20,256
You can now go to your team and practice for the competitions.

295
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:21,411
Wait up.

296
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,456
The children said they wanted you to compete too.

297
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,156
Are we sure about that?

298
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:27,899
We are.

299
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,335
I will join too.

300
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:31,650
The more the merrier.

301
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:32,932
Is that right?

302
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,049
Right.

303
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:37,995
See?

304
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,211
That’s good.

305
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:44,096
JJ and I will compete too then.

306
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:46,044
You didn’t even ask me.

307
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:47,429
Come on. Just help me.

308
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,887
All right then.

309
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,376
We have some lottery left.

310
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:03,398
Draw one.

311
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:14,958
Which color are you?

312
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,484
Blue. You?

313
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:18,537
I got blue too.

314
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:20,389
We’re on the same team.

315
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:22,816
Can I call it destiny?

316
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,222
This is not a very good start at all.

317
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:36,193
The sports day will be held next week?

318
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,734
It sounds fun.

319
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:40,322
That’s right.

320
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:42,664
The children were so excited today.

321
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,201
But we’re not on the same team.

322
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:47,277
What was it?

323
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,576
I mean…

324
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,343
Wee-ah and Sompor.

325
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,520
We want them to make up

326
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,131
but they are on different teams.

327
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:00,024
Who knows?

328
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,150
When two people compete,

329
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,549
they might understand each other better.

330
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,666
I heard you guys are competing too.

331
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,461
Dr. Fah’s team will win for sure.

332
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,901
Is that right?

333
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,016
Your body is fit and firm.

334
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,859
But Teacher Prince won the football match against Dr. Fah.

335
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:19,830
So?

336
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,896
There is no football game on the children’s sports day.

337
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:24,607
Dr. Fah’s team is going to win.

338
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:25,221
No.

339
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,134
My team is.

340
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:29,512
Let’s say the losing team must buy the winning team snacks.

341
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,175
Deal?

342
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:30,903
Deal.

343
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,241
I will even buy you BBQ pork.

344
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,687
I think…

345
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:35,665
this has gone a little too far.

346
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,502
That’s okay.

347
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,724
This is fun.

348
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:42,335
Can I join the BBQ pork party?

349
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,262
Now let’s eat before the food gets cold.

350
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,605
Eat first.

351
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:49,780
Eat first.

352
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,685
How is Fah doing?

353
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:10,965
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

354
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,808
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

355
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,742
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

356
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,238
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

357
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:26,586
Happy birthday,

358
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:28,340
my sunflower.

359
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:30,740
Thank you.

360
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,861
Make a wish.

361
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:54,664
It smells so nice.

362
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,062
Did you make it?

363
00:21:58,711 --> 00:22:00,262
Vanilla scent.

364
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:01,796
You like it?

365
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,270
Get home safe.

366
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:27,859
Well…

367
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,554
How about I walk you home?

368
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,544
That’s fine.

369
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,568
I can manage.

370
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,249
I knew this would happen.

371
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:13,571
Come on.

372
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:14,653
Let me walk you home.

373
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,064
Thank you.

374
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,053
What?

375
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,027
Why such a big sigh?

376
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:33,043
You hate to walk with me that much?

377
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:35,451
No.

378
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,333
I’m worried about the sports day.

379
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:40,027
Why?

380
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:46,739
Actually, I never want the competition to get this serious.

381
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,924
But look what Aou and Yayah are doing.

382
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:53,700
I get you.

383
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,632
You just want it to be fun.

384
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:00,727
Then

385
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,341
let’s make it fun.

386
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:08,108
Don’t make the event very competitive.

387
00:24:08,903 --> 00:24:09,949
I will help you with that.

388
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:11,958
Thank you for understanding.

389
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,684
Do you think they will finally talk?

390
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,023
He refuses to apologize.

391
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:27,589
He refuses to say he likes her.

392
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,456
It's not always simple to speak up.

393
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:33,456
It's not always simple to wait either.

394
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,752
Have you competed in a running race before?

395
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:05,690
I haven’t.

396
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,370
That's okay. I’ll guide you.

397
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,811
There are four steps.

398
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,517
First, on your mark. Stand behind this line.

399
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,371
Okay. Next is get set.

400
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,217
You will bend your knee in a sitting position.

401
00:25:16,653 --> 00:25:18,766
That’s right.

402
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,903
Your hand can’t go beyond this line.

403
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:21,812
Put it right here.

404
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,312
Left hand as well. That’s right.

405
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:30,832
In the third step, raise your body up.

406
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:32,509
Look ahead.

407
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:34,522
Do it like this.

408
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,297
Teacher Prince, what are you doing?

409
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:43,074
Making cheerleading pom-poms with the children.

410
00:25:43,913 --> 00:25:44,941
Can I help?

411
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:45,796
Of course.

412
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,540
This team does the same.

413
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,717
Go!

414
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,174
Am I doing it right?

415
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:06,276
Yes. Keep making it into small pieces.

416
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:11,898
Teacher Prince.

417
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:15,149
Time to eat.

418
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:16,742
Thank you.

419
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:22,437
Grilled pork.

420
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:23,364
Thank you.

421
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:35,293
Did you do that?

422
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:46,274
Hey.

423
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:49,398
The village chief asked me to bring you these sports jerseys.

424
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:52,930
Are you home?

425
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:11,566
Hey,

426
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,578
what are you doing in the dark?

427
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:16,769
Nature calls?

428
00:27:17,457 --> 00:27:18,451
Are you nuts?

429
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,204
I’m searching for something.

430
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:21,707
Searching?

431
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:24,337
At night?

432
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,876
Why didn’t you look in the daytime?

433
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:30,276
I know you’re afraid of the dark.

434
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:33,004
I’m not.

435
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,636
You remember it wrong.

436
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,376
- Boo!
- Hey!

437
00:27:38,043 --> 00:27:39,467
What the heck are you playing?

438
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,080
What am I playing?

439
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:49,276
I just wanted to see the reaction of someone so tight-lipped.

440
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,601
So what are you looking for?

441
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:59,016
The hair clip Wee-ah gave to Sompor.

442
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,740
Ah!

443
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,751
The one Sompor threw away.

444
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:06,111
Why?

445
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:08,818
You want Wee-ah to give it to her again?

446
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:10,477
Yes.

447
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,836
I’ve been looking since the evening.

448
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:16,203
Still can’t find it.

449
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:19,678
Okay then.

450
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:21,436
I will help.

451
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:22,476
It’s okay.

452
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,207
I can do it myself.

453
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,187
Hey.

454
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,593
When people offer their help,

455
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,476
you should learn to take it.

456
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:35,999
There’s no need to handle everything yourself.

457
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:36,831
Here.

458
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,149
I’ll help you find it.

459
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,547
Do you think they will finally talk?

460
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:53,707
You might not know this but I do.

461
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,568
Those two like each other very much.

462
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:58,998
Yeah?

463
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:03,332
That’s why Sompor is so mad.

464
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:05,613
Right.

465
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:08,476
And Wee-ah is a tight-lipped one.

466
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:11,026
He refuses to apologize.

467
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:13,475
He refuses to say he likes her.

468
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,350
He does things halfway.

469
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,307
That’s why Sompor gets angry.

470
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,216
Come on.

471
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:25,881
It's not always simple to speak up.

472
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:41,382
It's not always simple to wait either.

473
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,133
Are you saying you used to wait…

474
00:29:53,383 --> 00:29:54,341
It’s late.

475
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,407
We should go home.

476
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,476
We need to get up early tomorrow.

477
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:14,325
The village chief has an urgent business to get to.
[BAN KHUN OM HAET NOK SCHOOL SPORTS DAY]

478
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:17,745
So I’m here to commence the event on his behalf.

479
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:22,799
The event wouldn’t happen without Teacher Prince’s creativity.

480
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:25,379
It’s because we teamed up.

481
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,784
Ever since the first day we met…

482
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,712
Does he think this is the wedding of him and Teacher Prince?

483
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:36,635
Nice speech.

484
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:37,493
The opening ceremony has ended.

485
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:38,422
Give him a big hand, guys.

486
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:40,523
Thank you.

487
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,476
We’re about to start the first game of the day.

488
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,719
You’re with me, the hottest MC.

489
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,303
January, no!

490
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,738
February, no!

491
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,059
March, no!

492
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,305
April (Mesa), yes!

493
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,290
And me, an MC who is hotter than mountain chillis.

494
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,919
Yayah.

495
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:00,507
Dr.Fah.

496
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:02,518
Let’s make today a fun day.

497
00:31:04,436 --> 00:31:05,957
The only fun thing I expect

498
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,290
is to see you buy everyone BBQ pork.

499
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:11,511
Let’s go, everyone.

500
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:14,105
We’re starting our first game here.

501
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,514
This game is easy.

502
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:19,638
Two people will be carrying the one on top.

503
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:22,408
The one on top has a paper hat on

504
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:25,177
and must steal the hat from the opponents.

505
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,504
Fah, why don’t you concentrate?

506
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:28,838
Let’s steal more hats.

507
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:29,981
Did we lose?

508
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:30,916
Yes.

509
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:32,669
Dr. Fah, why are you absent-minded?

510
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:36,618
Wow! They’re going all in. No one wants to lose here.

511
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:39,116
Go. Go. Go.

512
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,670
Wee-ah, if we win, I’ll buy you snacks for a whole month.

513
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,537
Really?

514
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:05,715
Hey.

515
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,897
When we fall, we get back up.

516
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:11,213
Or you want to keep sitting on me?

517
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,850
No!

518
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,996
Aw!!

519
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:25,037
This game is called balloon stomp.

520
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:29,112
You sat on me in the last game.

521
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,960
It’s time for me to step on your ballon now.

522
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,764
No way.

523
00:32:34,237 --> 00:32:35,058
Are you sure?

524
00:32:38,476 --> 00:32:39,196
Ouch!

525
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:40,663
I’m sorry.

526
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,137
So this is how you want it?

527
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:47,399
Fine.

528
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:48,348
Here.

529
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:53,160
Get this.

530
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:03,866
Now what?

531
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:13,766
Here’s your food box.

532
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:16,254
Thank you.

533
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:20,214
I have a question.

534
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:22,578
What is the fight between you and Teacher Prince all about?

535
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:26,606
Nothing.

536
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,955
I can tell even from the distance.

537
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,055
Don’t tell me you’re fighting over me.

538
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:35,410
I don’t think so, Yayah.

539
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:39,204
It’s a long story.

540
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:41,508
Go ahead and tell.

541
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:42,600
I have time.

542
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:49,741
So that’s what happened?

543
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,984
I get you, Dr. Fah.

544
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:56,982
Really?

545
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,788
But I understand Teacher Prince as well.

546
00:34:01,057 --> 00:34:03,476
I feel sorry for him.

547
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:05,894
He’s going through the same thing again.

548
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,149
No wonder why he's so down.

549
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:11,461
What do you mean, Yayah?

550
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:23,436
Thank you

551
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,034
for taking me to the finish line with you

552
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:28,100
and for finding the hair clip for Wee-ah.

553
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,951
I’m sorry for being unreasonable.

554
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:32,347
What if I say I get you?

555
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,276
From this moment on,

556
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,701
can I flirt on you?

557
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,367
We’ve come to the last sport of the day

558
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:08,869
which is a triathlon.

559
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:09,747
That’s right.

560
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:12,914
It’s consisted of three different sports.

561
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:16,078
The first one is an eating challenge.

562
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:19,281
The second sport is cycling.

563
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:25,497
And the last one is a three-legged race.

564
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:27,953
Teacher Prince, are you okay?

565
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,675
I am.

566
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,202
Just warming up.

567
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:35,418
We will be competing in three sports.

568
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:38,596
The team that gets to the finish line first wins.

569
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:45,553
If you’re ready, 3 2 1, go!

570
00:35:46,302 --> 00:35:49,795
The game has started.

571
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:52,194
They are eating as fast as they can.

572
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:54,981
Go. Go. Go. Do your best, everyone!

573
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,626
The blue team is in the lead.

574
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:06,987
The white team is tailing them so closely. So so so close.

575
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:18,552
Come on.

576
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:19,938
Faster.

577
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,178
Tag my hand.

578
00:36:24,178 --> 00:36:25,201
Let’s go.

579
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,203
We’ve just started the second competition.

580
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:30,444
What a close game.

581
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,423
No way.

582
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,447
The blue team is so much ahead.

583
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,479
Can the white team catch up?

584
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:39,359
Keep going. Keep cycling, my friend.

585
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:46,061
It’s your turn now, Teacher Prince.

586
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:49,858
- We’ve come to a three-legged race now.
- Let’s go, Sompor.

587
00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:53,665
The blue team has just started.

588
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:56,618
I wonder if they can level it up at all.

589
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:59,028
Teacher Prince has gone so far now.

590
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,178
Teacher Prince, are you all right?

591
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:07,145
Fah, come on.

592
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:14,675
- Blue!
- White!

593
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,018
Oops! What is going on over there?

594
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:22,745
Teacher Prince just fell all of a sudden.

595
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:25,019
Fah, it’s your chance now. Surpass him.

596
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,818
Dr. Fah, why are you stopping?

597
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:32,479
The blue team, keep going!

598
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:33,978
Let’s help Teacher Prince up.

599
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:49,759
Come on.

600
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,343
Let’s go to the finish line together.

601
00:37:56,422 --> 00:38:01,245
Wow! Dr. Fah comes back and helps Teacher Prince up.

602
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,604
What a lovely ship. No! I mean what an impressive race.

603
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,348
And they finally get to the finish line together.

604
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:26,304
The blue and white teams finished at the same time as a result of today's competition.

605
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,376
We have a tie game.

606
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:38,204
No matter who wins or loses, every contestant will get a medal.

607
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,168
Teacher Prince, is this the real gold?

608
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,828
It’s a chocolate medal.

609
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:52,018
So delicious.

610
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:55,365
That’s only a consolation prize.

611
00:38:56,457 --> 00:39:01,231
What you best deserve is this one.

612
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,622
Hey.

613
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,298
How did you get it?

614
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:09,656
Before the competition started,

615
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:11,681
I went looking for it.

616
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:13,934
Besides,

617
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,045
I know everything, Wee-ah.

618
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:17,224
Know what?

619
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:24,101
You gave plain hair clips to other girls.

620
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:28,092
But the one you gave Sompor was custom-made.

621
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:30,041
That’s right.

622
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:35,308
I chose a pink hair clip because Sompor likes pink.

623
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:40,719
Why didn’t you tell Sompor from the beginning?

624
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,156
Because it’s not cool.

625
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:50,139
But I think it’s much cooler telling the truth.

626
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:53,675
It’s not too late to tell her.

627
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:57,841
The sooner you tell, the sooner you’ll look cool.

628
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:00,960
Come on.

629
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,344
Yes, sir.

630
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,965
How is your ankle?

631
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:19,036
It’s all right.

632
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:20,891
Thank you.

633
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:24,702
Let’s get you bandaged.

634
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:25,711
Come on.

635
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,261
HEALTH CENTER

636
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,433
You got a sprained ankle. You should be fine.

637
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,582
Next time, don’t force it.

638
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:52,468
That’s why you looked painful when you ran.

639
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,459
Thank you.

640
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:58,206
Your welcome.

641
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:01,271
It’s a duty of a doctor to take care of his patients.

642
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:08,046
I mean thank you for taking me to the finish line with you.

643
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,109
And for finding the hair clip for Wee-ah.

644
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:25,581
- I’m sorry.
- I’m sorry.

645
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,190
You first.

646
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,314
I’m sorry for being unreasonable.

647
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:39,561
There’s no reason for me to be angry at you about that night.

648
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,337
What if I say I get you?

649
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,463
What do you mean?

650
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:54,513
Yayah told me what you’ve been through.

651
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:57,184
What do you mean, Yayah?

652
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:03,418
Teacher Prince told me he had a terrible ex.

653
00:42:05,027 --> 00:42:08,418
That person couldn’t provide him with clarity.

654
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:10,451
He came when he wanted to.

655
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:12,089
He went with someone else when he felt like it.

656
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,769
Teacher Prince couldn’t even get jealous.

657
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:15,801
Because there was no established relationship.

658
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,477
What did Teacher Prince do?

659
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,064
They were together for a brief amount of time.

660
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:24,498
Teacher Prince couldn’t endure it at last.

661
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:25,499
He broke up with that person.

662
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:30,691
And what you’re doing is a repeat of what his ex did to him.

663
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:33,298
No wonder why he’s mad.

664
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:36,504
He doesn’t want to get hurt again.

665
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:45,394
Just because I’m not being clear doesn’t mean I’m not serious with you.

666
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:53,114
But I’m so serious that I’m afraid it’s too soon.

667
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:57,500
I’d been with my ex for seven years yet we couldn’t make it.

668
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:01,288
That’s why I don’t want to rush things.

669
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:05,898
But if my actions get you the wrong idea,

670
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,281
from this moment on,

671
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,241
can I flirt on you?

672
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,295
Prince,

673
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,369
I’m returning the cap gun I borrowed.

674
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:43,734
Oops!

675
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:45,938
Am I interrupting?

676
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,458
No.

677
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,487
Will you please excuse me?

678
00:43:57,576 --> 00:43:58,549
Thank you.

679
00:44:07,901 --> 00:44:08,931
What were you two talking about?

680
00:44:11,544 --> 00:44:12,981
What was it?

681
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:14,852
Nothing.

682
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:17,092
I was just giving him first aid.

683
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:36,453
Where are you going?

684
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,738
That gunshot was a signal to start.

685
00:44:44,094 --> 00:44:47,284
This game isn’t going to be as easy as the one we competed in today.

686
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,952
We’ll see about that.

687
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:54,188
Because I never lose.

688
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:15,738
I just want to try hard.

689
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:18,898
I want to stop everything…just to be with him.

Hey!

692
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:47,978
What are you doing?

693
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:49,979
You allowed me to flirt on you.

694
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:53,435
From now on, I’ll just flirt on you non-stop.

695
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:54,824
Prepare yourself for that.

696
00:45:55,658 --> 00:45:58,708
Can I put my hand right here until it gets warmer?

697
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,427
Prince, this way.

698
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:02,763
Teacher Prince already has someone he’s talking to.

699
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:04,260
Don’t worry.

700
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,696
I’m not trying to steal him.

701
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:09,470
I just want him to meet someone who can take care of him better than me.

702
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:10,635
What are you doing?

703
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:15,242
Your friend should know you have a doctor to take care of you up on the mountain.
