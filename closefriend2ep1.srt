1
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,599
The concept I'm presenting to you today

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,560
is a mood that is currently popular.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,320
So the genre of my music is easy-listening.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,960
Anyone can listen to it regardless of age and gender.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,449
Our artist is...

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,039
You said you weren't going to drink.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,320
Don't do this again, okay?

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,199
I'm worried about you.

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,039
Typhoon, listen to me. What's wrong?

10
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,560
Why are you walking away from me?

11
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,719
Did you forget that today is our anniversary?

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,920
You're only focusing on work right now. I understand that.

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm just a silly crybaby

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,960
who isn't going places.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,840
I haven't changed a bit.

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,439
Then can you act as if we're still in love?

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,119
I don't want to break up with...

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,048
"You've received an exclusive reward for participating"

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,519
"in the fan trivia competition of the hottest idol, Jedi."

21
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,599
There, there. Give us a hug.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,689
Oh well. I'll settle with a virtual hug.

23
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,959
If you were granted a wish,

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,480
what would you wish for, Mr. Ray?

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,959
Is it okay to wish for you

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,640
to become a reality for me?

27
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,480
I'll make it for you.

28
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,840
- Jedi, do you remember... - Oh.

29
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,599
I forgot to tell you that I'll have it here.

30
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,480
I'll swap the cups for you.

31
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,680
It's okay. You don't have...

32
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,640
I'll help you wipe it off.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
No need.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,519
It's okay.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,120
I thought you said you'd recognize me.

36
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,280
You're Ray,

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
who won the trivia

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,560
and got this VR headset, right?

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,090
Are you even real?

40
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,879
Of course. Here.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
The stain from the coffee you spilled just now.

42
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,039
What are you doing?

43
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,810
So?

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,599
It's better than VR, isn't it?

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Mr. Ray?

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,319
(Close)

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,919

Pierce?

52
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,159
Pierce?

53
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,639
Pierce?

54

(Ohm - Thitiwat Ritprasert)

(Fluke - Natouch Siripongthon)

56
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,000
What do you think of my outfit? Does it look okay?

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Whoa. Are you going to a wedding or something?

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,170
Phoon, aren't you going to apply for a creative position?

59
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,610
Just dress in your own style.

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm just scared that they'll think I'm too young.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,639
They won't.

62
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,399
Anyone would want to hire

63
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,759
someone like you, Phoon.

64
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,800
Will they even want to hire me?

65
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,519
Of course.

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,170
A typhoon is predicted to sweep over all the companies in the nation.

67
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,759
Come on. Hurry up and eat.

68
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,439
It's an auspicious day.

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,730
Don't start any trouble elsewhere, okay?

70
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll give you a lift.

71
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,240
Don't.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,920
I can go there myself.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,240
Oh? The company's not that far away?

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,199
We've moved to a place close to your company

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,120
so you won't have to stay the night there.

76
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,839
I'll be fine.

77
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,959
They might not hire me after all.

78
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,279
All right. It's up to you.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,959
I hope you get the job.

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,879
As for me, I have to come up with a new project.

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
A new song for Jedi.

82
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,319
Jedi?

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
The Jedi?

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,240
Wow! That's awesome, Pierce!

85
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
It is.

86
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,879
But you have to keep this a secret, okay?

87
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,120
Come on. Energize me.

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,279
Hold on. Let's wait until I get a new job.

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,480
I was going to give you a lucky charm.

90
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Pierce!

91
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,800
Mr. Ray,

92
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,879
working as a barista.

93
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,680
A die-hard fan.

94
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,199
I wonder what he's like in real life.

95
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,720
Hi!

96
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,360
Hi!

97
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,319
Huh?

98
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,959
What's up with my Mr. Ray today?

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,399
What a grumpy face.

100
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,480
I know now

101
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,839
that this Jedi is fake.

102
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,639
The real one isn't even remotely interested in me.

103
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,279
Huh?

104
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,679
You're from the VR headset?

105
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,090
You're not dreaming, Mr. Ray.

106
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,279
Should we let you rest?

107
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:29,993
(Kimmon - Warodom Khemmonta)

(Copter - Panuwat Kerdthongtavee)

109
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,702
You look so handsome even in your sleep.

110
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,261
Is this the real you?

111
00:09:55,901 --> 00:10:00,462
The real deal. The original me.

112
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,981
I had a nightmare.

113
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:20,182
I dreamed that you were the fake one from the VR again, Jedi.

114
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,942
I'm going now.

115
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:25,901
I'm probably dreaming.

116
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,861
You're shaking.

117
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,462
Are you really that scared?

118
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:45,462
I'm scared I might be dreaming.

119
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,741
And then everything might disappear once I wake up.

120
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,141
You're definitely not dreaming.

121
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,822
I'm right next to you, Mr. Ray.

122
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,501
Really.

123
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,542
It's good!

124
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,141
It's so good that I got scared.

125
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,101
It still feels incredible.

126
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:08,741
I don't even know

127
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:12,462
if I'd get to be with you without the help of the VR.

128
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,062
Of course you would.

129
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:24,822
I'd obviously go

130
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,182
to the ends of the earth

131
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,222
to find Mr. Ray.

132
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,981
Okay?

133
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,101
The real deal.

134
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,542
Oh, what time is it now?

135
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,141
- Nine. - Oh.

136
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,781
I have to get going.

137
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:57,781
I have a meeting about my single.

138
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,901
Are you going to come and stay the night here or at the condo?

139
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:06,741
Let me think about it.

140
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,582
I'll let you know, Mr. Ray.

141
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:12,101
- I'm going now. - What?

142
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,781
You didn't even give me a kiss or anything.

143
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,302
It's like you read my mind.

144
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,501
Okay?

145
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,101
Jerk.

146
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:36,182
It's nice to be together like this.

147
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:59,261
No one knows the real Jedi likes to sing out of tune in the shower.

148
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:04,662
How long do I have to hide love?

149
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:09,621
Close your eyes and open your heart

150
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:13,462
Who do you see?

151
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:18,182
Tell me

152
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:26,741
He sleeps with his mouth open.

153
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,462
He doesn't snore but drools.

154
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,182
And he always pays respect to everything.

155
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,141
He believes that there are guardian angels all around us.

156
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:11,422
I'm the only one who knows about these things.

157
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:16,662
But the guy named Ray doesn't exist in his life.

158
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,861
How long will this be kept a secret?

159
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,182
Who's calling at this hour?

160
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,302
Ugh, really.

161
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:44,261
Are you awake? I have a really awesome surprise to tell you.

162
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,141
Mm. What is it?

163
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:50,222
Pierce is getting to produce Jedi's new single!

164
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,822
Mm. Really?

165
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,062
What? Aren't you excited at all?

166
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,182
You're actually the first to hear about his.

167
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,062
Or have you quit being his fan?

168
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,621
Well, I already know about it.

169
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,781
Oh, that's no fun.

170
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,101
Anyway, what are you doing?

171
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,781
I'm thinking of looking for a job.

172
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,302
Huh? You haven't done that already?

173
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,381
Mm.

174
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,780
I'm waiting for the studio I used to teach at to open again.

175
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,582
They're closed for renovations at the moment.

176
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:28,822
Oh. What about the cafe you used to work at?

177
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:31,021
I've already quit.

178
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:34,662
The owner closed the shop because of an illness.

179
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:38,981
By the way, I'm about to go and apply for a new job today.

180
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,342
Guess where.

181
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:43,501
Typhoon, I have to hang up now. My mom's here.

182
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:45,542
Hey.

183
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,141
What's up with you, Ray?

184
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,342
Dressed for a wedding, you say?

185
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,101
- What is this? - Did you just hit me?

186
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:11,861
- I did. - You hit me, didn't you?

187
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,062
- There! - Hey!

188
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,942
- Take that! - Jedi! Stop it.

189
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,541
I thought you were in a rush to go to a meeting?

190
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,021
I am.

191
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,302
- I'm going then. - Mm. Hurry up and get dressed.

192
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,462
Come on. See me off.

193
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:28,942
I can't breathe.

194
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:51,662
Pierce.

195
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,981
Just a second. I'm trying to concentrate.

196
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,182
Hello, Pai.

197
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,182
What's the matter?

198
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,581
I'm making you the producer of a new face in the company.

199
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,781
This project has to be kept secret.

200
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:34,541
Because no one has seen her face before.

201
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,581
But I'm going to push her to become number one this year.

202
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:47,702
And she's going to push you to another level.

203
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,422
Her name is Milin.

204
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:25,632
I want everyone to be devoted to Jedi and Milin's new project.

205
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:29,341
It has to top at least three major charts.

206
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:30,981
Pierce,

207
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,142
I'd like you to be the music director.

208
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:35,581
You've proven that you can make a song appeal to the masses.

209
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,182
Tina, you're the promoter.

210
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,112
I'd like to see your idea within next week.

211
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,261
- Pai. - Hm?

212
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:48,902
I have someone else who wants to join the team.

213
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:50,662
Go ahead.

214
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,422
Hello? You can come in now.

215
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:07,741
Hello.

216
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,261
I'm Typhoon.

217
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:13,392
Phoon?

218
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:19,662
Hm? You know each other?

219
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:28,981
Well...

220
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,462
Are you Pierce's boyfriend?

221
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:38,422
I remember seeing you at the party last year.

222
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,341
Typhoon?

223
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,662
I thought you said you don't like drinking.

224
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:54,422
Is this what adults do at work?

225
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,781
Uh...

226
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,632
That's right.

227
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,112
I don't care if you're together or not.

228
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,981
But if you want to work here,

229
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,702
you have to demonstrate your skills to me.

230
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:14,182
I will.

231
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,741
Hm?

232
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:18,581
What about Jedi?

233
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:20,422
Didn't you come here together?

234
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,142
Oh? That's true.

235
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:24,702
- Where is he off to? - I don't know.

236
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,581
He's probably gone to the bathroom.

237
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,142
Typhoon, go and get Jedi.

238
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,501
Sure.

239
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:57,862
What am I going to do now?

240
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,222
- Oh, what should I do? - Right?

241
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,862
What should you do now?

242
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,222
Jedi?

243
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:16,981
What are you doing here?

244
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:20,261
This is where I work.

245
00:22:20,622 --> 00:22:23,182
I should ask you why you followed me here.

246
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,301
I was feeling posses...

247
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,862
I mean worried... oh!

248
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,741
I've missed... No, I can't control myself!

249
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,422
What should I do? What should I do?

250
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,021
- Ray, Ray, Ray... - Come here, you.

251
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:49,981
I can't find the bathroom.

252
00:23:08,382 --> 00:23:09,382
Jedi, you're here...

253
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,382
Ray?

254
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:23,462
Typhoon.

255
00:23:26,341 --> 00:23:27,581
Surprise! Hey there.

256
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,142
Hi.

257
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:45,981
Okay. Cut.

258
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:48,462
- All good. - You can go and get dressed.

259
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:54,261
Cut.

260
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,902
A slate can go in.

261
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,541
We can go back to sleep now.

262
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,261
Good.

263
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:04,222
To the ends of the earth to find Mr. Ray.

264
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:08,902
Where are you going?

265
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:10,501
I'm going. I'm dreaming.

266
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,182
I'm definitely dreaming.

267
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:13,341
Really!

268
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,981
- Cut. - You can slate now.

269
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:25,981
How long till we can show love?

270
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:31,862
How long do I have to hide love?

271
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:37,862
Close your eyes and open your heart

272
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:40,541
- Good. Cut. - Thank you.

273
00:24:51,462 --> 00:24:54,142
Next, eat the fruit.

274
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:05,902
Okay. Cut.

275
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:07,501
Okay.

276
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,382
- Just a little bit. - Thank you very much.

277
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,821
Okay. Stop.

278
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,981
- Take that! - Jedi! Stop it.

279
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:17,021
- Jerk. Go away. - I'm sorry.

280
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,541
Let me see your mouth.

281
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:21,182
Hm? Let me see your mouth.

282
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,061
I thought you said you were in a rush...

283
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,422
I can't find the bathroom.

284
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,142
Je...

285
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,622
Ray?

286
00:25:34,462 --> 00:25:35,581
Surprise!

287
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,142
Hi.

288
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:41,902
Cut. Check and wrap it up.

289
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:43,821
Oh, I should move.

290
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,061
Slate.

291
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,862
(Next Episode)

292
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,662
- Who's there? - Hi, Mother!

293
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,382
Jedi!

294
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:03,781
Do whatever it takes to convince the listeners

295
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:07,142
that Milin and Jedi

296
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,741
are really in a relationship.

297
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,862
Huh? But...

298
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:15,702
Did you just come up with a creative idea, Typhoon?

299
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:19,741
You have to keep what's going on between me and Jedi top secret.

300
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,862
You heard what Pai said, didn't you?

301
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,662
Now that you're on the team,

302
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:26,261
you have to be professional.

303
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:28,902
We can't act as a couple like when we're at home.

304
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,942
- Dad? - Hi.

305
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:32,902
Mom?
