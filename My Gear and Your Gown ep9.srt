Watch me, Itt.

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,785
I will beat you.

5
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,026
Folk, what's up?

6
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:55,986
Well, my car is inside.

7
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,346
I'm waiting for you to move.

8
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,505
Right, right.

9
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,666
Sorry. I'll go now.

10
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:33,866
Hey.

11
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,866
Don't tell me you're following me.

12
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:36,905
No.

13
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:38,386
I live in this building.

14
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:42,946
Although, I did follow you.

15
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,306
What a coincidence.

Wait.

34
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,946
Don't tell me you live on the same floor
and next door to me too.

35
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,105
No.

36
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,716
I meant to follow you this time.

37
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,346
Actually, I live on the ninth floor.

38
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:23,985
Folk...

39
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,836
-I think...
-Have you ever liked anybody?

40
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:31,146
If you have, I'm asking you to let me try.

41
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:32,706
I really like you.

42
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:36,266
I warned you.

43
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,385
All right, have it your way.

44
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:41,906
I'll stand by as your friend first.

45
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,505
See you later.

46
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,666
Pai?

47
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,586
If you're still hesitant
to open your heart to me,

48
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,385
you can at least open the door for me.

49
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,426
Did you really just use that pick-up line?

50
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,985
You're making me feel stupid.

51
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,346
But I really want to see your room.

52
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,545
When you think of me as a friend,

53
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,745
then you can knock on my door.

54
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,305
See you around.

55
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,545
-Call me when you're home.
-Bye-bye.

56
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,425
Hey.

57
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:30,466
Do you live in this room?

58
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:35,906
Ah, yes.

59
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,505
I live in this room.

60
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,586
Now that we know each other...

61
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:44,786
and live next door to each other...

62
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,185
do you want to hang out in my room?

63
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,425
Ah, well, I'm kind of busy today.

64
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,625
I want to hang out with you but...

65
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:07,745
I'm busy. I've got work to do.

66
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,545
Gonna draft my novel.

67
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:28,945
It's vibrating.

68
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,345
Hello.

69
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,346
Well, yes, yes.

70
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,265
Okay, okay.

71
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:54,185
Let's eat rice soup with squid.

72
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:55,625
You bought that?

73
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,586
No.

74
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:00,745
It's from 950.

75
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,745
Nine-Five-Zero?

76
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,905
(Enjoy your meal, Pai-Pai. From Mr. 950)

77
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,065
Nine-Five-Zero.

78
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,985
(Enjoy your meal, Pai-Pai. From Mr. 950)

79
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:29,265
Who do you think Mr. 950 is?

80
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,865
I think...

81
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:33,985
it's Folk.

82
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,706
How can you be sure?

83
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,665
Well, he said he was going to hit on me.

84
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,316
And you let him?

85
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:48,785
I understand him, though.

86
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,066
When you like someone,

87
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:55,785
sometimes you want nothing
but to be around them.

88
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,625
Your words got to me.

89
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:03,785
Thank you, man.

90
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:05,625
For what?

91
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,265
The thing is, I like Beau.

92
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,436
But she is way out of my league.

93
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,145
But like you said,

94
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:20,905
when you're into someone,

95
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:25,316
just being around them makes you happy.

96
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,196
I got an idea.

97
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,145
I will volunteer as a staff member
for the Star Contest Camp.

98
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:38,587
Well...

99
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,905
But don't get too close.

100
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:43,385
Be careful of your heart.

101
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,945
You too, Pai.

102
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,226
Don't forget that Itt
will also be at the camp.

103
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,786
What's going on between Itt and I...

104
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,785
is just a bet, that's all.

105
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,425
Pai-Pai, how's the rice soup?

106
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,626
(Mr. 950: Pai-Pai, how's the rice soup?)

107
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:11,905
Thank you.

108
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:13,866
How did you know I like rice soup
with squid?

109
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:16,266
(Thank you. How did you know
I like rice soup with squid?)

110
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,545
Good luck with the Star Contest.

111
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,146
(Mr. 950: Good luck
with the Star Contest.)

112
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:24,185
I'll do my best. Don't worry.

113
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,546
(I'll do my best. Don't worry.)

114
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,265
Oh, come on.

115
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,985
You caught me off guard.

116
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,305
Give me. Give it back.

117
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,665
It's mine.

118
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,825
This year's Star Contest
will also have a Popular Vote award.

119
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:19,825
So, let's get to know
the king and queen of each faculty.

120
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,626
Let's start with the Faculty of Dentistry.

121
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:23,865
Let's hear it for him.

122
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:28,945
Hi, everyone.

123
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:31,625
I'm Folk, Rattapoom Jintamanat.

124
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,625
The King of Dentistry.

125
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:38,207
Good job. Return to your place.

126
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,208
All right. Next, please.

127
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,346
Hello.

128
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:48,746
My name is Preechaya Pochaisri.

129
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:51,386
You can also call me Pong.

130
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,466
I'm from the Faculty
of Commerce and Accounting. Thanks.

131
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:55,626
Wow.

132
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:57,185
How professional.

133
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:59,145
Next, please.

134
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,065
Hello.

135
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:04,746
Phai. Prapawadi Kradingthong.

136
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,226
Faculty of Engineering.

137
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:11,586
Okay. Next one, please.

138
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,305
Hello. I'm Chalee Worakanthorn.

139
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:19,986
Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

140
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,146
Thank you.

141
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:22,705
He studies arts, guys.

142
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,385
Now, next.

143
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,106
Hey. I'm Itt, Ittikorn.

144
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,265
Faculty of Engineering.

145
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,065
Looks like this one is hot.

146
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,025
All right. Who's next?

147
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,585
I'm...

148
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,426
Pai, Pantoon Wongworawet.

149
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,266
Faculty of...

150
00:13:57,346 --> 00:13:59,706
(Stars of Socially Responsible)

151
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:01,346
What faculty?

152
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,546
(Stars of Socially Responsible)

153
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:10,067
A person who is as stiff as a board,

154
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,507
what do you call that?

155
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,745
Something "ca...?"

156
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:17,546
Is it "cadaric?"

157
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:20,545
It's called cadaveric spasm.

158
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,466
It refers to the stiffening seen
in drowning victims.

159
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:26,745
It's a result of the victims'
intense struggle for survival.

160
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,586
This doesn't apply to me.

161
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,945
Whoa.

162
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,145
Clearly. you're from the Faculty
of Medicine.

163
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,425
Pai has competed in the Biolympiad before.

164
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,466
That's how you talk to him.

165
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:54,466
All right. Those are our rules.

166
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:57,746
Now, everyone,
let's move into your own groups.

167
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:01,785
Group One, follow Folk.
And, Group Three, stay here.

168
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,146
And, Group Two, follow Itt.

169
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:05,825
All right. Let's get moving.

170
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,946
Let's go.

171
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:08,986
Group Two, follow me.

172
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,306
Group Three, form a circle and sit down.

173
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:16,785
Sugas, could you take care of that group?

174
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,466
Okay.

175
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,066
-Umm. My name's...
-Pai.

176
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,505
Can I call you Dorky Pai?

177
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,026
He's a cute dork, though.

178
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,466
Hmm. Let's call him Pai-Pai.

179
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,466
All right. Next,
we're going to play an icebreaker game.

180
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:43,226
This game is called "Brrr!"

181
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:46,065
Also known as the category game.

182
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,506
But this time,
we won't specify the category.

183
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,986
Players must figure it out themselves.

184
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,585
This is how you play the game.

185
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,466
When the first player says "one,"
this means the category is a number.

186
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,746
The following players
must say "two, three, four," respectively,

187
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:00,466
and the last player,

188
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:03,785
instead of saying "five",
has to say "brrr!"

189
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,025
Got it?

190
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:06,625
Got it.

191
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:10,185
All right. Group Three got it.

192
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,226
Could you demonstrate it for us?

193
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,386
Unagi.

194
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:14,986
-Sushi.
-Takoyaki.

195
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,106
Sashimi.

196
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:17,985
Brrr!

197
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,625
(Volunteer)

198
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:36,065
Umm, Beau.

199
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,746
Do you need a hand?

200
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,705
Oh. Sure, Waan.

201
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,226
Well...

202
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,226
Just organize these books by category.

203
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,585
You can do short stories.

204
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,265
-Sure.
-I'll do fables.

205
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,665
Okay.

206
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,186
-Are these fables?
-Yes.

207
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,106
Okay.

208
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:00,785
Sorry.

209
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:05,785
-This is a short story.
-Okay.

210
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:10,185
Thanks.

211
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,506
Oh, you have something on your face.

212
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:13,625
Oh, what is it?

213
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:16,145
It's gone now.

214
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,945
Oh, thanks.

215
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:21,066
There you go.
These are short stories.

216
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:47,825
The first step of first aid
is cleaning the wound...

217
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:50,145
by dabbing the wound with a cotton ball.

218
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:51,385
Don't scrub it, okay?

219
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,946
Also, you need to check...

220
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:55,385
if there are any particles
or dirt in the wound.

221
00:17:57,385 --> 00:17:59,867
Dab it with the cotton ball like this,

222
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:05,145
and avoid using hydrogen peroxide
and iodine.

223
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:09,905
The last step
is using saline to rinse the wound.

224
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:13,786
The most important teeth
are the molars, located here.

225
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:16,385
I'll show you
how to properly brush your teeth.

226
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:20,746
First, hold your toothbrush
at a 45-degree angle.

227
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:22,946
Then, move the toothbrush
from left to right.

228
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:27,145
Do this about four or five times, okay?

229
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,706
One. Let's do it.

230
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:31,065
One, two,

231
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:32,865
three, four.

232
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,506
Good job, everyone.

233
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,506
We'll brush our teeth together.

234
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:38,625
Sounds good?

235
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:42,516
You can rinse your mouth
after you're done.

236
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:44,905
Let's do it together.

237
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,865
Don't play with the water.

238
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,627
It doesn't look
like an adult showing kids.

239
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,147
More like a kid showing kids.

240
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,986
Barbra Streisand once said,

241
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,625
"There's a part of you
that always remains a child,"

242
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:17,705
"no matter how mature you get,"

243
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:24,705
"how sophisticated or weary."

244
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,625
Explain.

245
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:32,385
It means your inner child
will always be a part of you...

246
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,225
regardless of how mature you get...

247
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:39,465
or how complicated or exhausted you are.

248
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:41,066
Something like that.

249
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:43,466
Wow.

250
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:47,516
You're not only a dentist
but also a philosopher.

251
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:49,865
No.

252
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,586
Barbra is an actress and a songwriter.

253
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:57,767
And I am a dentist...

254
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:58,847
and a writer.

255
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:04,367
You're a nice guy
with a positive attitude,

256
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:05,517
and you have a way with kids.

257
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:09,705
You'll win the Start Contest for sure.

258
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:13,786
I don't know.

259
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:16,145
I'd rather have Pai be the winner.

260
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:33,627
The proper way to dress a wound...

261
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:38,506
is to clean it with alcohol.

262
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:39,665
But...

263
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,185
don't apply alcohol directly to the wound.

264
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:02,586
Are you okay, kiddo?

265
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:05,625
I feel his pain.

266
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:09,346
It's okay.

267
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:11,826
I'm sorry.

268
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,066
He's okay.

269
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,785
How's it going?

270
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:23,676
Dude, he's so tense.

271
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:26,145
Can you help him so he can relax a bit?

272
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,865
The kids are as tense as he is.

273
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:31,026
No way.

274
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,727
I volunteered
because I wanted to flirt with girls,

275
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:35,486
not to help you guys.

276
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:37,586
Let's do it this way.

277
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,746
Pai, leave here quietly and secretly.

278
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:42,345
-Waan will continue this.
-What?

279
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,625
No one will say anything.

280
00:21:43,705 --> 00:21:44,705
Believe me.

281
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,756
I don't think we should do that.

282
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:51,425
Believe me.

283
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,465
Calm down.

284
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:57,346
Itt, what happened?

285
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,546
I got cut from a metal object.

286
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:03,426
You're teaching first aid now, right?

287
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:04,586
Can you dress my wound?

288
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:08,785
Pai, how about you dress his wound?

289
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,226
You'll feel relaxed with him.

290
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,687
Besides, he won't cry.

291
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,927
-It won't scare the kids.
-Yes.

292
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:15,126
That's a good idea.

293
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:21,465
But how do I know you won't annoy me?

294
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:24,426
Just look at my wound.

295
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:25,705
How could I annoy you?

296
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,545
Sit down.

297
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,287
Everything's fine, everyone.
Don't be scared.

298
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,247
-Please stop crying.
-Don't be scared.

299
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:36,946
Doctor Pai is very gentle.

300
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,305
He will show you...

301
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:40,986
how to dress a wound
without causing any pain.

302
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,186
-It's okay.
-Please stop crying.

303
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:46,345
All the stubborn kids, come closer.

304
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:47,746
Let's move closer.

305
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,506
Don't cry.

306
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,426
Please.

307
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:55,706
I have some snacks
for anyone who helps him.

308
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:56,826
I'll help him.

309
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,625
Here it is.

310
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,307
Everyone, put on your blindfold and
hold the hand of the person next to you.

311
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:24,827
We'll slowly walk together.

312
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:38,746
Start walking once you're holding hands.

313
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:40,185
Keep holding hands.

314
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:50,266
Pai, hold my hand.

315
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,786
Put on your blindfold.

316
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:46,945
What?

317
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:51,106
Be quiet. The ceremony is about to start.

318
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,545
The purpose...

319
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,145
of the voluntary workcamp
is that the university wants...

320
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:02,066
all the faculty's Kings and Queens
to be an inspiration for others.

321
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:05,585
The workcamp requires you
to do good deeds, to share,

322
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,905
and to be a light in the darkness.

323
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,305
None of you are special people.

324
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:13,385
You are all equal.

325
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:17,065
Seniors have no power over you.

326
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:18,586
We're brothers and sisters.

327
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,506
All of you stand right where you are.

328
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,026
The seniors will come to you.

329
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,106
Are you a secret admirer type of guy?

330
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:48,905
No.

331
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:50,986
What are you waiting for then?

332
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,106
Are you afraid of disappointment?

333
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,546
That's not it.

334
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:02,385
Then go.

335
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:29,066
Beau?

336
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,066
Yes.

337
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:35,385
Since I'm one of the staff members,
can you tie my wrist?

338
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:38,185
Of course. Give me your hand.

339
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:43,786
Thank you for all of your help.

340
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:45,865
-Okay.
-Done.

341
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,705
-I'll go check on the others.
-Thank you.

342
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,665
She's cute.

343
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:58,547
You're close to her, aren't you?

344
00:27:58,627 --> 00:27:59,627
Can you help me?

345
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:26,506
Pai?

346
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:30,546
I have something to ask you.

347
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,385
We can talk later.

348
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,145
But...

349
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:40,746
I'm afraid it might be too late.

350
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:48,145
Would you be my boyfriend?

351
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,865
I already talked to you about this...

352
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:03,066
and I stand by what I said.

353
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,865
Do you like someone else?

354
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:18,826
I'm not comfortable
to talk about this with you.

355
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,066
He refused me.

356
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:42,986
Come on.

357
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,185
Let's drink.

358
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,185
Anything.

359
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,306
I don't want to be here anymore.

360
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,306
How about we decamp?

361
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:02,746
Let's go.

362
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:05,625
She's cute.

363
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,527
You're close to her, aren't you?

364
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:08,607
Can you help me?

365
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:22,026
What are you doing there, Waan?

366
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:24,026
You can't sleep?

367
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,145
Let's go for a walk?

368
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,465
Beau...

369
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:37,066
what kind of guy do you like?

370
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:42,625
Well, I like women.

371
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:43,746
What?

372
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:45,266
I was joking.

373
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:47,226
Why do you want to know?

374
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,425
Do you want to hit on me?

375
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:53,986
No.

376
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,266
Actually, a friend of mine wants to.

377
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:00,425
Can he?

378
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:04,026
Well...

379
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:06,746
Of course.

380
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:14,705
Would you excuse me? I'm going to bed.

381
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:28,266
I told you he likes you.

382
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,346
Are you happy?

383
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,266
He doesn't like me.

384
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,346
His friend does.

385
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:28,225
Where's your booty call?

386
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:31,026
Probably in bed with someone else.

387
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:41,665
It seems so easy for you guys.

388
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:47,546
It's just sex, not love.

389
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:49,586
It isn't that hard.

390
00:35:57,106 --> 00:35:58,506
How easy is it?

391
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:03,066
How easy do you want it to be?

392
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:02,345
Are you sure?

(Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul)

394
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,466
I've never felt this way
with my booty calls.

395
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,986
If I were to love someone,

396
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:06,426
I wouldn't need to wait
for a sign from the universe.

397
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:09,145
When love happens, it happens.

398
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,625
It might happen as soon
as you open up your heart.

399
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:12,665
Let me help you, Beau.

400
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:15,906
(Next episode)

401
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:17,745
I will be the winner,

402
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:19,545
and I will get my earring back.

403
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:22,265
Quit saying things you can't accomplish.

404
00:38:22,345 --> 00:38:23,705
You hate me.

405
00:38:24,145 --> 00:38:27,627
But from now on,
it won't be one-sided hatred anymore.

406
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:28,986
Remember,

407
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,066
I hate you too.
