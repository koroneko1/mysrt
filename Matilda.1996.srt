1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,961
<i>Everyone is born.
But not everyone is born the same.</i>

2
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,460
<i>Some will grow to be butchers,
or bakers or candlestick makers.</i>

3
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:57,217
<i>Some will only be good
at making Jell-O salad.</i>

4
00:00:57,388 --> 00:01:04,056
<i>But every human being is unique,
for better or for worse.</i>

5
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:09,514
<i>Most parents think their children
are the most beautiful things alive.</i>

6
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:13,940
<i>- Others are less emotional.
- What a waste of time.</i>

7
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:18,907
- $9.25 for a bar of soap!
- I had to take a shower.

8
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:23,242
$5,000! I'm not paying it!
They can't repossess the kid!

9
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:44,228
- There's no way out.
- Make a U- turn.

10
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,391
Harry!

11
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:59,865
<i>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood
lived in a very nice neighbourhood.</i>

12
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,955
<i>But they were not nice people.</i>

13
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,886
Get out of the street, you dodos!

14
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,724
<i>The Wormwoods were so busy,
they forgot they had a daughter.</i>

15
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:33,736
<i>If they had paid her any attention,
they'd have seen she was special.</i>

16
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:39,031
Oh, my gosh! Matilda!
Now look what you did!

17
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>You're supposed to eat the spinach!</i>

18
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:56,459
Babies...
You're better off raising tomatoes!

19
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:03,969
<i>At two, Matilda had already
learned how to take care of herself.</i>

20
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:11,480
<i>As time went by,
she developed a sense of style.</i>

21
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:16,361
<i>Every morning,
Matilda's brother went to school.</i>

22
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:21,030
<i>Her father went to work.
Selling used cars for unfair prices.</i>

23
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:26,033
<i>- Her mother took off to play Bingo.
- Soup's on the stove...</i>

24
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:29,746
<i>Matilda was left alone.</i>

25
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:33,542
<i>That was how she liked it.</i>

26
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:11,501
<i>At four. She had read
every magazine in the house.</i>

27
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:18,045
<i>One night. She asked her father for
something she desperately wanted.</i>

28
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:22,304
- A book? Why do you want a book?
- To read.

29
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,686
Why would you want to read,
when the television is right there?

30
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:35,490
- You get more out of watching TV.
- Get out of the way.

31
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,329
<i>Matilda already knew
she was different from her family.</i>

32
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:45,373
<i>She saw that whatever she needed.
She'd have to get herself.</i>

33
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,401
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

34
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,297
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

35
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:58,758
<i>The next morning,
Matilda set off in search of a book.</i>

36
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:42,434
- Where are the children's books?
- In that room.

37
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:49,816
- Would you like me to pick out one?
- No, thank you. I can manage.

38
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:13,008
<i>From then on, every day,
Matilda walked to the library.</i>

39
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:17,048
<i>She devoured one book after another.</i>

40
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:27,022
<i>When she finished all the children's
books. She searched for others.</i>

41
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:31,604
<i>Mrs. Phelps, who had been
watching her with fascination, -</i>

42
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,900
<i>- offered Matilda some information.</i>

43
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:40,495
You can have your own library card,
and take books home.

44
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:48,375
- You can take as many as you like.
- That would be wonderful.

45
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:57,504
<i>Matilda's strong mind continued
to grow, nurtured by the authors -</i>

46
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:03,471
<i>- who had sent their books out into
the world, like ships onto the sea.</i>

47
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:18,112
<i>The books gave Matilda a comforting
message: You are not alone.</i>

48
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,267
Did any packages come today?

49
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,268
- Where did all this come from?
- The library.

50
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:53,819
- The library? You're only four!
- 6...

51
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,691
Then you'd be in school already.

52
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:02,662
I was supposed to start school
in September. You wouldn't listen.

53
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,787
Get up.

54
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:10,082
Give me that book!

55
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:14,256
- How old is Matilda?
- Four.

56
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:20,016
- I'm 6... I was six in August.
- You're a liar.

57
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:26,804
- I want to go to school.
- Who'd sign for the packages?

58
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:32,856
We can't leave valuable packages
on the doorstep. Go watch TV.

59
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:39,117
- There's something wrong with her.
- Tell me about it.

60
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:44,283
Hey, dip face! Have a marshmallow.
Have another!

61
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:47,328
Dip face!

62
00:08:54,637 --> 00:09:01,435
<i>Matilda longed for a friend,
like the kind people in her books.</i>

63
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:07,024
<i>It occurred to her that
talking dragons and princesses -</i>

64
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,892
<i>- might exist only in story books.</i>

65
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,240
<i>But she was about to discover she
had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

66
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:17,409
<i>But she was about to discover she
had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

67
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:23,746
I'm great! I'm incredible!
Michael, pencil and paper.

68
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,867
- Did we sell some cars today?
- Did we!

69
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:31,297
- Can I get that new TV?
- Yeah!

70
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:38,217
It's time you learned the family
business. Write this down.

71
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:47,229
The first car I sold cost $320.
I sold it for $1.158.

72
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,148
The second one cost $512.
I sold it for $2.269!

73
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:59,988
- You're going too fast.
- Just write. The third cost $68.

74
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:07,496
I sold it for $999.
The fourth cost $1.100.

75
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:14,755
I sold it for
7,839 big American boffos!

76
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,968
- What was my profit for the day?
- $10.265.

77
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,930
Check it if you don't believe me.

78
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,154
- You saw the paper.
- From all the way over here?

79
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:39,026
Are you being smart with me?

80
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:43,997
- If you are, you'll be punished.
- Punished for being smart?

81
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:50,338
When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

82
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:53,878
- Person?
- Get up!

83
00:10:54,054 --> 00:11:00,174
<i>Harry had unintentionally given
his daughter some practical advice.</i>

84
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:05,809
<i>He meant to say, "child".
Instead, he said, "person".</i>

85
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:13,113
<i>Thereby, he introduced the idea that
children could punish their parents.</i>

86
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:18,317
<i>Only when they deserved it.
Of course.</i>

87
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:39,364
Michael, come into my room!

88
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:46,877
- What?
- I'll take you to work today, okay?

89
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:52,005
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I think appearance is important.

90
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:57,219
People don't buy a car. They buy me.
So I take pride in my appearance.

91
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:04,272
Well-oiled hair. Clean shave...
Get ready for a big day of learning.

92
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:10,063
There's a sucker born every minute.
We'll take them for all they've got.

93
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:14,983
- Give me the cookies.
- Here.

94
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:26,286
Okay, my boy! Heir to the throne!
Today we diddle the customers.

95
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:29,630
What are you looking at?

96
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,554
- Lovekins, where's my breakfast?
- Here we are, my heartstrings...

97
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,511
Snicker doodle.
What did you do to your hair?

98
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,774
My hair?

99
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,408
Give me those things.
Get in the car.

100
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,250
Get in.

101
00:14:07,422 --> 00:14:11,551
<i>Dirty dealings, like buying
stolen car parts, never stay secret.</i>

102
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:15,253
<i>Especially when the FBI
gets involved.</i>

103
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:27,812
- 9:17. Subject exits domicile.
- I've got 9:18.

104
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:32,563
9:17 is correct.

105
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:45,994
- One day, all this will be yours.
- This?

106
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:52,043
See this Junker? I paid $100 for it.
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

107
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:55,422
Transmission's shot.
Bumpers are falling off...

108
00:14:55,597 --> 00:15:00,805
What do I do with her?
I sell her!

109
00:15:00,978 --> 00:15:07,516
We should weld these bumpers on,
but that takes time and money.

110
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:10,979
So we use Super Super Glue instead.

111
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:15,533
- Go ahead. Put it on there.
- Won't it fall off?

112
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:22,452
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Not to me. Okay? Transmission!

113
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:28,462
The sawdust lets the engine run
sweet as a nut. For a few miles.

114
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:33,211
- Daddy, that's cheating.
- Nobody ever got rich being honest.

115
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:38,595
20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand.

116
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:43,146
But the Feds like to test the
ingenuity of American businessmen.

117
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:48,901
Two-directional drill. If you run it
backwards, the numbers go down.

118
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,398
Cool!

119
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:59,580
- Daddy, you're a crook.
- What?

120
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:04,825
- This is illegal.
- Here, keep drilling.

121
00:16:05,003 --> 00:16:10,840
- Do you make money?
- Don't people need good cars?

122
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,845
Can't you sell good cars?

123
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:20,016
I'm smart, you're dumb.
I'm right, you're wrong!

124
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:23,851
There's nothing you can do about it.

125
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:41,409
Harry, I won!
I hit the double bingo!

126
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,498
I'm taking you all to Cafe Le Ritz!

127
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,087
Let me see the money!

128
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:54,253
Your hair looks awful!
I hope they'll let you in.

129
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,678
- Here's your hat, Daddy.
- Get in the car.

130
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:06,601
- How much?
- It's for me to know.

131
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,483
- You never take us out.
- I took you to The Flipper.

132
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:23,329
- There was a comb in the soup.
- Oh, yeah! I like that joint.

133
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,452
- This way, please.
- Harry, take your hat off.

134
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,049
- I can't.
- You can't wear a hat inside.

135
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,798
- I can't take it off.
- Nobody cares about your hair.

136
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:40,308
I can't get it off.

137
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,474
I'm gonna get this hat off.

138
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:50,443
I think your head swelled up.

139
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:55,157
- You're pulling the skin!
- You're such a baby!

140
00:17:55,327 --> 00:18:00,404
- The fibres are fused to the head!
- What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:38,535
I will not be a figure of ridicule!
I want respect!

142
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:46,004
I still don't see
how you glued your hat on, Harry.

143
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:52,376
I did not glue my hat to my head!
The fibres fused to my hair!

144
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:59,091
Baby, wait a minute!
I'm getting it now.

145
00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:03,222
Oh, my God!

146
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:16,820
From now on, this family does
exactly what I say, when I say it!

147
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,666
Here's your hat.

148
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:25,538
Right now, we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

149
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:28,939
<i>Are you ready to get sticky
with Mickey?</i>

150
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,789
<i>Are you ready to get sticky
with Mickey?</i>

151
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:35,713
Shut your light off.

152
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:41,144
<i>For those idiots who don't know
how to play, here's how it goes.</i>

153
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,856
<i>For each correct answer, you'll move
one step closer to our cube of cash!</i>

154
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:52,859
<i>Any money that sticks to your
gooey body, you get to take home!</i>

155
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,328
- Hi. Dad.
- Are you in this family?

156
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:06,502
Hello. Are you in this family?

157
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,634
What is this trash you're reading?

158
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:17,348
It's lovely. It's "Moby Dick",
by Herman Melville.

159
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:23,767
Moby what?
This is filth!

160
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:29,611
- It's a library book!
- I'm fed up with all this reading!

161
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,988
You're a Wormwood! Act like one!
Sit up and look at the TV!

162
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:39,953
<i>Get real sticky
and get cash for free.</i>

163
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:42,496
<i>Let's get sticky!</i>

164
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:25,752
- I didn't do it.
- Of course not, you little twit!

165
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:32,172
- I told you that was a cheap set.
- It's not cheap, it's stolen.

166
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,178
Put your light on!

167
00:21:37,351 --> 00:21:41,135
<i>Was it magic, or coincidence?</i>

168
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:45,181
<i>We only use
a tiny portion of our brains.</i>

169
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,690
<i>The events of the following day
made Matilda discover her strength.</i>

170
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:58,621
- I need a car. Can you service me?
- Yes. Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

171
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:06,205
- Harry Wormwood, owner and founder.
- Agatha Trunchbull, Principal.

172
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:12,135
I want a tight car,
because I run a tight ship.

173
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:17,180
My school is a model of discipline.
"Use the rod. Beat the child."

174
00:22:17,351 --> 00:22:19,807
Do you have brats?

175
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:25,400
- A boy, Mikey, and one mistake.
- They're all mistakes, children.

176
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:30,444
- I'm glad I never was one.
- I'm gonna make you a great deal.

177
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,987
You had better.

178
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,578
Thank you. Enjoy it.

179
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,162
Thank you. Enjoy it.

180
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,869
Hey, you.
You're going to school.

181
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:47,580
You'll get a real education
at this place.

182
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:54,762
<i>Matilda had always wanted
to go to school.</i>

183
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:59,179
<i>She tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.</i>

184
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>She pictured a lovely building,
surrounded by trees and flowers.</i>

185
00:23:08,112 --> 00:23:11,398
<i>There was a building. And children!</i>

186
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:17,245
<i>Regardless of how the school looked,
she was happy to be there.</i>

187
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:24,827
<i>After all, any school is better
than no school at all. Isn't it?</i>

188
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:01,912
You... detention.

189
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,877
You're too small. Grow up quicker!

190
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,886
Heads up! Shoulders back!

191
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,182
- Sorry.
- It's better than being out there.

192
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:26,358
- Is that my teacher?
- No, that's the principal.

193
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:34,026
The principal likes to snap a whip
in here to see who's hiding.

194
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:38,488
- I'm Matilda.
- Lavender.

195
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:43,826
- I'm Hortensia.
- Does she really hit children?

196
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:50,838
No. What she does is worse.
Like yesterday, in the second grade.

197
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:56,765
She makes weekly visits to show
the teachers how to handle kids.

198
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,310
- Julius ate two M&Ms.
- And she caught him?

199
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,685
- Julius ate two M&Ms.
- And she caught him?

200
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:04,145
Of course!

201
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:16,119
- Was Julius okay?
- He lived, if that's what you mean.

202
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,374
She used to be in the Olympics.
Shot- put, javelin, hammer throw.

203
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:25,795
So she does this all the time?

204
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:28,883
- It's better than the Chokey.
- Chokey?

205
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:36,347
It's a tall hole in the wall.
A drippy pipe with jagged edges.

206
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:39,969
The walls have nails sticking out.

207
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:43,681
Get in, you festering bowl of pus!

208
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:47,274
I've been in there twice.

209
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:53,069
- Didn't you tell your parents?
- Would your parents believe it?

210
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,280
You must obey Miss Trunchbull.

211
00:25:56,455 --> 00:26:00,038
No. Here she comes!

212
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:05,996
Ah! Fresh meat!

213
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:17,515
- Amanda Thripp.
- Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

214
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:23,440
What are those...
hanging down by your ears?

215
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:28,270
- You mean my pigtails?
- Are you a pig?

216
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:33,654
- No. Miss Trunchbull.
- Do I allow pigs in my school?

217
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:41,622
- My mommy thinks they're sweet.
- Your mommy is a twit!

218
00:26:41,793 --> 00:26:46,088
- Chop them off by tomorrow, or...
- But...

219
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:50,125
But?
Did you say "but"?

220
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,972
- Hammer throw.
- Definitely.

221
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:56,343
I'll give you "but".

222
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:08,569
- Good loft!
- Excellent release!

223
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:16,201
Think she'll make the fence?

224
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,604
Get to class before I throw you all
in the Chokey.

225
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:45,565
- Lavender, what's my teacher like?
- Run. Run. Run!

226
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:48,607
Faster! Get in!

227
00:27:49,949 --> 00:27:54,279
<i>Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,
was one of those people -</i>

228
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:58,498
<i>- who appreciates every child
for who she or he is.</i>

229
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:04,123
- I scooped these up for you.
- How lovely. Thank you, Amanda.

230
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:08,165
We have a new student with us today.

231
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:13,004
This is Matilda Wormwood.
I'd like you to sit with Lavender.

232
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:19,469
You all know how scary the first day
of school is. So be nice to Matilda.

233
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:24,641
Could you get her workbook, please?
You can sit down.

234
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:28,152
<i>Miss Honey was a wonderful teacher.</i>

235
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:34,692
<i>But her life was not as beautiful
as it seemed. She had a dark secret.</i>

236
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,375
<i>Though it caused her pain, it didn't
interfere with her teaching.</i>

237
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:47,341
You've come on a good day. We're
going to review what we've learned.

238
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:55,054
If you know an answer,
just raise your hand.

239
00:28:55,225 --> 00:29:00,101
We've been working on our times
tables. Who'd like to demonstrate?

240
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:05,816
Let's do some together.

241
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,107
- 2 x 4 is?
- 8.

242
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,568
- 2 x 6 is?
- 12.

243
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:16,948
- 2 x 9 is?
- 18.

244
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:22,628
Soon you'll be able to do them all,
whether it's 2 x 7...

245
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:27,541
- 14.
- Or 13 x 379.

246
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:31,300
4,927.

247
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:37,303
- I beg your pardon?
- I think that's the answer.

248
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:42,224
13 x 379 is 4.927.

249
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:04,501
- It is.
- Wow...

250
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:16,471
- You can multiply big numbers?
- I read a book on mathematics.

251
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:22,350
- You like to read?
- Yes. I love to read.

252
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:30,900
- What do you like to read?
- I've been reading Darls Chickens.

253
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:35,785
Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

254
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:40,083
So could I.

255
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:47,921
All right, take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

256
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:57,683
I'll be back in a moment.

257
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:13,282
Gotcha! Right in the neck.

258
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,165
Come in.

259
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:23,289
Almost got you.

260
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:27,413
Good to see you, Jen.

261
00:31:27,593 --> 00:31:31,543
Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

262
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:39,514
It's about the new girl in my class,
Matilda Wormwood.

263
00:31:39,688 --> 00:31:42,358
Her father says she's a real wart.

264
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,475
A carbuncle. A blister.
A pustule of malignant ooze.

265
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:53,072
- Matilda is sweet and very bright.
- A bright child?

266
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,405
- She can multiply large sums.
- So can a calculator.

267
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:04,918
I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

268
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,084
You can't handle the little viper,
so you're trying to get rid of her.

269
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:15,055
- No...
- Typical, slothful cowardice!

270
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:22,225
The distance the shot-put goes
depends on your effort.

271
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,936
If you can't handle the little brat,
I'II lock her in the Chokey!

272
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:34,326
- Get it?
- Yes. Ma'am.

273
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:38,079
Everything I do
is for your own good.

274
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,746
And the good of
those putrescent, little children!

275
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:11,819
<i>- Mom. I'm home.
- How was school?</i>

276
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:17,498
- I get to do sixth grade work.
- Hold on a minute.

277
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:22,908
- Can't you see I'm on the phone?
- You just asked me how school was.

278
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:29,381
- The baby wasn't his.
- Well, it was really great.

279
00:33:29,553 --> 00:33:34,382
- No way. They have to be implants.
- The principal is insane.

280
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,060
- She threw a girl over the fence.
- You should wax yours, too.

281
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:44,268
I have the most wonderful teacher.

282
00:33:44,444 --> 00:33:50,031
Mine are driving me crazy.
Six hours at school is not enough.

283
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,359
I'll say.

284
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:58,242
A whack to the belly.
A smack to the face. Burns is hurt.

285
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,955
Saved by the bell.

286
00:34:01,128 --> 00:34:05,920
- Packages at this hour?
- Come here.

287
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:14,298
- Hello.
- We don't give money, charity...

288
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:18,852
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

289
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:25,191
What's she done now?
You! Go to your room, right now!

290
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:31,365
- She's your problem now.
- There is no problem.

291
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:35,284
Then beat it. We're watching TV.

292
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:42,787
If a TV show is more important than
Matilda, you shouldn't be a parent.

293
00:34:42,963 --> 00:34:46,249
Turn it off and listen to me.

294
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:55,886
Come on in. Get this over with.
Mrs. Wormwood won't like this.

295
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:01,357
- Close the door.
- Who is it?

296
00:35:01,524 --> 00:35:05,392
Some teacher.

297
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:11,026
- What did you do that for?
- What do you want?

298
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:16,907
- Matilda has a brilliant mind.
- Yeah, right. Give me a beer.

299
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:21,709
- Her math skills are extraordinary.
- Do you want one?

300
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:28,761
No thank you. She's reading material
that I didn't see until college.

301
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,051
College!

302
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:36,430
With private instruction, she'd be
ready for college in a few years.

303
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:42,606
A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

304
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:48,399
Look at you and me.
You chose books. I chose looks.

305
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:57,079
I have a nice house and a husband.
You teach children their ABC's.

306
00:35:57,249 --> 00:36:00,666
You want Matilda to go to college?

307
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:05,214
I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

308
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:08,834
A bunch of hippies
and cesspool salesmen.

309
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:12,712
Don't sneer at educated people.

310
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:18,312
If you became ill, your doctor
would be a college graduate.

311
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,855
If you were sued, your lawyer
would have gone to college, too.

312
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:29,235
Sued by who?
Who have you been talking to?

313
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:33,157
Nobody.

314
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:39,581
I can see
we're not going to agree. Are we?

315
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:44,165
I'm sorry
I burst in on you like this.

316
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,168
We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

317
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:55,553
- Why's he standing in the middle?
- Because it's over.

318
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:59,726
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

319
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:07,152
- Who won?
- I don't know. You shut it off.

320
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:10,427
<i>The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately!</i>

321
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,531
<i>The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately!</i>

322
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:16,112
Sit!

323
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:19,126
- What's up?
- Beats me.

324
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,330
Bruce Bogtrotter.

325
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,933
Would little Brucey come up here?

326
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,904
He lives on my block.

327
00:37:56,582 --> 00:38:04,875
This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter,
is a vicious sneak thief.

328
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:10,092
- You're a disgusting criminal.
- What are you talking about?

329
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:13,016
Chocolate cake.

330
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:19,767
You slithered like a serpent
into the kitchen and ate my snack!

331
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,356
Do you deny it?

332
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:29,449
Confess!

333
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:37,625
- I can't remember a specific cake.
- This one was mine.

334
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:43,332
- It was the best cake in the world.
- My mom's is better.

335
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:50,221
How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

336
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:55,514
Sit down, Bog.

337
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:19,583
Here we go.
Smells chocolatey, eh?

338
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:23,087
Now. Eat it!

339
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:28,295
I don't want any. Thank you.

340
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,886
Eat it!

341
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:35,263
Don't eat it.

342
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:38,852
- She wouldn't give him cake.
- It's poison.

343
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:14,924
- You look like you enjoyed that.
- Yes. Ma'am.

344
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:20,346
- You must have some more.
- No thanks.

345
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:25,021
But you'll hurt the cook's feelings.

346
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:33,027
She made this cake just for you.

347
00:40:35,457 --> 00:40:39,123
Her sweat and blood
went into this cake.

348
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:45,629
You will not leave this platform
until you have eaten the whole cake!

349
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:51,425
- The whole cake! See you at lunch.
- Thank you, Cookie.

350
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,104
You wanted cake, you got cake.
Now eat it!

351
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,449
Poor Brucey.

352
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:48,236
He's going to puke.

353
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:53,651
- I can't look. Is he going to puke?
- Without a doubt.

354
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,755
- Bruce looks real bad.
- Give up?

355
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:13,886
You can do it, Brucey!

356
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:18,604
Yeah, you can do it!

357
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,181
Go. Bruce!

358
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,908
Silence!

359
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:42,087
Silence!

360
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:45,706
Stop! Silence!

361
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,654
The entire assembly
will stay five hours after school!

362
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:22,335
Any children who object will go
straight into the Chokey. Together!

363
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:35,642
<i>Code R's the official way of saying
we've caught a bad one.</i>

364
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:46,687
- Where were you?
- Miss Trunchbull kept us late.

365
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:53,034
That's a lie! The packages were left
outside because you weren't here.

366
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:59,078
You get all this stuff from
catalogues and I don't get anything!

367
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:02,752
It's car parts. It's business.

368
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:08,001
- Why isn't it sent to the office?
- The cops are watching the office.

369
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:11,429
The cops are watching the house.

370
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,480
- They're parked outside, right now.
- Those are speedboat salesmen.

371
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:22,148
- Really nice guys.
- Cops.

372
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,568
Speedboats?
There are no lakes around here.

373
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:34,947
- Some people go away on weekends.
- And some people are cops.

374
00:44:35,124 --> 00:44:43,666
They're not cops!
Go to bed, you lying little earwig!

375
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:48,800
<i>With the FBI watching her father,
and the Trunchbull at school. -</i>

376
00:44:48,972 --> 00:44:53,052
<i>- it was a rare moment when Matilda
could just play.</i>

377
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:56,725
A frog! A frog! A frog!

378
00:44:56,896 --> 00:45:00,479
- What is it. Lavender?
- A frog!

379
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:06,027
- It's a salamander.
- It's a chameleon.

380
00:45:06,198 --> 00:45:10,576
"Any of the semi aquatic salamanders
from the genus triturus."

381
00:45:10,745 --> 00:45:16,415
"Some are brightly coloured
and secrete irritating substances."

382
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:23,420
Useless, flaming car!

383
00:45:25,885 --> 00:45:29,385
Wormwood! Sell me a lemon!

384
00:45:29,556 --> 00:45:33,636
You're heading for the Chokey!
Teach you a lesson!

385
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:38,556
You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

386
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:42,896
- I'm nothing like my father!
- You're the spitting image!

387
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:47,241
The apple never rots
far from the tree!

388
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:51,987
- Miss Honey!
- Trunchbull is teaching our class.

389
00:45:52,162 --> 00:45:55,947
She'll be here any second!

390
00:45:56,751 --> 00:46:02,540
Make sure the water is cold.
Cover the fish!

391
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:05,966
Put away the art projects.

392
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:10,085
<i>Most great ideas
come from careful planning.</i>

393
00:46:10,265 --> 00:46:14,927
<i>But sometimes.
They just jump out at you.</i>

394
00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:24,070
Last time, you forgot yourselves.
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

395
00:46:24,238 --> 00:46:30,525
- Don't laugh. Don't breathe loudly.
- Don't breathe at all.

396
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:36,081
Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

397
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:41,082
Sit!

398
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:46,297
Shoo.

399
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:53,258
I don't understand
why children are so disgusting.

400
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,721
They're like insects.

401
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,349
They should be got rid of.

402
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:11,193
The perfect school is one in which
there are no children.

403
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,531
Do you agree, Miss Honey?

404
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:22,998
You! Front of the class!

405
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,051
Are you okay?

406
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:37,647
Next time I tell you
to empty your pockets, do it faster!

407
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:41,943
This could be the most
interesting thing you've ever done.

408
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:50,654
Sit down, you squirming worm!

409
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,872
Get up!

410
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:11,799
- Can you spell?
- We can spell "difficulty".

411
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:17,930
- You can't spell "difficulty".
- She taught us with a poem.

412
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:21,642
How sweet. What poem is that?

413
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:27,988
Mrs. D. Mrs. I.
Mrs. F. F. I.

414
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,533
Mrs. C. Mrs. U.
Mrs. L. T. Y.

415
00:48:33,706 --> 00:48:40,326
Why are all these women married?
You teach spelling, not poetry!

416
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:50,680
Why do small children
take so long to grow up?

417
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:54,977
They do it deliberately,
just to annoy me.

418
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,955
What's funny?

419
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:18,366
Spit it out! I like a joke
as well as the next fat person.

420
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:27,257
It's a snake!

421
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:31,176
It's a snake!

422
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:35,559
One of you tried to poison me. Who?

423
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:40,272
Matilda! I knew it.

424
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:45,271
- It's not a snake. It's a newt.
- What did you say?

425
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:52,412
- It's a newt. Miss Trunchbull.
- Stand up! You did this.

426
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:57,077
- No. Miss Trunchbull.
- Did you have accomplices?

427
00:49:58,587 --> 00:50:05,088
- I didn't do it!
- You thought you'd pay me back?

428
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,673
- Well, I'II pay you back.
- For what. Miss Trunchbull?

429
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:15,389
- For this newt, you pissworm!
- I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

430
00:50:15,563 --> 00:50:21,732
Anyway, I'm big and you're small,
I'm right and you're wrong.

431
00:50:21,903 --> 00:50:26,779
There's nothing you can do about it.
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

432
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:33,119
Your father is a cheat! You're the
most corrupt low-lifes in history!

433
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,576
Am I wrong? I'm never wrong.

434
00:50:36,752 --> 00:50:42,837
In this classroom. In this school,
I am God!

435
00:51:13,874 --> 00:51:16,626
- You!
- I didn't move!

436
00:51:16,794 --> 00:51:22,001
- You did this.
- She was sitting way over here.

437
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:27,002
I'll be watching you.
Each and every one.

438
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:32,056
When you turn the corner,
when you get your smelly coats.

439
00:51:32,227 --> 00:51:37,387
When you skip merrily to lunch.
I'll be watching you. All of you.

440
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:40,934
And especially you!

441
00:51:51,497 --> 00:51:56,657
- Thanks for not telling.
- Best friends don't tell.

442
00:51:56,835 --> 00:52:00,454
She can really dance.

443
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:06,337
I'm gonna clean up this mess.
I'll be out there in a minute.

444
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:11,933
- Miss Honey...
- Yes. Matilda?

445
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:17,641
- I did it.
- Did what?

446
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:23,439
- I made the glass tip over.
- Don't let her make you feel bad.

447
00:52:23,614 --> 00:52:30,992
- It was an accident.
- I did it with my eyes. Watch.

448
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:40,129
It's wonderful you feel so powerful.
Many people don't.

449
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:53,219
Come on. Tip over.

450
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:57,689
- Tip over.
- It's all right, Matilda.

451
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:07,565
- I really did do it, Miss Honey.
- Sometimes you can do things.

452
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:12,452
But when you want to show someone,
then you can't.

453
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:18,709
- Or maybe something is broken...
- This isn't like that.

454
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:25,170
I don't know.
Maybe I made myself tired.

455
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:32,723
- Would you like to go to my house?
- I'd like that very much.

456
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:35,058
Good.

457
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,430
Good.

458
00:53:37,149 --> 00:53:42,772
I just stare very hard
and I can feel the strongness.

459
00:53:42,946 --> 00:53:46,695
I feel I can move almost anything.

460
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:53,998
- You do believe me. Don't you?
- You should believe in it.

461
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:58,544
Believe it with all your heart.

462
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:03,712
That's where Miss Trunchbull lives.

463
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:10,675
- Why is there a swing?
- A girl used to live in that house.

464
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:17,732
Her life was good and happy.
When she was two. Her mother died.

465
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,526
Her father was a doctor. He needed
someone to look after things.

466
00:54:22,696 --> 00:54:26,148
He asked the mother's stepsister
to live with them.

467
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:30,868
But the girl's aunt was mean
and treated her badly.

468
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:34,159
- Trunchbull?
- Yes.

469
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:39,957
- Then the girl's father died.
- How did her father die?

470
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:44,710
- The police said he killed himself.
- Why would he do that?

471
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:48,338
No one knows.

472
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:55,141
The end is happier.
She found a small cottage.

473
00:54:55,314 --> 00:55:02,775
She rented it for $50 a month and
planted hundreds of wild flowers.

474
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:08,072
- And she moved out of the house.
- Good for her.

475
00:55:08,244 --> 00:55:12,112
- Do you know why I told you this?
- No.

476
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:20,667
Your family doesn't appreciate you.
One day, things will be different.

477
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:30,889
- Should we have tea and cookies?
- Yes, please.

478
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:39,187
- It's the cottage from your story.
- Yes.

479
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:44,107
The young woman is you!

480
00:55:44,282 --> 00:55:49,787
- Then... No!
- Yes.

481
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:53,619
Aunt Trunchbull.

482
00:55:55,918 --> 00:56:00,960
When I left Aunt Trunchbull's home.
I left all my treasures behind.

483
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:06,128
- Treasures?
- Photos of my mother and father.

484
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:12,557
And a beautiful doll my mother
gave me. Lissy Doll, I called her.

485
00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:16,678
- Milk?
- Yes, please.

486
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:20,309
Why don't you run away?

487
00:56:20,486 --> 00:56:25,065
I've thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

488
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:29,950
- Without teaching I'd have nothing.
- You're very brave.

489
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:37,075
- Not as brave as you.
- I thought adults weren't afraid.

490
00:56:37,254 --> 00:56:42,794
All adults get scared,
just like children.

491
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:44,882
I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

492
00:56:44,883 --> 00:56:46,796
I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

493
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:56,641
There she is!

494
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:07,689
- Shot-put. Hammer throw.
- Javelin.

495
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:20,670
Back. Back. Back.

496
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:25,052
- She's afraid of a cat?
- Black cats. She's superstitious.

497
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:39,649
- Poor kitty.
- He's all right.

498
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,535
- Let's go get your treasures.
- No!

499
00:57:49,704 --> 00:57:53,204
She's gone. Come on!

500
00:57:55,502 --> 00:57:57,709
Matilda!

501
00:57:57,879 --> 00:58:00,916
Miss Honey!

502
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:11,804
Move, you piece of junkyard fodder!
Shift, you filthy...

503
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:23,398
My house!

504
00:58:30,747 --> 00:58:34,447
Oh, my!

505
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:42,790
- My father's portrait was there.
- The artist must have been brave.

506
00:58:42,968 --> 00:58:45,506
Really brave.

507
00:59:07,452 --> 00:59:13,206
We should go...
Father's chocolate box.

508
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:21,333
After supper, he'd take a chocolate
and cut it in half.

509
00:59:21,509 --> 00:59:24,593
And he'd give me the bigger half.

510
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:28,262
When he died.
I couldn't even sneak one.

511
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:32,928
She'd take a chocolate and say:

512
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:36,639
Much too good for children!

513
00:59:40,195 --> 00:59:42,864
Have one.

514
00:59:45,868 --> 00:59:49,699
No. She'd notice.

515
00:59:49,871 --> 00:59:53,287
- Where's Lissy Doll?
- Upstairs.

516
00:59:55,335 --> 00:59:57,957
Matilda...

517
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:17,018
This is my room.

518
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:25,147
- That's my dad.
- What's his name?

519
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:30,486
Magnus. I called him King Magnus.
And he called me Bumblebee.

520
01:00:31,874 --> 01:00:36,501
- I don't think he killed himself.
- Neither do I.

521
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:42,628
Is that Lissy Doll?

522
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:46,506
Wormwood!

523
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:51,723
You useless. Used car salesman scum!
Come here. Now!

524
01:00:52,645 --> 01:00:58,233
I know what "caveat emptor" means,
but I'm gonna sue you!

525
01:00:58,402 --> 01:01:03,396
I'II burn down your shop! I'll shove
that jalopy up your bazonga!

526
01:01:03,573 --> 01:01:09,410
You're gonna look like road kill!
You what...?

527
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:34,688
Come on.

528
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:44,277
- Shouldn't we hide?
- Go out the kitchen door.

529
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:47,119
I'll distract her.

530
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,785
Who's in my house?

531
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,637
Come out and fight like a man!

532
01:03:01,697 --> 01:03:03,939
Tally-ho!

533
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:10,613
Come on.

534
01:05:26,849 --> 01:05:29,601
Over there.

535
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:33,552
Some rats are gonna die today.

536
01:06:12,062 --> 01:06:14,933
Oh, my goodness.

537
01:06:15,399 --> 01:06:21,355
Feel my heart. Weren't you
the most scared you've ever been?

538
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:32,536
She shouldn't treat people that way.
Somebody has to teach her a lesson.

539
01:06:32,709 --> 01:06:36,209
When she leaves, we'll get the doll.

540
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:41,208
- What?
- Just kidding.

541
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:44,505
Come here.

542
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:50,054
Promise me you'll never
go back in that house again.

543
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:56,183
- I promise.
- Okay. Come on.

544
01:07:03,951 --> 01:07:09,905
He came home with $2.000 cash
and he threw it up in the air.

545
01:07:10,081 --> 01:07:15,242
We swam in it like we were on
"The Million Dollar Sticky"!

546
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,628
- Do you like that show?
- I love that show.

547
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:26,507
Now he has money in banks all over.
But does he give me a dime?

548
01:07:26,682 --> 01:07:30,846
- Matilda. This is Bob and Bill.
- They're cops.

549
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:37,141
- They are Ace Power Boat salesmen.
- Baby face, I'm starved!

550
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:41,731
- Hi, Harry.
- Who are you?

551
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:45,322
What is this? A hot tub party?

552
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:50,868
- You're entertaining surfers?
- They're cops, Dad.

553
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,870
- Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.

554
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:54,700
- Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.

555
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:58,497
You don't let me talk to people!

556
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,793
I need to talk to someone
besides the kids.

557
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:08,767
A man is entitled to come home
and find dinner on the table!

558
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:14,890
- Dad. Yell at me, okay?
- Shut up and leave us alone!

559
01:08:15,066 --> 01:08:20,689
- Yell at me again!
- I'll pound your miserable hide!

560
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:26,368
I want respect! You'll get
a tanning you won't forget!

561
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:28,992
My word is law!

562
01:08:34,629 --> 01:08:39,539
<i>No kid likes being yelled at.
But Harry's ranting and raving -</i>

563
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:42,552
<i>- gave Matilda the key to her power.</i>

564
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,932
<i>To unlock that power,
all she had to do was practice.</i>

565
01:08:57,110 --> 01:09:02,235
<i>Start acting like a Wormwood!
What are you? Stupid?</i>

566
01:09:02,407 --> 01:09:05,574
<i>There's something wrong with her.</i>

567
01:09:05,744 --> 01:09:11,332
<i>If you're a Wormwood, it's time
you started acting like one!</i>

568
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:28,204
<i>That was one of my favorites,
played for all you pretty ones.</i>

569
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:29,932
<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

570
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,492
<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

571
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:48,349
- Don't we need a search warrant?
- No. This guy's dirty.

572
01:10:48,518 --> 01:10:55,933
We'll show this tape in court.
That box is full of stolen parts.

573
01:10:56,110 --> 01:11:00,902
How about letting me
handle that camera for a while?

574
01:11:01,072 --> 01:11:05,818
Do you know how to use it?
Do you know about the zoom?

575
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:10,704
- How to adjust the eye piece?
- I can handle it.

576
01:11:13,044 --> 01:11:15,582
It's my turn.

577
01:11:15,755 --> 01:11:20,915
- Your turn to drop it.
- I won't drop it.

578
01:11:23,429 --> 01:11:26,549
You'll be in a lot of trouble.

579
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,389
The female minor.

580
01:11:31,605 --> 01:11:35,733
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- I hope you have a search warrant.

581
01:11:35,901 --> 01:11:42,319
If you don't, you could lose
your job or even go to prison.

582
01:11:44,076 --> 01:11:47,860
Your father is going to prison.
Do you know where you'll end up?

583
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:51,906
- In an orphanage.
- We can make it a nice one.

584
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:57,589
The kind with food... and tiny
cockroaches. What do you say?

585
01:11:59,008 --> 01:12:03,754
Your car is
about to run a stop sign.

586
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:18,524
<i>She bought some time for her dad.</i>

587
01:12:18,695 --> 01:12:24,817
<i>But now. Matilda had
bigger fish to fry. Much bigger.</i>

588
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:44,345
- Hey, dip face. Where are you going?
- Out.

589
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:50,093
Have a carrot.

590
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,094
Chew your food!

591
01:13:05,095 --> 01:13:06,446
Chew your food!

592
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:15,915
<i>Having power isn't as important
as what you do with it.</i>

593
01:13:16,089 --> 01:13:21,629
<i>And what Matilda had in mind
was nothing short of heroic.</i>

594
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:47,635
Come on!

595
01:14:47,810 --> 01:14:50,930
Lissy Doll, come on!

596
01:14:51,105 --> 01:14:54,272
Please come here.

597
01:16:53,524 --> 01:16:56,479
Leave me alone!

598
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,805
Magnus!

599
01:18:31,002 --> 01:18:34,916
Miss Honey!
You'll never believe what I got you!

600
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,670
I also brought you this.
I ate mine last night.

601
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:02,524
I will be teaching your class today.

602
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:15,326
<i>Miss Honey was getting nervous,
but Matilda had a plan.</i>

603
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:21,130
- She is really raving mad.
- What did your father call you?

604
01:19:21,304 --> 01:19:24,139
- Hummingbird?
- Bumblebee.

605
01:19:24,307 --> 01:19:28,685
- She knows the doll is missing.
- And he called her Trunchbull?

606
01:19:28,854 --> 01:19:35,984
- He called her Agatha.
- She called him Magnus, right?

607
01:19:36,152 --> 01:19:41,859
Maybe I could put the doll back.
No. I can't do that.

608
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:45,902
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

609
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:52,616
- You promised you wouldn't go back.
- I was on the garage roof.

610
01:19:52,795 --> 01:19:57,956
- I did it with my powers.
- All right. I need to think.

611
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,659
Powers?

612
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:31,703
I think I got them down.
Watch this.

613
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:53,725
And no more Miss Nice Girl.

614
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:56,937
Get inside, quickly! Run!

615
01:20:58,364 --> 01:21:02,278
Get against that wall, quickly!

616
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:05,024
Water!

617
01:21:05,204 --> 01:21:09,249
And hold the newt!

618
01:21:11,586 --> 01:21:15,584
Join the ranks. Move!

619
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:22,004
I am here to teach you all a lesson.

620
01:21:25,016 --> 01:21:30,604
Sometimes in life. Horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

621
01:21:34,276 --> 01:21:38,487
These things
are a test of character.

622
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,365
And I have character.

623
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:49,785
Form a line across the room!

624
01:21:49,959 --> 01:21:52,877
Fill this gap!

625
01:21:53,046 --> 01:21:57,292
I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about.

626
01:22:00,136 --> 01:22:03,552
A child came to my house.

627
01:22:03,723 --> 01:22:07,342
I don't know how, when or why.

628
01:22:07,519 --> 01:22:11,138
- May I...?
- No, you may not.

629
01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:14,767
But I know a child came.

630
01:22:14,943 --> 01:22:22,026
Did you know it was illegal to enter
someone's home without permission?

631
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:25,037
Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

632
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:29,823
Stomach in! Shoulders back!

633
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:35,541
Do any of you recognise this?

634
01:22:37,133 --> 01:22:39,707
Let's play a game.

635
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:45,391
Who was wearing
a pretty, red ribbon yesterday -

636
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:48,430
- and isn't wearing one today?

637
01:22:48,604 --> 01:22:56,149
Who does this disgusting ribbon
belong to?

638
01:22:58,364 --> 01:23:04,154
I shall personally see to it
that the demented Lilliputian -

639
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:09,915
- who owns this ribbon will never
see the light of day again!

640
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:13,584
I was at your house last night.

641
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:17,919
I broke your arm once before.
I can do it again.

642
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:22,839
I'm not seven years old anymore,
Aunt Trunchbull.

643
01:23:24,558 --> 01:23:27,724
Shut your holes!

644
01:23:27,894 --> 01:23:34,776
You'll be put away in a place
where no one will find you.

645
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:37,898
Look!

646
01:23:38,072 --> 01:23:41,073
The chalk!

647
01:23:46,998 --> 01:23:51,909
"Agatha..."

648
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:57,039
"This is Magnus."

649
01:23:57,217 --> 01:24:02,509
"Give my little Bumblebee...

650
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:09,051
...her house and her money."

651
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:14,225
"Then get out of town.
If you don't, I will get you."

652
01:24:14,402 --> 01:24:18,566
"I will get you like you got me."

653
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:22,192
"That is a promise."

654
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:42,326
Please don't throw him.

655
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,601
Lavender!

656
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:10,368
It's the Trunch!

657
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:17,675
Look at this!

658
01:27:20,805 --> 01:27:24,222
Let go.

659
01:27:28,563 --> 01:27:32,228
- I didn't know I could do that.
- Pretty good.

660
01:28:18,532 --> 01:28:24,155
<i>Trunchbull was gone,
never to be seen or heard from. -</i>

661
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:26,184
<i>- never to darken a doorway again.</i>

662
01:28:26,185 --> 01:28:28,038
<i>- Never to darken a doorway again.</i>

663
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:34,793
<i>Miss Honey moved back to her house,
and Matilda was a frequent visitor.</i>

664
01:28:34,966 --> 01:28:39,295
Did you know the heart of a mouse
beats 650 times a minute?

665
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,590
- Where did you learn that?
- In a book.

666
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:46,431
It beats so fast.
It sounds like it's humming.

667
01:28:52,776 --> 01:28:55,149
Hey, you!

668
01:28:55,321 --> 01:28:58,487
We're leaving. Let's go.

669
01:28:58,657 --> 01:29:03,236
- Let's wrap these up.
- I'd be happy to walk her home.

670
01:29:03,412 --> 01:29:08,751
- We're moving to Guam.
- Guam?

671
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:12,703
- Daddy's out of business.
- I don't want to!

672
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:17,838
- We're taking a permanent vacation!
- We have to hurry to the airport.

673
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:22,839
I love it here!
Please don't let them take me.

674
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:27,477
- Get in the car. Melinda!
- Matilda! I want to stay here!

675
01:29:27,646 --> 01:29:31,181
Why would she want
a disobedient kid?

676
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:34,809
She's wonderful and I love her.

677
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:41,072
- Adopt me, Miss Honey!
- I don't have time for this.

678
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:45,242
- I have the adoption papers.
- What?

679
01:29:45,415 --> 01:29:50,124
- Where did you get those?
- From a book in the library.

680
01:29:50,294 --> 01:29:53,710
Are you hearing this, Harry?

681
01:29:53,881 --> 01:29:58,129
- You just have to sign.
- I'll be an only child again!

682
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:01,221
I can't think with all these sirens!

683
01:30:02,891 --> 01:30:05,809
What do you think, pumpkin?

684
01:30:07,438 --> 01:30:14,603
You're the only daughter I ever had.
And I never understood you.

685
01:30:17,364 --> 01:30:20,983
Who's got a pen?

686
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:25,110
- Here.
- Thanks.

687
01:30:26,207 --> 01:30:33,954
<i>This was perhaps the first decent
thing they ever did for Matilda.</i>

688
01:30:34,132 --> 01:30:37,750
And here.

689
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:43,964
Come here. Turn around.

690
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:52,389
- You won't want support payments?
- No. We have everything we need.

691
01:30:52,568 --> 01:30:56,233
Let's roll.

692
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:14,125
<i>So Harry and Zinnia got away.
And as bad as things were, -</i>

693
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:18,428
<i>- that's how good they became.</i>

694
01:31:20,222 --> 01:31:26,806
<i>Miss Honey was made
principal of the school.</i>

695
01:31:26,979 --> 01:31:32,733
<i>And Matilda found, to her surprise,
that life could be fun.</i>

696
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:36,520
<i>She decided to have
as much fun as possible.</i>

697
01:31:36,698 --> 01:31:40,529
<i>After all, she was a very smart kid.</i>

698
01:31:55,092 --> 01:32:02,222
<i>Matilda and Miss Honey each got
what they had always wanted:</i>

699
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:06,223
<i>A loving family.</i>

700
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:11,188
<i>And Matilda never had to use
her powers again.</i>

701
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,775
<i>Well. I mean almost never.</i>

702
01:32:24,164 --> 01:32:26,833
"Call me Ishmael."

703
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:33,132
"Some years ago,
never mind how long, precisely..."
