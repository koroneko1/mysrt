1
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:23,842
You know.

2
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:26,079
I think this world is so small.

3
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:29,680
Prince’s boyfriend is the older brother of Kluen’s boyfriend.

4
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,792
And Kluen’s boyfriend is the little brother of Prince’s boyfriend.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,537
So the one you always talked about when we studied together was Daonuea?

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,531
The one and only in my life.

7
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:42,833
What about you?

8
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,898
When did you guys like each other?

9
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,670
At first,

10
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,283
I even despised him.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,510
But after a while,

12
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:55,839
my feelings just changed.

13
00:00:57,453 --> 00:01:01,525
I think your stories are exactly like novels.

14
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,506
Two stories in the same universe.

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,831
I gotta go.

16
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,733
Fah is here to pick me up.

17
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,648
Yeah.

18
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:19,970
I have to pick Daonuea up too.

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,716
Should we go?

20
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:22,158
Hold on.

21
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,666
What about me?

22
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:26,463
Me?

23
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,320
Go back to your place.

24
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:30,590
Go back?

25
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:33,242
What?

26
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,119
And who’s paying?

27
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,311
Guys, who’s paying?

28
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:39,218
We’ve arrived, Prince.

29
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:41,524
This isn’t my place.

30
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,000
This is a lesson.

31
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,802
You get in a car and fall asleep, always.

32
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,560
What if someone kidnaps and traffics you?

33
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,922
Like what you’re doing now?

34
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,720
I will never sell you.

35
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:00,301
I will keep you all to myself.

36
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,672
No one can have you.

37
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:08,300
Why did you take me to your place?

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,346
Well.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,655
Daonuea is spending the night at Kluen’s.

40
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,640
And I feel lonely.

41
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,298
So I took my boyfriend here to sleep with me.

42
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,187
But...

43
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:22,350
I don’t have pajamas.

44
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,447
You can wear Daonuea’s.

45
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,922
I don’t have my bolster.

46
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,467
You like to hug a pillow while sleeping?

47
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:31,355
You usually hug me.

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,851
What are you saying?

49
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,207
Did you…

50
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:40,760
ask your boyfriend if he wanted to spend the night with you?

51
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:43,996
Of course, he does.

52
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:47,084
Sleep here with me, please.

53
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,768
Please. Please.

54
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,424
Please.

55
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,029
Alright.

56
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:56,388
Fine.

57
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,680
Just to keep you company.

58
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,669
You really think that’s it?

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,607
You should sit down.

60
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,854
Or you can go straight to the shower first.

61
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,934
You look tired today.

62
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:37,320
Oh, Fah asked if you wanted to come over for a meal the day after tomorrow.

63
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,097
Prince is coming too.

64
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,771
Wanna come?

65
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,016
What’s wrong?

66
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,083
Just want to be clingy.

67
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,115
Should we go to Hua Hin this weekend?

68
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,212
So you can take a break.

69
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:11,843
You want me to take a break or you just want to go to the beach?

70
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:14,927
Let’s go.

71
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,650
Go to my beach.

72
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,659
Ask Fah and Prince to come along.

73
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,137
Your beach?

74
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,347
You said it yourself.

75
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,341
Is this the place you asked me to come along?

76
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,114
Does it mean this beach belongs to your family?

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,890
Yeah.

78
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,172
It belongs to you too.

79
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:43,245
Hello,

80
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:44,515
Fah.

81
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:45,532
I’ve arrived.

82
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,827
So you heard me, didn’t you?

83
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:52,868
Um.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,970
Um.

85
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,834
Why did you pretend not to hear?

86
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:01,923
I was a little blushing.

87
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,133
You, wicked.

88
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:09,526
I will take you there.

89
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,544
To the real beach of yours.

90
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,315
What do you mean?

91
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:17,643
It’s a secret.

92
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,865
You’ll see.

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,006
Without you by my side,

94
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:28,956
I’ll be so dishearted.

95
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,205
Hang in there.

96
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:35,000
You’ll be graduating in a few years.

97
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:37,216
You’ll be a dentist soon.

98
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:44,372
You remember when I said The North Star always stays at the same spot?

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,202
It always stays with you, Kluen.

100
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,561
Do you get that?

101
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:54,859
Can you not get any lovelier than this?

102
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,903
I’m a lovely person.

103
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:01,950
I can’t quit being lovely, can I?

104
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:04,692
Don’t quit then.

105
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,740
Continue being lovely.

106
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,751
And I’ll continue loving you.

107
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:10,974
Love you with all my heart.

108
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,424
Kluen.

109
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,174
I’m not even afraid.

110
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,530
You’re challenging me.

111
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,720
You should be afraid.

112
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,165
Go take a shower.

113
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,586
Shower. Shower.

114
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,171
Fine.

115
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,145
You get away this time.

116
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,411
Here.

117
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,873
[Don’t forget to eat. I prepared them for you. - Dao]

118
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:23,123
Daonuea is so cute.

119
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,904
How was your class?

120
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:31,701
Tired?

121
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:34,999
Not as tired as you.

122
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:36,904
So…

123
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:39,999
How was today at the hospital?

124
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:44,212
If you’re asking about the patients,

125
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:46,675
they’re fine.

126
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:50,112
But if you’re asking about the doctor,

127
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:52,292
he suffered so much

128
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:55,947
because he was thinking about his boyfriend all the time.

129
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,218
We’ve been together for so long.

130
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,809
When are you going to stop hitting on me, sir?

131
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,950
Well, I think…

132
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,846
I’m just gonna keep hitting on you like this.

133
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,539
I like it when you blush.

134
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,442
Cute.

135
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,572
Blush, my foot.

136
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:21,348
By the way,

137
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,243
Daonuea...

138
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:24,764
...is going to Hua Hin.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,248
He asked if you wanted to come.

140
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:28,253
Interested? Will you be free?

141
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,870
Ask yourself if you will.

142
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,051
I can be.

143
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,588
If you say yes, I’ll clear my schedule for you.

144
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:37,897
So we can go together.

145
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,223
Go take a shower.

146
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,667
I’ll bring you Dao’s clothes.

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,872
Hey.

148
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:07,712
I changed my mind.

149
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,760
I don’t just want your company in bed.

150
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,560
I want my boyfriend in bed.

151
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,570
Got it?

152
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,356
In this world,

153
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:30,124
if not you, no one will be able to put up with Fah.

154
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:33,488
For someone like Khabkluen, no one will get him either.

155
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,747
You have a point.

156
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,742
He’s so tight-lipped.

157
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:11,795
Hi, Prince.

158
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:13,990
Here. Let me help.

159
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,872
We arrived at the same time.

160
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:20,298
It’s your favorite, right?

161
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:21,345
Right.

162
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:22,461
Fried chicken.

163
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,450
By the way, did Fah tell you about the Hua Hin trip?

164
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,964
He did.

165
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:30,440
Coming?

166
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,231
Sure.

167
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,055
Yeah!

168
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:33,555
Let’s go.

169
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,001
Fah hasn’t come yet?

170
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,186
He’ll be here soon.

171
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,763
Don’t make that face.

172
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,015
Smile for me.

173
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,030
Fah is always like this.

174
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,004
He said it was an urgent case.

175
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,944
Please don’t be mad at him, Daonuea.

176
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:14,681
In this world,

177
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:18,508
if not you, no one will be able to put up with Fah.

178
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,150
For someone like Khabkluen,

179
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:25,811
if not you, no one will get him either.

180
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:27,680
Didn’t see that coming.

181
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,487
You have a point.

182
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:33,617
It’s so hard to know what’s on his mind.

183
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,288
He’s so tight-lipped.

184
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,121
So close-mouthed.

185
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,551
What are you doing, Kluen?

186
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,700
Prince is right here.

187
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:43,219
So?

188
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,527
I wanted you to prove if my lips were really tight.

189
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:48,461
I used to be like that.

190
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:52,866
But now I can say I love you every day.

191
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,472
I love Daonuea.

192
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:57,215
I love Daonuea so much.

193
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:58,140
Prince.

194
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,169
I love Daonuea.

195
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:02,573
Did you hear that?

196
00:13:09,937 --> 00:13:11,034
Hey.

197
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,727
Sorry, I’m late.

198
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:16,768
Urgent medical case.

199
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,215
There weren’t enough doctors so I--

200
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,955
Abracadabra. I wish for your tiredness to disappear.

201
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:32,782
I was so worried you’d get mad.

202
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,443
It’s your job. How can I be mad?

203
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:38,916
Besides,

204
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:40,531
I’m a grownup.

205
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:44,268
But I’m mad.

206
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:46,559
Kluen.

207
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,245
I think…

208
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:50,977
we should eat.

209
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:04,117
Fah.

210
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,312
You don't tell me things now.

211
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:09,863
You only told Prince you’d be late.

212
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,220
I guess I’m not on your priority list anymore.

213
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,774
It’s not that, Dao.

214
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:14,521
Well…

215
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:24,989
But you left me and spent the night at Kluen’s for a week.

216
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:27,342
You left me alone here.

217
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,610
Should I be mad at you?

218
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,713
No. You can’t get mad at me.

219
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,717
Then you can’t get mad at me either.

220
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:35,977
Be fair.

221
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:42,388
Ah. Let’s eat, guys.

222
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,222
Let me feed you.

223
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,917
Yum.

224
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:54,876
Is it good?

225
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,699
This is your favorite, isn’t it?

226
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:10,979
Dao.

227
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,209
Are my clothes still in your room?

228
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,591
Yes.

229
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:18,503
If so,

230
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,558
can I spend the night?

231
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:21,567
No.

232
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,041
Don’t you even think I have no clue.

233
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:27,371
I know when I was on the mountain,

234
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,878
you made my brother sleep at your place.

235
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,059
You should keep your distance sometimes.

236
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,051
Fah.

237
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,439
Hey.

238
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,898
Daonuea and Khabkluen have been together for so long.

239
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,747
Don’t be overprotective.

240
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,285
I don’t know.

241
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:48,615
I just despise him.

242
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,659
Come on.

243
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,395
Be reasonable.

244
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:55,814
If you don’t let Kluen crash here,

245
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:58,617
I will…

246
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,367
You will what?

247
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,691
I’ll make Prince sleep in my room tonight.

248
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:05,768
Are you crazy? No way.

249
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,082
Why not?

250
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,169
I’m scared of ghosts. I don’t want to sleep alone.

251
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,277
Dao,

252
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,779
you’ve been sleeping by yourself since young.

253
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,980
Why scared now?

254
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:18,289
I didn’t have Kluen in my life then.

255
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,449
And don’t you want to hug Prince to sleep tonight?

256
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,568
Fine.

257
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:31,930
Everyone sleeps wherever they want.

258
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,359
Eat and go separate ways.

259
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,505
Hey!

260
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,310
You don’t dry your hair again.

261
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:16,840
You can get sick.

262
00:17:19,056 --> 00:17:21,056
Because I knew you’d do it for me.

263
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,711
Am I spoiling you here?

264
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,053
If you keep doing this for me,

265
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,253
I’m willing to be a spoiled brat for the rest of my life.

266
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:39,803
I just love this one so much.

267
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:43,889
Don’t have to say that often.

268
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:45,933
I’m afraid you’ll get tired of it.

269
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,257
It’s not gonna happen.

270
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,216
Got it?

271
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:58,229
Kluen, stop.

272
00:17:58,229 --> 00:17:59,213
Don’t do this.

273
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,360
Then I’ll just continue studying.

274
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:08,889
Study again?

275
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,393
You should take a break.

276
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:18,437
All right.

277
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,186
That’s it for today then.

278
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:37,951
Kluen!

279
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,062
Kluen, don't play like this.

280
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,254
You said you would take a break.

281
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:43,626
I’m taking a break.

282
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,279
Not like this.

283
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,329
This kind of break keeps my tiredness away.

284
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,657
Kluen.

285
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:56,820
What?

286
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,717
No.

287
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,244
I miss the mountain vibes.

288
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:27,563
I miss the children.

289
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:29,248
You?

290
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,317
No.

291
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:38,453
Well.

292
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,931
What I miss the most about the mountain

293
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,165
is right here.

294
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,721
I still remember the first day we met.

295
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:50,306
In front of the school.

296
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:53,986
Actually,

297
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:56,881
we met before that.

298
00:19:59,131 --> 00:19:59,950
I’ve just arrived.

299
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,574
Taking the stairs.

300
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,391
Yeah. Okay.

301
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,796
I’m sorry.

302
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:17,619
Thank you.

303
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:18,609
Sure.

304
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,368
Don’t know if you remember.

305
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:28,571
I do.

306
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,076
But I didn’t realize it was you.

307
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,892
If I’d known I would love you this much,

308
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:46,645
I would’ve hit on you then.

309
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,808
So we would be boyfriends months sooner.

310
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:55,387
My Prince.

311
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,772
Are you blushing?

312
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:01,797
Listen to what you’re saying.

313
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,730
Are you challenging me?

314
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:16,467
I am.

315
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,041
when will you stop picking on Khabkluen?

316
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:48,508
I’m not picking on him.

317
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:52,667
Don’t you dare.

318
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:54,753
Here.

319
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:20,547
Prince.

320
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:23,452
Do you have any problem dating Fah?

321
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:28,129
Fah and I already had all problems on the mountain.

322
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:29,804
We understand each other well now.

323
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:34,406
You know?

324
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:37,301
I missed this version of Fah so much.

325
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:41,356
How come?

326
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:44,593
The one who smiles.

327
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,178
The one who is happy.

328
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,992
Not just Fah who can smile because of me.

329
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,819
I used to think I wouldn’t love anyone again.

330
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:54,854
Until Fah.

331
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,529
Then I should congratulate both of you

332
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:00,921
for having each other in life.

333
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,589
Come on, Prince.

334
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,379
Are you ready?

335
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09,779
Do your best, Daonuea.

336
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,210
Oh!

337
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:20,957
Whoa!

338
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:32,126
Prince, get closer.

339
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:33,755
No!

340
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:47,533
I think only toasts and sausages should do.

341
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:51,675
Here.

342
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:04,113
You made a very good toast.

343
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,364
Crispy and tender.

344
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,442
The color is also nice.

345
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:11,323
The sausage is very well cooked.

346
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,225
Good job.

347
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,608
The sausages, Prince fried them.

348
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:20,721
As for the toasts, Daonuea made them.

349
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:24,117
Oh.

350
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,268
Both of them look great, right?

351
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:29,113
Right.

352
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:32,536
It’s the toast my little brother made.

353
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,649
Of course, it’s great.

354
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:37,629
Let’s just eat.

355
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,062
Then we can head out.

356
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:57,031
It isn’t Kluen’s House.

357
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,796
I told you I’d take you to Dao’s beach.

358
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,653
Dao’s Beach?

359
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,496
What do you mean, Kluen?
[DAO’S BEACH]

360
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:09,017
My family built another resort.

361
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,314
My mom asked me to name it.

362
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:13,977
And I named it Dao’s Beach.

363
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,963
Kluen!

364
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,107
You don’t have to do that for me.

365
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:21,630
Is your mom okay with the name?

366
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:24,117
She loves it.

367
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:27,662
Two resorts named after two of her children.

368
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,620
Thank you, sir.

369
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,812
They are so cute.

370
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:41,894
Hey.

371
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:43,802
What are you doing?

372
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,743
Finding info.

373
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:48,428
On what?

374
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,440
How to buy a mountain.

375
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:52,787
Huh?

376
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,869
Dao, do you want an island?

377
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,818
A couple of islands should be nice.

378
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,589
I’m buying you a mountain.

379
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,595
Are you nuts?

380
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:05,681
A mountain isn’t something you can buy.

381
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,580
You don’t have to do anything for me.

382
00:26:12,057 --> 00:26:14,057
Just stay with me forever.

383
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,949
I love you.

384
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:20,166
I love you too.

385
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:25,401
About the mountain purchase,

386
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,862
don’t you ever tell anyone.

387
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,629
It’s embarrassing.

388
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,417
It’s been so long since my last beach trip.

389
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:00,301
It’s beautiful here.

390
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,270
The weather is nice.

391
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,582
By the way,

392
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,806
when will you stop picking on Khabkluen?

393
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,555
Who is? I’m not picking on him.

394
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:14,934
Come on.

395
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,428
I’m joking.

396
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:25,004
He deserves it.

397
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:29,776
He used to make Dao cry a lot.

398
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,466
Fah and Prince are cute together.

399
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:57,961
I just want to thank Prince a million times for bringing back the old Fah.

400
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,681
I want to thank Prince too.

401
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:03,171
For what?

402
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,886
Because Prince came into Fah’s life,

403
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,821
Fah is now less protective of you.

404
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:16,414
Fah, Prince,

405
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:18,261
get in the water.

406
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:20,760
Hold on.

407
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:24,063
I don’t want to get wet.

408
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:25,781
You don’t?

409
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,104
Fah.

410
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:28,139
Prince.

411
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:29,961
Come on.

412
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:30,467
Quickly.

413
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:36,866
Let’s go.

414
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,232
Hey!

415
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,096
I hadn't been in the water in a long time.

416
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,833
I’m exhausted.

417
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,719
You must admit.

418
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:30,508
Age matters.

419
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,158
Are you saying I’m old?

420
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,701
I’m not.

421
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:45,327
But if I’m old and still get to be clingy around you,

422
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:47,230
it’s okay.

423
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:49,654
You.

424
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:57,629
Dao,

425
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:58,934
you have an inhaler?

426
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,181
Fah left it with me.

427
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:04,605
Look at Fah.

428
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:07,978
He seems younger when he’s with Prince.

429
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:12,119
Prince!

430
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:20,600
Fah,

431
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,358
take the inhaler.

432
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:23,681
It’s refreshing.

433
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:37,094
Hey!

434
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:40,304
Smells nice and refreshing indeed.

435
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,781
Well. Well.

436
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:47,363
You guys are so sweet.

437
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:05,478
We read each other’s minds.

438
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:09,014
We’re at the beach.

439
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:11,132
It’s a must to bring this tee.

440
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:15,180
It’s the cutest tee in the world.

441
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,211
I worked hard to paint it for you.

442
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,186
Say it isn’t cute, and you’ll be punished.

443
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:27,301
The tee is cute.

444
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:31,543
But I think the painter is cuter.

445
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,080
Dao, are you finished?

446
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:42,044
Grilled shrimps will become dried shrimps if you let them wait any longer.

447
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:43,051
Can we go eat now?

448
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:45,567
I’m done. Coming.

449
00:31:56,586 --> 00:31:57,268
Hey.

450
00:31:57,268 --> 00:32:00,047
Should we go out to see the sunrise tomorrow?

451
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:02,235
Wake me up, Kluen.

452
00:32:03,246 --> 00:32:04,469
Roger that, sir.

453
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:07,045
Fah, Prince,

454
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:08,350
come with us.

455
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:09,805
Please.

456
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:12,372
Sure.

457
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,369
Yeah.

458
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,041
Just eat.

459
00:32:17,314 --> 00:32:18,707
Did you just give my brother an order?

460
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:23,121
Hey.

461
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:34,502
I’m sorry.

462
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,319
Come on. Let’s eat.

463
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:45,401
Yum.

464
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,030
Yum. Yum.

465
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,621
Don’t you dare.

466
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,302
Here.

467
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,617
Fah,

468
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:03,775
want some crab?

469
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,274
Yum. Yum.

470
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,223
Give it here.

471
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,443
It eats you in the face.

472
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:14,747
Here.

473
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:25,413
dao

474
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:27,848
After graduation,

475
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:29,599
will you live here with me?

476
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:12,197
What’s with this bracelet that keeps you staring so much?

477
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:15,782
When I bought it,

478
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,429
I didn’t even have the courage to give it to you.

479
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,599
Look now.

480
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,111
It’s so beyond my expectation.

481
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:28,419
Come on.

482
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,337
The bracelet is already beyond your expectation?

483
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,982
What about us being together now?

484
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:34,341
Isn’t it something even greater?

485
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:39,052
It’s like a dream.

486
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:41,445
If this was really a dream,

487
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,109
I wouldn’t want to wake up.

488
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:53,762
Why did you pick a sunflower bracelet for me?

489
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:58,507
Because you’re my sunflower.

490
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:03,850
You shine so bright when I look at you.

491
00:35:05,622 --> 00:35:08,383
People stare at you when you smile.

492
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,132
You are so cute.

493
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,527
You know that?

494
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:17,863
Well.

495
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:20,078
I kinda know that.

496
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:23,735
You, little wicked thing!

497
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,021
I don’t want to leave yet.

498
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:53,376
Then…

499
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,072
After graduation,

500
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:00,304
will you live here with me?

501
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:05,773
You know

502
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:12,538
waking up to see the beach is my dream?

503
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,333
But

504
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:19,954
it’s okay.

505
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:24,634
Just take me here often. It’s enough to make me happy.

506
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:37,501
Dao.

507
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,539
I never had a dream.

508
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:47,837
But now I do.

509
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:51,964
What?

510
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,062
My dream

511
00:36:58,102 --> 00:36:59,874
is to see you every morning.

512
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:04,242
To see your smile every day.

513
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:13,916
So living here isn’t a big deal at all

514
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,598
if it’s your happiness.

515
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:37,722
You see over there?

516
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:45,531
It’s where you can see the best view of the sea.

517
00:37:48,452 --> 00:37:50,452
You’ll see the sunrise every morning.

518
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:57,837
So I’m thinking of building a house there.

519
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:06,764
Build a painting studio where there’s every shade of watercolor for you.

520
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:11,288
There will be a small sunflower garden.

521
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,043
Right there.

522
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:21,393
There might be a living corner with a big tree.

523
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,730
When you want to paint outside,

524
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,728
you can do it under that tree.

525
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,483
So it won’t be too hot for you.

526
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:43,849
Thank you.

527
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:47,945
Thank you for doing so much for me.

528
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:53,465
Thank you for always loving me.

529
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,554
And thank you for not giving up on loving me.

530
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,563
Dao.

531
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:21,965
I told you before.

532
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,900
No matter what happens,

533
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,515
it’s your call.

534
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:41,758
Kluen.

535
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,041
I don’t get to visit beaches very often.

536
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,384
Now that I’m here,

537
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:05,887
it feels so special.

538
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,718
Then I will take you here again and again.

539
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,377
Only when you’re free is okay.

540
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:22,906
Prince,

541
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:27,356
I’m thinking of making a new plan.

542
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,614
I will keep you separate from work.

543
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:37,340
I promise I will make it work.

544
00:40:37,594 --> 00:40:38,477
But

545
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:40,945
I might need some time.

546
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,611
It’s totally okay.

547
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:53,149
I’m never mad about these little things.

548
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,514
I want you to rest

549
00:40:58,177 --> 00:40:59,742
because I really am worried about you.

550
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:04,229
Thank you.

551
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:16,946
Between the mountain and the beach like this,

552
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:20,411
which one do you prefer?

553
00:41:21,448 --> 00:41:22,546
Actually,

554
00:41:23,586 --> 00:41:25,173
I like every place.

555
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,728
Whether it’s the beach or the mountain.

556
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:34,153
It can be anywhere as long as I have you.

557
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:43,850
Well then.

558
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:53,197
Should our wedding be held on the beach?

559
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,762
We will only invite those whom we’re close to.

560
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:09,306
Invite people on the mountain down here.

561
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,480
But if they can’t make it,

562
00:42:15,196 --> 00:42:18,489
we can get married again on the mountain.

563
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:26,042
Fah.

564
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:32,837
Will you marry me?

565
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:47,651
Yes.

566
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,846
I will.

567
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,281
I love you.

568
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:41,948
I love it when the four of us are together.

569
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,250
I’m so happy.

570
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,020
Right now

571
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:48,955
I’m happy too

572
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,722
because everyone I love is here with me.

573
00:44:59,983 --> 00:45:00,653
Prince,

574
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,490
please take care of Fah.

575
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,417
With pleasure.

576
00:45:12,513 --> 00:45:13,403
Kluen.

577
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:18,089
Thank you so much

578
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,143
for loving my brother almost as much as I do.

579
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,121
I love Dao more than you see.

580
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,240
Don’t be sulky, my Kuafah.

581
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:49,835
You’ll pay for that later.

582
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:57,684
From now on every beach trip I have

583
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,538
will remind me so much of this moment.

584
00:46:02,488 --> 00:46:03,651
After this,

585
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:07,357
it won't be only Daonuea who loves the beach.

586
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:11,577
It will be a special place for us all.

587
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,433
Look.

588
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:16,642
It’s beautiful.

589
00:46:17,114 --> 00:46:18,100
Isn’t it?

590
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:21,814
How about we take a look closer?

591
00:46:21,814 --> 00:46:23,089
Again, Kluen?

592
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:23,971
Seriously?

593
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,114
What?

594
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:29,956
Come on.

595
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,469
Come on.

596
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,042
When an eclipse is near,

597
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:51,170
a curse falls on Suppalo students who violate the rules.

598
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,556
I know you’ve come to mess with my school.

599
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:57,001
You’ve been following me everywhere.

600
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:58,881
Are you into me, student prefect?

601
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,821
Ever since you joined, this school has been full of chaos.
