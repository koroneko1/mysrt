1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:04,541
BACK IN THE '90S, THAILAND WAS DEVELOPING

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:08,458
BUT GANG FIGHTS BETWEEN INSTITUTES
WERE ALSO RISING FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,375
THESE FIGHTS WERE ROOTED IN
FALSE BELIEFS AND TOXIC CULTURES,

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:16,708
TOGETHER WITH THE CHAOTIC TEENAGE YEARS
IN WHICH ANGER RUNS AMOK.

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:20,375
THE 4 INSTITUTES NOTORIOUSLY KNOWN FOR
GANG FIGHTS WERE IN, CHOL, KANOK AND BU.

6
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,083
INTRA ALUMNI

7
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,833
You don’t have to go, Dad.

8
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,666
Why wouldn't I?

9
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,750
It’s Father’s Day.

10
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,458
You look like hell.

11
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,458
-Amm.
-Damn stink of alcohol.

12
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,041
You came home at dawn.

13
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,083
It’s the Father’s Day ceremony at school,

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,000
not Alcohol Day.

15
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,375
Amm.

16
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,375
Why?

17
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,708
What are you going to say now?

18
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,541
You are always like this, year after year.

19
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,875
Your pants have
sweat stains all over them.

20
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,625
And look at your shoes.

21
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,291
You’d wear that junk to my school?

22
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm ashamed.

23
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,083
Amm.

24
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,833
Amm.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,291
MR. PUTTIPONG

26
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,041
Yes, Mr. Puttipong.

27
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,666
Billy, the concrete beam
is not settling yet.

28
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,791
It can’t be,
the guys just finished it at 4 a.m.

29
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,583
Where are you?
Aren't you at the construction site?

30
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,375
Oh, damn!

31
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,583
Out of my way, damn it!

32
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,375
Come on.

33
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,958
Come on in. Come on.

34
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:19,875
I said get out of my way.

35
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,750
They are fighting out there.
Where would I go?

36
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,500
I’m going to help my daughter.

37
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,958
Come on. Come.

38
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,750
Come on in. Come on.

39
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,750
-Run!
-Go!

40
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,333
Jerk! Get off!

41
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,750
Amm!

42
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,458
Amm!

43
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,916
Amm.

44
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,375
Amm.

45
00:03:58,958 --> 00:03:59,791
Amm.

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,416
Amm.

47
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,125
Please help!

48
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,250
Please help my daughter!

49
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,750
Ambulance!

50
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,958
Someone call an ambulance!

51
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,708
Hello.

52
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,375
I’m Suwicha, Inthira's teacher.

53
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,750
Remember me?

54
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,333
Mr. Pranott.

55
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,708
I sent the blueprint
for project four last night.

56
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,375
Yes, sir. I owe you this time.

57
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,375
Thank you.

58
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:35,208
Amm, do I have to
prepare for the parents’ meeting?

59
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:40,250
Students got into a gang fight again.

60
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:44,708
They are from two
different vocational schools this time

61
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,708
and it was right in the middle
of Samut Sakhon

62
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,916
with swords and homemade
hand grenades involved.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's a report that a soldier…

64
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,416
Teens these days…

65
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,958
What’s wrong with them?

66
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:03,208
They were charging at
each other with long swords.

67
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,083
Like you’ve never done that.

68
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,125
The jurisdiction of
Krathum Baen police station.

69
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,750
A soldier who was driving by…

70
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
Back then it was not like this.

71
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,000
It was not like this?

72
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,083
What was it like then?

73
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,791
Like real men?

74
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,541
I've never seen any
technical student act like a real man.

75
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
-Amm…
-You're telling me not to generalize.

76
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,333
The fact that I’m crippled,

77
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,500
isn’t it because of
technical students like you?

78
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:16,125
1995

79
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,666
Hey, pay up.

80
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,083
I'm getting off.

81
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:54,416
Schmuck,
does your tuition fee cover all bus fares?

82
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,875
You never pay your stuff, twat.

83
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,333
Oh, oh?

84
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,333
Mister,

85
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,583
other than caffeine,

86
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,583
only a good beating up gets me vibing.

87
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,625
What a jerk.

88
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,875
I had a look at you
While you were sleeping

89
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,875
You seemed so innocent

90
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,125
Hey, Lupin.

91
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,083
Why are you so into singing?

92
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,166
Quit school and get a record deal already.

93
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,458
Oh damn! It’s not
that I love singing, Billy.

94
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,791
I just love music,

95
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,458
so I keep rehearsing.

96
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,291
Stone Metal Fire have
a concert at the end of the year.

97
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,083
I’m telling you, I’m going to shine.

98
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,083
Just watch me, you’ll be so high.

99
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,916
Yes, Lupin. I believe you.

100
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,625
You always had potential.

101
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,625
Only Jae Danupol is cooler than you.

102
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,958
The gig is at the end of the year,
why the rush?

103
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,916
Come on, Billy.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,375
You can’t spell the word "target"?

105
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,708
Targets are for attacks.

106
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,208
And I'm planning a big attack there.

107
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,625
Hey! CHOLs alert!

108
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,916
Old man, stop!

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,458
INs!

110
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,458
CHOLs!

111
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,083
CHOLs? We're INs!

112
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,791
Idiot, do one!

113
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,000
Let my friend show off!

114
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Billy!

115
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,250
Get your medicine at the counter.

116
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,500
You are invincible.
Where did you get the tattoo?

117
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,541
Invincible your ass.

118
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,541
Got 18 stitches on my back.

119
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,166
Billy.

120
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,958
Sorry…

121
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,500
that I was too late.

122
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,708
No. Why sorry?

123
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,916
If it hadn't been for you,
Mod would have chopped me up.

124
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,125
You think too much.

125
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,291
Dad, hello…

126
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,916
You only bring me trouble.

127
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,958
Your brain

128
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,791
ever come up with something good?

129
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,916
See you.

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,375
Are you leaving?

131
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,291
See you tomorrow.

132
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,833
You can’t be mad at me, Au.

133
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,166
I’m here on time.

134
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,708
Da,

135
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,083
I've missed my period for two months now.

136
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,916
You serious?

137
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,500
Are you joking with me?

138
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,916
No, seriously.

139
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,125
I'm not messing with you about this.

140
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,500
It's not a joke, Da.

141
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,875
Don’t think too much.

142
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,583
Whatever happens, happens.

143
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,916
What about my parents?

144
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't have to worry.

145
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,083
I’ll figure it out somehow.

146
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,041
I am responsible for this.

147
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But it is a serious matter, Da.

148
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,916
It is serious to me as well.

149
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,583
Da, let’s get a taxi.

150
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,083
The Buranapons are all over the station.

151
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,416
If you have a girl around,
they don't do it.

152
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,500
It would be despicable if they did.

153
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey.

154
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,333
Walking with your head high.

155
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,500
Do you think you are Andy Lau?

156
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,375
Pickup, go home, get laid.

157
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,833
Don’t you have it all too easy?

158
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,791
You can have it easy.

159
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,625
But if you want it difficult,

160
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,666
you might get a bit sweaty.

161
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,041
It’s kind of hot around here.

162
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,375
Want a drink?

163
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:48,791
Okay.

164
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,000
Enough, you idiot. I’ll choke.

165
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,791
You come with a girl, drink up.

166
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,041
Whenever you come alone,

167
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,500
I’ll beat the crap out of you.

168
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,833
Hey.

169
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,666
Make way for Andy Lau.

170
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,708
Give me a cigarette.

171
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,041
Let’s eat.

172
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,625
Thanks, Mom.

173
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,041
-Mom
-Yes.

174
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,000
Billy will stay with us for a while.

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,875
Sure, make yourself at home.

176
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,750
But… are you on a run?

177
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,333
No, I’m not.

178
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
I have a problem with my stepdad.

179
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,000
I’m kidding.

180
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,833
Da told me everything.

181
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:28,833
Just relax, son.

182
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,416
Thank you.

183
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,166
-Da.
-Yes, Mom.

184
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,541
Why don’t you invite Au for dinner?

185
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,083
You know her dad is very strict.

186
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,458
She can’t stay out late.

187
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,791
A policeman’s daughter.

188
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,916
And you, make sure you use protection.

189
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,458
Respect her dignity.

190
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,375
Protect what?

191
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,500
Well, you know.

192
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,708
Au and I are not like that.

193
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,958
Come on, just do as I say.

194
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,541
Yes, Mom.

195
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,041
Let me answer the phone.

196
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,166
Mischievous, isn’t he?

197
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
You seem to be very close to him.

198
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,583
Yeah.

199
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,750
It’d be nice if you were my family.

200
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,916
All families are different.

201
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,583
It’s like this here.

202
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,125
Many are not.

203
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,333
You are a man now.

204
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,875
Stay with the present.
Look toward the future.

205
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,541
Forget the past.

206
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,125
-Very wise.
-Right.

207
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,291
TO INTRA WITH CONDOLENCES FROM CHOL

208
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,250
Are you sure, X?

209
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,250
Yeah, they usually hang around here.

210
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,375
What a smelly alley.

211
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,791
Are you sure Da is here?

212
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,916
Not sure.

213
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,541
But if he turns up,

214
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,583
it'll be this mofo's last day.

215
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,000
Turn off the engine.

216
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,958
Whoa. Those CHOLs.

217
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,208
What are they doing here?

218
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,541
Surely they are looking for trouble.

219
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,625
What the hell are you doing?

220
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,250
I’ve always wanted to face them.

221
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,208
Now I have a chance,

222
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,833
I'll welcome them with my number 12.

223
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,666
Forget the drugs, I'd rather hit them.

224
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,125
When I shoot them, you take off. Okay?

225
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,041
My name is goddamn Yad!

226
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:05,750
Let's go!

227
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,250
My friend? My friend?

228
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,333
Where are you going, coward?

229
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,916
Who sent you here? Scumbag!

230
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,125
Damn, Mod.

231
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,750
Enough, Mod!

232
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,208
He’s going to die.

233
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,166
Stop!

234
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,500
Go!

235
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,208
Do one, scumbag!

236
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,166
Go!

237
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,166
Like a drama that you have to act

238
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,916
It’s because of some kind of force

239
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The force of love, lust, so powerful

240
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,416
That commands you to do anything

241
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,791
Enough with your force of love!

242
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,500
Idiot freeloaders!

243
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,208
What a waste of my stuff!

244
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,208
Aunty, music is drug prevention.

245
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,875
Right, Lupin.

246
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,583
Like this alcohol
you are drinking is not addictive?

247
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,791
What would you know? It’s medicinal.

248
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,000
Doc told me it's good for circulation.

249
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,000
Why did you sell it to me then?

250
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,708
For you it’s like charity.

251
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,833
My shop will be shut down because of you.

252
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,125
Damn!

253
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,291
Jeez.

254
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,916
Honorable freeloader,
have you heard of it?

255
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,083
So fierce.

256
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,333
For the SMF gig this year,

257
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:27,541
I have my new Converse to attract chicks.

258
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,958
They’re going to be thrilled.

259
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,250
Where did you get the money?

260
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,458
He snatched some
Scholls from the mall yesterday.

261
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,916
Got five pairs.

262
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,208
What did you do with five pairs?

263
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,291
Hey,

264
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,291
Billy.

265
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,458
Look at those…

266
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,708
Scholl.

267
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,750
Mint condition.

268
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,750
Just watch me.

269
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,458
Gotcha. Gotcha.

270
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,875
Kiddo.

271
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,750
Hey, kid!

272
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:19,750
Hey, kid.

273
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,125
Kiddo!

274
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,041
Oh!

275
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,541
Pretending to ignore me?

276
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,541
I guess I can’t play nice.

277
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,708
Seems like you need Arahan palms.

278
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,791
Kid, you have nice shoes.

279
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,166
Can I have them?

280
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,583
Come on! Take them off!

281
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,250
Damn.

282
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:56,000
Very good. I love obedient young men.

283
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,000
Let’s go.

284
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,125
Bro.

285
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,625
How are they?

286
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:03,583
Brother.

287
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,750
They smell right.

288
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,791
Yeah.

289
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,625
-I mean you, jackass.
-What?

290
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,916
Can I have 40 baht for more games?

291
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,916
You wasted my time,
I thought you’d be tough.

292
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,458
So you bought them, Mr. Customer.

293
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,000
Damn.

294
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,458
But I didn’t have to
go to the shop, right?

295
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,458
Oh, damn.

296
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,208
Who is coming to
the SMF concert this year?

297
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,625
School girls maybe? Damn!

298
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,041
Billy, what are you talking about?

299
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,291
We are the flashiest.

300
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,125
Listen to me carefully.

301
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,791
There must be Lupin with INs.

302
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,041
"Lupin." Do you get it?

303
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,250
Billy.

304
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,041
I think the CHOLs
and KANOKs will be there.

305
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,416
Let them bind together,

306
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,958
I’ll take care of that.

307
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,000
Damn.

308
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,458
Also KANOKs and PAYUs.

309
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,458
Those scumbags are violent.

310
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,958
Are you scared, you dork?

311
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,250
Let those losers come,

312
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,333
I’ll slap their heads one by one.

313
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,625
Mr. Customer,

314
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,166
what did you call Billy again?

315
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,166
A dork.

316
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,416
Loudmouth.

317
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,875
Schmuck. Dork.

318
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,041
Hell.

319
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,000
It's for you, bro.

320
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,458
I’ve got a Flirt Card.

321
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:45,625
How’s that?

322
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,875
"Can I have your number?"

323
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,875
Jealous, huh?

324
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,875
With my looks,
girls can't help falling for me.

325
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:57,833
Is she pretty?

326
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:00,375
Of course, I wouldn’t do it if she wasn’t.

327
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,583
Guide me to that girl.

328
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:03,583
Sure.

329
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:04,791
-Let’s go.
-Follow me.

330
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,833
Excuse me, guys.

331
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,625
You can compete in a boat race,

332
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,833
but you can’t compete in luck.

333
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,958
I gotta go for now.

334
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:15,916
Come on, dork.

335
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,208
-Such a bully.
-Hurry.

336
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,916
-So full of crap.
-Crap talker.

337
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,583
Where is she, huh?

338
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,125
It's the end of the line for you here.

339
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,750
Go. Go home.

340
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,708
I’m Lupin of INTRA.

341
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,166
What do you want me to do?

342
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:05,291
You'll get your ass kicked,
son of a bitch!

343
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,583
Scumbag!

344
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,083
Schmuck!

345
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,458
Schmuck!

346
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,166
I said stop.

347
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,416
Don’t run, damn it.

348
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,708
Don’t you get it? I said stop.

349
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,750
Where are you running to?

350
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,750
Heck!

351
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,500
Hey, KANOKs!

352
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:18,750
Billy, get down!

353
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,666
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,250
Go!

355
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,250
Billy, you get hit?

356
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,166
I'm okay.

357
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,458
Lupin?

358
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,666
Holy hell! Lupin!

359
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:39,916
Scumbag!

360
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:45,750
Lupin!

361
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:09,916
Dad.

362
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,916
Can I have some money?

363
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,083
We're going school camping
in Kanchanaburi.

364
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,500
Sure, are you staying overnight?

365
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,250
How many days, so I know how much?

366
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,458
Four days.

367
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:30,583
I’ll prepare you some coats.

368
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,625
It might be cold there.

369
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,416
Take my camera.

370
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,125
You can take some pictures
with your friends.

371
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,083
Alright.

372
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,250
You should go longer.

373
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,000
Not as tough as your tongue.

374
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,000
Can you please calm down?

375
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,375
He might have thought it through.

376
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,333
You'd better shut up.

377
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:03,250
There is no point being nice to him.

378
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,250
I put your stuff in the dog cage.

379
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,958
If you want to come back,

380
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,416
stay in the dog cage!

381
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,958
Isn't that too harsh?

382
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,333
To discipline him.

383
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,291
He got his dad’s vile blood.

384
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:18,875
Don’t talk crap about my dad!

385
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,375
-Billy!
-What are you gonna do?

386
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,833
It’s my house. What are you gonna do?

387
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:22,958
You think you are tough?

388
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,375
I beg you, please.

389
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:29,208
Why? Can’t I discipline your ex's son?

390
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,583
You!

391
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,208
-Enough, Dad. Dad!
-Billy!

392
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,708
Get your stuff out of my house.

393
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,083
Don’t ever come back!

394
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,250
Get out!

395
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:58,208
Billy, I’m sorry.

396
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,041
You don’t need to apologize.

397
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,541
It’s my fault that I'm your son.

398
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,625
Just stay away for a while.

399
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,500
Billy!

400
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,583
You took Au home today?

401
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,875
Yes, Mom.

402
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,583
Do her parents know about you?

403
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:08,208
They do, but…

404
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,500
they don’t really like me.

405
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,125
Especially her dad.

406
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,416
Are you serious about her?

407
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,916
Of course I am.

408
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,333
Like really serious?

409
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,833
Then prove yourself.

410
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,166
Yes, Mom.

411
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,333
Da.

412
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,083
Is that Billy?

413
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,916
Yes, I’ll go see him.

414
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,125
As soon as you got back?

415
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,625
Forget it. Get inside.

416
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,958
Mom.

417
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,166
-Hello, Mom.
-Hi.

418
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,250
Can I…?

419
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:15,125
Yes, make yourself at home.

420
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,625
Thank you.

421
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,208
Have you eaten?

422
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:21,625
No.

423
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,458
I’ll make you an omelet. Come.

424
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,833
-Billy.
-Huh?

425
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,583
I have something to tell you.

426
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,416
What is it?

427
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,041
Au is pregnant.

428
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,166
Holy crap.

429
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:58,083
What are you going to do?

430
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,916
I’ll take care of them. I’m a real man.

431
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,958
But you are still in school.

432
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,083
You have no job.

433
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,125
But I have my hands and feet.

434
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,500
It’s my child so I’ll take care of it.

435
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,541
Does your mom know?

436
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,750
No.

437
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,125
I’ll find the right time.

438
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,333
How about her family?

439
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,708
Not yet.

440
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,166
That’s a big problem.

441
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:43,041
Don't go, I'm begging you

442
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,416
I'm begging you to stop singing already.

443
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,875
You have been singing all day.

444
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:51,666
Are you going to
the Kai Pang concert, channel 7?

445
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:54,291
Are you, Da, Billy?

446
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,166
Of course.

447
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,500
It’s Pang we are talking about.

448
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,708
Yeah.

449
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,375
How about you, Da?

450
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,625
Don’t tell me you are not going.

451
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,791
If you won’t, I won’t.

452
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:15,083
Can I just go to the SMF concert?

453
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,208
I’ll pass on this one.

454
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,833
Why is that?

455
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,375
Or you don’t like alternative music?

456
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,541
Are you anxious about Au?

457
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:30,916
Yeah.

458
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,166
See, Billy? I knew it.

459
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,708
Did Au break up with you?

460
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,250
I told you, she's stuck-up.

461
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,541
I’m good at reading people.

462
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:42,875
Wait.

463
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:44,375
No break up.

464
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,791
Au is pregnant, idiot.

465
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,083
Huh? Au is pregnant?

466
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,833
Damn.

467
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:56,166
How did it happen?

468
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,083
They stared at each other
and she got pregnant.

469
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,333
What a stupid question, idiot.

470
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,541
That’s not what I meant.

471
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,208
I meant how did you let her get pregnant?

472
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:09,541
I gave you condoms,
why didn’t you use them?

473
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,958
Do her parents know?

474
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,708
Not yet.

475
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,958
Just calm down, don’t overreact.

476
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,541
Read my lips,

477
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,250
don’t dwell on the past

478
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,291
and don’t long for the future

479
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,625
or you’ll lose your present.

480
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,375
That works for me.

481
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,125
So in the present,
you go to the concert with me.

482
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,333
Yes, Lupin.

483
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,791
I hope in the present,

484
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,291
you don’t get kicked out like last time.

485
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:39,750
Snap out of it, man.

486
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,708
To be frank…

487
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,583
I’ll stay through to the end.

488
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:47,875
This is how you snap.

489
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,916
Come on, I really want you to be there.

490
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,833
Hey, don’t stress.

491
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,333
We’ll think about that later.

492
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,208
It’s for the Kai Pang concert,

493
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,708
let’s just go.

494
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:01,875
Fine, I’ll go.

495
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,000
That's my friend.

496
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,958
"Stay through to the end."

497
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,416
How’s that, you idiot?

498
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,416
So you said you would
not get kicked out, Lupin?

499
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,416
Scumbag! Those CHOLs
really got on my nerves,

500
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,208
so I have to give it to them.

501
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,583
I told you I shouldn’t have come.

502
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,958
We're the BUs from Bang Na

503
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:33,791
No one bats an eye
We're the unfortunate tech students

504
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,541
Ministry of Education couldn't care less

505
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:39,750
They say we're punks

506
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,333
Heck! There are a hundred BUs ahead.

507
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:47,041
We're diligently repeating the year

508
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:50,541
Making sure the world knows
We're despicable

509
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:54,208
We're BUs, BUs!

510
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,541
What do we do?

511
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:10,833
Just get on with it.

512
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:23,916
CHOLs!

513
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,541
Damn, so many of them.

514
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,458
Seems like they want to eat my foot.

515
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,750
They want a show, let them come.

516
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,041
We never know.

517
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,250
The BUs might run away.

518
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,750
But leave the CHOLs to me.

519
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,041
Let's have some fun.

520
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,625
Is everybody okay? Get hit?

521
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,791
BANG SUE POLICE STATION

522
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,750
Stop!

523
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,375
What are you doing?

524
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:48,833
Face down!

525
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,166
Hands behind your back.

526
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,208
Hands behind your back.

527
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,250
Are you tough?

528
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,291
Get up!

529
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:01,041
Everybody, up! Now!

530
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,958
Officer, take them to the van.

531
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,875
Go!

532
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:09,500
Calm down. Go further in. Up you go.

533
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,666
I’ll whip your ass.

534
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,625
Move.

535
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,625
-What are you doing?
-Why?

536
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,708
-Get on.
-Sit down or I’ll whip your ass.

537
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,625
Hey.

538
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,250
-Jerk!
-Billy!

539
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,291
Sit down!

540
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,000
Want to try me?

541
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,750
Still fighting? Hey.

542
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,583
I'll hit you.

543
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,875
So gritty.

544
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,416
You have nothing else to do?

545
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:45,333
You thinking what I’m thinking?

546
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Of course, moron.

547
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,750
I was arrested once.

548
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,458
I get booked again, I’ll be gone for long.

549
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,958
-What are you going to do?
-I don’t know.

550
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,375
Let me handle it.

551
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,125
Tell your guys to be prepared.

552
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,333
You'd better make it, jackass.

553
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,291
Damn you. Always get on my nerves.

554
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,375
I’ve despised you for so long.

555
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,333
-Want to go one-on-one with me?
-Stop!

556
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,708
I said stop.

557
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,166
Officer, I'm done.

558
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,750
Can I go one-on-one with this jerk?

559
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,208
He’s doing my head in.

560
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:25,041
Fine. But the loser…

561
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,833
will get beaten up. I warn you.

562
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,750
You moron. Loose mouth.

563
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,833
Do you know channel 7 Muay Thai?

564
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,916
I’ll make you the highlight of the day.

565
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,250
You're Channel 7?

566
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:38,833
Then I’m the Dark Knight, schmuck!

567
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,250
Damn. If you are both from…

568
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,958
Channel 7 and Dark Knight,

569
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,208
Then I’m Songchai Ratanasubun?

570
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,666
Fight.

571
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,666
-IN!
-CHOL!

572
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,791
Quiet!

573
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,500
When are you going to start?

574
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,708
Go on.

575
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,375
One…

576
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,166
Two!

577
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,333
Damn! Still counting?

578
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,500
Annoying as hell!

579
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,208
-Three!
-Hey!

580
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,333
-Run!
-Go!

581
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,958
-What the hell?
-Stop!

582
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,625
Sit down!

583
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,208
Sit down!

584
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:38,541
Hey, guys.

585
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,583
Let me ask you this,

586
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,750
why do you guys fight?

587
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:47,000
What is it for?

588
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,250
I see you guys always
having street fights.

589
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:55,708
If there were no idiots like you
in this country,

590
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,458
it would be much more developed.

591
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:00,000
The three of you…

592
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:02,875
have you ever asked yourselves

593
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,458
why you have to fight?

594
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:12,166
Year after year,
I've always seen you fight.

595
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,666
Just use your brain. Think hard.

596
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,708
"Year after year, you fight."

597
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,375
Like you police are good, what a jerk.

598
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:32,250
Can you answer his question though?

599
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,708
Why do we fight?

600
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:40,125
Sure.

601
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,000
Why then?

602
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,416
You are the BUs.

603
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,916
This jackass is the INs.

604
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,833
And I’m the CHOLs.

605
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:57,125
That’s sensible.

606
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,208
You have a point. I agree.

607
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:05,208
If I was not in the BUs,
you were not in the CHOLs,

608
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:07,666
and that jackass was not in the INs,

609
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,458
would we still fight?

610
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:15,291
Young people in the US fight all the time.

611
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:18,166
They don’t even have
patriotism for the institute,

612
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,916
they are just gang members.

613
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,625
All drug dealers.

614
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:22,916
How do you know?

615
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,541
Have you been there?

616
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,125
Piss off.

617
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,708
All I know is
every country has their own problems.

618
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,041
It depends on how
they solve their problems.

619
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,666
And what's the problem in the US?

620
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,416
Are you stupid?

621
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:45,708
Why?

622
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,541
Don’t you have cable TV in your area?

623
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,875
You are a jerk.

624
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,041
What’s wrong with you?

625
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,125
I really want to know.

626
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,250
It’s poverty.

627
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,416
Poverty?

628
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,541
How many cans of glue have you sniffed?

629
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,458
And what's the problem in this country?

630
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,000
How would I know, slimeball?

631
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,750
If I did, I’d be in parliament.

632
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,625
So do you or do you not know?

633
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,458
What is wrong with you? Why so quiet?

634
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,208
POLICE STATION
WE PROTECT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE

635
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:40,708
Your parents are here to bail you out.

636
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,250
I’m sure they are not mine.

637
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:49,000
My parents.

638
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,875
Please sign an acknowledgement here.

639
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:55,791
Yes.

640
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,000
I’m not here to bail him out,
I want to press charges.

641
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,416
What did you say?

642
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,458
Your son is a piece of crap.

643
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,250
He should be in jail as discipline

644
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,833
and know what being miserable is like.

645
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,958
Officer, he stole my camera.

646
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,416
If you really want to report your son,

647
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,708
file a report with the officer in charge.

648
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,625
Let’s go.

649
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,458
Wait, you can’t do that.

650
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,791
Stay out of this.

651
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,416
Billy.

652
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,208
I’m sorry.

653
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,916
You told him about the camera?

654
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,500
I’m sorry.

655
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,333
Mom,

656
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,958
let me ask you one thing.

657
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,750
What is it?

658
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,166
Why did you have me?

659
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:28,708
It’s my fault.

660
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:30,833
I’m sorry.

661
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,791
-Hi, boss.
-Hi.

662
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,333
Are you doing well?

663
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,708
If I was doing well, I wouldn’t be here.

664
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,125
What did you do this time?

665
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,958
War with the INs at the Pang’s concert.

666
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,708
They got me busted.

667
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,041
Only three of you got busted?

668
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:37,666
This scumbag is BU, that jackass is IN.

669
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,083
How about you?

670
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,416
I’m okay.

671
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,291
The technical boys at house 4.

672
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,875
House 2 is for stray local guys.

673
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,958
Yad and his friends
were busted for drugs and guns.

674
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:54,666
The whole gang is in here.

675
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,708
Don’t they fight?

676
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,750
The locals hate technical boys.

677
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:58,916
Damn right they do.

678
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,458
They outnumber us.

679
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,208
Clashed with the DONs since the first day.

680
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,083
These guards are mean.

681
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,000
They punish offenders severely.

682
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,750
Isn’t this Mr. Oh the CHOLs?

683
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:25,416
Are you here on vacation?

684
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,458
Never thought I would meet you here.

685
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,791
Yeah, I’m on vacation, hunting animals.

686
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:40,333
Oh, hunting animals?

687
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,750
What kind of animals?

688
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:44,750
We have them all here.

689
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,291
The crappy kind,
I’m never bored of looking at.

690
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:01,833
Well, it’s not fun time now

691
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:05,500
because we hunt at night.

692
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,958
There is an IN guy here.

693
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,875
I’ve always wanted to chew you.

694
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,750
Let’s see if you live up to
your reputation.

695
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:21,625
What the hell are you looking at?

696
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:25,875
What the hell are you looking at?

697
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,833
-Scumbag!
-Hey.

698
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,750
-Slimeball.
-Dirtbag!

699
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,583
This one is quite fierce.

700
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,666
You might want to get some jabs.

701
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,875
-Jerk.
-Stop.

702
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:41,416
-Stop.
-Don’t worry, you’ll have your chance.

703
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,666
But I’m hungry now. Got to eat.

704
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,500
I’ll save my dessert for later tonight.

705
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,708
-You slimeball!
-Stop!

706
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:50,875
Stop!

707
00:53:50,958 --> 00:53:51,791
Stop!

708
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,125
Hey, you are not the IN here!

709
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,500
You are not the IN here!

710
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,125
Look at those creeps.

711
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:00,416
Look!

712
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,750
They hunt in groups.
They are not like you!

713
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,708
You think the military police are cruel,

714
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:08,875
these guards are even worse.

715
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,666
I thought the CHOLs were fearless.

716
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,833
Let’s beat the crap out of them,
see if they are tough.

717
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:23,041
Next time,

718
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,375
I don’t think they'll have the guts.

719
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,583
Damn.

720
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:34,500
Hey.

721
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,041
Don’t you know the rule?

722
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:42,916
What rule?

723
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,416
The big guy showers near the tap.

724
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,333
Is that so, schmuck?

725
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,458
It is not mentioned in the text book.

726
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,541
Then put it in your skull,

727
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,666
because the text books…

728
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:08,208
don’t tell you everything.

729
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:13,875
Well, go ahead, I’ll wait.

730
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:16,750
Sure.

731
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,541
I thought you were tough, schmuck.

732
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Hey.

733
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,166
But in my book,

734
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,375
this is what it taught me.

735
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,541
Here come Social Studies.

736
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,666
Son of a bitch!

737
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,875
What the hell are you doing?

738
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:08,166
Who started this crap? Say it!

739
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,708
Or you all will be punished.

740
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:14,666
I did.

741
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,500
I started it.

742
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,250
Me too.

743
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:42,625
It’s done.

744
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,833
Is it?

745
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:46,250
Anything else?

746
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,208
If not, you'd better go home.

747
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,041
Alright.

748
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:56,583
Dad, if you need anything,
please let me know.

749
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:57,583
Who’s your dad?

750
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,541
I'd never have a son like you.

751
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,041
Da, you should get back.

752
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,750
You can come again later.

753
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,333
Don’t come again ever

754
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,875
and stay away from my daughter.

755
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:18,583
Why do you talk like that?

756
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,000
Why can’t I?

757
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,541
I say what I like.

758
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:22,666
You have a problem?

759
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,916
But Au and I are seeing each other.

760
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,833
So?

761
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,125
You are together then, or what?

762
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,791
Au is my daughter.

763
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:32,958
Who I want her to date, is my decision.

764
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:34,833
Go. Get lost.

765
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:39,416
Da, please leave, trust me.

766
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:45,708
Goodbye, Mom.

767
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,583
Dad…

768
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,458
Au is pregnant.

769
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,458
What did you say?

770
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,125
I said…

771
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:22,916
Au is pregnant.

772
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,333
You impregnated my daughter?

773
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,250
Dad!

774
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,500
You punk. Son of a bitch.
You piece of crap.

775
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,833
Da, listen to me, please go home.

776
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,875
Get out of my house!

777
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,833
And never come back again

778
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,916
or I will kill you!

779
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,083
Go!

780
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:44,875
Do one!

781
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,500
Da, please go home.

782
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:51,541
Goddamnit!

783
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,541
So many nice men…

784
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,375
Yet you choose this jerk!

785
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,500
Why?!

786
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:11,166
You caused trouble on your first day.

787
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:13,416
Two times for now

788
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,458
and you have to
clean up the toilet tomorrow.

789
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:19,666
If you still cause more trouble,

790
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,791
there will be more coming.

791
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,000
Who will be the first?

792
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:42,375
I will.

793
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:50,291
Take a deep breath.

794
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:09,666
Deep breath.

795
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,041
Come on, one more.

796
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,375
Take a deep breath.

797
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:44,833
One last time, now you remember.

798
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,583
Come on.

799
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:32,666
Mom.

800
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,041
Are you hungry?

801
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,166
I cooked you some food.

802
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:57,250
Let’s eat.

803
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,291
Your favorite, stuffed bitter gourd soup.

804
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,791
What’s wrong, Mom?

805
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,791
What happened to you?

806
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,750
Why are you crying?

807
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,583
Did someone hurt you?

808
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,291
Today I met Aunt Duang Jai,

809
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:56,875
she invited you to Kik's graduation.

810
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,916
She doesn’t know that you…

811
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:33,791
Mom.

812
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,291
I’m sorry.

813
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,708
Mom.

814
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:47,625
Mom.

815
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:18,958
Damn it.

816
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:22,125
We were punished
and still have to wash the toilet.

817
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,166
Why are you whining?

818
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:35,375
Why did you pick the smaller bucket?

819
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,291
You clean that zone,
and this zone is mine.

820
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,291
Damn Oh.

821
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,375
You come to this zone, jerk.

822
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
They didn’t flush their crap. Damn!

823
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,583
Didn’t you start all of this?

824
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,166
Now we have to clean up crap.

825
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,833
You are the one who built it up.

826
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:33,916
You've had a go at him since we arrived.

827
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,791
Are you gonna talk crap or clean it?

828
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,250
I’m still in pain because of you.

829
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,375
Hurry up, scumbag.

830
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:49,875
Which room do
you want me to wash? Let me help.

831
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,125
Were you just crying in the toilet?

832
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,250
What I do in the toilet is my business.

833
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:06,166
I’m a grown-up.

834
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,791
Just get on with it.

835
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:13,875
What the hell? You argue like kids.

836
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,375
Where’s my brush?

837
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:38,750
Why do you go to IN?

838
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,541
And you?

839
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:52,958
Why do you go to CHOL?

840
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,333
I asked you first.

841
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,041
Seriously, I have no idea
why I went to CHOL.

842
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:05,625
This is strange.

843
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:09,791
We wear different uniforms out there.

844
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,375
But if I was not studying at CHOL,

845
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,958
I might end up like Yad.

846
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,000
No future.

847
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,666
Because we hold onto the institute's name.

848
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:35,875
I get to see my mom's tears.

849
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:37,541
Damn it.

850
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:42,416
I don’t know.

851
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,875
I think it’s the virtue of this.

852
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,583
Skills that teach us to survive.

853
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:58,000
People fight in all lines
of work and study.

854
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:15,000
By the way,

855
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:17,666
if we all meet outside,

856
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,291
will we fight?

857
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:25,666
I don’t know.

858
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:28,125
We know each other now.

859
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,208
We'll just try to
avoid each other in public.

860
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,000
If we can’t,

861
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,291
we’ll meet later to settle it.

862
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:42,666
All right,

863
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,083
friend?

864
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,958
Da, when will Billy get out?

865
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,666
In a few days.

866
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:11,416
Did his family visit him?

867
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,166
His mom sent letters and some money.

868
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:21,958
Poor Billy.

869
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,541
How did he manage to go back to school?

870
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,375
There's only one semester left.

871
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:31,416
Mom.

872
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:35,208
Billy will have to stay with us
for a while.

873
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:38,041
Billy’s mom will send the money.

874
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,875
Sure, no problem.

875
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:57,625
Well?

876
01:09:58,541 --> 01:09:59,375
Well?

877
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,333
Well…

878
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,833
I want to ask you…

879
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:10,375
what do you think about Au?

880
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:17,166
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

881
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:24,416
I mean, do you like Au or not?

882
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:34,083
Well… if you love her
and think she is good for you,

883
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,750
then I love her too.

884
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,958
You gotta make a decision by yourself.

885
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,416
But…

886
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:46,083
is there something else?

887
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:49,958
No, nothing. I just
want to know what you think.

888
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,208
I’ll wipe the plate.

889
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,208
-Hello, Mom.
-Hello, Mom.

890
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,375
Hello.

891
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,000
Good luck.

892
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:11,833
Don’t come back here again.

893
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:19,458
-What's up?
-What’s up, man?

894
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:26,250
Why are you here?

895
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:28,666
I’m sorry.

896
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:31,916
Please don’t be mad at me.

897
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,958
Take this money,

898
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,000
and finish your studies.

899
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:49,958
I’ll try to make things
better with your stepdad.

900
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:48,291
We’ll be friends until we grow old

901
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:59,375
Share many memories from now on

902
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:08,291
Share sadness, happiness, dreams

903
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,541
Laugh and cry together

904
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:18,041
Until that day comes

905
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:22,416
Until we die

906
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,541
My turn.

907
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:33,833
Until that day, the day we die

908
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,375
Awesome.

909
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:39,500
Billy, you are really good
at song writing.

910
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,666
It’s just a hobby, for Lupin.

911
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,291
Lupin?

912
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,625
I see that he likes singing.

913
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,166
One day he can be a singer.

914
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,750
I don’t think he can.

915
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:52,041
But you, maybe after graduation.

916
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,333
Nah.

917
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:58,458
Hey, the SMF concert is in a few days.

918
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:00,625
What is your decision?

919
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,375
I don’t know.

920
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:06,458
How about you?

921
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,333
You go, I go.

922
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:12,625
If you don’t, me neither.

923
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,458
Okay, I’ll go.

924
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:22,791
Really?

925
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,375
Yes, it’s the last gig before we graduate.

926
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,458
Damn! Attaboy.

927
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:32,833
We’ll have a great time.

928
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:34,041
Why?

929
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:36,541
Lupin has been preparing
since the start of the year.

930
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,208
-Our Lupin?
-Yeah.

931
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,083
He talks about this concert every day.

932
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:41,708
Prepares his costume early.

933
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,708
Yeah, he’s quite something.

934
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:46,958
Billy.

935
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:49,291
Let me ask you something.

936
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:50,250
What?

937
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,625
When my baby is born,

938
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,166
what will your gift be?

939
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,333
I don’t know yet.

940
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,375
But I’ll have a gift for sure.

941
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:39,833
I’ll be back.

942
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:45,666
Hello.

943
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,166
Hello, Da. It’s Au.

944
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,166
What are you doing?

945
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,458
Playing guitar with Billy.

946
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,625
How are you, Au?

947
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:01,125
What are you doing? Did you eat?

948
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,125
Da.

949
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:09,166
Have you told your mom that I’m pregnant?

950
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:12,583
Not yet.

951
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:17,291
I will tell her after the SMF concert.

952
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:23,833
The SMF concert…

953
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,125
is it that important to you?

954
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:34,291
Au, it’s the last thing with my friends.

955
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:40,000
Don’t sulk. It’s not a big deal.

956
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,458
Right.

957
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,166
It’s not a big deal.

958
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,416
I got to go.

959
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,041
Okay, Au.

960
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:03,916
Au…

961
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,125
I love you.

962
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:08,458
Sweet dreams.

963
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:31,750
It was Au.

964
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:34,708
She doesn’t want me to go.

965
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:38,375
What will you do?

966
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It’s one last time. Come on.

967
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,958
After my baby is born, I will…

968
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,375
just be a good father.

969
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,583
Okay, let’s do it.

970
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,583
IN

971
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,791
One word that makes the world delightful

972
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:33,541
It turns bitterness into sweetness

973
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:37,875
One word that makes you cry

974
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:42,375
That takes all your hopes
It makes you want to die

975
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,583
That makes you a good person
Like no one has ever seen

976
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:57,458
That makes you a bad person
Like you have never been

977
01:18:57,541 --> 01:19:01,333
One night that will make you enchanted

978
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:05,708
For no reason, you forget to breathe

979
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:09,708
Like a drama that you have to act

980
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,375
It’s because of some kind of force

981
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:16,375
The force of love, lust, so powerful

982
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:20,916
That commands you to do anything

983
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,208
The force of love, lust, so powerful

984
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:29,208
That commands you to do anything…

985
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,791
INTRA

986
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:44,125
Look at Lupin from INs.

987
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,708
Mod, look at him.

988
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,125
It's gonna be so goddamn fun!

989
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:56,166
The force of love, lust, so powerful

990
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,375
That commands you to do anything

991
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:04,125
The force of love, lust, so powerful

992
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:08,875
That commands you to do anything…

993
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,208
Hello, Mom.

994
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:13,875
Is Da home?

995
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:20,166
The force of love, lust, so powerful

996
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,916
That commands you to do anything

997
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:44,708
Anything, anything

998
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:47,916
Love makes you do anything

999
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,583
We all smile to everyone
But it’s different in our mind

1000
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:20,166
People seem friendly
But they are not real

1001
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:24,125
Look at ourselves, we realize

1002
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:28,083
Deep down we don’t
Want to be less than anyone

1003
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,833
People fight for everything

1004
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:36,333
Do everything to get what they want

1005
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:47,458
We give up and become losers

1006
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:51,708
We are generous and become victims

1007
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:55,541
Stop trusting and be more pessimistic

1008
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:59,166
Prevent it before dangers get to us…

1009
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,291
That mofo Lupin is asking for it.

1010
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,333
Very well. I like it.

1011
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:07,000
Hey.

1012
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,291
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?

1013
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:18,500
Paranoid, I’m insane, aren’t I, doc?

1014
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:22,541
Paranoid, it’s curable, isn’t it, doc?

1015
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:28,458
Paranoid, I’m afraid
You’ll prolong my treatment

1016
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,625
Did a good job, get praised and rewarded

1017
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:42,833
It is actually misleading

1018
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:46,875
When useful, you are always wanted

1019
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:50,333
When useless, they replace you

1020
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:54,208
Everybody is looking
For their own benefit…

1021
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,333
INs!

1022
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,333
INs!

1023
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,291
CHOLs!

1024
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:05,750
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?

1025
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:07,166
KANOKs!

1026
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,416
KANOKs!

1027
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:10,250
BUs!

1028
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,375
Come on.

1029
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:14,208
Come on, scumbag.

1030
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:15,333
KANOKs!

1031
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:19,625
I’m afraid you’ll prolong my treatment…

1032
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:23,416
IN!

1033
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:31,875
You're gonna get it, schmuck.

1034
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,166
INs!

1035
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,333
Doc!

1036
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:40,541
Please help. Doc!

1037
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:41,541
This way!

1038
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:42,583
This way.

1039
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:44,875
Family waits here.

1040
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,041
Goddamnit!

1041
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:50,250
I told you. Who shone tonight?

1042
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,791
INs!

1043
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,916
Did you see their faces?

1044
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,041
Mod must have been so mad.

1045
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,666
He deserves it.

1046
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,250
It could have been worse.

1047
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,208
Yeah.

1048
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:02,833
I told you, where there are INs, there is…

1049
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:03,750
Billy.

1050
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,458
Lupin, you dork.

1051
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,375
Let me call Au.

1052
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,791
You are a dork.

1053
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:10,875
Ta-da!

1054
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,166
What are you doing?

1055
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,166
Counselling.

1056
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,708
-I’m a watchdog.
-Moron.

1057
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,666
I can talk to my girlfriend.

1058
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:25,250
Don’t drink it all.

1059
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:34,625
Hello, Au?

1060
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:50,208
What did you say, Au?

1061
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,500
Hey!

1062
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:09,000
Hey.

1063
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:09,916
Follow him.

1064
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,333
-Da!
-Da!

1065
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,166
-Da!
-Da!

1066
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,541
Da!

1067
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:23,083
-Da!
-Da!

1068
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,375
-Da.
-Au!

1069
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:25,875
-Da.
-Au!

1070
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:27,541
Au!

1071
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,166
Au!

1072
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:40,791
1144, please state your pager number.

1073
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,541
Seenoom messaged that he saw Da the IN

1074
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,166
and two friends on his street.

1075
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,291
Au!

1076
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:06,875
Au!, It’s me, Da!

1077
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,291
Au!

1078
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,375
Hey, Da.

1079
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,333
What are you doing?

1080
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,916
Come on, if you want to die.

1081
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,041
You'd better go back.

1082
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:28,916
I won’t.

1083
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,208
You’ll be charged with
trespassing and sex with a minor.

1084
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:40,083
Go ahead.

1085
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:43,500
If you want to get me arrested, do it.

1086
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,375
But I’ll tell the police

1087
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,916
that you will take Au to get an abortion.

1088
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,083
Dad!

1089
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,833
You can’t get rid of my baby.

1090
01:26:57,916 --> 01:26:59,750
You don’t have the right
to tell me what to do!

1091
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:00,750
I do.

1092
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:02,875
The baby is mine!

1093
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,208
But Au is my daughter!

1094
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:10,000
And I don’t want her
to have a baby with you.

1095
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:17,458
Look at yourselves.

1096
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,000
You're like a bunch of dogs,

1097
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,375
running around and biting people.

1098
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,458
Dogs?

1099
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:32,416
What's wrong with dogs?

1100
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,625
Dogs love their puppies.

1101
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,083
We are human.

1102
01:27:37,166 --> 01:27:40,250
We also have right to be fathers!

1103
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:44,333
Do you think I'm heartless?

1104
01:27:44,416 --> 01:27:45,666
Yes!

1105
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:51,291
Because people like you have no future.

1106
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,166
Can you tell me
what the future looks like?

1107
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:59,083
Have you ever seen it?

1108
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:03,625
Although we have no future,
we still have hearts.

1109
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,375
Tell me the truth, Au.

1110
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,125
Do you really want to get an abortion?

1111
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:37,625
Da.

1112
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,708
If I keep the baby,

1113
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,458
can you really take care of us?

1114
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:01,333
I’m only 17.

1115
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,750
You are still in school,

1116
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:09,750
you don’t even have a job.

1117
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:16,791
So for the baby and myself…

1118
01:29:19,458 --> 01:29:20,416
what will it be like?

1119
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:25,250
Can you tell me?

1120
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:41,708
I don’t think we're ready.

1121
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:53,541
You know, before all of this…

1122
01:29:54,791 --> 01:29:57,208
I never thought of anything like this.

1123
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:00,875
Until today…

1124
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,875
it’s today, Da.

1125
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:07,958
You went to the concert.

1126
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:10,083
You always go and fight.

1127
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,166
And you…

1128
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:19,166
you still think I can rely on you?

1129
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,541
Can I, Da?

1130
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:31,458
Au. Please calm down.

1131
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,875
I understand what you said, but…

1132
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,833
can I ask you only one thing?

1133
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:43,250
Please keep the baby,
I’ll take care of it.

1134
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,666
You will?

1135
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:51,750
You can’t even take care of yourself.

1136
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:54,375
How can you take care of a baby?

1137
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:58,958
Enough.

1138
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,000
No matter what you think

1139
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:03,750
or what you say,

1140
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:08,750
I’ll never let my daughter

1141
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,541
stoop down to your level.

1142
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:16,166
My level? What's low?

1143
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,500
You want her to have an abortion,
that’s the lowest!

1144
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:20,541
Enough with this.

1145
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:23,375
Do you want to die? Come at me!

1146
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:25,000
-Come on.
-No.

1147
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,291
Dad. Enough.

1148
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:31,458
No.

1149
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,375
No, calm down.

1150
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:41,833
Dad.

1151
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:50,458
I’m sorry that I snapped at you.

1152
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,916
I’m sorry about the crappy things I said.

1153
01:31:56,416 --> 01:31:58,166
But the only thing I ask,

1154
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:01,000
can you let Au keep the baby?

1155
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,708
After she delivers the baby,
I’ll raise it.

1156
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:09,541
I’ll be responsible for everything.

1157
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:16,000
And she still has
to bear it for nine months.

1158
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,208
You only think about your own benefit.

1159
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:22,916
When her tummy gets bigger,

1160
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:29,458
Au, I and my whole family

1161
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:31,041
have to be embarrassed.

1162
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,291
Mod and his friends, Billy.

1163
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,625
Billy!

1164
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,458
I really don’t know
what to do, Dad. I really don’t.

1165
01:33:15,291 --> 01:33:16,833
The only thing I know,

1166
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:19,000
please let Au keep the baby.

1167
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:25,500
Please, and after she gives birth,

1168
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:26,458
she doesn’t have to do anything else.

1169
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:29,291
I will never come to see her again.

1170
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,625
Please let her keep the baby.

1171
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:35,291
Have mercy on it. Spare the baby’s life.

1172
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,625
Da, why are you bowing to him?

1173
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,833
This idiot doesn’t deserve your respect.

1174
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:41,375
-Billy!
-Dad, no!

1175
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,500
-Lupin!
-Mofo!

1176
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:45,375
I said stop. Stop now.

1177
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,541
Stop now! Stop.

1178
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:48,958
What would you like me to do?

1179
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:50,666
What would I do?

1180
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:55,541
The way I beg and fall to my knees,
everything is for my child.

1181
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:57,791
It’s for my child, you get it?

1182
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:17,333
Dad.

1183
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:20,375
I know.

1184
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:23,958
I’m useless. I’m an idiot,
a piece of crap.

1185
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:26,166
This is the best my life can do.

1186
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,375
But my child's life…

1187
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,250
please let it live.

1188
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:50,708
Mod.

1189
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,083
Even my friend goes to technical college

1190
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,375
and seems like a crappy person

1191
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:20,500
but ultimately the baby is his.

1192
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:26,375
Please don’t force her to get an abortion.

1193
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:30,375
We beg you.

1194
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:39,875
Let’s go.

1195
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:27,541
Finally, after three years.

1196
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:32,458
Yeah, we graduated.

1197
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:36,125
I never thought that we would graduate.

1198
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:43,375
We've had so much fun
in the past three years.

1199
01:36:43,458 --> 01:36:45,541
We went through so much,

1200
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:49,166
all the bad and the good.

1201
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,250
Oranges, Mom.

1202
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:51,416
Yeah.

1203
01:36:55,458 --> 01:36:56,583
Three years…

1204
01:36:57,375 --> 01:37:00,750
I hadn’t slept well until you got this.

1205
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,000
Shed so many tears.

1206
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:09,875
You should look for higher education.

1207
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:14,000
Get well paid
so you can afford for your child.

1208
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:17,250
I can still help with
the expense at the moment.

1209
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,041
Thank you, Mom.

1210
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Thank you.

1211
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:29,541
He graduated from that crappy institute?

1212
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:32,166
He's quite alright.

1213
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,541
If you could go back in time,

1214
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,208
would you go to vocational college?

1215
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:41,916
That is an odd question.

1216
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:44,041
Who would be able to go back in time?

1217
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:48,000
Even the river doesn’t flow back.

1218
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:52,583
Billy, the water flows in
one direction in high tide,

1219
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,125
it flows back the other way in low tide.

1220
01:37:56,208 --> 01:37:57,958
It will be the same tomorrow.

1221
01:37:58,041 --> 01:37:58,958
You idiot.

1222
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:02,208
So deep.

1223
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:05,791
If I could really choose.

1224
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,375
If I could go back in time,

1225
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:10,083
I wouldn’t choose this path.

1226
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:13,958
I feel you, my friend.

1227
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:19,708
But we can’t go back to fix anything.

1228
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:24,250
Life is up and down just like the river.

1229
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:27,958
Look at it that way.

1230
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:32,041
Hell, yeah!

1231
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:33,458
Even deeper than me.

1232
01:38:36,625 --> 01:38:39,708
Hey, come support me
at the military draft.

1233
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,000
Of course we’ll come.

1234
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:42,916
Yeah.

1235
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,458
Lupin, have you seen Rhang lately?

1236
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:47,041
How is he? Quit using drugs?

1237
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:50,375
He said he’d come to my military draft.

1238
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,000
He’ll leave
Wat Thamkrabok rehab in two weeks

1239
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:56,583
but his dad won’t let him go back to IN.

1240
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,750
He'll send him to Sripatum university.

1241
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:03,291
So he won't go back
to the same environment.

1242
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:11,666
We did it!

1243
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:28,250
Rhang, give me.

1244
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,458
Wow! Damn, super black.

1245
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:36,375
-Pass.
-That’s awesome.

1246
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:57,416
I got it.

1247
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,208
You are going in?

1248
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,416
The black ballot!

1249
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,000
-How's that?
-Attaboy.

1250
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:06,000
Red ballot, mofo!

1251
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,333
-I'm so pissed.
-Damn.

1252
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:10,541
Those scumbags are noisy.

1253
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:11,500
God damn…

1254
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:12,541
He's going solo.

1255
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:14,083
Two officers locked my hands.

1256
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:15,000
Why?

1257
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:17,125
Stop me from running away? I don’t know.

1258
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:19,166
-You're a lucky son of a bitch.
-Sure I am.

1259
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,333
Noisy bitches!

1260
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,208
Why the hell are you barking?

1261
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:26,458
Oh, Billy from IN?

1262
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:30,041
Your friend is damn lucky.

1263
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:33,208
But you and me seem out of luck.

1264
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:39,500
Wanna show me what you got, bitch?

1265
01:40:40,458 --> 01:40:41,875
I’ll see you outside.

1266
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:48,416
Who is that?

1267
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:51,041
Such a kickable face.

1268
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:53,625
Yad, a local stray.

1269
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:56,750
From Central Ladprao
and picks fights with technical boys?

1270
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah.

1271
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,958
How do you know him?

1272
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,625
At the juvie.

1273
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:04,041
I fought with him there.

1274
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,041
Don’t mind him.

1275
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:10,250
He has nothing on us.

1276
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:12,875
-Let's have hot pot.
-Yeah.

1277
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:13,875
Your treat, Lupin.

1278
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:15,125
Yeah, your turn.

1279
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:16,083
I have 20 baht.

1280
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:17,625
Jerk.

1281
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:26,708
Hello?

1282
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:28,041
Where are you?

1283
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,875
You are so late.

1284
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:32,375
Lupin could have gone to boot camp.

1285
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:33,958
How was it?

1286
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,083
Black ballot.

1287
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:37,750
We gotta celebrate.

1288
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:38,708
Where?

1289
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:40,208
In the hood.

1290
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:42,166
Just come join us, stop asking.

1291
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:43,750
Page Rhang when you get here.

1292
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:44,666
He’ll pick you up.

1293
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:45,958
Rhang is there?

1294
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:48,625
Everybody is here but you.

1295
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:50,500
Just come, stop asking.

1296
01:41:51,916 --> 01:41:52,750
Yeah.

1297
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:54,833
I saw Mod too.

1298
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:58,375
Mod who?

1299
01:41:58,458 --> 01:41:59,916
I’ll crush him.

1300
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,375
Just hurry, Rhang has
to rush back to rehab.

1301
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,041
What rehab, you idiot?

1302
01:42:04,125 --> 01:42:05,708
Let me talk to him.

1303
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:08,041
Hello, Da.

1304
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:10,208
Hurry up.

1305
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,541
See you there.

1306
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:14,416
All right?

1307
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:18,833
Yeah, see you, man.

1308
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,583
Drink up all you want, my treat.

1309
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:33,333
Damn.

1310
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:53,041
Oh, I saw Lupin today.

1311
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,916
When I walked out,

1312
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,000
I saw Billy and his friends.

1313
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:01,458
So what?

1314
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:04,833
I’m just telling you.

1315
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,583
You know Billy, don’t you?

1316
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:13,833
Yeah, I know him.

1317
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:17,166
We became good friends in juvie.

1318
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:23,125
But they are always the INs, aren’t they?

1319
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:30,166
And I am the one who slashed him.

1320
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:37,791
But I’m a CHOL,

1321
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,666
I know what you are thinking.

1322
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:46,791
But to me, friends
and institute are as important.

1323
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:52,291
Billy was there
so you didn’t want to fight?

1324
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:54,625
I was gonna go after Da,

1325
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:56,958
Billy and I would settle things later.

1326
01:43:57,041 --> 01:43:58,500
You were there, weren’t you?

1327
01:43:58,583 --> 01:44:00,041
You know what happened.

1328
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:03,583
Yeah, I understand.

1329
01:44:04,291 --> 01:44:06,916
I’m kidding. Don’t think too much.

1330
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,416
We did the right thing that day.

1331
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,458
It would be despicable if we fought them.

1332
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:14,041
Da was on his knees crying,

1333
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:15,500
who would want to hurt him?

1334
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,458
But I won’t spare him next time.

1335
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:27,000
Where’s the restaurant?

1336
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:29,458
I don’t have that 20 baht anymore,

1337
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:30,916
already spent it on cigarettes.

1338
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,500
-You are always like this.
-Lame.

1339
01:44:34,583 --> 01:44:37,750
-This one.
-My parents don’t give me money so often.

1340
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:41,625
They say the hot pot is really good here.

1341
01:44:42,166 --> 01:44:43,250
There is a jukebox too.

1342
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:46,708
I told you it’s
the best here. All kinds of music.

1343
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,041
-Hit songs, Grammy…
-Sony.

1344
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,458
Sony, Grammy,

1345
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:51,750
RS, FourS, they have it all.

1346
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,625
Bakery too.

1347
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:55,458
-Come on.
-Do you have two baht?

1348
01:44:56,416 --> 01:44:59,000
Put some music on.

1349
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:06,333
Do you see that, Billy?

1350
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:15,750
Hello.

1351
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:17,458
A table for three?

1352
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:21,291
Please come in, please.

1353
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:29,291
Seeing their faces
made me lose my appetite.

1354
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:33,833
They should put our feet
in their mouth rather than the meal.

1355
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:35,250
Agreed.

1356
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,916
They should rather eat our feet.

1357
01:45:40,333 --> 01:45:42,541
What now, Billy? Go somewhere else?

1358
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:46,958
Order,

1359
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,916
one grilled beef.

1360
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,750
Whiskey, two waters, one bucket of ice.

1361
01:45:54,375 --> 01:45:57,000
Calm down, Lupin. Keep it cool.

1362
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:58,541
Leave now, we're losers.

1363
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,791
They’ll talk crap about us.

1364
01:46:02,416 --> 01:46:04,041
What are you gonna do?

1365
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,375
Clear up.

1366
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,375
How?

1367
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:13,416
Don’t know.

1368
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:14,916
Jerk.

1369
01:46:15,625 --> 01:46:18,833
Your order is coming.

1370
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,083
Here.

1371
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,208
Rhang, get me the whiskey.

1372
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:18,958
Oh,

1373
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,583
let me drink with you guys.

1374
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:23,291
About that night.

1375
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:29,041
Looks like we’ll have a hot pot with feet.

1376
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,875
That sounds yummy.

1377
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:34,083
You might have watched too much
Dreams Come True.

1378
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:39,000
Coming here wishing to drink with us?

1379
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:41,458
I’m not as generous as Mr. Traipop.

1380
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,250
What do you want me to do?

1381
01:47:51,083 --> 01:47:53,000
If you want to drink with us,

1382
01:47:53,875 --> 01:47:55,625
make a drink for us first,

1383
01:47:55,708 --> 01:47:57,041
are you okay with that?

1384
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:11,916
Which one is your glass?

1385
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:33,791
Straight? Mine is.

1386
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,083
That's good.

1387
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:38,791
Straight, pure with nothing else.

1388
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:40,375
Just like your heart.

1389
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:42,500
It's okay.

1390
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:30,000
Thanks to you guys.

1391
01:49:31,958 --> 01:49:32,791
Wait.

1392
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:43,958
You finished your drink,
let me make another one.

1393
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:08,625
Thanks, man.

1394
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:20,333
What did you talk about with them?

1395
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:22,416
Grilled beef is coming.

1396
01:50:25,791 --> 01:50:27,708
I thought you’d get in a fight.

1397
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:29,583
I was so prepared.

1398
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:32,166
-To fight?
-To run.

1399
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:33,416
That was nothing.

1400
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:37,333
They asked about
what happened at Au’s house.

1401
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:39,625
They must have understood.

1402
01:50:39,708 --> 01:50:42,291
Quite a big heart they have.

1403
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,916
I thought they would beat you up.

1404
01:50:48,291 --> 01:50:50,750
No, it’s over.

1405
01:50:54,916 --> 01:50:56,208
Lupin.

1406
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:58,041
Give me the money you extorted from kids.

1407
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:01,416
Damn, Rhang!

1408
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:05,458
You are desperate for two baht?

1409
01:51:05,541 --> 01:51:07,250
I want some music on.

1410
01:51:07,333 --> 01:51:08,916
How can you afford drugs

1411
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,125
when you want two baht from me? Here.

1412
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:12,333
I quit.

1413
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:13,333
Quit buying?

1414
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:14,541
Quit taking.

1415
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:16,041
Fine then.

1416
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,583
Are you sure you can find them?

1417
01:52:30,666 --> 01:52:32,291
Of course.

1418
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:34,875
Trust me, I got red ballot today.

1419
01:52:34,958 --> 01:52:37,791
My hands need blood. Either IN or CHOL.

1420
01:52:37,875 --> 01:52:39,416
So, what’s next?

1421
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,375
Stop talking, ride on.

1422
01:52:42,458 --> 01:52:44,125
Okay, got it.

1423
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:52,041
Just tell me, just tell me one thing

1424
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:56,458
Why you have changed?

1425
01:52:57,291 --> 01:53:04,250
About me
Upset and crying because of you

1426
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:08,083
It's just your imagination

1427
01:53:09,666 --> 01:53:10,916
Damn.

1428
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:18,041
I'M IN FRONT OF DISTRICT OFFICE, DA

1429
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:21,666
Da is here.

1430
01:53:22,583 --> 01:53:23,541
I’ll pick him up.

1431
01:53:23,625 --> 01:53:26,583
Let me come along, I miss him. Let’s go.

1432
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:29,375
You stay here with Billy.

1433
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:31,833
No. Where are you picking him up?

1434
01:53:31,916 --> 01:53:33,166
District office.

1435
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:35,250
I won’t be long.

1436
01:53:35,333 --> 01:53:36,458
Okay.

1437
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:38,875
Get me some drink.

1438
01:53:41,375 --> 01:53:42,291
Cheers.

1439
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:47,458
I nearly got drafted, you know.

1440
01:53:48,375 --> 01:53:49,375
Luckily I didn’t.

1441
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,333
There is a hot pot shop ahead.

1442
01:54:03,416 --> 01:54:06,208
Let’s go check it out.
They might be there.

1443
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,958
All right, let’s go.

1444
01:54:15,291 --> 01:54:16,875
Da.

1445
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:18,916
-Damn.
-I’ve missed you.

1446
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,166
I could have attacked you back.

1447
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:22,083
Are you all right?

1448
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:23,291
Yeah, how about you?

1449
01:54:23,375 --> 01:54:25,333
You look the same, same long hair.

1450
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:26,291
Have you waited for long?

1451
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:27,333
Not at all.

1452
01:54:27,416 --> 01:54:28,291
And you, are you drunk?

1453
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:30,500
I’m good. A little tipsy.

1454
01:54:56,708 --> 01:54:58,000
Who chose this song?

1455
01:54:58,083 --> 01:54:59,083
So spot on.

1456
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:05,166
Sorry, Oh.

1457
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:08,750
That son of a bitch, Billy,
stabbed JR at the concert,

1458
01:55:08,833 --> 01:55:11,000
you stay out of this, alright?

1459
01:55:11,083 --> 01:55:13,041
Billy, you son of a bitch!

1460
01:55:13,125 --> 01:55:14,541
What?!

1461
01:55:16,208 --> 01:55:17,083
Scumbag!

1462
01:55:17,166 --> 01:55:19,000
-You scumbag!
-Why did you slash me?

1463
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:36,583
-Mod, please.
-Oh!

1464
01:55:36,666 --> 01:55:38,750
Mod, stop. Please!

1465
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:40,458
If CHOL means something to you…

1466
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:43,916
Stay out of this!

1467
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,125
Scumbag!

1468
01:55:45,791 --> 01:55:46,875
Hey!

1469
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,416
This is my day.

1470
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:19,166
Don’t you want to fight now?

1471
01:56:20,916 --> 01:56:22,333
INs and CHOLs?

1472
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:26,541
Aren’t you so great?

1473
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:30,250
Now that you got my little bee show.

1474
01:56:34,833 --> 01:56:38,375
Weren’t you so gritty before, huh?

1475
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:42,250
Even Thai Life Insurance can’t help you.

1476
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:49,958
And you, look at what you did to me.

1477
01:56:51,791 --> 01:56:52,750
You want more?

1478
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:55,458
Huh?

1479
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,166
And you,

1480
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,458
you think you are a CHOL?

1481
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:07,708
You are a CHOL?

1482
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,250
Huh?

1483
01:57:12,333 --> 01:57:13,625
What?

1484
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:17,583
I can’t hear you.

1485
01:57:17,666 --> 01:57:21,416
How is it running into my bullet?

1486
01:57:23,375 --> 01:57:26,375
Does it feel good? Does it?

1487
01:57:29,916 --> 01:57:32,000
Of the three of you,

1488
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:34,500
who do I shoot first?

1489
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:40,125
Do you wanna know who I shoot first?

1490
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:55,166
Huh?

1491
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:58,291
I'll tell you who I shoot first.

1492
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:01,583
Who do I shoot first?

1493
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:04,583
Shoot you?

1494
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:08,041
Do I shoot you?

1495
01:58:11,291 --> 01:58:12,375
Or you?

1496
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:15,791
I know.

1497
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:19,166
I’ll shoot you all
at the same time, scumbags!

1498
01:58:22,583 --> 01:58:23,708
Scumbag!

1499
01:58:28,958 --> 01:58:30,208
You dirtbag!

1500
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:48,791
Da!

1501
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,625
Da!

1502
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:27,208
Da!

1503
01:59:28,166 --> 01:59:29,291
Da!

1504
01:59:34,041 --> 01:59:35,083
Da!

1505
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:42,625
Da!

1506
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:45,750
Da!

1507
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:48,583
Da!

1508
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:52,208
Da!

1509
01:59:53,666 --> 01:59:54,916
Da!

1510
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,833
Da!

1511
02:01:51,875 --> 02:01:53,291
Don’t worry, Da.

1512
02:01:55,416 --> 02:01:56,416
I promise…

1513
02:01:58,416 --> 02:02:00,416
I’ll take a good care of your child.

1514
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:19,833
After Da died,

1515
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,500
I adopted Amm to be my daughter.

1516
02:02:25,625 --> 02:02:27,000
Amm lived with Da's mother from then.

1517
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:31,750
How did Da’s mother die?

1518
02:02:32,416 --> 02:02:34,625
She was killed by drug addicts.

1519
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:38,791
They have no relatives.

1520
02:02:39,541 --> 02:02:41,958
Billy took Amm in.

1521
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:45,291
We all have to help with the expense.

1522
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:56,041
Billy,

1523
02:02:58,375 --> 02:02:59,291
I’m sorry

1524
02:03:00,833 --> 02:03:02,375
that all of this happened.

1525
02:03:06,416 --> 02:03:08,125
Why are you apologizing?

1526
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:11,125
It’s been a long time.

1527
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:14,708
All because we were so wild.

1528
02:03:18,666 --> 02:03:21,458
I feel guilty because of that.

1529
02:03:22,041 --> 02:03:24,000
That’s why I became a teacher.

1530
02:03:27,125 --> 02:03:28,833
It’s just a moment in time.

1531
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:35,458
I believe that everybody
goes through rough times.

1532
02:03:37,541 --> 02:03:41,291
What matters is how you act upon them.

1533
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:53,208
That’s why I am to blame.

1534
02:03:56,666 --> 02:03:57,833
Society despises me.

1535
02:03:59,416 --> 02:04:00,500
My daughter despises me.

1536
02:04:26,416 --> 02:04:27,333
What’s this?

1537
02:04:30,458 --> 02:04:32,041
Why are you drinking with my dad?

1538
02:04:37,291 --> 02:04:39,458
Did you force my teacher into this?

1539
02:04:40,166 --> 02:04:41,000
Dad.

1540
02:04:41,708 --> 02:04:45,291
If I knew what you had
planned for the parents’ meeting,

1541
02:04:47,708 --> 02:04:49,708
I could have taken a motorbike taxi.

1542
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:51,125
Inthira,

1543
02:04:53,583 --> 02:04:55,375
stop talking to your dad like that.

1544
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:58,500
Do you realize what you have just said?

1545
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:00,666
I do.

1546
02:05:01,833 --> 02:05:03,833
I always know what I’m about to say.

1547
02:05:05,291 --> 02:05:07,583
Do you have any idea why I am like this?

1548
02:05:34,916 --> 02:05:37,541
I’ll get some more ice.

1549
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:48,833
How was the parents’ meeting?

1550
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:50,333
I was so embarrassed

1551
02:05:50,416 --> 02:05:53,125
when my friend asked
where my dad graduated from.

1552
02:05:54,333 --> 02:05:55,208
Damn.

1553
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,125
He went to a technical college.

1554
02:05:58,208 --> 02:05:59,583
Who’d want to say that?

1555
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:03,583
Yeah.

1556
02:06:03,666 --> 02:06:08,708
Is graduating from
technical college that disgraceful?

1557
02:06:10,541 --> 02:06:12,000
I’ll call you back, Ter.

1558
02:06:23,083 --> 02:06:25,041
Do you have any idea
what I have been through?

1559
02:06:28,333 --> 02:06:31,250
I know what you have been through.

1560
02:06:32,125 --> 02:06:35,791
Do you know the man you are drinking with

1561
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:37,958
is not my real father?

1562
02:06:39,083 --> 02:06:39,916
Yes.

1563
02:06:42,833 --> 02:06:45,166
I was there when your dad died.

1564
02:06:47,541 --> 02:06:51,916
There is never a day
that your dad and I in more pain…

1565
02:06:52,875 --> 02:06:55,291
than about that awful mistake we made.

1566
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:04,666
I am sorry

1567
02:07:06,208 --> 02:07:08,208
that I am a part of that tragedy.

1568
02:07:09,166 --> 02:07:10,000
I’m so sorry.

1569
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:14,125
Sorry?

1570
02:07:18,125 --> 02:07:21,416
You say sorry and does
that make my life better?

1571
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:25,416
Or will my dad come back to life?

1572
02:07:25,916 --> 02:07:29,208
My apology can't make your life better

1573
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:31,416
or bring Da back to life,

1574
02:07:32,958 --> 02:07:35,833
but do you know that it’s Billy

1575
02:07:35,916 --> 02:07:37,416
who has been taking care of you?

1576
02:07:44,666 --> 02:07:45,791
Yes, I know.

1577
02:07:48,833 --> 02:07:50,625
I knew all along.

1578
02:07:50,708 --> 02:07:52,833
Let me fly with you.

1579
02:07:56,375 --> 02:07:58,208
I saw that he came to
visit grandma all the time.

1580
02:07:58,291 --> 02:07:59,333
Hello, Mom.

1581
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:00,708
When I was a kid,

1582
02:08:02,791 --> 02:08:07,791
he always gave my grandma money.
It was for me.

1583
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:13,750
Always brought along many things

1584
02:08:19,583 --> 02:08:21,583
and played with me,

1585
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:24,250
made me smile.

1586
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:38,375
He taught me to do my homework

1587
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:40,916
and even did it for me.

1588
02:08:44,708 --> 02:08:47,416
He played guitar just to put me to sleep.

1589
02:08:48,916 --> 02:08:50,458
But I didn't sleep.

1590
02:08:56,833 --> 02:08:59,125
After my grandma died,

1591
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:04,791
he took me in and raised me.

1592
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:11,458
He took me to Aunty Peaw's restaurant.

1593
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:18,666
He and Uncle Lupin took me to play games.

1594
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:29,625
But what I never knew was,

1595
02:09:30,458 --> 02:09:34,500
I never knew if what
he has been doing for me…

1596
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:37,041
is because he feels responsible

1597
02:09:38,791 --> 02:09:40,958
or because he loves me?

1598
02:09:43,083 --> 02:09:47,750
You know, he never
remembers anything about me.

1599
02:09:48,416 --> 02:09:51,208
He can’t even remember my birthday.

1600
02:09:53,958 --> 02:09:56,333
He doesn’t know what my favorite food is,

1601
02:09:57,541 --> 02:09:59,291
or what I enjoy doing.

1602
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,625
He only knows when my real dad died.

1603
02:10:05,583 --> 02:10:08,250
When the school was established.

1604
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:11,041
He drinks all day,

1605
02:10:13,041 --> 02:10:14,291
only cares about work,

1606
02:10:15,083 --> 02:10:17,000
wallowing in the past.

1607
02:10:42,666 --> 02:10:46,000
Dad, I really want to know.

1608
02:10:51,083 --> 02:10:52,333
Do you love me

1609
02:10:57,333 --> 02:11:00,708
or do you just feel responsible?

1610
02:11:09,958 --> 02:11:10,791
Amm.

1611
02:11:15,833 --> 02:11:16,916
I’m sorry.

1612
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:39,791
DEDICATED TO EVERY SOUL
THAT MY FRIENDS AND I WRONGED

1613
02:12:20,125 --> 02:12:23,791
I told you to stick to just one thing.

1614
02:12:23,875 --> 02:12:25,666
Now it’s all mixed up.

1615
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:26,958
Think you are tough, huh?

1616
02:12:27,041 --> 02:12:29,625
Told you to take ketamine,

1617
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:31,166
and you took two things.

1618
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:32,750
Let it out.

1619
02:12:32,833 --> 02:12:34,291
The mall will be closed, no more buses.

1620
02:12:34,375 --> 02:12:35,708
I’ll have to find a way to get home.

1621
02:12:35,791 --> 02:12:37,166
You are such a burden.

1622
02:12:38,916 --> 02:12:40,041
How is it?

1623
02:12:41,125 --> 02:12:43,916
Get up, scumbag. Get up.

1624
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:49,166
Anytime he is drunk, my shoulder hurts.

1625
02:12:57,166 --> 02:12:58,791
I wouldn’t complain if it was a girl.

1626
02:12:59,708 --> 02:13:01,500
He’s so heavy.

1627
02:13:21,416 --> 02:13:22,291
Put down the spartan sword.

1628
02:13:23,958 --> 02:13:26,041
or you’ll get to taste my Beretta.

1629
02:13:26,125 --> 02:13:27,791
I can shoot the three of you

1630
02:13:27,875 --> 02:13:31,166
like playing Tic-tac-toe, schmucks!

1631
02:13:31,666 --> 02:13:34,791
If I put it down, you’ll shoot us anyway.

1632
02:13:40,041 --> 02:13:41,791
Stop talking back to me.

1633
02:13:41,875 --> 02:13:43,041
You forked tongue.

1634
02:13:44,041 --> 02:13:45,375
I said put down your sword.

1635
02:13:48,166 --> 02:13:49,041
Quick!

1636
02:13:50,833 --> 02:13:54,000
Six rounds left, I definitely won’t miss.

1637
02:14:11,833 --> 02:14:13,458
Come on!

1638
02:14:14,458 --> 02:14:15,583
Now!

1639
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,541
We're the BUs from Bang Na
No one bats an eye

1640
02:14:22,625 --> 02:14:23,791
We're…

1641
02:14:24,416 --> 02:14:25,958
You have some grits, scumbags.

1642
02:14:26,041 --> 02:14:31,000
Go and find some
Baihor bitter pills for your friend.

1643
02:14:32,125 --> 02:14:33,416
Go!

1644
02:14:47,375 --> 02:14:49,541
See you next album, man.
