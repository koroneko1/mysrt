1
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,458
Sairoong, have you seen

2
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,458
the Uranus clip on YouTube?

3
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,583
What clip?

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,833
The clip about Uranus. It's gone viral.

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,625
It's got over one million views now.

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,500
I haven't seen it yet. What is it about?

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,875
You probably think it's about aliens

8
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,833
but actually, it's not.

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,208
-I see.
-It has something to do with astrology.

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,291
This certain clip illustrates

11
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,125
how Uranus completes a revolution
around the sun

12
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,541
-once every seven years,
-I see.

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,291
and this has an effect on our lives.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,833
To put it simply,

15
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,333
-All right.
-the 7th year,

16
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,333
-then 14th year, 21st year,
-Okay.

17
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,375
and 28th year...

18
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,333
-Think along with me.
-Okay.

19
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,833
-The first seven years of our lives,
-Yes.

20
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,208
we stay at home.

21
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,500
We are children.

22
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,291
But when we reach seven years of age,
we go to school and enter first grade.

23
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,958
-Oh, I see.
-Life begins to change.

24
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,333
-Yes.
-Then from 7, you turn 14 years old.

25
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,166
-I see.
-What was being 14 years old like for you?

26
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,291
-Me?
-Did anything special happen?

27
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,500
When I was 14 years old...

28
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,458
I had my first crush.

29
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,958
Wow. When people turn 14,

30
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,958
-most of us hit puberty, right?
-Yes.

31
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,500
They start falling in love.

32
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,250
What about when you were 21?

33
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,708
When I was 21...

34
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,833
I had my fourth love.

35
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,916
Wow. You must have been quite hot.

36
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,500
URANUS' IMPACT ON EARTH

37
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,958
I DON'T KNOW ANY PLANET
THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON EARTH

38
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,208
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,125
I AM AT A TURNING POINT IN LIFE

40
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,625
WHY? DO YOU LIKE GUYS NOW?

41
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:09,500
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING US,
SO IT SHOULD BE WORTH IT

42
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,083
SINGLE

43
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,791
IN A RELATIONSHIP

44
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,708
AND ONE OTHER PERSON LIKES THIS

45
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,916
AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,208
AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THIS

47
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,375
AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE...

48
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,000
DAMN

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,416
WHO'S THE GIRL?

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,333
GOODNESS GRACIOUS

51
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,541
WHO'S THE BITCH? TELL ME NOW

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,125
I THINK IT'S MAY FROM CLASS TWO

53
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,083
MAY IS RUNNING FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT

54
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,583
I THINK IT'S MAY FROM CLASS TWO

55
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,875
I'm running for school president.
Candidate number two.

56
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:02,666
I am Maythawee Suwichakornkul.

57
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,750
-Do I have to say it again?
-Yes.

58
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,666
Okay.

59
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,291
I am Maythawee Suwichakornkul.

60
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,375
-Again?
-Yes.

61
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,708
I am Maythawee--

62
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,541
MAYBE IT'S PAT, THE CHEERLEADER?

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
OBSERVE CLOSELY, PUAN SERVED PAT FIRST

64
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,375
You're all clueless.

65
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,958
Just ask him.

66
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,291
IT'S DEFINITELY FOUR
FROM THE JAPANESE CLASS

67
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,958
I'M SURE IT'S MILK
IN TENTH GRADE CLASS ONE

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,416
PUAN IS IN A RELATIONSHIP

69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,583
MILK IS IN A RELATIONSHIP

70
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,958
THEY CHANGED STATUS AT THE SAME TIME

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,625
Shit!

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,833
Shit!

73
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,833
PLEASE CHECK OUT THE END OF THIS CLIP

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,416
SOONTORNPHU'S DAY

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,875
Please enjoy the show.

76
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,291
POETRY DAY 2012

77
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,166
-There are two microphones.
-Oh, my goodness.

78
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,375
DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T NOTICE THAT, PUAN?

79
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,625
WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO, MR. DETECTIVE?

80
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,500
TOPTAP HAS TAGGED YOU IN HIS PHOTO

81
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,833
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING A CRUSH
ON HER SINCE GRADE NINE?

82
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,708
WHAT'S GOING ON? TELL ME NOW

83
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,875
Hey, Puan changed his status
to "In a Relationship."

84
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,291
I heard it's Milk from tenth grade.

85
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,666
Milk the MC? She got to him first.

86
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,541
Do you remember Poetry Day?

87
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,083
Puan was rolling up the mic cord...

88
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,041
and his hand touched hers.

89
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,958
She didn't even say anything.
She gave him a big smile too.

90
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,041
He had a crush on her since ninth grade.

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,500
He always put away her mic.

92
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,583
Was that how he flirted with her?

93
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,500
But he rolled up the mic cord for me too!

94
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,750
Ngor, if I can't get him,
don't you even think about it.

95
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,541
Fine. I will just be one
of his Facebook fans.

96
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,083
Let's beat Milk up then.

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,416
No.

98
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,666
No one can have him.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,416
Only I can have him.

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,625
Do you want to beat me up too?

101
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,583
This has gone too far.

102
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,166
I better sneak a peek at Puan's Facebook.

103
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,833
She's Puan's girl, not My Girl anymore.

104
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,916
Do you need any help
with your mic today, sweetie?

105
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,041
Stop it.

106
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,500
Aren't you embarrassed?

107
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,541
Posting a clip

108
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
is better than typing.

109
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,000
How do you know people want to see it?

110
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,083
Look.

111
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,375
Here.

112
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,750
There are 2,000 students in this school.

113
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,125
So?

114
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,166
What? Look.

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,416
Don't you see?

116
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,291
There are over 800 views.

117
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,125
That's a lot, almost half of the school.

118
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,375
Okay, you nerd.

119
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,541
You don't need to tell them that

120
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,833
our hands touched and we smiled.

121
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,083
People might think I am easy.

122
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,791
I love you because...

123
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,166
-you are easy.
-You're crazy.

124
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,458
-Bitch.
-Let me clean your ear.

125
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,208
Is it itchy?

126
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,166
-I'll scratch for you.
-It hurts. Why did you kick me?

127
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,666
Milk.

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,875
Puan!

129
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,250
What the hell?

130
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,291
It's a shark.

131
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,750
Puan, take a photo.

132
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,375
Puan.

133
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,833
I like it.

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,666
To be honest,
you can't find it anywhere else.

135
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,708
The clothes are amazing. It really is.

136
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,791
I just went to Japan

137
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,750
-and it wasn't this pretty there.
-Miss...

138
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,750
Excuse me. I need to take a photo.

139
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,958
Yes?

140
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:20,708
Koy.

141
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:22,833
Pe.

142
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,333
Could you two please take a photo
with my girlfriend?

143
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,125
Don't you want a photo anymore?

144
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh, you two broke up.

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,416
-Milk, come out now. Milk.
-Goodbye.

146
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,583
Hello.

147
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,458
Hello. I'm on my way.

148
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,750
How was I supposed to know
they broke up already?

149
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,541
They broke up ages ago.

150
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,250
Wait.

151
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,416
Milk, wait.

152
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,291
Milk, put it down. Hang on.

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,333
Wait a second.

154
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
It's awesome. Give it a try.

155
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,333
Wait.

156
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,541
CAN WE EAT IT YET? IT'S MELTING

157
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
Just a second.

158
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,583
I want a picture before it melts.
You'll get to eat it soon.

159
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,791
It's perfect.

160
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,083
This will make
the popular page for sure. See?

161
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,291
Puan.

162
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,291
The drink.

163
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,625
What now?

164
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,333
-Hey, Milk.
-What?

165
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,375
Must you film this too?

166
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,208
Milk.

167
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,041
Must you film this too?

168
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,125
Do I look like myself?

169
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,875
This is even uglier than the clip.

170
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,458
Ouch!

171
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,166
That really hurts.

172
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,625
-Do I look like myself?
-Wow.

173
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,291
Are you an alien?

174
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,375
Puan.

175
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,333
Anyone view it
if you set it as public, right?

176
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,958
Yes.

177
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
Exactly!

178
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,291
So what?

179
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,291
I don't want others to see it.

180
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,500
Can you set it to private?

181
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,666
Hang on.

182
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,958
14 VIEWS

183
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,166
There are only 14 views.

184
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,750
Nobody is interested.

185
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,583
I watched it five times.
You watched it five times.

186
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,416
The other four were probably accidental.

187
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,041
Look.

188
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,791
Someone left a comment.

189
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,041
TWO COMMENTS

190
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,791
SHE'S SO CUTE
WHAT SCHOOL DOES SHE GO TO?

191
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,791
THAT WAS GREAT

192
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,750
Wow.

193
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,458
You're popular now.

194
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,166
Set it to private now.

195
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,750
Okay, sure.

196
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,208
PRIVATE

197
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,458
Done.

198
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,416
WHERE SHOULD I GO ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

199
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,500
It's soccer time. Come on.

200
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:56,041
WHERE IS THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE
FOR COUPLES ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

201
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,916
PHU CHI FAH IS ROMANTIC

202
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,291
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT

203
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,416
A bracelet for your girlfriend?

204
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,666
How many types do you have?

205
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,458
All types. Which would you like?

206
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,583
A good quality or a normal quality one?

207
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,333
IT'S CROWDED THERE
YOU BETTER TO GO DOI ANG KHANG

208
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,916
A ten-baht lighter?

209
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,416
You again?

210
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,500
ARE THERE OTHER PLACES NEARBY?

211
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,583
SANTORINI PARK IS A HONEYMOONER'S DREAM

212
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,791
SANTORINI PARK

213
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,958
IS THERE A THEME PARK TOO? WHERE IS IT?

214
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,833
CHA-AM CITY, IT'S ONLY
A TWO-HOUR DRIVE FROM BANGKOK

215
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,708
I'M ONLY IN ELEVENTH GRADE
DO YOU HAVE ANYWHERE IN BANGKOK?

216
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,583
WHAT ABOUT ROD FAI PARK?

217
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,416
IT'S ROMANTIC AND CLOSE TO THE SKY TRAIN

218
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,625
Milk, give me a smile. One, two, three.

219
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,875
Good.

220
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,375
-Milk--
-Puan.

221
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,416
A lizard!

222
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,708
Oh, my.

223
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,958
-Come here.
-Are you petting it?

224
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,166
It's kind of cute.

225
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,791
Okay, that's cool.

226
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,666
Pretty...

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,541
ugly.

228
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:10,916
Pretty...

229
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,166
ugly.

230
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,666
Pretty ugly.

231
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,083
Puan, stop filming. Hurry up.

232
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,000
-Hey, Milk.
-What?

233
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,583
Why did you turn around?

234
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,916
The scene was so beautiful.
Can we start all over?

235
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,458
-Can we start here?
-The scenery over there is better.

236
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,625
I have to change the lens too.

237
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,791
Do you have to?

238
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,791
It was a bit narrow.

239
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,750
Please, start there.

240
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,291
Where?

241
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,583
Over there.

242
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,083
Fine.

243
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,375
PRETTY UGLY.MOV

244
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,166
That's so cool, Puan.

245
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,041
You're so in love. How cute.

246
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,500
Your MV is cool too.

247
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,666
If you're free, you can direct my MV.

248
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,958
This kid is so talented.

249
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,333
Talented...

250
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,500
PRETTY UGLY

251
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,458
LANGUAGE PLAZA

252
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,291
Please give a round of applause

253
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,625
for Puan.

254
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,625
I've seen your MV already

255
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,916
and I want to say that...

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
it's dope!

257
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,041
Super cute!

258
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,083
Awesome!

259
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,041
Yes.

260
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,916
Yes, speaking. Okay.

261
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,708
GMM Grammy just called.
They want me to direct an MV for them.

262
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,083
I did not direct Joke So Cool.

263
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,166
Joke So Cool directed me.

264
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,208
Today, we've got a new MV.

265
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,333
It's very special
because the director is only 17 years old

266
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,416
and is currently in eleventh grade.

267
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,833
Let me ask you.
Did you do all this for fame?

268
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,625
Or are you jealous
of other Internet stars?

269
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,791
Like Put-Dejudom, Kome-Pakarang, Chef Mee?

270
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,208
Listen, Woody.

271
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,041
If I wasn't famous,

272
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,958
you wouldn't have invited me here, right?

273
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm kidding.

274
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,583
Ma'am, what is that noise?

275
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,125
Ask Puan!

276
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,041
Puan.

277
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:32,958
Puan.

278
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,333
-Puan.
-Puan.

279
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,625
-Puan.
-Puan.

280
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,916
-Puan.
-Puan.

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,250
-Puan.
-Puan.

282
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,333
PUAN, WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?

283
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,666
DID YOU GET DIARRHEA?

284
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,916
PRETTY UGLY.MOV

285
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,000
Pretty...

286
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,583
ugly.

287
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,166
Pretty...

288
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,375
ugly.

289
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,333
BUT I...

290
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,125
I worked all night for this.

291
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,375
Don't you have anything to say?

292
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,666
It's good.

293
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,500
Just good?

294
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,083
It's better than
you filming me pick my nose.

295
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,750
But it's just "good" for you though.

296
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,291
IF FACEBOOK HAD A "LOVE" BUTTON,
I'D CLICK IT A MILLION TIMES

297
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,375
What's up?

298
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,708
I was just thinking of you.

299
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,666
Puan.

300
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,458
I showed my mom the clip.

301
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,916
-She scolded me.
-What?

302
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,583
Why?

303
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,875
She asked

304
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,791
why I didn't tell her

305
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,625
and if I got paid for it.

306
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,833
Geez.

307
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,625
I almost had a heart attack.

308
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,708
-You scared me.
-She thought it was a real music video.

309
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,791
You should quit school
and do this for a living.

310
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,625
I'm not that good.

311
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,250
-I still have a lot to learn.
-It's so cool.

312
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,666
Believe me, everyone will love it.

313

314

Thank you for making this for me.

315
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,375
I'll head to bed.

316
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,791
Tomorrow, we won't see each other.
Don't miss me too much.

317
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:28,875
See you on Sunday.

318
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,375
Okay, bye.

319
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,791

00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,041
There are 11,000 views now.

337
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,625
People on Twitter like it too.

338
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,625
My followers are going up by 300 now.

339
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,625
There's just one problem.

340
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,333
There is one dislike on YouTube.

341
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,916
What the hell is wrong with that person?

342
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,958
You can just turn it off
if you don't like it, right?

343
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,875
Why would you click "dislike"?

344
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,916
These people probably sit at home
staring at their shit.

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,416
I clicked it.

346
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,208
Why?

347
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,166
Didn't you say you made it just for me?

348
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,583
Yes, I did it for you, Milk.

349
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,208
I didn't make it for anyone else.

350
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,333
-Why did you post it?
-What?

351
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,541
Everyone else liked it. Except you.

352
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,500
Do you care more about those 10,000 views?

353
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,458
Wait, Milk.

354
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,958
What's wrong with you?

355
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:44,083
Of course, I care about you more.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it.

356
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:45,416
Take it down then.

357
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,708
You can't, right?

358
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,708
Why do I have to take it down?

359
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,625
EDIT PROFILE PHOTO

360
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:13,958
UPLOAD NEW PHOTO

361
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,708
"Your degree of bliss while in love

362
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:45,375
in retrospect will be the degree of sorrow
you feel but multiplied many times."

363
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,291
Sathu.

364
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,041
Did you break up with Puan?

365
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,500
No.

366
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:57,041
All his Facebook posts
sound like he's dying.

367
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,541
What a wimp.

368
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,250
He even posted Buddha quotes.

369
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,458
Just click "like" and he will feel better.

370
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,833
Why are you so mad at him anyway?

371
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,500
It was good.

372
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,041
Pretty Ugly music video, you know?

373
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,833
I wish I had one.

374
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,500
If he didn't love you,
he wouldn't have made it.

375
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,041
Actually, I am not that mad.

376
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,958
I'm just annoyed that he's so cocky.

377
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,458
You are just jealous
of the 10,000 likes he got.

378
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,125
No, I'm not.

379
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,666
You know, I clicked "like" too.

380
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,041
Don't be jealous of me.

381
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,291
Oh, god. Can you do it again?

382
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,625
Grab mine too.

383
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,708
Your name is Milk but you've got no milk.

384
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,041
What about you? Have you got any?

385
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:01,166
THE WATER THAT RUNS THROUGH
SHOWER IS JUST LIKE RAIN...

386
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:05,291
HOW ARE YOU? ARE YOU DEAD YET?

387
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,958
Puan, why aren't you wearing a shirt?

388
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,583
-Oh, no.
-Puan, why are you naked?

389
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:32,750
How's this shirt? Do you like it?

390
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:37,250
I heard you are a devout Buddhist now.

391
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,250
Yes.

Are you happy now?

394
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,666
Not really.

395
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,333
Why not?

396
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,041
I am sad

397
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,541
that you are mad at me.

398
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,083
You're being too extra.

399
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,291
Stop being sad.

400
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,750
I will

401
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,958
sing you a song.

402
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,250
Can you play it now?

403
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:27,833
Yes.

404
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,875
Goodnight, Puan.

405
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,958
Why did you do that?

406
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,875
What are you talking about?

407
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:45,333
I'm talking about this stupid clip.

408
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,416
I played it for you only.
Why did you upload it?

409
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,791
I was happy that you played it for me.

410
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:55,541
I posted it as a thank you present.

411
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,916
Did I do something wrong?

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,625
Come in person if you want to thank me.

413
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,791
You can call me.

414
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,083
We can talk via Skype.

415
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,833
Look how inappropriate my clothes are.

416
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,458
Take it down right now.

417
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,833
But all the comments are positive.

418
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,541
BEAUTIFUL VOICE

419
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,166
SHE'S ADORABLE AND HER VOICE IS GREAT

420
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,375
OFFBEAT BUT WHO CARES?
HER FACE IS PRETTY

421
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,458
PLAY A SEXY SONG NEXT TIME

422
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,708
SO SLUTTY
SHE IS CUTE

423
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,416
AT 1:45 TIME MARK, I GOT TURNED ON

424
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,500
Take it down right now.

425
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,875
I'M OUT OF JUICE BECAUSE OF HER

426
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,333
I said, take it down.

Are you listening to me?

430
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,916
We can talk after you take it down.

431
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:11,708
Puan!

432
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,583
All right, Milk.

433
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,416
I took it down.

434
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,166
DELETED

435
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:35,541
I'm hungry.

436
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,666
Milk, wait.

437
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,041
Milk.

438
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,208
Wait.

439
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,375
I already took it down.
What else do you want?

440
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,083
The damage has already been done, Puan.

441
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:01,708
Then

442
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,583
what do you want me to do?

443
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,083
Ask the people on the internet.

444
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,791
What if I stop using Facebook,

445
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,208
and YouTube?

446
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,875
Will you stop being mad at me?

447
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,375
Please?

448
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,416
Milk.

449
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,458
You're so cute.

450
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,083
Fuck you.

451
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,458
THE OLD CLIP WAS DELETED
SO I REPOSTED THE CLIP I SAVED

452
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,416
TO SHARE HER CUTENESS WITH THE WORLD

453
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,000
THIS WILL BE MY LAST STATUS UPDATE

454
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,208
GOODBYE

455
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,375
Hello.

456
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,041
I'm Puan.

457
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,416
I'm the one who posted the clip
of my girlfriend playing the song

458
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,958
"You are the Gift"
on ukelele a few days ago.

459
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,208
After I posted the clip,

460
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,208
there were some comments

461
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,166
that I didn't expect,

462
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,291
and my girlfriend didn't like them.

463
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,625
So she told me to take it down.

464
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,791
And I did.

465
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,291
But there were some people

466
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,500
who downloaded the clip

467
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:40,875
and reposted it.

468
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,458
That's why the clip is still on YouTube.

469
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:45,958
I tried to contact

470
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,208
the person who posted it

471
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,416
but couldn't reach him.

472
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,000
I tried to call Milk,

473
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,458
but I couldn't reach her either.

474
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:03,500
She probably

475
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,916
doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

476
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,833
I made this clip

477
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,875
because I want to apologize
to my girlfriend.

478
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,458
And I think this is
the only way to do it. 

479
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,208
This clip is not meant to be shared

480
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,500
because I only want

481
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,583
one person to see it.

482
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,041
I WISH HIS GIRLFRIEND COULD SEE IT

483
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,541
That one person is

484
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,916
Milk, my girlfriend.

485
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,291
Milk.

486
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:41,541
IS THIS AN ADVERTISEMENT?

487
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,625
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,958
Everything was my fault.

489
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,333
You don't have to stop being mad at me.

490
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,750
Please give me

491
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,208
another chance.

492
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,208
WHY ARE YOU APOLOGIZING TO A COMPUTER?

493
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,791
WHY SAY ALL THIS TO THE INTERNET?

494
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,375
IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD BE APOLOGIZING
IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE

495
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,041
I'M IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE NOW

496
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,666
THANK YOU, EVERYONE

497
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,375
Milk.

498
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,541
Milk.

499
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,125
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,083
Milk.

501
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,375
About the clip,

502
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,875
I will track down
and delete those remaining ones.

503
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,625
My friend is an expert on programming.

504
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,541
If I post anything again,

505
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,708
I will ask you first, all right?

506
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:09,208
PUAN, THAT'S ENOUGH

507
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,041
I WISH HIS GIRLFRIEND COULD SEE IT

508
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,541
I ALREADY APOLOGIZED,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T COME OUT

509
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,791
SHE SENT ME A TEXT SAYING "THAT'S ENOUGH"
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

510
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,916
NO MESSAGES

511
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,458
NO MESSAGES

512
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,250
You asked people on the internet
what you should do next.

513
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,750
I don't think
you need to do anything anymore.

514
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,583
Feel free to do whatever you want.

515
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,166
Post whatever you want.

516
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,625
You'll be fine without me.

517
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,541
You have tons of people
who love you out there.

518
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,791
YOU ARE THE GIFT

519
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,958
This looks good.

520
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,708
I want to eat a watermelon.

521
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,833
Stop spinning so hard.

522
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,083
-You can stop filming.
-Why?

523
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,291
This is

524
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,291
our first date after Valentine's Day.

525
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,416
I want the world to know

526
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,291
that I love Milk.

527
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,333
I love Milk!

528
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,791
Milk!

529
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,333
I love you.

530
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,416
If that wasn't enough, 

531
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,333
you can replay it yourself.

532
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,750
Did you take my phone?

533
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,208
I just want to say

534
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,958
the only person who can make me smile

535
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:33,958
is you, Milk.

536
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,375
He's here.

537
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,166
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

538
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:30,458
Jon, come out and talk to me.

539
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,000
Jon.

540
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,250
Jon.

541
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:43,791
Jon, come out.

542
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,291
Jon.

543
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:21,458
Everyone, welcome to
the Back of House Tour.

544
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,416
In a minute,
you will get to closely observe

545
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,416
how marine creatures are taken care of
here in Siam Ocean World.

546
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,291
Jon!

547
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,625
Jon!

548
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,458
Jon!

549
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,583
How are you?

550
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,375
Please return to your group?

551
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,708
We must go as a group.
Follow everyone else.

552
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,375
It's me, Mam.

553
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:04,458
Who?

554
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,291
Do you really not recognize me?

555
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,041
I'm a superstar.

556
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,166
Bamrung, it's all right.

557
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,166
She's my friend. I'll take care of her.

558
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:21,708
All right?

559
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,041
Jon.

560
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,583
What time will you be off?

561
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:29,708
Let's go eat.

562
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,750
It's been a while.
We've got so much to catch up on.

563
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,916
If you're here to talk about the movie,

564
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,666
I've already talked to the director.

565
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm not taking the role.

566
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,166
You should go.

567
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,458
Jon.

568
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,416
Don't be like this.

569
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,708
Do you have any idea how hard it was
to get a hold of you?

570
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,833
You wouldn't come out to see me.

571
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,083
I called so many times
but you wouldn't pick up.

572
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,791
I don't pick up calls from strangers.

573
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,958
Am I a stranger to you now?

574
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,916
Why are you here again?

575
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,625
To get my stuff.

576
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,791
SEA YOU SCRIPT
JON

577
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,666
SEA YOU SCRIPT
MAM

578
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:16,958
Have you decided?

579
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,416
Is it going to be the rich playboy
or that lame singer?

580
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,875
SUPERSTAR GOSSIP

581
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,666
NO CLOSURE, LOVE TRIANGLE

582
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,083
If the old one was good,

583
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,041
I wouldn't have to find a new guy.

584
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,333
No.

585
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,458
Oh, no.

586
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,958
Shit.

587
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:18,166
Excuse me. It's nine o'clock.
We are already closed.

588
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,333
Oh, my friend is in the restroom.

589
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,625
Jon.

590
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,583
You, again?

591
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,833
Doesn't your boyfriend mind
when you stalk men like this?

592
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:39,958
Me?

593
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:41,666
No one would dare to.

594
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,291
Jon.

595
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,541
Jon, you haven't answered whether
you will be in the movie Sea You.

596
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,125
Nobody's going to watch this movie.

597
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,833
The first one was seven years ago.

598
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:54,750
-No one even remembers it.
-Are you crazy?

599
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,666
It made 100 million baht.
No one would forget that.

600
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,125
I think everyone's waiting for the

601
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,416
sequel. Please?

602
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,375
Please?

603
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,083
Can you take a good look at me first?

604
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,291
I don't think you've changed that much.

605
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,375
I know now

606
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,000
why you can't be with anyone.

607
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,333
It's because
you only think about yourself.

608
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:39,041
KAJON SUWANNAMED FROM SEA YOU

609
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,875
And those are the nominees for

610
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,916
"Best Rising Actor" of the year.

611
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,500
And now, please welcome

612
00:50:47,583 --> 00:50:51,958
last year's winner, Mr. Jack Chalermpol.

613
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,416
He will announce
this year's Best Rising Actor.

614
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,750
It's an honor to have him here tonight.

615
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:06,083
And the award
for Best Rising Actor goes to...

616
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:14,125
my beloved brother,

617
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,083
Jon, Kajon Suwannamed.

618
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,333
Congratulations to Jon.

619
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,125
Please give a small speech for us tonight.

620
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,333
Thank you for this award.

621
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,208
This movie

622
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,125
helped me to get to know a lot of people.

623
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,958
I met this woman while filming.

624
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,708
I loved her very much.

625
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,833
But now,

626
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,000
she has become a slut.

627
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,708
I don't get it.

628
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,041
The more famous, the sluttier she got.

629
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,625
Since you want to break up,

630
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,458
let's just announce it here.

631
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,208
That bitch and I

632
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,416
are over.

633
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,458
Now that

634
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:21,000
everyone knows about our real score,

635
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,541
you are free to do whatever you want.

636
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,666
Go.

637
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,541
Go with him.

638
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,000
I've cleared the path for you.

639
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,583
Jon, come on. Don't do this. Calm down.

640
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:36,041
-Are you happy now?
-Jon, many people are here.

641
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,916
It's not your business!

642
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:50,791
All right. The Dive Communication Show

643
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,666
has come to an end.

644
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,750
Please give a round of applause to Jon.

645
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,333
Thank you.

646
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:03,041
Does anyone have any questions?

647
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,458
Do you want to ask him something?

648
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,291
Ask him something.

649
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,208
Why me? I don't want to.

650
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,333
-You ask.
-Why?

651
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:17,083
I'll do it.

652
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:19,833
Jon.

653
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:22,000
We need to talk to Director Ton.

654
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,250
Everyone's waiting for your answer.

655
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,208
They'll have a press conference soon.

656
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,250
Go home, Mam. We'll talk later.

657
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,875
Kids.

658
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,583
Did you know that I and Jon

659
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,416
used to be in a movie together?

660
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,250
It was very popular.

661
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,166
Raise your hand if you have seen it.

662
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,666
If not, it's okay.

663
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:59,541
Because there will be a sequel soon.

664
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:02,250
But you won't get to see it

665
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,750
if he doesn't come out
of the tank to talk to me.

666
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:07,250
So let's call out

667
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,625
his name

668
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,583
and clap all together, okay?

669
00:55:10,666 --> 00:55:12,666
One, two, three.

670
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,458
-Jon!
-Jon!

671
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,333
-Louder!
-Jon!

672
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,208
-That's great. Louder!
-Jon!

673
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,708
-Jon!
-Jon!

674
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,666
In the previous one, it ended
with the couple falling in love, right?

675
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,500
This sequel starts with us being a couple

676
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,333
fighting and breaking up.

677
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,958
"Will they get back together again?

678
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,708
Stick around to find out in...

679
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,833
Sea You Again

680
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:41,416
part two."

681
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,541
I remember the synopsis that Ton sent me.

682
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,958
Oh, no.

683
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,208
I like it.

684
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,208
I think the story has matured.

685
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,083
In this sequel,

686
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:10,166
there will be no senseless fighting.

687
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,458
No revenge.

688
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,125
No unpleasantness.

689
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,666
It will be all about love

690
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,416
and forgiveness.

691
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:28,250
BITCH

692
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,708
We can't be in this movie together.

693
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,833
What is your reason
for not taking the role?

694
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,458
Is it because you're fat?

695
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,125
Jon, you can lose weight
and look good again in no-time.

696
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:44,708
Oh, I know.

697
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,416
Your girlfriend won't let you
work with your ex, right?

698
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,458
Is she afraid an old flame might reignite?

699
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:52,083
Tell her not to worry.

700
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:54,666
I won't steal you from her.

701
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,041
Don't tell me you are still single.

702
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,916
Single or not, it doesn't matter.

703
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,166
I won't star in it.

704
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,083
Jon.

705
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,333
Didn't you say
you loved this film so much?

706
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,416
Jon.

707
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,916
You're still cute.

708
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,916
Tomorrow, let's go to Ton's office.

709
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,916
See you at ten o'clock, okay?

710
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,458
Are you here for the casting?

711
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,250
I'm here to see Director Ton.

712
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:36,125
He isn't available.
He's casting actresses.

713
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,583
What movie is the casting for?

714
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,625
Sea You Again.

715
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:46,625
For which part?

716
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,458
We're casting for the lead actress.

717
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:52,125
For the lead actress, why?

718
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,083
Because we still have not casted

719
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,041
the lead actress, that's why.

720
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,166
That's not possible!

721
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,750
Are you here to audition or not?

722
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:02,041
If so,

723
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,791
then fill out the application form.

724
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,666
Here's the script.

725
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:07,666
I will call you

726
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,125
when it's your turn.

727
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,625
SEA YOU AGAIN

728
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:28,750
Jon.

729
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:32,833
The press will ask you about
being nominated for Best Rising Actor.

730
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,208
Do you remember your answers?

731
00:59:36,791 --> 00:59:38,000
Just stick to the script.

732
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,583
-Okay.
-Great.

733
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,833
Babe.

734
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,666
The script is very good, right?

735
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,041
No, I won't let you take it.

736
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,583
Why not?

737
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,500
What kind of a movie
has a kissing scene on every page?

738
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,375
Can you be reasonable?

739
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,750
I am being reasonable.
You're being childish.

740
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,375
Why? I want to star in it.

741
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,500
The director is very talented.
He received so many awards.

742
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:01,583
Let him be.

743
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:04,250
Deaw Patcharawit is the actor.
Don't you know that he's a prick?

744
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,791
His nickname is Tongue-zilla.

745
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,666
So what?

746
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:12,208
You know about it and so that's why
you wanted that role, right?

747
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,291
That's sick.
Is that all you can think about?

748
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:17,833
Mam, we heard that you will be starring

749
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:19,916
with Deaw Patcharawit, is it true?

750
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,333
Yes, it's true.

751
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,208
Jon, why are you letting Mam work

752
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,375
with the actor known as "Tongue-zilla"?

753
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,125
It's her career,

754
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,208
her lips, her tongue.

755
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,583
It has nothing to do with me.

756
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,500
Excuse me.

757
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,333
One more question, please.

758
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:42,583
He has to get ready. We are sorry.

759
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:45,750
What's wrong? Why did Jon just walk out?

760
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:48,166
-What's going on?
-Is something wrong?

761
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:51,291
SEA YOU

762
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,541
SEA YOU

763
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:08,208
Sorry, the number you have dialed
isn't in service.

764
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,666
Hello. I'm here to audition
for Sea You Again.

765
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,083
-Please read the script.
-Okay.

766
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Thank you.

767
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,250
Peak!

768
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,291
-Noona!
-Peak!

769
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,291
Oh, my god! How are you? Long time no see.

770
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:27,500
You're still slim as always.

771
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:28,708
You, too.

772
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,000
I miss you so much. How are you?
Are you here to audition for the role too?

773
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,125
Yes, I really want this role.

774
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,583
I'm sure whoever gets this role
will be famous.

775
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:45,583
How come the previous couple
won't star in this sequel?

776
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:47,541
It's been seven years.

777
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,791
Nobody knows where the lead actor is.

778
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,333
But I think

779
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,333
their time has passed.

780
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:59,500
The girl is not famous anymore.
Now she's just a supporting actress.

781
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,291
If she didn't spread her legs so often,

782
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,833
she wouldn't even make the news.

783
01:02:07,666 --> 01:02:10,208
I've never watched this movie before.

784
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:13,250
What is it about?
I was only in fifth grade then.

785
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,416
Well...

786
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,541
If I remember correctly,

787
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,875
it's about two strangers
who went on a trip together

788
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:22,708
and agreed not to tell
each other what their name is.

789
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,583
-Really?
-Yes.

790
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,166
What a cool plot!

791
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:29,208
-She sounds easy.
-If you really don't know it,

792
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,416
it would best to just shut up.

793
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,500
It's about two people who hate each other

794
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,791
but are forced to be together.

795
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,541
CAN TWO PEOPLE WHO HATE
EACH OTHER, FALL IN LOVE?

796
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:46,583
-Mam, it's the trailer. Come here.
-Is it here?

797
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,166
The highlight
of the Music Festival this year

798
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,500
is Zea from the band, To Die For

799
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:55,250
featuring with the boys from F14.

800
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,666
ZEA
THE ROCK STAR

801
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:06,916
We are

802
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,541
To Die For!

803
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,791
RANG
THE BOY BAND DANCER

804
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,708
THE LEAST FAMOUS ONE AMONGST ALL

805
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,583
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
WHO MISSED THE FLIGHT TOGETHER

806
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,541
-How much is it to go to that island?
-Hey, Panda Eyes!

807
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:39,583
Are you sure you want to go there?
It's dangerous. You shouldn't.

808
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:40,666
It's easy for you to say.

809
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,416
You are just one of the F14 gay boys.

810
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,083
If you go missing,
nobody will even notice.

811
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:47,416
"It's dangerous. You shouldn't."

812
01:03:49,416 --> 01:03:50,791
"It's easy for you to say.

813
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,375
You are just one of the F14 gay boys.

814
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,500
If you go missing,
nobody will even notice."

815
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:57,125
Did you just call me gay?

816
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,666
-I'll show you my manhood.
-No.

817
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,833
Miss.

818
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:07,541
I thought you were dead.

819
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,083
It seems like

820
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:11,625
we are the only ones here.

821
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,625
Why am I trapped on an island
with a pathetic guy like you?

822
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,833
How can you love me?

823
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,041
You hate my guts.

824
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,791
You don't even know

825
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,291
my band's songs.

826
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,958
I just know that

827
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,208
when I am with you,

828
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,916
I am so damn happy.

829
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,375
Is this what they call love?

830
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,583
When we get to the shore,

831
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,041
will we hate each other again?

832
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,041
TWO PEOPLE WHO HATE EACH OTHER...

833
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,458
ARE ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE

834
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,875
SEA YOU

835
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,458
CASTING FOR SEA YOU AGAIN

836
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,541
-This way.
-Okay.

837
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:31,000
-Your audition went very well.
-Really?

838
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,625
-Thank you so much, Ice.
-Thank you, Director Ton.

839
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:37,208
-I will--
-Director Ton.

840
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:38,791
Why are you holding castings?

841
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:40,291
What about me and Jon?

842
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,916
If Jon isn't the lead,
then you can't be the lead either.

843
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,291
But I found Jon already.
He is on his way here.

844
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:51,125
Mam, if Jon was interested,
he would have been here already.

845
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,666
-I'll leave now--
-Director Ton.

846
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,208
Let's do this then.

847
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,208
Well...

848
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,666
Give me

849
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,208
the lead actress role.
You can cast the lead actor.

850
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:04,666
All right?

851
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,000
You don't need to cast the lead actress.

852
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,250
Listen, Mam.

853
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:11,083
You don't get it,

854
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,625
do you?

855
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,666
You and Jon are meant to star together.

856
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,166
Either you star together

857
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,041
or you don't at all.

858
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,333
Do you understand?

859
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:22,708
Have you watched Full House?

860
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,916
They're about to have a sequel.

861
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,291
Without Rain...

862
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,541
Without Rain,

863
01:06:27,666 --> 01:06:29,416
who would Song Hye-kyo star with?

864
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:33,083
Will she star with Jang Geun-suk?

865
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,041
Jang Geun-suk and Song Hye-kyo?

866
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:39,291
That won't work. Do you understand?

867
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,291
You are watching

868
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,375
the Ocean Walker show.

869
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:00,916
If anybody is interested
in an underwater walk,

870
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,291
please contact our staff.

871
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:11,083
The next story is about the movie
we've all have been waiting for

872
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:13,958
Sea You Again.

873
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:18,458
That's right. After an exhausting search
for a lead couple,

874
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:22,208
everyone's been guessing
who would they be.

875
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,666
Finally, the next 100 million baht
box office film

876
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:28,000
has got its new leading stars.

877
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:32,208
Peach Pachara and Ice Preechaya

878
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,625
will be the new starring couple.

879
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:38,375
The director said that

880
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,708
he changed the main cast
to keep the story fresh.

881
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:45,000
The script was also updated
to make the main cast appeal younger.

882
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,708
Cut!

883
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,791
Get ready for the next scene.

884
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,666
Hurry up. The sun will set soon.

885
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:42,458
Cut. I said cut!

886
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,916
I thought I was going to die down there.

887
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,708
I won't let anything happen to you.

888
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:50,791
Really?

889
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,958
Here.

890
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,166
Thank you.

891
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:51,416
After we finish filming, what will you do?

892
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,333
I will go back
to get my marine biology degree.

893
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,333
What about you?

894
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,541
-I'll probably audition for a movie.
-Again?

895
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:08,666
Do you like being an actress?

896
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,041
It's my life and soul.

897
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,333
It makes me very happy.

898
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,833
Especially,
when people love and admire me,

899
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,250
it feels really great.

900
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,041
Don't you like being an actor?

901
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,083
I don't like acting.

902
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,541
Why did you accept this movie then?

903
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,208
Because of you.

904
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:19,458
After filming is done,
will we still see each other every day?

905
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,208
Of course.

906
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:32,958
Couples are supposed to
see each other every day.

907
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,166
How could he do that?

908
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,333
Is he crazy?

909
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,500
How can Sea You not be starred by us, Jon?

910
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:16,666
But I think we still have time.

911
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,083
It's not too late.

912
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,750
Director Ton will give us a chance, Jon.

913
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,541
Let me be straightforward.

914
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,166
This movie is my last chance.

915
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,625
I want to be a star again.

916
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:18,958
Your line starts here.

917
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:22,750
The highlighted ones are mine.

918
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:25,291
In this scene, the couple

919
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,291
already broke up

920
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:28,666
and they happened to meet again.

921
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,333
Let's pretend

922
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,916
that we are stuck on an island,

923
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:37,208
surrounded by fish

924
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:38,791
swimming all around us.

925
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:43,583
Are you ready?

926
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,541
Yes.

927
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:54,083
"How long has it been
since we last saw each other?"

928
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,541
"Since the concert last year,

929
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,500
when you wrote that song to curse me
and sang it on stage."

930
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:04,041
"You only remember
the bad memories, right?"

931
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,916
"Were there any good ones?"

932
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:07,541
"I'm sorry.

933
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:12,208
I am sorry for acting like a fool
and making you sad."

934
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:13,708
"But you were like that...

935
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,458
because of me too."

936
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:21,958
"So how have you been?"

937
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,416
"I've been good.

938
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,875
You were not there to nag me
for waking up late,

939
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:34,583
for leaving my clothes on the floor,

940
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:37,500
for not eating on time,

941
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,375
and for not putting lotion on before bed.

942
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:44,416
It was great."

943
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:05,208
"Do you think about those things?"

944
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:06,916
"Don't you?"

945
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,291
"No.

946
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:18,583
Because I never felt...

947
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:21,041
like you were gone."

948
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,291
"Rang.

949
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,166
Do you think
we can love each other again?"

950
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:42,083
ZEA: DO YOU THINK WE CAN LOVE
EACH OTHER AGAIN?

951
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:49,083
According to the script,
Rang has to kiss Zea.

952
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:56,291
RANG BENDS DOWN TO KISS ZEA

953
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,250
Gosh, can you kiss

954
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:17,583
like two people who are actually in love?

955
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:21,291
If you guys still can't kiss,
I will show you how to do it.

956
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:23,833
Jon.

957
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:26,708
I'm begging you.

958
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,291
Please focus.

959
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:32,083
Let's do it in one take.

960
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,250
Hey, try looking at each other.

961
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:35,541
Stare into each other's eyes.

962
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,041
Yes, like that.

963
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:40,666
Now, try to imagine what Zea and Rang

964
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,208
have gone through together

965
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,375
and their relationship.

966
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,791
They won't see each other again.

967
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,166
Jon.

968
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:33,125
Think about Rang and Zea.

969
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,333
Think about when they loved each other.

970
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,333
Think about when they fought so much...

971
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,833
that they had to break up.

972
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:49,666
Think about when they were alone.

973
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,500
It must have been lonely.

974
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,583
But now,

975
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,250
they ran into each other again.

976
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,958
"How long has it been
since we last saw each other?"

977
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:13,583
Well.

978
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,083
"Since the concert last year,

979
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,250
when you wrote that song to curse me
and sang it on stage."

980
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:24,208
"You only remember
the bad memories, right?"

981
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:26,541
"Were there any good ones?"

982
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,708
I'm sorry.

983
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,875
I am sorry for making you sad.

984
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:39,458
I was stupid.

985
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,583
Why did I have to be so damn jealous?

986
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:47,166
That was bad for us.

987
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:50,708
I've blamed myself every day.

988
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,125
Why did I have to be such an asshole?

989
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:58,291
I am sorry.

990
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:13,041
"But you were like that...

991
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,333
because of me too."

992
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:24,291
I'm sorry.

993
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,708
"So how have you been?"

994
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:47,708
"I've been good.

995
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,250
You were not there to nag me

996
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,833
for waking up late,

997
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,375
for leaving my clothes on the floor,

998
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,416
for not eating on time,

999
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,666
and for not putting lotion on before bed.

1000
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,500
It was great."

1001
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,708
"Do you think about those things?"

1002
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:21,833
"Don't you?"

1003
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,416
"No.

1004
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:32,375
Because I never felt like you were gone."

1005
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:59,916
"Do you think
we can love each other again?"

1006
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,833
Do you think we can love each other again?

1007
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,041
That was amazing.

1008
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,583
You've made Rang and Zea

1009
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,083
come back to life again.

1010
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,750
But...

1011
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:54,541
you haven't been
watching the news, have you?

1012
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:03,708
That was the end

1013
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,500
of the Dive Communication Show.

1014
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:10,083
Please give a round of applause to Jon.

1015
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:13,625
Does anyone
have any questions for our diver?

1016
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:27,750
Jon.

1017
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,666
You already knew they changed
the leading cast, right?

1018
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,458
You knew I wouldn't get
the role anyway, right?

1019
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,791
Then why did you rehearse
the script with me?

1020
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:50,416
Answer me.

1021
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,708
Is something wrong with the mic?

1022
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:58,708
Excuse me, Jim.

1023
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:02,625
I'm Jon.

1024
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:03,666
Jon.

1025
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:06,083
Do I make you nervous?

1026
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:09,041
No.

1027
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,458
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

1028
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:17,583
Then, you've never hugged a girl before.

1029
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,541
I met you.

1030
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,875
I got to know you.

1031
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,083
I loved you.

1032
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:11,958
She has become a slut.

1033
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:15,958
I fought with you.

1034
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,041
Ouch!

1035
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:20,416
I broke up with you.

1036
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:27,916
I hated you

1037
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,916
because of this movie.

1038
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:37,125
The reason I didn't want
to be in this movie

1039
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:42,291
was because I didn't want
to love you again.

1040
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,708
I understand.

1041
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,791
I'm glad

1042
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:05,625
I got to share that moment with you again.

1043
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,791
Thank you, Jon.

1044
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,291
Mam.

1045
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,041
"Do you think

1046
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,458
we can love each other again?"

1047
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:49,583
"Do you think...

1048
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,041
-we can love each other again?"
-Jon.

1049
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:05,041
Isn't that supposed to be my line?

1050
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:58,166
One, two.

1051
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:02,583
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1052
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:10,666
One early morning,

1053
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,208
a gun

1054
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,833
was about to take

1055
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,500
a woman's life.

1056
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:22,208
Meanwhile, she tried to figure out

1057
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:24,333
how to start her life over again

1058
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:25,958
after the gun went off.

1059
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:27,750
Bang.

1060
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:30,791
Raise your hands in the air

1061
01:29:30,875 --> 01:29:34,125
and let me hear some noise!

1062
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:43,125
This is the Bangkok Giant Marathon
for everyone who loves to run.

1063
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:46,000
Please make some noise
and let me see a show of hands.

1064
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:50,166
We are here to welcome
all the Bangkok Giant Marathon runners.

1065
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,208
Please make some noise
when they reach the goal.

1066
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:03,791
Up until now,

1067
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:08,291
this woman still can't find a reason

1068
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:13,208
for running in a 42.195km
marathon at 3 a.m.

1069
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,666
She can't make sense of it.

1070
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,333
If wasn't for that fateful day

1071
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:20,750
four months ago...

1072
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:31,958
What's the matter with you?

1073
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,166
Didn't you see me?

1074
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:36,666
What were you looking at?

1075
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,083
Hey.

1076
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:42,666
Look at your arm.

1077
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:45,583
Hey! Who do you think you are?

1078
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:04,583
Do you have another pair of glasses?

1079
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:10,958
How about this?

1080
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,458
Let's go to my car.

1081
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:13,958
Do you have glasses in your car?

1082
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,083
I got Betadine.

1083
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:21,375
-Where do you think you're going?
-Easy!

1084
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:55,833
SEA YOU AGAIN

1085
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,583
If there wasn't any raining sound

1086
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:14,166
that evening inside his car,

1087
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:16,666
it would have been totally silent.

1088
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:22,250
Why do you go there to run?

1089
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:24,416
-The traffic is bad.
-Why?

1090
01:33:25,041 --> 01:33:27,708
If I run on the road,
people will think I am a boxer.

1091
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,625
Excuse me.

1092
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,291
Is this the reason why
you're running a marathon?

1093
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:12,875
She is thinking

1094
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,458
there must be a problem

1095
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:19,333
that caused anyone to run a marathon.

1096
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,375
How far is a marathon?

1097
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:24,875
It's like from Bangkok

1098
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:26,291
to Pathum Thani.

1099
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,750
Is it the west side or the east side
of Pathum Thani?

1100
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,041
What do you think about when you run?

1101
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:37,625
Is it fun to run alone

1102
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:39,333
without talking to anyone?

1103
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:44,666
By the way,

1104
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,750
about your glasses,

1105
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:47,875
I'll buy a new pair for you.

1106
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,291
There's no need.

1107
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:52,166
How would you know my prescription?

1108
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,500
And how will we meet again?

1109
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:00,416
At that second,

1110
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,333
no one knows what set her heart in motion.

1111
01:35:03,791 --> 01:35:04,958
Whether it's

1112
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:06,583
the Betadine,

1113
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:07,833
the rain,

1114
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,583
the smell of his sweat in the car

1115
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:14,333
or maybe it's the blurry image of him
caused by her bad eyesight.

1116
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,416
Do you run here every day?

1117
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:21,041
If I were a dog,
I would have peed on every light pole.

1118
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:29,833
How will I recognize you?

1119
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:32,458
I'm sorry.

1120
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:45,833
Wait.

1121
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:47,041
Well...

1122
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,583
I don't know your name yet.

1123
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:51,958
-Did I not tell you?
-What?

1124
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,333
I never asked.

1125
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:02,125
Keep the glasses.

1126
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:03,583
-What?
-I don't need them anymore.

1127
01:36:03,666 --> 01:36:04,958
Thanks a lot.

1128
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,166
Wait.

1129
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:36,208
She thought

1130
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:40,375
he was the type of person
she'd like to spend time with

1131
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:44,458
even when she wanted to be alone.

1132
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,458
Hello.

1133
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,333
It's you.

1134
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:16,166
This is for the sandal I broke.

1135
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,041
It costs more than your glasses.

1136
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,041
How would you know?

1137
01:37:34,833 --> 01:37:36,083
It's nice.

1138
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:38,166
And how would you know it is nice?

1139
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:40,625
I just think so.

1140
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,250
You don't have to say that

1141
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:45,166
to make me feel good.

1142
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,291
Here.

1143
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:50,875
If you can make me run 5km,

1144
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:53,541
it will improve my golfing skills.

1145
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:55,958
Do you

1146
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:57,458
have a lot of free time?

1147
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,541
I've got heaps.

1148
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,208
It means I have a lot of time.

1149
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:08,875
I see.

1150
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,666
What year were you born in?

1151
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:12,666
What year...

1152
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:15,708
What year was it?

1153
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,166
-Hey.
-What?

1154
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:38,375
Even though we are not
competing with anyone,

1155
01:38:38,875 --> 01:38:40,833
we shouldn't let a grandpa overtake us.

1156
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:42,208
Aren't you embarrassed?

1157
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,208
Can we not run the opposite way?

1158
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,166
Why not?

1159
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:48,958
There is no rule that says we can't.

1160
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:50,208
But still...

1161
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:10,000
YEAR OF DOG, PIG, RAT, OX, TIGER, RABBIT,
DRAGON, SNAKE, HORSE, GOAT, MONKEY

1162
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:11,958
Gosh, 24?

1163
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,916
Shall we try walking?

1164
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,375
Like fast walking?

1165
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:27,375
Let me ask you something.

1166
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:29,416
The day you ran into me,

1167
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:31,250
did you really not see me?

1168
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,250
What were you looking at?

1169
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,208
Runners only focus

1170
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,458
on what is seven feet ahead.

1171
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:40,708
Our job is to keep running.

1172
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,083
Do you see what happens
if you only look at the ground?

1173
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,125
So asthma motivated you to run?

1174
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:14,833
Yes.

1175
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,166
The thing is,

1176
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,583
when I was born,

1177
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,500
the doctor told my parents

1178
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:24,166
to not let me do sports
and let me take it easy.

1179
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:27,041
So I always thought to myself,

1180
01:40:27,416 --> 01:40:28,666
"Is this

1181
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,250
how my life is going to be?
Will I be sitting around like this?"

1182
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:34,291
You know,

1183
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,833
I run

1184
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:38,916
because it's the only sport
that I can do in private.

1185
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,791
Who are you hiding from?

1186
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,458
Don't laugh at me.

1187
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:46,916
The truth is

1188
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,208
I didn't mean to run
the opposite way on that day.

1189
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:55,208
But I saw my grandma's friend
doing Tai Chi here.

1190
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,750
Your grandma's friend?

1191
01:40:57,833 --> 01:40:59,083
She's a trouble maker.

1192
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:00,833
She reports things back to my family.

1193
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:01,958
Think about it.

1194
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:03,708
I even have to wash

1195
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:06,166
my running clothes outside of the house.

1196
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:08,250
Wow, that's bad.

1197
01:41:23,666 --> 01:41:24,666
You know,

1198
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:27,166
I really like Pid,
the bass player of Bodyslam.

1199
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,541
He's very strong.

1200
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,541
While he is holding a big bass guitar,

1201
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:32,625
he can lift his leg over an amplifier

1202
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,416
as tall as my head.

1203
01:41:34,833 --> 01:41:36,708
-Really?
-Watch me.

1204
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:43,583
Wasn't that cool?

1205
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:56,291
He told her that

1206
01:41:56,875 --> 01:41:58,291
a marathon

1207
01:41:58,375 --> 01:42:01,458
is a world that
nobody around him understands.

1208
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,250
It's like a secret garden

1209
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:07,583
where only he can enter.

1210
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:09,416
At least,

1211
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,833
I have a goal for myself every year.

1212
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:13,916
I see.

1213
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:15,708
That's interesting.

1214
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:19,625
Do you think

1215
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:21,083
I can run a marathon?

1216
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,791
Well...

1217
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,416
Why don't you give it a try?

1218
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:39,375
While they were walking and talking,

1219
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:41,000
his touch

1220
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:42,833
was like

1221
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:45,250
a tender peel covering an orange

1222
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:47,916
in her hand.

1223
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:49,958
Hold on.

1224
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:54,291
Let me ask you about the roses again.

1225
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,375
It...

1226
01:42:58,083 --> 01:43:01,500
It has nothing to do with
you being broken-hearted, right?

1227
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,000
Well...

1228
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,333
If I send you an email,

1229
01:43:10,708 --> 01:43:12,041
will you reply to me?

1230
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,958
Then, they both walked away

1231
01:43:20,166 --> 01:43:22,041
with a new feeling

1232
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,291
that grew into their hearts.

1233
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,666
That night,

1234
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:49,875
he emailed her
the marathon running schedule

1235
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:52,791
of Jeff Galloway.

1236
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:55,458
Inside, it listed

1237
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:57,375
the running distance

1238
01:43:57,458 --> 01:44:00,875
that keeps increasing every week

1239
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:04,125
until the day of the marathon.

1240
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,375
It meant

1241
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,750
the marathon

1242
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:11,583
she had no confidence in

1243
01:44:11,666 --> 01:44:13,416
or ever dreamed of being in

1244
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:16,666
was about to become a reality.

1245
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:30,916
ENJOY YOUR FIRST MARATHON

1246
01:44:34,416 --> 01:44:38,083
I don't know if she will enjoy it or not.

1247
01:44:38,916 --> 01:44:42,166
But the fact that
she came out to run with him for months

1248
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:44,791
probably meant

1249
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:48,833
she wanted to do something with her life.

1250
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:50,583
It's something

1251
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:52,666
that she was not sure

1252
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:54,750
would be possible.

1253
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:24,666
Hey.

1254
01:45:40,041 --> 01:45:41,333
Hurry.

1255
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,166
Faster.

1256
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:38,833
Come on.

1257
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,208
-You must try harder.
-I can't anymore.

1258
01:46:41,291 --> 01:46:43,500
On the day of the marathon,
you must run for four to five hours.

1259
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:44,666
You go first. I can't.

1260
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,625
You are already three weeks
behind schedule.

1261
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:47,833
-I can't. I'm so tired.
-Here.

1262
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:49,125
Just a little further.

1263
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:51,750
Endure it. Come on.

1264
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:54,250
Just go. I really can't.

1265
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,000
-Come on. Quick.
-You go.

1266
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:59,791
I can't. I'm tired.

1267
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:06,625
I really can't.

1268
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:08,666
There's no way I'll make it.

1269
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:13,208
Seriously,

1270
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:14,708
I better quit.

1271
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,291
I think you should stop
thinking negatively.

1272
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,875
No matter how tired you are.
Tomorrow is a new day.

1273
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:22,541
That's for sure.

1274
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,333
Everybody will have a new day.

1275
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:26,583
But a marathon is not for everybody.

1276
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,333
I wasn't born with eight nostrils.

1277
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:35,666
Listen.

1278
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,416
No matter how difficult it is,

1279
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:39,583
our body will adjust.

1280
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:42,458
If you don't push yourself a bit more
or try a bit harder,

1281
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:43,708
you will never

1282
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:45,208
move forward with your life.

1283
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:46,291
Let's go.

1284
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:47,791
No.

1285
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:49,666
Why do I have to run this stupid marathon

1286
01:47:49,875 --> 01:47:52,625
and make myself suffer
just to overcome asthma like you?

1287
01:47:58,291 --> 01:47:59,500
Did you think

1288
01:48:00,083 --> 01:48:01,458
running was going to be easy?

1289
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:06,333
You don't have to pressure yourself
to do something you don't want to.

1290
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,625
I want to run,

1291
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:12,083
but I don't want to be tired.

1292
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:18,416
That's up to you.

1293
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,416
If you want to run, 1km is enough.

1294
01:48:22,916 --> 01:48:24,708
But if you want a new life,

1295
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,333
then run a marathon.

1296
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:39,583
The moment happened very fast.

1297
01:48:40,166 --> 01:48:41,875
She thought he must be mad

1298
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,875
because he said

1299
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,458
"Up to you."

1300
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:48,583
She was in shock

1301
01:48:48,875 --> 01:48:51,291
staring at his back

1302
01:48:51,416 --> 01:48:53,500
while he was walking away.

1303
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:57,375
She wanted to say sorry to him.

1304
01:48:58,416 --> 01:49:00,250
But she was afraid that

1305
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:02,458
he might turn around and say,

1306
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:05,416
"Sorry for what?

1307
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:07,916
I am not your boyfriend."

1308
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,208
Then it would make her so sad

1309
01:49:11,375 --> 01:49:14,250
and she would say,

1310
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:16,333
"Forget about being your girlfriend.

1311
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:20,333
I can't even be your friend."

1312
01:49:21,958 --> 01:49:25,000
Luckily, the thing she was afraid of

1313
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,291
didn't actually happen.

1314
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,083
The thing is,

1315
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:35,250
I had a bad experience at the 35-km mark

1316
01:49:37,166 --> 01:49:38,458
and that had to do

1317
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:40,833
with the dried roses in my car.

1318
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:54,666
In the morning of the race,

1319
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:58,208
I bought those roses
and kept them in my car.

1320
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:01,708
I wanted to see them when I drove home.

1321
01:50:02,666 --> 01:50:04,833
I wanted to celebrate

1322
01:50:04,916 --> 01:50:06,958
because I proved my doctor wrong.

1323
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:09,125
He told her

1324
01:50:09,208 --> 01:50:13,125
that he ran
on his first marathon last year.

1325
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:16,666
I went without preparing myself
or doing any research.

1326
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:18,291
I only trained for a week.

1327
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:20,416
I didn't drink water or eat
before the race.

1328
01:50:20,708 --> 01:50:22,125
I only thought about

1329
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:24,041
keeping my pace,

1330
01:50:24,833 --> 01:50:26,083
so I could finish it fast.

1331
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:50,708
At around 30km, I passed out.

1332
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:52,666
I was running but at a walking pace.

1333
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,666
I ran even though I felt
there was a knife in my back.

1334
01:50:56,708 --> 01:50:59,833
Then there was a voice
of a devil from afar saying

1335
01:51:00,666 --> 01:51:03,333
"Who told you to run anyway?"

1336
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:11,208
He could only run for another 3km.

1337
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:16,583
At the 35-km mark,

1338
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:18,833
the sound of the devil in his head

1339
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:21,416
which everyone told him to ignore

1340
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:25,083
started up again like clockwork.

1341
01:51:25,333 --> 01:51:27,666
"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?"

1342
01:51:28,333 --> 01:51:30,791
His knee led his leg one after the other

1343
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:32,416
in slow motion.

1344
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:35,958
Then suddenly his legs got weak

1345
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:39,041
as if there was a chain

1346
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:40,750
attached to his leg.

1347
01:51:44,291 --> 01:51:46,083
And then I answered the devil.

1348
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,291
"Yes.

1349
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:50,833
You're right."

1350
01:51:51,916 --> 01:51:53,291
What happened next?

1351
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:04,583
Sir.

1352
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:05,666
Sir.

1353
01:52:09,166 --> 01:52:10,458
Then I...

1354
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:13,583
DNF.

1355
01:52:14,166 --> 01:52:15,416
What?

1356
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:18,083
I did not finish.

1357
01:52:26,583 --> 01:52:27,625
Well.

1358
01:52:27,916 --> 01:52:29,208
They put me on a stretcher.

1359
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:30,833
Really?

1360
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:35,625
So I put those roses
inside the glove compartment

1361
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:37,375
and planned not to open it

1362
01:52:37,458 --> 01:52:39,333
until I finish 42km.

1363
01:52:40,083 --> 01:52:42,250
Until I carelessly opened it.

1364
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:46,208
I am sorry.

1365
01:52:49,958 --> 01:52:50,958
You know,

1366
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:54,500
On the day of the race, at the 28-km mark,

1367
01:52:54,583 --> 01:52:55,708
we will see the sunrise

1368
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:58,083
beyond the Rama VIII Bridge.

1369
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:00,041
It's so cool.

1370
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,458
At this moment,

1371
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:04,958
anyone who is watching this

1372
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:07,666
will probably expect an inspirational song

1373
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:11,416
playing in the background.

1374
01:53:40,875 --> 01:53:43,916
MARATHON RUNNING SCHEDULE

1375
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:05,583
In Buddhism,

1376
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:07,208
everything in this world

1377
01:54:07,625 --> 01:54:10,208
moves in a constant flux

1378
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:13,166
until it encounters a turning point

1379
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:15,583
or an outside force.

1380
01:54:23,166 --> 01:54:24,708
And this story of hers

1381
01:54:24,833 --> 01:54:26,708
was no exception.

1382
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:54,000
PONGSAKORN THIPTHINNAKORN

1383
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:55,833
1854 RATCHADAMRI ROAD, LUMPINI,
PATHUMWAN, BANGKOK

1384
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:26,416
Once you run for a few months,
you will feel like

1385
01:55:27,833 --> 01:55:29,166
you aren't the same person anymore.

1386
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:32,791
Did she hear that phrase?

1387
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:36,541
"You aren't the same person."

1388
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:39,958
It's the same phrase that her husband

1389
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:42,125
whispered in her ear

1390
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,083
while giving her the wedding ring.

1391
01:55:44,625 --> 01:55:46,708
"You aren't the same person anymore."

1392
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:51,583
During these past few months,

1393
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:55,416
she's never spoken of her husband's death,

1394
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,083
not even once.

1395
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,208
Even though

1396
01:56:06,291 --> 01:56:10,000
she still remembers everything
on the day he passed away.

1397
01:56:10,833 --> 01:56:14,583
Breaking news,
a plane broke apart into two pieces.

1398
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:17,833
The front of the plane hit the sand wall.

1399
01:56:18,125 --> 01:56:19,458
The tail of the plane

1400
01:56:20,208 --> 01:56:22,958
is stuck on the runway.

1401
01:56:43,875 --> 01:56:45,083
The time,

1402
01:56:46,625 --> 01:56:48,083
the place,

1403
01:56:49,833 --> 01:56:52,166
the hands of her friend on her shoulder,

1404
01:56:53,375 --> 01:56:55,208
and even the lights

1405
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:59,458
seemed to focus on her
more intensely that evening.

1406
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:31,291
Hey.

1407
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:33,000
Hey.

1408
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:37,166
This is Sairoong,

1409
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:42,916
her young colleague
who became her best friend.

1410
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,875
You got darker.
All the stuff on your desk is with me.

1411
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:47,416
Are you coming back to work?

1412
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,041
You? Run a marathon?

1413
01:57:49,916 --> 01:57:51,375
Do you live in the same condo?

1414
01:57:51,458 --> 01:57:52,666
Don't you pick up your phone?

1415
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,916
And how come you didn't join
the dinner last time?

1416
01:57:56,291 --> 01:57:58,583
I was busy. I wanted to go, though. But...

1417
01:57:59,083 --> 01:58:00,416
something came up. I don't remember.

1418
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,083
-It's okay.
-Next time.

1419
01:58:03,791 --> 01:58:06,500
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I really am.

1420
01:58:08,208 --> 01:58:10,500
Sairoong knows her very well.

1421
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:12,291
Are you afraid of someone coming that way?

1422
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:18,333
You look that way every 15 seconds.

1423
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:29,166
So the rumor of you running
with a young guy everyday...

1424
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:31,041
is true?

1425
01:58:34,833 --> 01:58:37,583
The rumor that Sairoong heard about

1426
01:58:38,083 --> 01:58:40,166
was missing one detail.

1427
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,833
-Besides being young,
-Hello.

1428
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:45,125
he's good looking too.

1429
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:57,416
Since when?

1430
01:58:57,666 --> 01:58:58,791
What?

1431
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,291
When did you decide
to start seeing that boy?

1432
01:59:03,541 --> 01:59:05,541
I knew that you would say this

1433
01:59:06,125 --> 01:59:08,708
because if I were you,
I would say the same thing.

1434
01:59:09,833 --> 01:59:12,083
So what was all the drama five months ago

1435
01:59:12,166 --> 01:59:15,041
about loving only one man in your life?

1436
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:26,083
I never forgot my late husband.

1437
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:36,333
It's true
that there is a new man in my life.

1438
01:59:40,708 --> 01:59:42,291
She told Sairoong about him

1439
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:44,583
and the stories he told her

1440
01:59:44,666 --> 01:59:46,458
about the running schedule,

1441
01:59:46,791 --> 01:59:48,291
Milo's principle,

1442
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:51,541
and the devil at the 35-km mark.

1443
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,791
Before Lumpini park was closed that night,

1444
01:59:57,416 --> 01:59:59,166
Sairoong asked her...

1445
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:00,375
Hey.

1446
02:00:01,166 --> 02:00:03,083
Are you sure you're not going crazy?

1447
02:00:05,666 --> 02:00:07,833
I understand you must be lonely, but...

1448
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:09,958
I am lonely

1449
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,166
but I don't want to be sad.

1450
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,375
She wasn't sure

1451
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:20,250
if Sairoong would accept her or not

1452
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:23,500
if she told her the real reason

1453
02:00:23,583 --> 02:00:25,000
in her mind.

1454
02:00:25,166 --> 02:00:26,958
I can't accept this.

1455
02:01:08,791 --> 02:01:09,916
That night,

1456
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,583
she laid on the sofa

1457
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:16,916
and stared at the faint light

1458
02:01:17,416 --> 02:01:20,833
shining through the curtains
like in those Kazakhstan films

1459
02:01:21,291 --> 02:01:23,458
with a heavy heart.

1460
02:02:17,291 --> 02:02:19,208
Hello, this is Pongsakorn speaking.

1461
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:23,208
Please leave a message
after the beeping sound.

1462
02:02:24,666 --> 02:02:25,833
Thank you.

1463
02:02:40,666 --> 02:02:43,458
Hello, honey. Have you already decided?
I am done with work.

1464
02:02:43,583 --> 02:02:46,750
See? I told you it would only take a day.

1465
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:49,333
You always exaggerate things.

1466
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:54,208
-I told you so and you didn't believe me.
-The beach here is beautiful.

1467
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:57,416
Why don't you show me
how to dive in the pool here?

1468
02:02:57,791 --> 02:03:00,916
I've shown you many times.
You must be bored of it by now.

1469
02:03:01,333 --> 02:03:05,083
This week is really busy.
I've been working non-stop. I'm tired.

1470
02:03:05,375 --> 02:03:06,416
I'm lazy too.

1471
02:03:07,291 --> 02:03:10,333
You should change your flight
and come back now.

1472
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:18,791
Hello, this is Pongsakorn speaking.

1473
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:22,958
Please leave a message
after the beeping sound.

1474
02:03:24,208 --> 02:03:25,375
Thank you.

1475
02:03:32,791 --> 02:03:34,291
Don't come back.

1476
02:03:37,416 --> 02:03:38,666
Don't come back.

1477
02:04:47,666 --> 02:04:50,291
Sorry, the number you've dialed...

1478
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:23,791
ARE YOU SICK?

1479
02:05:23,875 --> 02:05:26,833
I'M DOWNSTAIRS, I'M GOING UP TO SEE YOU

1480
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:41,375
Hey.

1481
02:07:41,958 --> 02:07:43,583
Did you receive my messages?

1482
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:49,500
I told you not to do that.

1483
02:07:49,583 --> 02:07:51,375
I told you that's not how it is, Pat.

1484
02:07:51,458 --> 02:07:52,958
What about those things?

1485
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:54,458
I didn't do it.

1486
02:07:54,625 --> 02:07:56,625
Then what did you do?

1487
02:07:56,708 --> 02:07:58,083
Be reasonable, Pat.

1488
02:07:59,333 --> 02:08:00,458
She spoke to him

1489
02:08:00,541 --> 02:08:03,791
trying to keep it down

1490
02:08:03,958 --> 02:08:06,208
so that it would not echo.

1491
02:08:06,375 --> 02:08:07,875
But at that moment,

1492
02:08:07,958 --> 02:08:09,958
she couldn't 

1493
02:08:10,083 --> 02:08:12,166
keep her voice calm.

1494
02:08:12,291 --> 02:08:13,708
If I want to keep seeing you,

1495
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:15,666
I will go running with you.

1496
02:08:16,958 --> 02:08:18,458
But honestly,

1497
02:08:19,041 --> 02:08:20,583
this has gone too far.

1498
02:08:21,875 --> 02:08:23,750
You shouldn't waste your time on me.

1499
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:28,041
Do you know
that you're the most pitiful one?

1500
02:08:32,541 --> 02:08:33,583
Why?

1501
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:34,958
Hey.

1502
02:08:35,791 --> 02:08:37,208
You know Milo's principle.

1503
02:08:37,625 --> 02:08:39,791
You planned a 40km running schedule.

1504
02:08:40,708 --> 02:08:42,583
How come you don't know
the answer to this?

1505
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:45,875
These last couple of months,

1506
02:08:46,666 --> 02:08:48,833
I've been trying to tell you

1507
02:08:48,916 --> 02:08:50,375
that I like you.

1508
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:10,958
Your family won't be okay with me.

1509
02:09:15,333 --> 02:09:17,333
No family would be okay with me.

1510
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:22,875
My family isn't okay
with the marathon either.

1511
02:09:24,833 --> 02:09:26,166
In 20 years,

1512
02:09:26,458 --> 02:09:28,958
do you want to feed me the food
that old people eat before going to bed?

1513
02:09:29,916 --> 02:09:31,333
If you want to have dinner,

1514
02:09:31,416 --> 02:09:33,833
go eat with your mom at home.

1515
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:38,791
You don't want to regret it later, right?

1516
02:09:41,666 --> 02:09:42,791
Do you regret

1517
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:46,875
anything now?

1518
02:09:55,583 --> 02:09:58,458
The devil at the 35-km and 36-km mark,

1519
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:01,833
did it not warn you
about your actions now?

1520
02:10:07,666 --> 02:10:10,875
My husband just died earlier this year.

1521
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:17,375
I know.

1522
02:10:19,958 --> 02:10:21,208
It was in the newspapers.

1523
02:10:21,583 --> 02:10:23,625
-I just--
-Why did you ask for my name

1524
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:25,833
on the day you ran into me then?

1525
02:10:32,583 --> 02:10:34,791
I wanted you to think
I didn't know anything about you.

1526
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,750
What if

1527
02:10:47,458 --> 02:10:49,166
I was a normal guy

1528
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:51,500
and you were

1529
02:10:51,583 --> 02:10:53,166
a normal girl,

1530
02:10:53,791 --> 02:10:55,208
without your husband...

1531
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:59,083
could we be together?

1532
02:11:08,583 --> 02:11:10,041
What makes you think we could?

1533
02:11:12,208 --> 02:11:13,583
My instinct tells me so.

1534
02:11:20,166 --> 02:11:22,458
Either you watch too many movies,
or you are too young.

1535
02:11:25,166 --> 02:11:26,416
I am young,

1536
02:11:27,208 --> 02:11:28,666
but not that young.

1537
02:11:30,833 --> 02:11:32,166
I'm sorry.

1538
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,916
I am not amused by your teenage quip.

1539
02:11:47,208 --> 02:11:48,291
Right before

1540
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:51,000
you came to see me,

1541
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,458
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

1542
02:11:57,125 --> 02:11:59,500
It was the first time in a few months

1543
02:12:00,958 --> 02:12:02,958
that I took a good look at myself.

1544
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:06,458
I never felt

1545
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:08,916
like I betrayed my husband

1546
02:12:09,916 --> 02:12:11,125
until today.

1547
02:12:19,041 --> 02:12:20,083
Do you know

1548
02:12:22,083 --> 02:12:24,458
what promise I have given him
at his grave?

1549
02:12:33,916 --> 02:12:36,208
I promised
that I would not love another man.

1550
02:12:43,458 --> 02:12:45,041
Thank you for introducing me to marathons.

1551
02:12:51,875 --> 02:12:53,750
But I don't want to see your face anymore.

1552
02:13:34,166 --> 02:13:36,583
That was an amazing story.

1553
02:13:36,666 --> 02:13:38,500
A group of teenagers fought

1554
02:13:38,583 --> 02:13:41,541
and the bullet
killed an unlucky crocodile...

1555
02:13:42,666 --> 02:13:44,000
After that day,

1556
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:47,416
she thought about starting her life over.

1557
02:13:49,458 --> 02:13:52,250
But she could only turn on the TV

1558
02:13:53,416 --> 02:13:56,958
and pretend to watch Sairoong's show.

1559
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:59,416
Or sometimes

1560
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:01,291
she would turn her back towards the park

1561
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:05,791
while the Skytrain approached
the park's station.

1562
02:14:12,458 --> 02:14:14,416
On a sunny day,

1563
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:16,833
she thought of retiring her shoes,

1564
02:14:17,125 --> 02:14:20,041
just like those
retired football players do

1565
02:14:20,166 --> 02:14:22,333
when they stop using their studs.

1566
02:14:33,125 --> 02:14:35,916
It was a Saturday morning in October.

1567
02:14:36,166 --> 02:14:37,750
Her mom came to visit

1568
02:14:38,083 --> 02:14:40,666
with souvenirs from China.

1569
02:14:41,666 --> 02:14:43,666
Her mom asked her about work.

1570
02:14:43,750 --> 02:14:45,375
When are you going back to work?

1571
02:14:48,208 --> 02:14:49,333
In a while.

1572
02:14:49,416 --> 02:14:52,291
And then her mom made breakfast for her.

1573
02:14:56,291 --> 02:14:58,166
Even though her mom
didn't make it obvious,

1574
02:14:59,208 --> 02:15:02,833
a lot of little things made her feel

1575
02:15:03,416 --> 02:15:06,125
like her mom wanted to talk
about something.

1576
02:15:21,791 --> 02:15:22,750
Mom.

1577
02:15:25,833 --> 02:15:27,083
Did Sairoong tell you?

1578
02:15:27,625 --> 02:15:29,416
Yes, yesterday.

1579
02:15:30,291 --> 02:15:32,166
I met her and she told me.

1580
02:15:36,541 --> 02:15:37,708
Oh, no.

1581
02:15:37,875 --> 02:15:40,875
She couldn't think of anything
to say to her mom.

1582
02:15:40,958 --> 02:15:42,666
She told me
you're going to run a marathon.

1583
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:45,208
Be careful not to break your legs.

1584
02:15:46,333 --> 02:15:49,458
On my way up,
someone asked me to give this to you.

1585
02:15:50,958 --> 02:15:53,708
I guess he tried to call
but your phone must be off.

1586
02:15:58,291 --> 02:15:59,958
YOU'RE INVITED TO BANGKOK GIANT MARATHON

1587
02:16:11,708 --> 02:16:15,000
ENJOY YOUR FIRST MARATHON TOMORROW MORNING

1588
02:16:15,291 --> 02:16:16,500
This time,

1589
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:19,416
he really made her heart skip a beat.

1590
02:16:26,208 --> 02:16:27,541
Taste it.

1591
02:16:29,833 --> 02:16:31,500
-It's good.
-Okay.

1592
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:34,416
And who was that guy?
Kids these days are so good looking.

1593
02:16:35,416 --> 02:16:36,833
Was he your trainer?

1594
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:39,541
That's good. He can look after you.

1595
02:16:46,333 --> 02:16:49,041
While her mom was cooking that morning,

1596
02:16:49,583 --> 02:16:53,375
food was the last thing on her mind.

1597
02:16:59,083 --> 02:17:00,875
These past few months,

1598
02:17:00,958 --> 02:17:03,916
practicing for the marathon
gave her peace.

1599
02:17:04,458 --> 02:17:08,041
Living life seemed to get easier.

1600
02:17:29,791 --> 02:17:32,500
But right now she is afraid that

1601
02:17:32,583 --> 02:17:34,708
if she stays in this room,

1602
02:17:34,791 --> 02:17:37,375
she will keep staring into the mirror

1603
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:40,000
over and over again.

1604
02:17:52,333 --> 02:17:53,333
Ten.

1605
02:17:53,958 --> 02:17:55,083
Nine.

1606
02:17:55,541 --> 02:17:56,833
Eight.

1607
02:17:57,541 --> 02:17:58,750
Seven.

1608
02:17:58,958 --> 02:18:00,208
Six.

1609
02:18:00,833 --> 02:18:02,041
Five.

1610
02:18:02,333 --> 02:18:03,416
Four.

1611
02:18:03,916 --> 02:18:05,125
Three.

1612
02:18:05,208 --> 02:18:06,333
Two.

1613
02:18:06,416 --> 02:18:07,791
One.

1614
02:18:20,041 --> 02:18:21,666
I want my new life to begin

1615
02:18:22,541 --> 02:18:24,583
with the sound of the gun going off.

1616
02:18:27,291 --> 02:18:28,916
I don't want to just run.

1617
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:32,333
I want to start a new life.

1618
02:18:37,791 --> 02:18:39,041
I'm sure.

1619
02:18:39,583 --> 02:18:41,583
I want my car to smell like sweat, too.

1620
02:19:07,291 --> 02:19:08,916
I see the sunrise

1621
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,958
at the Rama VIII Bridge now.

1622
02:19:12,125 --> 02:19:13,625
If I didn't run,

1623
02:19:13,916 --> 02:19:15,583
I wouldn't have seen the sunrise.

1624
02:19:31,666 --> 02:19:34,875
Come on. You're almost there.

1625
02:19:36,833 --> 02:19:38,291
I want to confront my devil

1626
02:19:38,625 --> 02:19:40,250
at the 35-km mark. 

1627
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:46,041
I want to confront my devil

1628
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,375
at the 35-km mark. 

1629
02:20:03,666 --> 02:20:05,166
I want to confront my devil

1630
02:20:05,416 --> 02:20:07,000
at the 35-km mark. 

1631
02:20:15,916 --> 02:20:17,666
We have reached

1632
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:19,916
the point of the race

1633
02:20:20,416 --> 02:20:22,083
where we all feel alone

1634
02:20:22,291 --> 02:20:24,375
and must make a decision.

1635
02:20:25,083 --> 02:20:27,000
We must ask ourselves

1636
02:20:27,083 --> 02:20:28,958
"How badly do we want to finish?"

1637
02:20:29,041 --> 02:20:30,375
Miss.

1638
02:20:31,666 --> 02:20:32,791
Do you need a ride?

1639
02:20:33,041 --> 02:20:35,666
And we must find the answer on our own.

1640
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:36,916
What kilometer is this?

1641
02:20:37,208 --> 02:20:38,583
I don't know.

1642
02:20:39,666 --> 02:20:42,208
She never thought

1643
02:20:42,958 --> 02:20:45,666
she would end up on this road

1644
02:20:46,083 --> 02:20:48,416
at the age of 42.

1645
02:20:55,083 --> 02:20:56,333
Thank you.

1646
02:20:56,916 --> 02:20:59,041
Miss, just a bit further.

1647
02:21:04,666 --> 02:21:06,666
You haven't stopped running
in the opposite direction.

1648
02:21:06,958 --> 02:21:08,500
What took you so long?

1649
02:21:08,833 --> 02:21:10,708
I was waiting for you at the finish line.

1650
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:37,458
Yesterday, did you tell my mom

1651
02:21:37,541 --> 02:21:38,833
that you would look after me?

1652
02:21:47,666 --> 02:21:48,875
Well...

1653
02:21:50,333 --> 02:21:52,333
It wasn't exactly like that.

1654
02:21:55,041 --> 02:21:56,666
What did my mom tell you?

1655
02:22:01,083 --> 02:22:02,166
Well.

1656
02:22:04,083 --> 02:22:05,958
-She said--
-I'm kidding.

1657
02:22:07,166 --> 02:22:08,291
Let's go!

1658
02:22:08,458 --> 02:22:11,666
She was thinking that in reality,

1659
02:22:11,875 --> 02:22:14,708
her past and memories did not exist.

1660
02:22:16,166 --> 02:22:17,791
Right now,

1661
02:22:17,875 --> 02:22:20,500
it was just a matter

1662
02:22:20,583 --> 02:22:22,041
of moving her legs

1663
02:22:22,125 --> 02:22:23,666
to keep moving forward.

1664
02:22:37,625 --> 02:22:38,708
You go first.

1665
02:22:39,208 --> 02:22:40,458
Come with me.

1666
02:22:40,791 --> 02:22:42,541
Come on. Just a bit more.

1667
02:22:42,625 --> 02:22:43,791
You go first.

1668
02:22:44,041 --> 02:22:45,166
I can't go on anymore.

1669
02:22:50,416 --> 02:22:52,583
Stop being pessimistic.

1670
02:22:52,958 --> 02:22:55,791
How hard can 2km be?

1671
02:22:57,125 --> 02:22:58,625
Tomorrow is a new day.

1672
02:22:58,875 --> 02:23:00,083
Don't you remember?

1673
02:23:03,333 --> 02:23:04,791
Give me your hand.

1674
02:23:06,625 --> 02:23:08,666
I already bought the roses.

1675
02:23:10,666 --> 02:23:11,958
Let's go.

1676
02:23:12,458 --> 02:23:13,458
Come on.

1677
02:23:14,333 --> 02:23:17,791
If there was no pain to endure,

1678
02:23:18,791 --> 02:23:21,458
why would anyone want to run a marathon?

1679
02:23:33,333 --> 02:23:35,458
They both ran for six hours,

1680
02:23:35,666 --> 02:23:37,916
slower than the fastest runner

1681
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,166
by three and a half hours.

1682
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,666
The finish line is there for all runners,

1683
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,666
whether you're the first

1684
02:23:46,083 --> 02:23:48,333
or the 1,500th runner.

1685
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:50,708
Everyone who crosses the finish line

1686
02:23:50,875 --> 02:23:54,333
will be treated as a winner.

1687
02:23:54,583 --> 02:23:55,666
By the way,

1688
02:23:56,333 --> 02:23:58,791
what did you say
to the devil at the 35-km mark?

1689
02:24:05,625 --> 02:24:07,083
She knew now that

1690
02:24:07,583 --> 02:24:10,083
despite what she told the devil,

1691
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:13,083
she was not the same person anymore.

1692
02:24:14,416 --> 02:24:15,625
And this

1693
02:24:15,708 --> 02:24:19,916
is the only purpose humans live for.

1694
02:24:20,375 --> 02:24:22,041
Move forward

1695
02:24:22,125 --> 02:24:24,458
to cover the seven feet in front of you,

1696
02:24:24,833 --> 02:24:27,083
and look forward to the changes coming

1697
02:24:27,583 --> 02:24:29,666
in the next seven feet ahead.

1698
02:31:56,625 --> 02:31:58,625
