Please turn off all electronic devices.

Fasten your seat belts.

6
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:51,566
Put your seat back upright,
and return the table to its start position.

7
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,797
Captain, we are ready to take off.

8
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:06,968
Hello. Hello.
Hi. Good morning.

9
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:09,101
Hello.

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,606
Everyone, please put on the

Don't worry.

- Hey!

36
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,196
- Hi.
- Hi, Kaya

37
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,867
I passed my interview for a company!

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,634
I'm going to work in America!

39
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,750
That's so good to hear.
Congratulations!

40
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,621
Because of you!

41
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:21,063
Thank you. Thank you, Tutor Pleng.

42
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,626
Enough, enough.

43
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,613
Actually, I need your help.

44
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:34,149
I want to break up with my Thai boyfriend.

45
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:36,610
Okay, and then?

46
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:40,614
He can't speak English,
and I can't speak Thai.

47
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:45,914
You guys can't even talk to each
other. How did you get together?

You know, S-E-X

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,623
Oh, yes.

52
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:08,620
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Ah... Ah...

53
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,884
Okay, okay. Enough. I got it.

54
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,025
Thank you, Tutor Pleng.

55
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:18,828
For what?

56
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,977
For helping me
break up with him.

57
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:25,407
Oh, no. I didn't say I would.

58
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,999
But...

59
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:32,711
I bought this Louis Vuitton bag for you.

60
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:40,607
Oh yeah, breaking up with
a guy is easy. Don't worry.

What's wrong with you?

69
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,914
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?

70

- I love you. But we don't have a lot in common.

78
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,781
<i>- The things we like.</i>
- The things we like.

79
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,625
Our cultures.

80
00:06:57,929 --> 00:06:59,500

I don't think it'll work out.

84
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,538
Because we don't understand each other.

85
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,532
Understand, your ass!

86
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,619

87
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,773
Oh, I don't know about that.

88
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:22,031
I'm just here to translate.

89
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,007
Ok, let's continue.

90
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:29,613
- Hopefully, you'll meet the right person.
- You are the right person!

91

I've heard enough!

92
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:34,968
If you don't want to listen,
it's ok.

93
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,500
Wait a minute.
Are you her tutor?

94
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,628
Yes.

95
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,734
It's your fault!

96
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:49,914
Fuck it.

97
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,296
What the fuck are you looking at, Sir?

98
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,202
Is that a bomb?

99
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,610
Hey...

100
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,612
Hey...

101
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,638
Hey, what's that?

102
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,177
It's chicken soup.

103
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,609
Chicken soup?

104
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,552
This is fuck.

107
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,302
You mean me?

108
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,603
No, I mean the other guy.

109
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,153
What kind of guy is that?

110
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:07,637
You mean me?

111
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,442
The other guy.

112
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,263
He won't live long with that attitude.

113
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,167
Oh, you mean the other guy.

114
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,794
No, it's you!

115

118
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,228
Don't come close.

119
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,083
I'll blind you.

120
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:06,616
Not worth it.

121
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,310
You're into domination?

122
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:14,700
I'm interviewing at the factory,
so I can get back with Kaya.

123
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,411
You have to teach me.

124
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,677
Go study with your Dad!

125
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,354
I thought you were a half-blood?

126
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,941
Hey!

127
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,629
My Dad is French.

128
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,426
He went back before I
was old enough to walk.

129
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:28,770
Then go study with
another teacher.

130
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,885
No.

131
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,531
If you can teach others,

132
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,615
then you can teach me.

133
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,106
You see your big photo
in front of the school?

134
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,532
- Teach me?
- Yes, I will teach you.

135
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,627
- One on one?
- Yes, I will.

136
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,591
Here's the money.

137
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:06,612
It you trick me,

138
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,626
I won't take the money...

139
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:12,989
I'll take something else.

140
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:32,625
Is this worth it?

141
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,609
It's 4am already, you haven't
slept yet, Daddy?

142
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,255
Daddy should have gone out
with me this evening.

143
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,512
Since you didn't go...

144
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,614
Ko A and Ko Chai
kept forcing me to drink.

145
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,498
Meh.

146
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:14,618
They asked me to send
you some love.

147
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,616
Look at this.

148
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,532
They gave a lot.

149
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:25,976
This is human skin.

150
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,247
They wrote as if my skin is paper.

151
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,621
This is a thrilling chicken.

152
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,622
So thrilling.

153
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:57,509
So thrilling.

154
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:13,802
Daddy.

155
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,614
Daddy's not sad.

156
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,192
Daddy knows...

157
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,567
if Daddy's sad...

158
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,192
Daddy's not cool.

159
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:24,622
- You're drunk. Go to sleep.
- Daddy doesn't want her!

160
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:32,616
Kaya, Kaya, Kaya, Kaya,
Kaya, Kaya, Kaya...

I was really craving Jok.
[Jok: rice soup and actor's name]

164
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,618
Okay, let's get started.

165
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:28,602
Now you're taking a conversation lesson.

166
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,747
So, you will have to speak
English as much as possible

167
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:34,619
I need your full attention
and participation.

168
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:39,617
If you have any questions, just ask.
Don't be shy. Do you understand?

169
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:42,747
Do you understand?

170
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,325
Do you understand?

171
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,614
Why are you standing?

172
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,700
Stand up.

173
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:57,310
Yeah, I know.

174
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:59,091
I got up to buy coffee.

175
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,688
You want anything?

176
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,715
I'm set.

177
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,098
You go.

178
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,609
This is a huge project.

196

"H" like when you tell a dog
to go away "shoo shoo".

197
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,997
- Shoo Shoo

198

Shoo Shoo... Let's try again.

00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:26,573
Hey, waiter...

208
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:27,275
Yes?

209
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,825
X, Y, and then?

210
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,013
Zed.

211
00:17:30,286 --> 00:17:31,621
Zed, you see?

212
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,531
What is this?

213
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:39,622
This is a glass.

214
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:43,611
And, what's this?

215
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,584
This is...

216
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:48,115
a lord.
[Thai for straw]

217
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,779
This is a straw.

218
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:53,610
Little school boys even know this.

219
00:17:58,604 --> 00:17:59,623
What is that?

220
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,614
There.

221
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,045
That is... woman.

222
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:05,980

00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:08,618
Ah, shoelace.

00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,517
Wrong again.

225
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,802
- So, what is it?
- That is mango.

226
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:17,567
Mango? Where's mango?

227
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,982
Breast mango.
[Type of mango]

228
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,154
Why are you walking up?

229
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,841
It's already 10pm.

230
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,342
I finished teaching late,

231
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:42,990
they've already closed the
door and elevator.

232
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,996
Do you want a ride?

233
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,654
No.

234
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,740
My boyfriend gave me this.

235
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,627
You have a boyfriend?

236
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,675
Remove the lid and get it ready...

237
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,428
you might need it soon.

238
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,217
I wish you can make it.

239
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,740
Can't wait to see your damn face
when you find out the truth.

240
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,685
That you're just her sex toy.

241
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:18,121
I know that you're cursing me.

242
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,638
But I don't understand the words.

243
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:05,599
May I grab it?

244
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:07,005
Yes you may.

245
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,605
MOLE

246
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,643
It'll be your turn soon.

247
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,865
What should I say about moles?

248
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,985
Whatever you want.

249
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,622
Whatever I want...

250
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,619
You may begin.

251
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,627
Uh, mole.

252
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:44,263
A mole is...

253
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:46,787
destiny in action.

254
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,611
Moles are destiny's little miracles.

255
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:54,881
Because...

256
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:59,787
no person can predict where or when
a mole will actually appear.  Or...

257
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:02,073
Or even finally end up on their body.

258
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:06,591
Moles appear to be random.

259
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:15,113
But... But if moles are truly random, then
how can two persons, two total strangers...

260
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:17,607
have a mole in exactly the same spot?

261
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,606
Maybe it is destiny.

262
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,818
You see, moles, like destiny,
are no different.

263
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:28,625
If you wait to meet someone
with the exact same mole,

264
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,143
it is almost impossible.

265
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,526
That is why...

266
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,064
we need to write our own destiny.

267
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,951
Oh, that was fast.

268
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:11,108
A student asked for your
phone number today.

269
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:15,619
Who is it?

270
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:20,602
Pruek, your business conversation student.

271
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,522
Did you give it to him?

272
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,552
Yes, I did.

273
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,201
Why did you give it to him?
It's inappropriate.

274
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:33,099
Stop smiling so much.

275
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,099
Your smile is from here to
the elevator.

276
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:46,044
No, this is what you call smiling from
here to the elevator.

277
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,609
Oh, so boring, my life is awesome.

278
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,623
Dorks.

279
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,263
What do you like to eat?

280
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:01,834
I like to eat Mama.

281
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,201
What is "Mama"?

282
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:09,474
Oh, Mama is a brand
of Thai instant noodles.

283
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,613
Foreigners don't know what Mama is,

284
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:13,926
they're going to think you eat your mother.

285
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,925
Why are you smiling so much?
Are you nuts?

286
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:28,810
What time do you go to bed?

287
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,326
Uh...   Twelve.

288
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:36,604
Or you can say "midnight".

289
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:40,659
You can use the word "mid" when
you want to say "half"...

290
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:43,650
for example, "mid-term",
means half-term exam.

291
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:47,927
But when you stab someone
all the way it's called "mid"?

292
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,763
Ok, whatever.

293
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:54,613
What do you like to do in your free time?

294
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,610
Uh, I like to play Porkærm.

295
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:04,137
You should say
"I like to play cards".

296
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:09,700
Or, if you want to return
the question, you say...

297
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,633
What about you?

298
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:14,911
What if I don't want to know?

299
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,617
It's ok, but you will look like an idiot.

300
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,261
Wow, wow.

301
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:25,825
Idiot, why did you use the flash?

302
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:26,959
Hey hey hey...

303
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:29,247
Wow, it's like a pyramid triangle.

304
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:31,620
Wow, nice and white.

305
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:33,613
Hey!  What the???

306
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:37,497
Where are you going?

307
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,610
Come with me.

308
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:45,605
- Why did you hit him?
- He took your picture.

309
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:46,575
No, I didn't.

310
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,605
- You didn't
- No, I didn't

311
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:51,628
- So you like to look at underwear?
- What are you doing?

312
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:54,621
- You like it, right?
- I didn't do anything.

313
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:56,602
- You did not do anything?
- I did not do anything.

314
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:57,612
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

315
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:59,629
Give her your cell phone.

316
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,474
Give her your phone!

317
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:04,613
Oy!

318
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,620
It hurts, sir.

319
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,613
It's locked.

320
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:14,614
Pattword...
Pattword...

321
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:18,627
8644

322
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,700
Did you send it to your friend?

323
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:26,263
- No, I didn't.
- Are you sure?

324
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:27,334
I'm sure!

325
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,370
Did you delete it?

326
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,060
Are you sure?

327
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:36,619
Say something!

328
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:38,911
Apologize to her.

329
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:39,956
I'm sorry!

330
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:41,501
I'm so sorry!

331
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:48,966
Next time you want to look,
go see your mom.

332
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,114
Don't do this again.

333
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:52,942
I will not let you off.

334
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:56,427
-Oh!!!
- Hey sir, that's my phone!

335
00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:00,612
Let me go!

336
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:09,606
You're pronunciation is wrong. It should be
"password" instead of "pattword".

00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:10,767
Hey.

338
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:16,667
Oh shit!

339
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:19,349
I scared the shit out of you.

340
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,200
Eww shit!!!

341
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,231
Get me some tissue.

342
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,669
- There's no tissue here.
- Over there!

343
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,580
- This is called a "napkin",

344
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:39,602
- not a tissue
- Hey

345

Why is that shit smell lingering?
Is it eternal shit?

Oh damnit!

Any more?

350
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,300
Little bit.

352
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,613
'Sup man?

What are you reading?

355
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:01,169
Uh, Happy Dolpin.

356
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:03,989
Ah, Happy what?

357
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:07,615
Happy Dophlinth.

358
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,607
It's pronounced...

359
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:12,333
Happy Dolphin.

360

Hey, put it back.

361
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:19,012
Don't read this one,

00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,997
It's for little gay kids.

365
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,053
I prefer the dolpin.

366
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,302
Excuse me.

367
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,582
Do you speak English?
Can you?

368
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,700
Can you?

369
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:47,724
Oh, perfect. Hey... Great

370
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:51,609
I'm looking for this restaurant here.
You know it? You've been there before?

371
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,625
I heard it's really good.

372
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,621
- Talk to him.
- Talk to him yourself.

373
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,004
If it's far? It's no problem.
 I can take a cab no problem at all.

374
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:02,607
Tell him to go away.

375
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,623
Oh, tell him yourself.

How far you think?

00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:22,177
Hey, how's it going?

382
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:23,863
Eww, more friends.

383
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:25,581
I think he said it's far.

384
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,625
It's far? It's fine, I have a map.

385
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,508
- Would you mind here?
- He's got a map.

386
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:32,380
Would you mark here?

387
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:33,910
- Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
- Right here

388
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:35,224
What do you want?

389
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:38,223
- Yes? Do you know?
- Just in the area didn't matter.

390
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:40,122
I don't know what you're saying.

391

Yeah, this, this one?

392

Hi, there...

394
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,965
 I'd gotta run.

395
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:50,428
- Hey, wait.
- What's wrong?

396
00:29:56,622 --> 00:29:57,638
Here.

397
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:03,622
Actually, foreigners aren't that scary.
You can just speak freely.

398
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:13,528
Why?

399
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,405
What are you doing?

400
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,317
I'll make Mama with this.

401
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:18,935
You've finished eating?

402
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,698
Can I take it?

403
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,496
Who taught you this?

404
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,880
I learned it from Kaya.

405
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,935
- You understand her?
- Yeah, I do.

406
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:34,951
This, eat.

407
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:37,262
This, sleep.

408
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:39,005
What if you cannot sleep?

409
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:41,426
This is "cannot sleep".

410
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:44,903
- What if the toilet is full?
- Toilet full?

411
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,966
Are you joking?

412
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:52,482
When you ask her to be your girlfriend,
what do you say?

413
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:57,605
I ride a bicycle, take her to the beach,
wake up and she's my girlfriend.

414
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:01,347
Okay, stop.
Stop right here.

415
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,144

00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,151
- Where? Right here?
- Yes.

417

This is Pruek.

418
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:19,614
Do you want to sleep here?

419
00:31:24,531 --> 00:31:25,614
Who is it?

420
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,611
- Nosy.
- Oh...

421
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:31,917
I asked so you can teach me.
I don't mean to be nosy.

422
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:35,269
It's my boyfriend.

423
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:38,606
- You don't have a boyfriend.
- I do.

424
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,011
Hmmm...

425
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:45,606
If you had a boyfriend, he would come
check me out the first day of tutoring

426
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:53,995
He's not my boyfriend yet, but very close.
I'm waiting for him to ask.

427
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:58,191
I didn't ask you that.
Why did you tell me?

428
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:01,089
Going now.

00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:13,626
Shall we visit the countryside together?

430
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:17,933

Would you like to go on a date?

432

Hello?

Hello, my phone fell over and I
accidentally pressed the button.

440

You accidentally typed an entire sentence?

Yes.

How'd you get the key?

He can't wash it himself?

He has no hands or feet?

Luckily, they returned it.

00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:45,255
Why not?  You have to return
the ring anyway.

506
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:02,888
What is the big deal?

507
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,364
I don't want to.

508
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,872
Hairy.

509
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:40,130
I deny the breakup.

510
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:44,996
She returned it.
That means Game Over.

511
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:46,755
Why are you so stubborn?

512
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:03,583
"I've been an asshole to all my girlfriends,
but I want to be good to you."

513
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:15,645
"I've been an asshole to all my girlfriends,
but I want to be good to you."

514
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:21,627
- Hello, tutor Pleng!
- Hi, Kaya

515
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,613
Today I ran into Yim,
And he has a message for you.

516
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:27,270
Wanna hear it?

517
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:33,612
"I've been an asshole to all my girlfriends,
but I want to be good to you."

518
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:37,489
"Here is your ring back.
Even if you wanna break up with me,

519
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:39,215
I'm not breaking up with you."

520
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,043
What? Is he coming here?

521
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:49,238
Don't tell me, he's gonna
take the interview test to work here.

522
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,472
Yeah.

523
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:55,783
And you have been tutoring him, right?

524
00:41:58,955 --> 00:41:59,837
Yeah.

525
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:02,971
No, you shouldn't have done that.

526
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:04,604
Ewww.

527
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:07,768
But he does study really hard you know.

528
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,893
Oh.. How cute.

529
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,955
You have a dog?
Is that a golden retriever?

530
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,808
Oh boy come here.

531
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:23,674
Hi. I'm Owen.

532
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:30,893
Hi, I'm Pleng.

533
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,603
Bye.

534
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,893
Oh... Hardcore.
Really Hardcore.

535
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:40,323
I hired you to break up with him,
But you're tutoring him to come see me.

536
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:41,862
How could you?

537
00:42:49,205 --> 00:42:55,559
<i>My love for you, in my heart.</i>

538
00:42:55,598 --> 00:43:01,592
<i>It's a secret that I don't
know how to tell you.</i>

539
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:08,608
<i>I have a secret in my heart.
Deep inside my heart.</i>

540
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:14,531
<i>I don't know how to tell you, I love you.</i>

541
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:16,640
<i>I love you.</i>

542
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:24,890
- You cannot contact her?
- No

543
00:43:27,078 --> 00:43:28,531
What time did you Skype her?

544
00:43:30,012 --> 00:43:32,195
I called her many times.

545
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:40,180
Grab your pen and paper.

546
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:43,734
- Do I have to write it down?
- Yes.

547
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:49,640
There are three kind of tenses
in a sentence.

548
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,763
Present, past and future tense.

549
00:43:52,609 --> 00:44:00,515
The structure of present tense is simple,
and that is S + V...

550
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,031
No! Stop!
Can you teach like before?

551
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:09,353
If you don't want to write it down,
then I cannot teach you.

552
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:13,070
Why are you going to
leave me like this?

553
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:16,930
Because your exam is in July.
There's not enough time.

554
00:44:22,047 --> 00:44:23,898
You are too stupid.

555
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,711
Am I really that stupid?

556
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,945
Here, take your money back.

557
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,015
I'm so sorry.

558
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:27,602
Hey, Hey, Hey .. No, don't!

559
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:57,759
Once, once, once, once...

560
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:29,187
Once upon a time.

561
00:46:29,605 --> 00:46:32,914
<i>Once upon a time.</i>

562
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:39,611
<i>There lived an unhappy young girl
named Cinderella.</i>

563
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,613
Yes, Khun Pruek.

564
00:46:46,992 --> 00:46:48,203
Where are you now?

565
00:46:49,054 --> 00:46:50,060
I'm on the way to teach.

566
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:53,969
I want to invite you to my Mom's
birthday at my house.

567
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,461
- Oh, it's your Mom's birthday?
- Yes.

568
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,382
- Which day?
- This Saturday.

569
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,812
Are you available?

570
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,590
I'm available.

571
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:07,437
<i>One day the palace arranged a ball
for the Prince to choose his Princess.</i>

572
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,610
<i>Cinderella stepped down from
the pumpkin carriage,</i>

573
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,629
<i>and found herself standing among
all the beautiful ladies in the kingdom.</i>

574
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:22,625
Is that a hairstyle or a bicycle seat?

575
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:24,961
<i>When the ball started...</i>

576
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:36,125
<i>the Prince gazed directly at Cinderella.</i>

577
00:47:36,724 --> 00:47:40,741
<i>He walked straight to her
and ask her for a dance.</i>

578
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:44,757
Would you like to wipe your mouth?

579
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:45,797
Is it dirty?

580
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:49,625
<i>Cinderella danced with the Prince,
song after song.</i>

581
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:53,582
This is my grandfather's car.

582
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:57,623
<i>Both of them joyfully talked to each other.</i>

583
00:47:58,988 --> 00:48:01,461
Only 3 exist in Thailand.

584
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,094
Would you like to sit inside?

585
00:48:11,526 --> 00:48:14,234
I'll go grab the key.

586
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:33,530
I'm back.

587
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:35,883
<i>Then, at the first stroke of midnight,</i>

588
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,140
<i>before the spell would wear off,</i>

589
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:40,530
<i>Cinderella sadly said goodbye
to the Prince.</i>

590
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:43,628
I think I'd better go, I'm sleepy.

591
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:48,094
<i>In her haste, one of her
glass slippers fell off.</i>

592
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:54,336
<i>The Prince, now madly in love,
had every woman in the kingdom...</i>

593
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:57,272
<i>try on slipper in hope
of finding Cinderella.</i>

594
00:48:57,297 --> 00:48:58,625
Does this belong to Pleng?

595
00:48:59,538 --> 00:49:01,406
Please wait!

596
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:07,607
<i>Before long, the Prince warmly
unites with Cinderella again.</i>

597
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:11,368
Pleng, you left your phone.

598
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:12,476
Thank you.

599
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:14,539
Sorry that you had to run.

600
00:49:14,564 --> 00:49:16,383
If I didn't run to bring you your phone,

601
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:19,569
who would I talk to tonight?

602
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:40,422
"Can I be your boyfriend?"

603
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:46,477
YES

604
00:49:48,608 --> 00:49:51,628
<i>And they lived happily ever after.</i>

605
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,258
<i>The End</i>

606
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:16,711
"Can we celebrate our
1 Day Anniversary tomorrow?"

607
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:34,616
Cuation.

608
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,616
Is it Caotion?

609
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,629
Cau... Cuation. Caotion, Caution.

610
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,398
Hey brother.

611
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,875
Why does Daddy look
so sad lately?

612
00:51:03,906 --> 00:51:06,610
Idiot.  Don't say anything
that sounds Japanese.

613
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:10,414
If Daddy hears it, and thinks about Kaya,
we will be in big trouble.

614
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,906
Jok, you are right.

615
00:51:16,598 --> 00:51:18,281
But, we must support him.

616
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:23,235
You cannot say the word "Hai",
because it sounds Japanese.

617
00:51:23,282 --> 00:51:25,149
Use some other word instead.

618
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:28,976
Yeah, you are right.

619
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:31,898
I'm glad I respect you.

620
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,359
Daddy.

621
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:42,070
Daddy, I see you're working very hard.

622
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:45,126
So I brought an ice water...

623
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:46,359
for you.

624
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:51,144
for you.

625
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,008
Daddy, I'm sorry.

626
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,763
I'm just worried about you, Daddy.
I didn't mean to say "Hai".

627
00:52:04,532 --> 00:52:05,969
What's wrong with you?

628
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:20,655
Very precise.

629
00:52:20,906 --> 00:52:23,616
I can feel it in my neck.

630
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:26,015
It's not too deep.

631
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:44,625
<i>Paging Mr. Yim.
Please meet your teacher at the statue.</i>

632
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:07,018
Translate this for me.

633
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,471
You missed my finger.

634
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:11,666
What's so funny?

635
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,745
Can I teach you again?

636
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:26,266
You want a punch?

637
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,672
If you punch me,
I'll slap you.

638
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:30,549
What? I just want to help you.

639
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:38,081
You said I'm too stupid to learn.

640
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:40,596
Actually...

641
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:44,932
If you want to be fluent,
there's not enough time.

642
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:50,565
But, if you just want to pass the exam,
there is a way.

643
00:53:52,893 --> 00:53:53,901
What way?

644
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:55,508
Practice exam.

645
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:57,733
Memorization.

646
00:53:58,606 --> 00:54:00,127
Let's do it!

647
00:54:00,662 --> 00:54:01,684
Translate, please.

648
00:54:02,533 --> 00:54:04,127
It means "Let's do it!".

649
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:11,922
- Rook.
- Oy, what rook? It's my turn.

650
00:54:11,954 --> 00:54:13,571
Get up and walk over there.

651
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,698
I'm gonna kick you until
your fat explodes.

652
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:28,252
Everyone, this is Pleng, my tutor.

653
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,581
Stand up, please.

654
00:54:35,323 --> 00:54:39,932
Good evening, Teacher.

655
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,906
How are you?

656
00:54:44,424 --> 00:54:48,815
I'm fine.  Thank you.  And you?

657
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:51,799
I'm good.
And I'm glad to meet you guys.

658
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:53,582
She said...

659
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:55,120
I'm a cook...

660
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:56,377
And I use gas...

661
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,167
to fry the fish!

662
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:07,620
Are these all in your department?

663
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,376
Can you take the head cheese...

664
00:55:10,401 --> 00:55:12,251
out of the fridge?

665
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:16,159
Ok, haha.

666
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:20,596
Okay, let's start interview.

667
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:25,157
Okay, let's eat.

668
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:27,590
She's hungryyyyyyyyyy.

669
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,609
Hmm, you learn fast.

670
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:33,526
How do I know what the interviewer
will ask me?

671
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:37,594
I don't know either so we will brainstorm.
The more the better.

672
00:55:39,307 --> 00:55:41,603
Ok!

673
00:55:41,784 --> 00:55:45,237
Why do you want to relocate
to America?

674
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,721
To follow my wife.
Do you have a problem?

675
00:55:46,746 --> 00:55:50,151
If you answer like this,
who will approve?

676
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,602
You must say, you want to gain experience
to improve your work in Thailand.

677
00:55:55,708 --> 00:56:00,597
The hydraulic sound, eed, eed, eed, eed...

678
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:03,751
Can you stop?
"Eed" is my Mom's name.

679
00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:07,657
If it goes eed, eed, eed,
like his Mom's name...

680
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,645
the problem is that
the piston is too narrow.

681
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,231
Perhaps the oil has dried
or the cylinder is broken.

682
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,129
Oh, hey...
Why is your name "Making Milk"?

683
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:19,176
Because my Dad made me
drink milk with whiskey.

684
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,651
- Your power hungry.
- Can you tell me...

685
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:25,531
what is the proper temperature
for the boiler room?

686
00:56:25,563 --> 00:56:28,659
Oh, by the way... Your name is "Snap"
because you like to snap your mustache?

687
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:30,981
He likes to snap...

688
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:32,470
down there.

689
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,485
When the power breaks, will Daddy
fix it or replace it?

690
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,547
I'm the fix-master,
not the replace-master.

691
00:56:39,954 --> 00:56:42,372
Ok! You're hired!

692
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:44,770
Who would turn down a great
employee like you?

693
00:56:44,977 --> 00:56:48,149
Why are you praising him?
You're here to ask questions, not praise!

694
00:57:04,157 --> 00:57:05,368
Woah.

695
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:08,336
He's a good dancer.

696
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:17,266
Hey, why don't you dance with them?

697
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:19,704
I only dance at big events.

698
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,805
This time, let her begin.

699
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,774
We will say the alphabet,  A to Z.

700
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,124
In random order.

701
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:40,852
Daddy, why so little?
Only 3 letters?

702
00:57:40,877 --> 00:57:43,615
Since you said "A to Z",
no one understands.

703
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:45,415
Oh, wait a minute.

704
00:57:45,735 --> 00:57:49,625
If you lose, you get this
in your ass.

705
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,413
The women get it too.

706
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:53,758
Begin.

707
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,610
- X
- A

708
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,296
- T
- M

709
00:57:57,321 --> 00:57:59,266
You going to the ATM?

710
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:01,180
J

711
00:58:01,614 --> 00:58:02,774
Y

712
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,590
- P
- Are you going to the Korean dance?

713
00:58:06,915 --> 00:58:08,094
G!

714
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:09,852
W

715
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:13,297
Come on, come on, hurry up.

716
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,645
R

717
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:16,309
One...

718
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:19,612
- Two...
- Q!

719
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:23,450
K

720
00:58:24,832 --> 00:58:26,317
K is mine!

721
00:58:26,747 --> 00:58:28,915
What should I answer?

722
00:58:29,604 --> 00:58:32,504
I just said D.

723
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:35,530
It's your turn.

724
00:58:35,534 --> 00:58:37,624
What is your answer?

725
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:40,020
One...

726
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,786
Two...

727
00:58:42,149 --> 00:58:44,710
Wait, wait, wait...
X!

728
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:47,180
- Already picked!
- Oh no Daddy!

729
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:48,290
First one.

730
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:50,914
Ladies and Man...

731
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:56,629
It is round 2!!!

732
00:58:59,613 --> 00:59:02,579
- Oh, too deep.
-  Too deep?

733
00:59:03,422 --> 00:59:04,641
To deep, bro!

734
00:59:07,614 --> 00:59:09,611
Ok, Chong Nom.

735
00:59:09,868 --> 00:59:13,836
1, 2, 3...

736
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,605
Is it working, Daddy?

737
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,399
- Let it go!
- I already did!

738
00:59:34,424 --> 00:59:36,391
Let it go all the way!

739
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:50,079
Damnit.

740
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:56,844
It smells like grilled meat.

741
00:59:57,157 --> 00:59:58,559
I cannot shit any more.

742
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:00,286
It's burning my hole.

743
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:02,584
Why did you keep flexing your hole?

744
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,619
Are you doing ok there?

745
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,009
My stomach hurts.

746
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:14,637
Are you gonna die?

747
01:00:23,784 --> 01:00:26,621
Hey, what is breast mouse?

748
01:00:30,558 --> 01:00:33,190
Pervert, pervert, I'll slap you.

749
01:00:37,232 --> 01:00:38,180
Oh?

750
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:44,946
It's not here.

751
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,946
You've already fixed this thing?

752
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:49,790
It looked unrepairable.
I can't believe you fixed it.

753
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:50,782
What?

754
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,948
I'm the repair-master...

755
01:00:52,973 --> 01:00:55,344
whatever is broken, I can fix.

756
01:01:01,985 --> 01:01:03,682
Don't be so sure...

757
01:01:03,878 --> 01:01:06,078
Not everything will be that easy.

758
01:01:09,243 --> 01:01:11,221
If you're referring to Kaya...

759
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,369
I never thought it would be easy.

760
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,369
If she cannot speak Thai,

761
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,840
I will study English.

762
01:01:18,196 --> 01:01:20,534
If studying English is too difficult,

763
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:22,502
I will study Japanese.

764
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,047
Hey!

765
01:01:31,613 --> 01:01:33,790
- Ouch, it's in my eyes!
- What happened?

766
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:36,605
- My contact lens!
- Hey, be careful!

767
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:38,899
This way! Come here!

768
01:01:39,344 --> 01:01:40,625
Here, here...

769
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:43,627
- Why me?
- Here, here...

770
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:46,219
You're extremely near-sighted.

771
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:48,243
Yeah.

772
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:56,641
- Do I look like a blind man?
- I think so.

773
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:01,110
- Translation, please?
- I think so means "I think so."

774
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:03,852
Hey, stop!

775
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:11,883
- Hurry up!
- Slow down please!

776
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,102
Why? We won't make it in time.

777
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:28,790
Hey! Teacher!

778
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:30,375
Oh...

779
01:03:14,612 --> 01:03:16,310
You said you wouldn't laugh.

780
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,013
I can't help it.

781
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:22,506
Damnit...

782
01:03:22,904 --> 01:03:25,612
If Jok saw me, he'd lose respect.

783
01:03:28,396 --> 01:03:29,888
Why do you keep showing me?

784
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:40,618
"Nozzle"

785
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:46,151
"At idle speed, what size of nozzle
should we use?"

786
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:58,073
What are your strengths?
Why should we choose you?

787
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,675
I'm the repair-master.
Anything that is broken, I can fix.

788
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:16,624
I believe that I can repair
anything that is broken.

789
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,405
If English is too difficult,
I will study Japanese.

790
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:37,428
Even if the process is difficult,
I will find a way to repair it.

791
01:05:11,061 --> 01:05:13,143
Before I came to study with you,

792
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:15,088
we had met before.

793
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:17,295
Really?

794
01:05:18,476 --> 01:05:20,791
Do you remember the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs event,

795
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,401
where you were the interpreter?

796
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:23,999
I remember.

797
01:05:24,562 --> 01:05:25,562
Yes, that one.

798
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:28,491
After that, I asked my friend
to find out where you worked.

799
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:30,311
So, I came to study with you.

800
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:33,983
So, you didn't really want
to learn English?

801
01:05:34,937 --> 01:05:35,937
Yes.

802
01:05:36,135 --> 01:05:37,601
I wasn't interested
in learning...

803
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:39,374
only to flirt.

804
01:05:43,614 --> 01:05:44,819
Are you ok?

805
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:48,061
Let me help you.

806
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:50,491
Oh no!

807
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:27,923
I always dreamed of doing this.

808
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:31,716
So romantic.

809
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:36,198
Pleng, can you close your eyes?

810
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,623
Close your eyes.

811
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:41,205
Close my eyes?

812
01:06:50,614 --> 01:06:53,607
SONG FOR LIFE

813
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:57,635
Love is so beautiful,

814
01:06:57,729 --> 01:07:01,291
for my entire life.

815
01:07:01,605 --> 01:07:03,776
I've always been looking for love...

816
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:06,283
I cannot get enough.

817
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:11,664
I want you by my side.

818
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:15,615
Shower me with your love.

819
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:21,619
Always close to me.

820
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,304
Are you happy?

821
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,890
Very much.

822
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:38,257
You love this type of song?

823
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:41,623
I'd sacrifice my life for this song.

824
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,143
I feel very lucky.

825
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:49,128
You have a good sense of humor.

826
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:51,367
I don't have one.

827
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:55,734
Is this guy for real?

828
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:59,838
Khun Pruek, If you want to take
your yacht out,

829
01:07:59,863 --> 01:08:03,136
don't forget to check the
weather forecast.

830
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,373
Weather forecast!
[In foreign accent]

831
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:08,914
Oh, yeah, you mean
weather forecast.

832
01:08:09,859 --> 01:08:12,461
If you want to go to...

833
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:13,679
Munnok Island.

834
01:08:13,704 --> 01:08:15,562
- Mannok Island?
- Munnai -Monsnai?

835
01:08:15,587 --> 01:08:16,640
Or Samet Island...

836
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:17,896
Samet Island?
[In foreign accent]

837
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:19,957
- Samet! Everyone has sex!
[pun]

838
01:08:19,982 --> 01:08:21,557
Ask me any time.

839
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,612
- You ok with that?
- Yes, I'll let you know!

840
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:34,867
Ah, Pleng! There you are.

841
01:08:38,304 --> 01:08:39,976
I have something for you.

842
01:08:41,608 --> 01:08:43,632
Why not for me?
[foreign accent]

843
01:08:43,884 --> 01:08:45,477
Why not me?

844
01:08:45,825 --> 01:08:47,710
Why?

845
01:09:02,533 --> 01:09:05,629
I think this one is a little
bit too small.

846
01:09:06,697 --> 01:09:07,697
Ok.

847
01:09:07,955 --> 01:09:10,169
Then let's try...

848
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,833
this pair.

849
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,627
Let's try it.

850
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:17,942
Hey...

851
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:19,263
it fits well.

852
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:29,098
Actually, you could just call me
and ask my size.

853
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,818
That would spoil the surprise...

854
01:09:30,843 --> 01:09:32,609
for your happiness.

855
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,122
Anything I can do.

856
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:39,130
Ok.

857
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,216
Can I not accept it?

858
01:09:48,326 --> 01:09:49,326
Why not?

859
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:52,138
This pair looks like the one you broke.

860
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,380
Okay.

861
01:10:01,304 --> 01:10:02,809
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

862
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:10,610
Shall we go back to being Teacher
and Student, like before?

863
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:15,138
Why?

864
01:10:15,163 --> 01:10:19,604
Because I went to see a fortune teller...

865
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:23,557
they said not to date someone who
was born in the same month.

866
01:10:23,597 --> 01:10:25,651
It would be bad luck.

867
01:10:33,122 --> 01:10:34,888
We need to write our own destiny.

868
01:10:38,098 --> 01:10:39,192
Can you remember?

869
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:42,098
Yes.

870
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,020
Do your feet hurt?

871
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:49,114
I'll massage your feet.

872
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:53,052
Relax, relax...

873
01:10:53,741 --> 01:10:55,169
Oh, nice sound.

874
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:06,364
What is your job position?

875
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:09,973
I am a maintenance engineer.

876
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:15,610
Hey, I answered correctly!
Why'd you punch me?

877
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:18,998
How do you feel about working
with foreigners?

878
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:22,942
I haven't answered yet.
What's wrong with you?

879
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,671
I'm stressed!

880
01:11:27,604 --> 01:11:28,622
Come on!

881
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:35,628
Hold up.

882
01:11:39,134 --> 01:11:40,778
Come on!

883
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,044
Feel better?

884
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:29,648
Yes.

885
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:31,778
What wrong with you?

886
01:12:32,004 --> 01:12:33,659
I want to break up
with my boyfriend.

887
01:12:34,615 --> 01:12:37,617
She has a punch like Pacquiao.
[Filipino boxer]

888
01:13:02,971 --> 01:13:04,252
Where are you going?

889
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:07,463
Some asshole requested they
close early.

890
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:21,777
What the heck!

891
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,119
Translation, please?

892
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:25,963
It means "we should run".

893
01:13:26,713 --> 01:13:29,607
- Don't tell me that he is...
- Yeah, that's him.

894
01:13:34,088 --> 01:13:36,385
Is that a flower or a shower lid?

895
01:13:42,213 --> 01:13:46,698
As a maintenance engineer,
I believe everything can be fixed,

896
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:48,760
and made to work again.

897
01:13:49,088 --> 01:13:53,361
No matter how hard it is to fix,
I will always find a way.

898
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:57,424
What?

899
01:13:57,846 --> 01:14:00,609
Not finished yet.
There's one more left.

900
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,616
"You will regret it, if you
don't choose me."

901
01:14:03,947 --> 01:14:06,236
You will regret it if you don't choose me.

902
01:14:07,385 --> 01:14:11,822
Well, actually, I don't think this approach
will make them want to hire me.

903
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:13,956
No, I think it's good.

904
01:14:13,981 --> 01:14:16,648
It's straight to the point.
It's perfect for you.

905
01:14:18,369 --> 01:14:19,955
Ok, let's continue.

906
01:14:21,135 --> 01:14:25,697
When the pressure in the cylinder
is abnormally high, how would you fix it?

907
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:27,663
Pressure, pressure...

908
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:32,447
Ah, for me working under pressure
is quite challenging.

909
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,018
Almost correct.

910
01:14:34,613 --> 01:14:36,322
That's for another question.

911
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:41,530
- That's #235
- But pressure is the key word.

912
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:46,151
Yes, but this one is like the "pressure"
at work, not the "pressure" in a machine.

913
01:14:46,298 --> 01:14:48,634
There's your pressure coming.

914
01:14:58,616 --> 01:15:01,613
- Did he see me?
- He didn't look this way.

915
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:06,604
- You should just tell him.
- Breaking his heart is like killing a puppy.

916
01:15:07,057 --> 01:15:09,610
It's not a big deal, he'll survive.

917
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:19,530
Hey...

918
01:15:19,702 --> 01:15:21,526
I wanted to surprise you.

919
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,735
How are you doing?
Do you feel better?

920
01:15:31,768 --> 01:15:33,940
Tui said you weren't feeling well.

921
01:15:34,432 --> 01:15:35,854
Yeah, I feel better.

922
01:15:36,447 --> 01:15:39,625
Here, I brought some dinner.

923
01:15:40,155 --> 01:15:43,891
Oh, no no no, my room
is very messy right now.

924
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:46,604
That's fine, I'll help you.

925
01:15:46,604 --> 01:15:49,158
- Ah...
- You are ill.

926
01:15:49,736 --> 01:15:52,088
It's fine, don't worry about it.

927
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:54,144
What's going on?

928
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:56,901
Oh, it's this guy.

929
01:15:59,445 --> 01:16:00,806
Who are you?

930
01:16:03,854 --> 01:16:04,955
What?

931
01:16:05,612 --> 01:16:07,268
Let's go the room.

932
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:10,143
Excuse me?

933
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:12,276
Who are you?

934
01:16:15,452 --> 01:16:17,713
I'm her husband.

935
01:16:23,605 --> 01:16:25,703
- Umm...
- What's this all about?

936
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:29,624
We started dating less than
a month ago.

937
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,626
Let's go.

938
01:17:24,096 --> 01:17:28,299
Why did you tell him that?
What's he gonna think?

939
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:30,935
I'm helping you.

940
01:17:31,753 --> 01:17:33,457
Should I thank you?

941
01:17:34,346 --> 01:17:37,621
What did you tell him?
He seemed so shocked.

942
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,002
Oh, I said that...

943
01:17:42,299 --> 01:17:43,611
I got you pregnant.

944
01:17:43,782 --> 01:17:46,651
Oh my God!  That's so slutty!

945
01:17:47,606 --> 01:17:49,401
How could you conceive of
such a thing?

946
01:17:49,807 --> 01:17:53,612
Did you ever care about me?
You made me sound like a big slut.

947
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,080
Going now.

948
01:18:06,418 --> 01:18:09,401
Hey, where are you going?
Why don't you use the elevator?

949
01:18:09,502 --> 01:18:12,440
If he's still downstairs,
he will see me.

950
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,172
Going now.

951
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:06,503
Hello, what's up?

952
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:07,791
Hello, where are you?

953
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:10,614
I'm here, buying coffee.

954
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:36,589
- There's no time for coffee, we're late.
- I have my motorcycle, no problem.

955
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,094
What are you wearing?
I told you to dress nicely.

956
01:19:42,126 --> 01:19:44,165
I have it, don't worry.

957
01:19:46,799 --> 01:19:48,768
This is what you brought?

958
01:19:48,793 --> 01:19:49,651
Yes.

959
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:54,618
What the hell do you want?
This is how I dress everyday for work.

960
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:03,220
Hey, hold up!

961
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:05,768
Have you never bought a shirt before?

962
01:20:06,487 --> 01:20:08,010
The tag is still on it.

963
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,682
Oh, I beg your pardon!
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

964
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,377
Ah. He is okay.
Don't worry about it.

965
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,072
I'm so sorry.

966
01:20:23,126 --> 01:20:24,345
Why didn't you respond?

967
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,588
You're not afraid to fight people,
but you're afraid to speak English?

968
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:32,606
-  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
- Whatever "...er" you are.

969
01:20:32,668 --> 01:20:35,408
If you don't start speaking first,
the conversation will never begin.

970
01:20:35,606 --> 01:20:38,603
I don't know why I brought you here.

971
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:42,213
Today, you must speak with
at least 3 foreigners.

972
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:43,331
Understand?

973
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:48,617
How can I talk with them,
they speak so fast.

974
01:20:49,646 --> 01:20:51,127
Listen for the key words.

975
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:20,416
How are you?  How are you?

976
01:21:22,512 --> 01:21:24,151
How are you?

977
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:27,530
How are you... How are you...

978
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:28,502
Hey!

979
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,446
Hey!

980
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:33,994
Who are yow?

981
01:21:34,026 --> 01:21:34,955
Oy!

982
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,627
Who are you?

983
01:21:37,096 --> 01:21:39,244
I am fine. Who am I?

984
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,151
- Is this guy okay?
- You think he has Alzheimer's?

985
01:21:42,299 --> 01:21:44,877
Are you okay?
You okay?

986
01:21:44,955 --> 01:21:48,940
- I am a Maintenance Engineer.
- Oh, Maintenance Engineer.

987
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,196
- That's good for you.
- Congratulations.

988
01:21:51,229 --> 01:21:53,869
Yeah, congratulations.
I wish you are the best.

989
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:56,614
- Good luck.
- Ah, because...

990
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,063
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

991
01:21:58,066 --> 01:21:59,908
- Oh, because sorry?
- Bye Bye!

992
01:21:59,986 --> 01:22:02,166
- Okay, Bye Bye Yeah
- Bye Bye

993
01:22:02,205 --> 01:22:03,877
- Good luck.
- Going now.

994
01:22:05,532 --> 01:22:08,018
Oh!!! Such a weirdo.

995
01:22:08,127 --> 01:22:11,165
I can speak Thai, why does he
have to speak English to me?

996
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:13,602
"Maintenance Engineer", you buffalo.

997
01:22:13,602 --> 01:22:15,612
I agree.

998
01:22:46,616 --> 01:22:48,268
You come one?

999
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:49,995
Pardon?

1000
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,126
Ah, father, mother?

1001
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:55,592
My parents are standing right over there.

1002
01:22:55,617 --> 01:23:00,408
- Standing?
- My mother is a lady in the blue dress.

1003
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,376
Mother... Blue dress...

1004
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:07,623
Nice white skin.

1005
01:23:19,896 --> 01:23:21,616
Woah!

1006
01:23:21,989 --> 01:23:23,316
Are you very excited?

1007
01:23:23,894 --> 01:23:25,094
You like to dance?

1008
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,621
Oh yeah?

1009
01:23:35,531 --> 01:23:36,778
Who the fuck are you?

1010
01:23:39,989 --> 01:23:41,621
No.

1011
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:45,617
Who's kid that?
So cute.

1012
01:23:56,105 --> 01:23:59,418
Oh, he only dances at big events.

1013
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:08,926
Thank you for attending
the event tonight.

1014
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:12,832
We must thank Pleng,
our lovely translator.

1015
01:24:12,871 --> 01:24:13,880
Thank you.

1016
01:24:14,067 --> 01:24:17,707
Thank you everyone for your presence
here tonight. Please enjoy the night.

1017
01:24:18,823 --> 01:24:22,512
- Ok I'll see you later, thank you.
- Ok thank you.

1018
01:24:37,491 --> 01:24:38,199
Hey...

1019
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,013
Would you like to leave?

1020
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,864
No it's ok, I can wait.

1021
01:24:43,531 --> 01:24:44,590
Why aren't you wearing them?

1022
01:24:44,903 --> 01:24:47,653
They're broken.  They guy didn't
repair them properly.

1023
01:24:48,421 --> 01:24:49,668
Can you hold it for me?

1024
01:24:53,608 --> 01:24:55,231
Thanks.

1025
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:08,723
I'm very interested in your culture.

1026
01:25:08,762 --> 01:25:13,609
I'd love to know a bit more
about the elegant hand movement

1027
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:16,746
- How did they do that?
- Like this.

1028
01:25:16,777 --> 01:25:18,223
I can not.

1029
01:25:23,065 --> 01:25:24,473
...and no shoes.

1030
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:26,418
Oh, sorry...

1031
01:25:26,612 --> 01:25:28,618
my shoes are broken.

1032
01:25:30,063 --> 01:25:33,605
Please give a warm welcome to our guest.

1033
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:38,571
Do you understand? Or are
you just clapping along?

1034
01:25:39,188 --> 01:25:40,625
Yeah, I understand.

1035
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:44,203
- <i>Good evening.</i>
- Good evening.

1036
01:25:44,453 --> 01:25:47,021
- Wow.
- I can translate the whole song.

1037
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,553
<i>Tonight...</i>

1038
01:25:53,586 --> 01:25:54,953
Tonight.

1039
01:25:55,007 --> 01:25:58,524
<i>It's just the two of us.</i>

1040
01:25:58,549 --> 01:26:00,008
It's just the two of us.

1041
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:04,453
<i>So, forget the world for a while.</i>

1042
01:26:05,628 --> 01:26:07,071
Forget the world.

1043
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:07,766
Yes.

1044
01:26:10,606 --> 01:26:15,633
Open your eyes...
Open your eyes?

1045
01:26:15,688 --> 01:26:18,055
That's correct. Be confident.

1046
01:26:21,102 --> 01:26:22,453
You.

1047
01:26:25,621 --> 01:26:28,624
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

1048
01:26:31,531 --> 01:26:36,605
- Sounds like "do do, doo doo"?
- No it's not, listen carefully.

1049
01:26:43,813 --> 01:26:45,758
Can I ride home with you?

1050
01:26:45,835 --> 01:26:47,653
My dog's very vicious.

1051
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,547
Don't help me with this line.

1052
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:05,018
Ok, maybe I need your help.

1053
01:27:13,606 --> 01:27:16,937
I promise I will be forever yours.

1054
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:27,945
Let me walk you home.

1055
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:34,620
<i>Before this morning,
before the sunrise.</i>

1056
01:27:35,605 --> 01:27:37,484
Morning?

1057
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:49,570
Before I go back to reality and you...

1058
01:27:51,618 --> 01:27:54,595
go back to your life.

1059
01:28:02,922 --> 01:28:06,613
Tell me that you feel the same way too.

1060
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,609
I've already fixed them.

1061
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:28,886
Going now, Thank you.

1062
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:11,195
Daddy, why'd you come back so late?

1063
01:30:11,765 --> 01:30:13,607
Having an interview tomorrow?

1064
01:30:14,018 --> 01:30:16,203
Are you crazy?
It's next month.

1065
01:30:17,766 --> 01:30:20,836
I just went to help them
clean up the room.

1066
01:30:25,352 --> 01:30:26,117
<i>June.</i>

1067
01:30:26,142 --> 01:30:28,133
Oh crap!
June is not July.

1068
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,695
Right, July is Karakada.

1069
01:30:29,789 --> 01:30:33,445
The talking Dict is incorrect.
Daddy is correct.

1070
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,161
Correct your ass!
I'm wrong.

1071
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,258
Everyone knows I'm wrong!

1072
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:40,035
Stop praising me!

1073
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:45,623
He scolded me again!

1074
01:30:54,614 --> 01:30:56,624
Hello Teacher.

1075
01:31:02,953 --> 01:31:04,609
Calm down.

1076
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:14,626
Ok, come on over.

1077
01:31:30,806 --> 01:31:34,218
I'm sorry, I'm very stupid.

1078
01:31:41,378 --> 01:31:42,836
You can remember everything?

1079
01:31:43,384 --> 01:31:44,397
Yes.

1080
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:48,177
There are no corrections needed.

1081
01:32:11,585 --> 01:32:12,884
Teacher...

1082
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:18,718
Oy!

1083
01:32:27,596 --> 01:32:29,878
Go sit over there.

1084
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:32,494
If she sees you with me,
she will misunderstand.

1085
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:48,031
Hello tutor Pleng!

1086
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,070
How are you?

1087
01:32:49,095 --> 01:32:50,695
Fine and you?

1088
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:53,226
I'm doing great.

1089
01:32:53,343 --> 01:32:58,554
Today is the day of the interview.
Is he still going?

1090
01:33:00,858 --> 01:33:03,583
- I guess so.
- That's good.

1091
01:33:04,296 --> 01:33:07,264
Because I need all of the help from you.

1092
01:33:07,484 --> 01:33:08,186
Huh?

1093
01:33:08,218 --> 01:33:14,335
I know the important answer that
will help him to pass the interview test.

1094
01:33:14,374 --> 01:33:17,114
So he can come see me.

1095
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,327
What? Say that again?

1096
01:33:19,352 --> 01:33:24,225
Tell Yim to remember the
name of the company's founder.

1097
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:33,733
What is the intention of
your change of heart?

1098
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,841
You've have been refusing
to encounter this fella all along.

1099
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:39,999
I just changed my mind.

1100
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:42,905
Why are you talking funny?

1101
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:44,031
Oh...

1102
01:33:44,647 --> 01:33:48,897
Right now I'm in the middle of
translating some legal documents.

1103
01:33:49,022 --> 01:33:50,872
All the vocab must be rubbing off.

1104
01:33:50,929 --> 01:33:56,952
- I see.
- So, how about Mr. Golden Retriever?

1105
01:33:56,977 --> 01:34:00,179
He will be away for 3 months.

1106
01:34:00,204 --> 01:34:03,116
We have an open relationship.

1107
01:34:03,624 --> 01:34:06,579
So, I can see anybody I like.

1108
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:12,522
So, when he returns
What will happen with Yim?

1109
01:34:13,072 --> 01:34:15,600
Why do you sound concerned?

1110
01:34:17,727 --> 01:34:19,720
I'm just curious.

1111
01:34:27,861 --> 01:34:30,858
- What?
- Oh, My God.

1112
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,546
You love Yim.

1113
01:34:36,559 --> 01:34:38,593
Oh my God... Oh my God...

1114
01:34:38,788 --> 01:34:41,046
You guys had sex.

1115
01:34:41,569 --> 01:34:42,944
Hell no.

1116
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:44,975
Stop it!

1117
01:34:51,584 --> 01:34:56,155
Tutor Pleng be careful
your going to get hurt.

1118
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:58,983
Be ready to pick your broken heart...

1119
01:35:12,024 --> 01:35:13,804
What did she tell you?

1120
01:35:16,846 --> 01:35:18,475
She wants you to meet her.

1121
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:25,510
That's it.

1122
01:35:29,295 --> 01:35:31,202
I heard her say...

1123
01:35:33,967 --> 01:35:35,600
"You love Yim."

1124
01:35:44,366 --> 01:35:45,416
I like you.

1125
01:35:53,104 --> 01:35:55,114
You still want to go for the exam?

1126
01:36:05,558 --> 01:36:07,077
I intend to go.

1127
01:36:08,281 --> 01:36:09,679
Anyway, I must go.

1128
01:36:16,147 --> 01:36:17,225
True.

1129
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:20,484
How can a tutor like me...

1130
01:36:20,897 --> 01:36:22,606
fall in love with a student?

1131
01:36:40,412 --> 01:36:42,999
She told me she wants you back.

1132
01:36:54,566 --> 01:36:58,804
<i>I believe I can fix it to work again.</i>

1133
01:36:59,663 --> 01:37:04,570
<i>Anything I need to fix,
I will always find a way.</i>

1134
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,577
Today, I will go first.

1135
01:37:19,105 --> 01:37:22,092
Fairy Tale.

1136
01:37:31,921 --> 01:37:35,827
Once upon a time a little
 girl dream of being a Princess.

1137
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:40,264
And meeting a charming Prince
that would sweep her off her feet.

1138
01:37:40,725 --> 01:37:45,100
In the real world, a Princess
may not want Prince charming.

1139
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:48,672
But just an ordinary shoemaker.

1140
01:37:49,877 --> 01:37:53,213
And it is not Prince charming's fault.

1141
01:37:53,799 --> 01:37:55,229
You knows what's funny?

1142
01:37:56,237 --> 01:38:01,830
In the end who knows? The shoemaker
may not want the Princess either.

1143
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:09,166
Therefore it is not necessary for the story
to end with "happily ever after".

1144
01:38:16,096 --> 01:38:17,924
I admit that it hurts.

1145
01:38:19,313 --> 01:38:21,572
It's easy to understand
once you admit it.

1146
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:25,221
There's something I'd like clear up.

1147
01:38:25,426 --> 01:38:26,824
I'm not pregnant.

1148
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,160
So what makes you think that..

1149
01:38:34,668 --> 01:38:36,401
I believe you're pregnant?

1150
01:38:37,207 --> 01:38:38,902
Umm...

1151
01:38:40,697 --> 01:38:43,694
That day at my condo...

1152
01:38:45,572 --> 01:38:49,585
that guy whispered in your ear.

1153
01:38:54,547 --> 01:38:56,144
He said...

1154
01:38:58,106 --> 01:38:59,668
Pleng is his woman.

1155
01:39:00,777 --> 01:39:02,575
Stay away from her.

1156
01:39:08,563 --> 01:39:11,569
He was just saying that.

1157
01:39:24,035 --> 01:39:26,580
Do you remember about
my destiny mole story?

1158
01:39:27,902 --> 01:39:29,449
Yes, I remember.

1159
01:39:29,567 --> 01:39:30,949
My mole...

1160
01:39:31,192 --> 01:39:33,325
needs to find destiny to erase it.

1161
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:39,566
Did this take you long to think about?

1162
01:39:42,266 --> 01:39:45,688
But I think you might have
found your destiny mole.

1163
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,564
Yes.

1164
01:40:02,362 --> 01:40:06,313
BROKEN HEART SONG

1165
01:41:00,557 --> 01:41:05,570
"You must remember the founder's
name of the Japanese company."

1166
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,580
Nohada Toichi

1167
01:41:33,123 --> 01:41:35,564
Mr. Willay, have a seat.

1168
01:41:40,185 --> 01:41:42,639
Why do you want to work in the US?

1169
01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:44,577
Why US?

1170
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:50,006
I want to learn new experience...

1171
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:55,162
and come back to apply
here in Thailand.

1172
01:41:55,396 --> 01:41:59,357
Do you think you'll have any problems
working in a foreign country?

1173
01:41:59,674 --> 01:42:00,803
No problem.

1174
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:02,843
I am a professional.

1175
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:09,373
It is the nature of our work that we have
to deal with high pressure situations.

1176
01:42:09,619 --> 01:42:11,389
Do you think you can handle it?

1177
01:42:12,647 --> 01:42:15,054
Is it emotional pressure,
or machine pressure?

1178
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:24,997
It takes a lot to work in
high-pressure machinery.

1179
01:42:31,584 --> 01:42:35,560
For me, working under pressure
is quite challenging.

1180
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:38,740
Are you trying to
compare yourself to a machine?

1181
01:42:42,342 --> 01:42:43,560
What about you?

1182
01:42:46,677 --> 01:42:47,700
What about you?

1183
01:42:48,565 --> 01:42:50,068
What do I think?

1184
01:42:50,115 --> 01:42:51,209
Yeah.

1185
01:42:51,253 --> 01:42:52,404
Yeah.

1186
01:42:52,585 --> 01:42:56,779
I think you're trying to illustrate
how you feel about things.

1187
01:42:56,812 --> 01:43:00,192
Uh, working on high pressure
machinery is dangerous,

1188
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:02,722
but you're up to the
challenge right?

1189
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,623
- "I think so" means you agree.
- I think so.

1190
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:13,627
Why should we choose you?
What are you strong points?

1191
01:43:14,557 --> 01:43:19,574
As a Maintenance Engineer, I believe
everything can be fix and made to work again.

1192
01:43:19,578 --> 01:43:24,537
No matter how hard it is
to fix I will always find a way.

1193
01:43:26,481 --> 01:43:27,747
<i>Not finished yet...</i>

1194
01:43:28,075 --> 01:43:29,942
<i>There's one more sentence...</i>

1195
01:43:30,028 --> 01:43:32,184
<i>You will regret it if
you don't choose me.</i>

1196
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,685
You will regret it if
you don't choose me

1197
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:42,687
Alright then, thank you
for your participation.

1198
01:43:42,712 --> 01:43:44,692
Thank you.

1199
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:21,841
Wait!

1200
01:44:22,067 --> 01:44:25,191
I have one last question.

1201
01:44:25,216 --> 01:44:26,020
Yeah?

1202
01:44:26,045 --> 01:44:30,561
What is the name of our
company's founder?

1203
01:44:35,562 --> 01:44:37,060
Eh?

1204
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:41,755
- For you.
- Huh?

1205
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,796
Teacher, someone asked me
to give this to you.

1206
01:45:06,755 --> 01:45:10,052
<i>Teacher, I received the interview results</i>

1207
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:12,075
<i>I didn't pass.</i>

1208
01:45:12,912 --> 01:45:16,255
<i>Actually, I wanted to pass,
to make you proud.</i>

1209
01:45:16,301 --> 01:45:20,532
What is the name of our
company's founder?

1210
01:45:22,567 --> 01:45:24,573
Doraemon
[Anime character]

1211
01:45:25,564 --> 01:45:28,716
<i>It's difficult for me to say
sweet things.</i>

1212
01:45:30,318 --> 01:45:32,177
<i>However...</i>

1213
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,599
<i>please listen to me.</i>

1214
01:45:35,755 --> 01:45:39,060
<i>I'm not in love with her.</i>

1215
01:45:39,779 --> 01:45:42,013
<i>I just want to be good...</i>

1216
01:45:42,474 --> 01:45:44,013
<i>with one woman.</i>

1217
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:46,450
<i>That's it...</i>

1218
01:45:46,623 --> 01:45:50,811
<i>and then she comes along.</i>

1219
01:45:51,825 --> 01:45:55,208
<i>Damnit.  Stupid me.</i>

1220
01:45:56,557 --> 01:45:59,974
<i>I threw the ring in the toilet.</i>

1221
01:46:01,645 --> 01:46:04,528
<i>I'm sorry that I didn't come to
say all this in person.</i>

1222
01:46:05,476 --> 01:46:06,781
<i>That's it.</i>

1223
01:46:08,866 --> 01:46:11,468
<i>I'm an asshole.</i>

1224
01:46:47,897 --> 01:46:50,578
Teacher, I want to ask you something.

1225
01:46:52,225 --> 01:46:56,373
If I want to tell Kaya, that I'm not
going to see her any more...

1226
01:46:58,061 --> 01:46:59,491
How do I say it?

1227
01:46:59,516 --> 01:47:02,850
Actually, you could have just asked me
this on the phone.

1228
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:07,560
Oh.

1229
01:47:08,557 --> 01:47:12,577
I can break up with a woman
on the phone,

1230
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:17,561
but I can't tell her I have feelings
for her on the phone.

1231
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:25,566
I wanted to see the look on your face when
I said I like you.

1232
01:47:28,226 --> 01:47:29,226
Anyway...

1233
01:47:31,022 --> 01:47:32,725
Teacher...

1234
01:47:33,662 --> 01:47:36,873
do you still feel the same?

1235
01:47:41,564 --> 01:47:44,558
Why are you looking at me
like this?

1236
01:47:45,937 --> 01:47:47,968
Don't cry.

1237
01:47:49,247 --> 01:47:51,380
Which part are you listening to?

1238
01:48:01,163 --> 01:48:15,561
As a Maintenance Engineer, I believe
everything can be fixed and made to work again.

1239
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:21,597
No matter how hard it is
to fix, I will always find a way.

1240
01:48:22,565 --> 01:48:25,390
I will find a way.

1241
01:48:25,976 --> 01:48:29,177
You will regret it if you don't choose me.

1242
01:48:31,794 --> 01:48:34,257
I will be very regretful.

1243
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:36,018
If you don't choose me.

1244
01:48:39,519 --> 01:48:40,879
I think so.

1245
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,138
Translation, please?

1246
01:48:46,164 --> 01:48:49,155

What about you?

1259
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:11,322
I think so!

1260
01:50:15,556 --> 01:50:16,963

Oh yeah!

THE END

1269
01:50:43,559 --> 01:50:46,186
I used to live in Ohio.
[with bad foreign accent]

1270
01:50:46,211 --> 01:50:47,531
Ok, that's a new state.

1271
01:50:47,556 --> 01:50:50,169
- It has a song, too.
- I've never heard of "Ohao".

1272
01:50:50,194 --> 01:50:52,535
- They have a national theme song.
- How does it go?

1273
01:50:52,574 --> 01:50:54,593
Ohao, Ohao...

1274
01:50:55,577 --> 01:50:59,044
Ohao-ha-Ohaho...

1275
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:02,588
- Can you sing the song?
- No, I cannot sing.

1276
01:51:04,558 --> 01:51:06,554
I've never seen a foreigner
with such an accent.

1277
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:10,897
- Okay, let's start interview.
- Okay...

1278
01:51:10,922 --> 01:51:13,710
Let's eat, she's hungry.

1279
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:15,944
Let's start interview!

1280
01:51:16,031 --> 01:51:18,530
Let's eat, she's hungry.

1281
01:51:18,874 --> 01:51:21,577
Let's start interview!

1282
01:51:23,406 --> 01:51:26,983
Ok, let's eat, she's hungry!
