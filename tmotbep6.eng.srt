1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,879
I think you like Nut, Tofu.

2
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,879
You didn't use your experience
as material, right?

3
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
If for you, normal means

4
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,919
only thinking the way you do,

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,759
then half the world would be abnormal.

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,759
If I remember who I am,

7
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,159
I have to leave.

8
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,960
I want to record my time with you,

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,960
so it can be my memory.

10
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,639
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

11
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,800
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

12
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
If you want it,

13
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,960
wait until I'm dead.

14
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,560
When will you understand

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,439
that going into someone's room
without permission

16
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,400
is an invasion of privacy?

17
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,000
If you're happy,

18
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,960
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

19
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,159
will come to you naturally.

20
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,240
Mister.

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Song.

22
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,439
What's that smell?

23
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,439
Song.

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Song.

25
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Song.

26
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Song.

27
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,360
Song.

28
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,919
Song!

29
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,159
Song.

30
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,360
Song, wake up.

31
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,479
Song.

32
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,599
Song.

33
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,159
Song, get up.

34
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,519
Get up.

35
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,399
What happened?

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,399
I can't…

37
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Don't fall asleep.

38
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,480
You can't die on me.

39
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,759
Come on.

40
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,519
One, two…

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
Let's go.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,759
You can't die on me, Song.

43
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,920
Come on.

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,519
Song.

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,439
Are you okay? Come on.

46
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,360
I need a stretcher.

47
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,879
-This person is hurt.
-This way.

48
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,160
Bring the stretcher.

49
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,920
-Come on.
-Let's go.

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,600
Gen.

51
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,959
What's happening?

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Mom.

53
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,639
The guy who went inside is my friend.

54
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,240
Go park your car. It's blocking the way.

55
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll take care of this end.

56
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,079
Dad.

57
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,839
Why are you here?

58
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,839
I'm here to pick your mom up.

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
Who's that?

60
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,079
Well…

61
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,720
He's an actor in Nut's series.

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
I found him

63
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,639
-in bad shape
-I see.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,480
so I brought him here.

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Were you on the set?

66
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
No.

67
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,399
Wait.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
Where did you find him?

69
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,000
At his house.

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
I went

71
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
to talk to him.

72
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,480
-Oh, my…
-Oh, my…

73
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
-Our son went to a man's house.
-I know.

74
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,720
Mom.

75
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,560
It was necessary.

76
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,839
Why are you investigating me?

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,360
You seem to care about him,
but he's not your friend.

78
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,839
-That's why I asked.
-Yes.

79
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,319
I'm worried the series

80
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,639
will be affected.

81
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,560
If you're short of an actor,

82
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,199
it's a big deal, Dad.

83
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,839
Nut is fixing the drafts all by himself.

84
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
He's got enough on his plate.

85
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want to make it worse.

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,959
I see.

87
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,240
You worry about Nut.

88
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,279
Who else am I supposed to worry about?

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,839
-My goodness.
-Well…

90
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,879
Him, maybe.

91
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,199
He's fine. He has diarrhea, that's all.

92
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,920
We call it non-stop shitting.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
He's a shitting dog.

94
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,519
So it's just

95
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,839
-diarrhea?
-Yes.

96
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,240
-It's diarrhea.
-He's a friend?

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,639
Gosh.

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,800
-Yes.
-I see.

99
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,959
A friend and a brother.

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,279
Is that so?

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,399
Are you all right?

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,199
Tell us.

103
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm fine, Dad. I'm usually like this.

104
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,439
I see.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,439
He's sweating.

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,800
Bring it on.

107
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,959
Catch me.

108
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,680
Bring it on.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,519
Bring it on.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,439
No.

111
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,839
I love you, mister.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,920
Fuck.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
I died.

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
I know you heard me.

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,399
What?

116
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
I was

117
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,879
playing a game.

118
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,360
You know what?

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,679
I'll call a nurse for you.

120
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,279
I love you, mister.

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,399
I love you, mister.

122
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,840
I love you, mister.

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,600
I love you, mister.

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,759
I love you, mister.

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
I love you, mister.

126
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,679
-I love you, mister.
-Stop.

127
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,600
A nurse

128
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,919
might hear you.

129
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,279
I love you, mister.

130
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,639
-I love you, mister.
-Stop.

131
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,600
I said, be quiet.

132
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,639
They might hear you.

133
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,720
Okay?

134
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,879
But I really love you.

135
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
Give me your hand.

136
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,879
My hand?

137
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,120
I don't want your phone.

138
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,320
I need support from you.

139
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,639
-Please.
-Just be quiet.

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,879
Kuenchai.

141
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,559
You came to play inside this room again.

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,759
Go away. Get out.

143
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,440
Gosh.

144
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,679
This dog.

145
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,240
All right.

146
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,000
-What?
-Do you love him?

147
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
-What?
-Do you?

148
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,360
-No.
-You love him, don't you?

149
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,559
No!

150
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,159
Sib.

151
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,559
Mrs. Na.

152
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,519
Are you okay?

153
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,799
I'm fine.

154
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,240
I accidentally dropped those.

155
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,679
Do you like history books?

156
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes.

157
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,759
I used to teach social science.

158
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,519
That's why I have history books.

159
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,440
Is history fun?

160
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,960
Of course.

161
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,600
You study important events from the past

162
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,559
to understand the present

163
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,919
and use them to guide the future,

164
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,200
so history doesn't repeat itself.

165
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,759
In that case,

166
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,440
if we realize

167
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,960
that we are unhappy
because of our bitter past,

168
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,519
can we create new history?

169
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,120
So we might end up happy in the future.

170
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,120
She was suffering.

171
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,759
That's why she created a new world.

172
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,159
And Nut is suffering

173
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
because he locked the old world up.

174
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,799
He can't make use

175
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,159
of those old memories.

176
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

177
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,480
is to find a new one, right?

178
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,080
If you're happy,

179
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,120
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

180
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,080
will come to you naturally.

181
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,279
I gave you a ladder, but why don't you
have the courage to climb it?

182
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Go back

183
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,960
and think about
what your problem is and fix it.

184
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,279
I don't want to see a wall
in front of you your whole life.

185
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,200
Humans are so complicated.

186
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,600
Humans are like that, Teddy.

187
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,159
You might become
more complicated yourself.

188
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,960
I feel so sorry for Nut.

189
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm going to help him.

190
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,639
Prib said

191
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,120
Nut can't write romantic scenes

192
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,720
because he has a bitter past.

193
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,679
I might not be able to change his past,

194
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,559
but I will help him get over it.

195
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,759
What are you doing in my room?

196
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,759
We need to talk.

197
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,159
Stop.

198
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,159
Let me get dressed.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I talked to your mom about history.

200
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
Why don't you create new history

201
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,360
if your past was bad?

202
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,799
What are you saying?

203
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Let's create new history together, Nut.

204
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,919
I want to make you happy.

205
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,919
With good memories,

206
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,320
you will have stories to tell.

207
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,720
Look ahead,

208
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,639
look around you,

209
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,360
and open up your heart.

210
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,200
Wait.

211
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,440
Is your name Tofu?

212
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,440
I'll let you stay here.

213
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,600
Nut.

214
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,000
Nut.

215
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,399
Why are you being quiet?

216
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,799
All right then.

217
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,960
Let's try it.

218
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,360
But since it's your idea,

219
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,720
you must take responsibility.

220
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,799
Let's go on a date.

221
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,960
We are here.

222
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,960
CAN TOSS

223
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,000
Tofu.

224
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
Is this where you wanted to take me?

225
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,400
Yes.

226
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Do you like it?

227
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,119
I do.

228
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,119
Let's go.

229
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,680
RING TOSS

230
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,279
Take that.

231
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,240
Nut.

232
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,039
Look.

233
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,359
It's switched off.

234
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,400
Tell me next time.

235
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
Drink some juice, Nut.

236
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,799
Nut.

237
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,720
Tofu.

238
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,839
This isn't juice. It's herbal liquor.

239
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,759
-It's juice.
-Oh, my god.

240
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,519
It's fermented juice.

241
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,839
Come take a look.

242
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,119
Welcome.

243
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

244
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,680
-She sells many types of juice.
-That's right.

245
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,480
I see Trembling Girl,

246
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
-Elephant Power…
-Trumpet.

247
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,039
And Tiger Power.

248
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,359
-I have everything.
-Tofu.

249
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,680
Welcome.

250
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,000
-Is this it?
-Yes.

251
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
-This is it.
-I've tried them all.

252
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,720
This is the best one.

253
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,640
Take your pick.

254
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,599
-Can I take this home?
-No.

255
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,599
-Tofu, stop. Put it down.
-Sure.

256
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,200
-I'll give you a special price.
-That's all right.

257
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,240
Put it down.

258
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,880
We also have a set.

259
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,039
A set?

260
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,079
Do you want some?

261
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,839
It's pickled fruit.

262
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,759
Please have a taste.

263
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,119
-It's good for your circulation.
-Tofu.

264
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
-Try it.
-How much have you had?

265
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
-Just ten shots.
-What?

266
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,440
Nut, can you bike in a straight line?

267
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
You are so drunk.

268
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,759
-I'm not drunk.
-Careful.

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,319
Not drunk, my ass.

270
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,240
I've been going in circles.

271
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
I don't want to go home yet.

272
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,559
You don't want to go home,

273
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,240
but I do.

274
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,440
Really?

275
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,920
Tofu.

276
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,160
-I can walk home.
-Oh, my god.

277
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
You're a weird drunk.

278
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,960
I'm not drunk.

279
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
I can walk ten more laps.

280
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,079
One.

281
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,559
Two.

282
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,200
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

283
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,160
Tofu.

284
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,599
Are you okay?

285
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,640
Get on. We're going home.

286
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,279
You want to go home?

287
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,559
You asked me out.

288
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,160
Why did we have to come here?

289
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
How is it romantic?

290
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
I don't know.

291
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,359
I wanted to come.

292
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,519
Did you not want to come?

293
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Do I look like I wanted to come?

294
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,880
Where should we go for our date?

295
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,359
The market is good enough for you.

296
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,960
Give me somewhere more meaningful.

297
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Does anyone know

298
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,839
where Nut wants to go?

299
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,200
Yes, I know a place.

300
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,599
Nut wrote how he wanted to go there
and drew a picture of it long ago.

301
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Where is it?

302
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
Follow me, Nut.

303
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,720
Where are you going?

304
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,920
Answer me first, Tofu.

305
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,000
Tofu.

306
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,920
What made you think I wanted to come?

307
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,640
Does it matter?

308
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,079
I just want you to be happy,

309
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,599
smile

310
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,319
and laugh like you did today.

311
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,599
You need to remember
this moment to write the script.

312
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,720
I like seeing you happy.

313
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,359
Tofu.

314
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
Let's find a place to hide.

315
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,720
Why?

316
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,359
I've never played in the rain.

317
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,680
Woo-hoo.

318
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,480
You've gone crazy.

319
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,119
Let's go or you'll get sick.

320
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,119
The rain is so cooling, Nut.

321
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,480
It's as cooling as a shower.

322
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,079
You will be dry later

323
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,119
when the rain stops.

324
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
Don't be scared.

325
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,799
Come.

326
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,839
Are you happy, Nut?

327
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,240
Woo-hoo!

328
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,839
I made coffee for you.

329
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,640
You haven't showered.

330
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,240
I'll help you.

331
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,839
Do you know

332
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,240
how things will end

333
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,319
if you're too good to me?

334
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
What did you say?

335
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,279
I said,

336
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,960
do you know how things will end

337
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,240
if you're too good?

338
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,720
I'm kidding.

339
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,119
Go away. I need to work.

340
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,759
Go.

341
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,599
Go take a shower.

342
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
What's wrong with me?

343
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,559
Is it because of Nut?

344
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
My heart is racing

345
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
and my face

346
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,920
feels hot.

347
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,880
It's hotter than usual.

348
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,200
Why is my body so hot?

349
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,279
My whole body feels hot.

350
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,119
But I'm happy.

351
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,799
Is this

352
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,000
what they call…

353
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,599
This is for you.

354
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,680
Tofu.

355
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:57,839
Tofu.

356
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,960
You are so gross.

357
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,200
Go take a shower.

358
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,640
Tofu.

359
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,519
Oh, my god.

360
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,359
You're burning up.

361
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,680
It ends with me caring for you.

362
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,960
Look.

363
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,559
-You're mine.
-Wow.

364
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,519
-How was that?
-You're good, Nut.

365
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
Watch me.

366
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,039
Oh, no.

367
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,119
Nut.

368
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,359
You go first.

369
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
BALLOON POP

370
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,000
Watch me.

371
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,640
Yes.

372
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,720
-Oh, my god. Watch me.
-Oh, no. Nut.

373
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, what?

374
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
-Oh, god.
-Oh, god.

375
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,000
Come on.

376
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,960
I have to win.

377
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,319
So close, Tofu.

378
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,240
Go.

379
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,240
Tofu.

380
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,119
Let's go.

381
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,039
What the hell?

382
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,039
It's hard.

383
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
Tofu, throw it.

384
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
What's wrong?

385
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,599
If I throw this ring,

386
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,720
I won't have one for you.

387
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,279
How lame.

388
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,839
Nut.

389
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,599
If you want me to propose,
buy me more rings.

390
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,279
Nut.

391
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,240
Thank you.

392
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,160
Yours is bigger.

393
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,559
Do you like this place?

394
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,599
That's great. I'm happy
to take you to a better place.

395
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,960
You make it sound like I'm dead.

396
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
How do you know my likes and dislikes?

397
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,759
I always pay attention to you.

398
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,640
Let's take a selfie.

399
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,960
I want to capture our day together

400
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,160
to remember it by.

401
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:51,440
Nut, look.

402
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,880
You can see the candy.

403
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,839
No.

404
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,160
That trick is getting old.

405
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,440
Tofu.

406
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,400
Where are you going?

407
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,839
I'm going behind the hut.

408
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,759
Thank you.

409
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,119
You're frying pork in the office?

410
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,160
I can do anything for love.

411
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
I worked on the recipe all night.

412
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,240
Juea approved it.

413
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,599
I hope he doesn't get cancer.

414
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,400
The pork is way too burnt

415
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,839
to eat.

416
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Nut eats it like this.

417
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,599
Do you think he eats it

418
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
because it's burned?

419
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,319
It's about the person who makes it.

420
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,000
If he were to fall for you,

421
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,799
this pork wouldn't be the reason.

422
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,920
He would love you for you.

423
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Do you understand?

424
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,559
Who made it for him?

425
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,159
Only his mom and Tofu live with him.

426
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,800
Do you think that person…

427
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,840
What?

428
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,840
Don't be sad. I'm here.

429
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,079
I knew you would come,

430
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,119
so I waited for you.

431
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,800
Thank you for watching me all night

432
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,159
and taking me home.

433
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,480
I'm taking responsibility
for giving you diarrhea.

434
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,519
Did you tell your dad?

435
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,559
He's busy.

436
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,480
He'll just worry.

437
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,360
If he worries,

438
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,960
take good care of yourself.

439
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,639
My parent isn't a doctor like yours.

440
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,039
I don't take good care of myself.

441
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,719
I'm looking for someone
to take care of me.

442
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,119
I'm here, am I not?

443
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,400
What is it, mister?

444
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,639
I…

445
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,719
washed them for you.

446
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,480
Wait.

447
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,039
Are you opening up to me?

448
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,719
Opening up?

449
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,159
What are you talking about?

450
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
I'm just afraid

451
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,119
the series will go under

452
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,440
if you die.

453
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,280
That's all.

454
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,400
I won't die easily

455
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,280
because

456
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,880
-I will stay alive to hug you.
-Hey.

457
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,599
Song, what are you doing?

458
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,559
Song.

459
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,880
-I love you, mister.
-Song.

460
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,280
What's your problem?

461
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,239
-Oh my.
-Let me go.

462
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,159
-My god.
-What are you doing?

463
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,199
Dad. Mom.

464
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,360
Why are you here?

465
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,280
We came to visit him.

466
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,199
The doctor approved his discharge.

467
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,039
He must have gotten a great caretaker.

468
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,000
Mom.

469
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,519
Be careful of what you eat next time.

470
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes.

471
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,239
-Thank you guys so much
-You're welcome.

472
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,599
-for taking care of me last night.
-Sure.

473
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,239
You look better in real life.

474
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,679
I was the one who accepted
your friend request.

475
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,239
He was playing hard to get.

476
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,079
Dad!

477
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,719
You're being way too loud.

478
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,519
People will think I've died.

479
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,840
What?

480
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,159
If you don't like yelling.

481
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,519
you should leave.

482
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,119
I'm going to drop him off

483
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,719
and go to work.

484
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Go already.

485
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,519
Let's go.

486
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,880
Gosh, judging from what
you were doing on the bed,

487
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,760
he's definitely more than a friend.

488
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,760
Mom.

489
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,800
This kid gets on my nerves.

490
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,639
Be glad I'm your friend.

491
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,719
Not every kid is like that.

492
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,559
There are many good kids out there.

493
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,679
Come on.

494
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,000
-What?
-Let's go.

495
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,079
Look at him.

496
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,840
Who did he get his stubbornness from?

497
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,960
You, I guess.

498
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,360
-Really? Not from you?
-No.

499
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm sorry.

500
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,960
I didn't mean to wake you.

501
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,800
The thing is

502
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,920
you had a fever last night,

503
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,800
so I wiped your body down.

504
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
You said you were cold

505
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,119
so I…

506
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,039
Thank you.

507
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,119
It got much warmer

508
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,079
with you next to me.

509
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,639
Having fever for the first time sucks.

510
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,519
But I got a lot better…

511
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,159
when you hugged me.

512
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,239
Human bodies work in a strange way.

513
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,320
You can go back to sleep.

514
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,280
I'll go check on your mom.

515
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,559
Mrs. Na.

516
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,000
Here's your apple juice.

517
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,440
Thank you.

518
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm sorry.

519
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:30,480
I woke up late because I was sick.

520
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,599
I almost forgot your apple juice.

521
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,320
That's it?

522
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,480
I was worried.

523
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,599
It's my job to take care of her.

524
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,559
I need to do my best.

525
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,920
Are you going to work today?

526
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,960
I didn't have time to prepare anything.

527
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,119
Can you wait?

528
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,880
I'll help you get it ready in no time.

529
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,920
What brings you

530
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,519
all the way here?

531
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,760
I hear you talked to a doctor in Bangkok.

532
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:37,119
Are you sending Tarn there?

533
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,480
I've got connections.

534
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,440
I'm aware that the chance
of Tarn waking up is slim to none.

535
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:51,079
But I want to do my best.

536
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,599
He doesn't deserve any of this.

537
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,639
It's too cruel.

538
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,920
He's unfortunate.

539
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,000
I still stand by what I said.

540
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,840
I agree with you

541
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,679
and I'm willing to cover
all of the expenses

542
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,559
if it will get us out of trouble.

543
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,119
Trouble?

544
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,639
We don't know who attacked your nephew

545
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,079
but people think it's TRD.

546
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,880
Investors are putting
their investments on hold

547
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,320
because it's too risky.

548
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,880
It's starting to upset the executives.

549
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
If this project is terminated,

550
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,320
you, the project manager,
might be in trouble.

551
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,519
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

552
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:48,519
But you chose to get involved.

553
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,559
Your wife too.

554
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,639
Or they wouldn't have
asked you to give a testimony.

555
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,920
You know?

556
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,679
That's all I know.

557
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm not going to meddle
in your family's business.

558
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,159
I hope you can put an end
to this problem soon

559
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:12,079
without affecting our work.

560
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,239
If you can't,

561
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,039
I'll have to step in.

562
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,320
I thought you went back.

563
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,519
Didn't you want me
to do my job as his aunt?

564
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,760
Here I am.

565
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,280
It looks like

566
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,559
you're worried about him more than I am.

567
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,079
You must be extremely afraid of him dying.

568
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,920
That's why you are here all day.

569
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,760
Why?

570
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,360
Do you feel guilty?

571
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,079
Guilt about what?

572
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,360
Don't get upset.

573
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,840
I meant

574
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,679
you feel guilty…

575
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,599
for neglecting your nephew.

576
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:20,880
Someone almost beat him to death.

577
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,960
That's all.

578
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,159
Or are there other reasons

579
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,920
that make you feel guilty?

580
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,239
I have only one regret in my life.

581
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,880
It's marrying you.

582
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,039
Saen.

583
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:44,639
Don't worry about him.

584
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,760
As his uncle-in-law,

585
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,039
I won't let his attackers walk.

586
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,159
A wound from a blunt object,

587
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,000
3cm wide and 7cm long,

588
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,960
was found at the back of his neck.

589
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,400
His X-ray shows

590
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,960
a fracture in the skull
and a cerebral hemorrhage.

591
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,760
He needs more than 21 days to recover.

592
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,800
He was hit from the back.
No other wounds were found.

593
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
This means there's no sign of struggle.

594
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,639
Is it possible

595
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:27,000
that the attackers
lured him out of the car

596
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,800
and hit him with an object?

597
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:33,000
Sir.

598
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:35,639
Sir.

599
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Since he's smart enough to lead a protest,

600
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,760
he must be quite a thorough person.

601
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,320
Maybe someone lured him outside,

602
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,480
so he took the car.

603
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Once he arrived,

604
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,880
he carelessly got out of the car.

605
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,599
According to Saen,

606
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,920
he has evidence proving
it was an accident.

607
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,079
A security camera

608
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,840
in Tatarn's neighborhood

609
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,760
recorded his car driving past at 7:06 p.m.

610
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,719
One minute later, Saen's car drove past

611
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,719
in the same direction.

612
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,440
Fifteen minutes later,

613
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,440
Tatarn's car was spotted
near Sarapee Temple

614
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:25,760
with Saen's car not far behind.

615
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,039
Then, his car hit a motorcycle

616
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:30,239
that was riding
on the wrong side of the road.

617
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,760
Looking at the time,

618
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,280
there's no way Saen got there
in time to attack Tatarn.

619
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,079
Could Sajjaree

620
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,079
be behind it?

621
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,719
Is that you, Tarn?

622
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,159
Can we meet?

623
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,599
I need to talk to you.

624
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,400
Sajjaree

625
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,880
may have lured her nephew out
to the meeting spot.

626
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,880
Then she flew back to Bangkok right away

627
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,519
to avoid suspicion.

628
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,559
Yes.

629
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:59,320
As for Tatarn's car,

630
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,719
a security camera in Chiang Mai

631
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,960
caught it on the road
along the railway track.

632
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:06,960
I've asked the officers
both in Lamphun and Lampang

633
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,760
to check the route Tatarn took
before the attack.

634
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,679
No one has found anything.

635
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,599
Why did he take the longer route
to get to Lampang?

636
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,280
It's like he avoided the cameras.

637
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,760
I agree.

638
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,199
Something isn't right.

639
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:40,679
Set it up around the house.

640
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,039
The hard disk
of the security cameras is missing.

641
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:11,119
Search the house.

642
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,800
Yes, sir.

643
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,239
-All done.
-Thank you.

644
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,039
Excuse me.

645
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,320
I thought you went back.

646
00:51:58,719 --> 00:51:59,760
Why do you care?

647
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:02,239
Who did you meet with?

648
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,559
I saw you talking to a man.

649
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,199
Who?

650
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,679
There are lots of men.

651
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,400
Which one do you mean?

652
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,559
Are you jealous?

653
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,159
Don't worry.

654
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,639
Even though you don't care about me,

655
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,519
I would never cheat, unlike you.

656
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,480
If you don't want me to cheat,

657
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,880
then agree to the divorce,

658
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,840
so I can date her
without going behind your back.

659
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:45,639
-What? You drugged her?
-What? You drugged her?

660
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,760
I had to.

661
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,400
Or she would have thrown
her medicine away again.

662
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,159
Why didn't you tell Nut the truth?

663
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,639
He'll get mad
if he finds out about it later.

664
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:02,800
He might even kick you out, who knows.

665
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:06,360
I don't want Nut to fight with his mom.

666
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,159
He's already stressed with work.

667
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,960
What Tofu is doing might be good
for both Nut and his mom.

668
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,199
That's true.

669
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,840
Saying only what is necessary

670
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,800
is better than making things worse.

671
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,440
You are doing the right thing.

672
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,719
I won't hide it for long.

673
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,400
Once his mom gets better,

674
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,199
I'll tell everyone the truth.

675
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,760
Kuenchai.

676
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,960
Have you seen my book?

677
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,800
Did you take it again?

678
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
"The Little Prince."

679
00:53:58,679 --> 00:53:59,960
They say,

680
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:03,800
older people perceive
The Little Prince differently

681
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,800
than children.

682
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,760
You should read it again.

683
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,519
You might understand
and perceive it differently this time.

684
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:16,039
Dad.

685
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,679
-No.
-Be careful!

686
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:56,599
Saen.

687
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,280
Na.

688
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,159
It's really you, Saen.

689
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,280
Mrs. Na.

690
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,840
Mrs. Na.

691
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,920
Mrs. Na!

692
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,960
No.

693
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:05,920
Let's move.

694
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,920
What's going on?

695
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,119
-What?
-Are you hurt anywhere?

696
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:15,800
How careless of you.
Do you have a death wish?

697
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,719
Jan.

698
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,400
It's…

699
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,639
-Well…
-Saen.

700
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,000
Do you see other men
as your husband again?

701
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,239
-When will you stop being crazy?
-Jan.

702
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,760
Saen is my husband.

703
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,320
-Can you hear me? Mine.
-Jan.

704
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,519
-He's mine.
-Stop or I'll call the police.

705
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:31,719
-Get off her.
-Stay out.

706
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,480
Make sure she takes her medicine.

707
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,320
She shouldn't talk to anyone's man.

708
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,719
Weren't you the one

709
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,159
who left Saen for Sib?

710
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,519
What a lunatic.

711
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,639
Gosh.

712
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:44,079
-Move.
-My goodness.

713
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,159
What the…

714
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,400
My goodness.

715
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:50,519
Let's go inside.

716
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:51,440
Okay.

717
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:56,400
-Gosh.
-What?

718
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,679
I feel sorry for Na.

719
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,880
And what is Jan's problem?

720
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,719
She has been with Saen for 20 years.

721
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,719
But she still can't let it go.

722
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,119
She knows Na is sick.

723
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,559
What does she want from Na?

724
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,760
Listen to me.

725
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:13,519
You shouldn't judge people.

726
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,760
All right?

727
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,400
People have

728
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,679
different limitations.

729
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,159
We are not her.

730
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,400
We don't know

731
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,880
what she has been through.

732
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,320
Do you understand?

733
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,519
People who seem weak

734
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,360
might have a really strong heart.

735
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,079
And people who seem strong

736
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:41,079
might have wept more tears
than we could imagine.

737
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,039
Keep an eye on him

738
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,239
and keep me updated.

739
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,079
Weren't you the one who left Saen for Sib?

740
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,519
Na.

741
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,880
Yes, Grandma.

742
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,239
I…

743
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,800
I don't know how much time I have left.

744
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,199
I'm worried about you.

745
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,159
You are a woman.

746
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,119
You need

747
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:15,639
a husband

748
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,719
to take care of you.

749
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,480
Trust me.

750
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,480
You won't have to anymore.

751
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,039
I'm returning this to you.

752
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,079
See? Do you see what Sib does for you?

753
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,960
He's a man who's nice and consistent.

754
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,920
What are you waiting for?

755
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,519
A good man doesn't come by easily, Na.

756
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,320
Mrs. Na.

757
01:00:03,159 --> 01:00:04,079
It's apple juice.

758
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,679
Is it a headache?

759
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,480
I'm just a bit confused.

760
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,440
Is it about what Jan said?

761
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,280
That and…

762
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,440
what I saw.

763
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:47,480
The guy who looks like Mr. Saen?

764
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:05,039
It's okay.

765
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,320
When you remember it,

766
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:10,880
you can talk to me.

767
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
You should rest.

768
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,599
There's still a lot

769
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,159
I don't know

770
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:08,239
 about what happened

771
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,159
between Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen,
Mr. Sibmeun, and Jan.

772
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,360
It's still bothering her.

773
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,119
It's the reason
she's refusing to get treated.

774
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,920
I hope

775
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,679
what I'm doing

776
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,320
will help her

777
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,639
get over it one day.

778
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,679
Mrs. Na and Nut

779
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:29,760
will finally be happy.

780
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,760
Come in.

781
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,000
Nut, take a seat.

782
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,119
Nut, you've managed
to climb over the wall.

783
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,199
Congratulations.

784
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,719
Thank you so much, Juea.

785
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,840
I don't regret

786
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,519
giving you the ladder.

787
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:20,679
Or is it possible

788
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,719
that you are in love?

789
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,480
Song said I had to have a Facebook first

790
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,519
before I can add you as my boyfriend.

791
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,199
HE LOOKS CONFUSED AND SO ADORABLE

792
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,280
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE

793
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,679
I want to record my time with you,

794
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:09,920
so it can be my memory.

795
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,760
You even have a photo of a dog.

796
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,079
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT IT

797
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:29,840
BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY

798
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,079
PLEASE ACCEPT MY BOYFRIEND REQUEST,
I MEAN, FRIEND REQUEST

799
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,159
You try too hard.

800
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,360
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT IT

801
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,679
BUT I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY

802
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,360
PLEASE ACCEPT MY BOYFRIEND REQUEST,

803
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,239
I MEAN, FRIEND REQUEST

804
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:17,719
PEERANUT HAS ACCEPTED
YOUR FRIEND REQUEST

805
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,039
Nut accepted my boyfriend…

806
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:22,360
I mean, friend request.

807
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,320
Kuenchai, Nut has accepted
my friend request.

808
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,159
HE LOOKS CONFUSED AND SO ADORABLE
THAT I HAVE TO TAKE A PICTURE

809
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,320
Holy shit.

810
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,760
Has Prib seen this?

811
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:06,280
Excuse me, where's Prib?

812
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,639
I don't know, but I saw her leave.

813
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:24,000
PRIB, WHERE ARE YOU? HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

814
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:59,119
Are you dead?

815
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:01,199
No.

816
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,239
Almost though.

817
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:05,039
You rubbing it in will do the job.

818
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,599
I saw it when Nut posted it.

819
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:10,519
Nut accepted Tofu's friend request,

820
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:12,559
but not mine.

821
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,800
You should make peace with it.

822
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,320
Really?

823
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,639
Stop it. Do you still
consider me as a friend?

824
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:21,719
Seriously.

825
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm being honest with you

826
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,199
because you're a friend.

827
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,360
Stop running from the truth.

828
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,599
I'm not running.

829
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:32,119
Really? Where are you then?

830
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:34,119
Did you go drinking?

831
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,960
No, I didn't.

832
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,480
I'm getting my stuff together.

833
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,840
Getting your stuff together? Where?

834
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,199
Somewhere far away.

835
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,599
But don't worry.

836
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:46,280
I'll be back in two days.

837
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,360
I'm going to take back what's mine.

838
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,960
Two days? Are you…

839
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,079
Are you becoming a nun or a witch?

840
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,520
MY BELOVED BROTHER

841
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,239
I came as promised.

842
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,520
Do you remember?

843
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,319
We promised each other

844
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:09,720
that we would meet up this day every year.

845
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,199
We can't be lovers.

846
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,439
But you can be my sister.

847
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,119
Fine.

848
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,079
I'll be your sister.

849
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,119
But you have to promise

850
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,800
that you won't forget me.

851
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,960
You are

852
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:43,239
one of a kind.

853
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,760
I won't forget you.

854
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,319
Is that a compliment?

855
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:51,119
Yes.

856
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,520
How about this?

857
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,840
You must make it up to me

858
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,359
by celebrating the day we met

859
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,279
and our bond.

860
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,399
Promise me

861
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,720
that we will meet every year

862
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,880
and you will buy me a meal.

863
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,760
I promise.

864
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,560
I will buy you a meal every year.

865
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,520
Okay?

866
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Let's take a picture
as proof of our promise.

867
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,239
Don't keep me waiting for too long.

868
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,319
Wake up and buy me a meal already.

869
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:53,199
I think I'm about to be heartbroken again.

870
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,560
Please wake up. I need your support.

871
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:19,720
I came to visit Tarn.

872
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,159
It has been a month.

873
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,560
Are there any signs of recovery?

874
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,920
His condition has been stable.

875
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,239
Why don't you take Tarn to Bangkok?

876
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,600
My friend's mother is a doctor.

877
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,840
I can talk to her.

878
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:39,399
I already talked with a doctor.

879
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:41,119
He said the same thing.

880
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,640
Someone said,

881
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:50,039
with enough moral support
from their loved ones,

882
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,399
comatose patients

883
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,159
might get better.

884
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,600
But Tarn has no one.

885
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,760
You are his only visitor.

886
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
We can't do anything,
except wait for a miracle.

887
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,960
Why hasn't Nut uploaded other photos

888
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,439
besides the one from the fair?

889
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,159
Come here.

890
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,119
Nut said

891
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,159
Facebook is a diary full of memories.

892
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,920
How come his diary is empty?

893
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,880
That's because some memories are kept

894
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,239
deep inside the heart.

895
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:38,800
There's no need to archive them.

896
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,760
You know?

897
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,439
You can never erase them from your heart.

898
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,439
Do you understand?

899
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,319
Thank you.

900
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,760
We went to the market.

901
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,640
We bought snacks for you and Na.

902
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,039
-Thank you.
-Sure.

903
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,439
-Yes.
-Which are harder to erase,

904
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:02,479
good memories

905
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,680
or bad memories?

906
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,880
Well…

907
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,560
-Nhong, tell him what you think.
-Yes.

908
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,439
-I think
-Tell him.

909
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,760
-Go ahead.
-bad memories stay in your heart

910
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,000
-Yes.
-longer than good memories.

911
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,159
Yes, that's right.

912
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,720
Do you understand?

913
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,920
Do you really like him?

914
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,960
What are you talking about?

915
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:51,159
I told you to find someone new,

916
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,399
so you went out with Tofu.

917
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,640
Are you a couple?

918
01:13:58,279 --> 01:13:59,720
What's with you?

919
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,680
Listen.

920
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,359
We've only been on one date.

921
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,600
Do I look that easy to you?

922
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:07,119
Is that so?

923
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,880
I can tell from Mars that you are happy.

924
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:13,199
Look.

925
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,840
You've never been like this before.

926
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:23,479
If you like him,

927
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:26,439
go for it.

928
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,560
You're a grown-up now.

929
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:30,279
You don't need to listen
to anyone anymore.

930
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,279
But he's a stranger.

931
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,680
He will leave one day.

932
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:41,439
That day isn't today.

933
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,960
Why worry about it now?

934
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,600
If you want to be happy

935
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,560
and Tofu makes you happy,

936
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:48,960
why wait?

937
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,079
Someone might take him first.

938
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,520
Which one?

939
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,199
I don't know.

940
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,880
What?

941
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,439
Nut was looking
at this photo at the shoot.

942
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,960
I thought maybe
he was thinking of an old friend.

943
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,920
Why do you want to know about this person?

944
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:38,239
Well…

945
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,840
I want to help Nut with his work.

946
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,119
I hear Nut is inspired by his own past.

947
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,560
If he meets an old friend

948
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,760
he misses,

949
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,920
he might have fun stories to tell.

950
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,159
You care a lot

951
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,800
about Nut.

952
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,359
He's my special someone.

953
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,800
Without him,

954
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:07,640
I wouldn't be here.

955
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,239
If I were Nut,

956
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:13,920
my ears would turn red.

957
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,920
Why?

958
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,760
You're confessing your love.

959
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,439
Love?

960
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:30,119
Yes.

961
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,159
Nut is always your priority.

962
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:36,439
Nut was even the first person

963
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,680
you added on Facebook.

964
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,439
I'm the second, right?

965
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,640
Right?

966
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:48,680
Oh, my god.

967
01:16:49,399 --> 01:16:50,520
You are blushing.

968
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:52,560
Your cheeks are red.

969
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,279
Look.

970
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,079
Both cheeks are red.

971
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,079
Look.

972
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,279
Does Nut make you shy?

973
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:08,239
Tell me the truth.

974
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,560
You're back.

975
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:18,640
I came back a while ago.

976
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:21,039
Are you deaf and blind?

977
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,159
Why are you here?

978
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,600
I came to invite Tofu over for dinner.

979
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:31,760
My dad asked me to bring food.

980
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,279
After that,

981
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:36,760
Tofu can sleep over at my place.

982
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,359
I bought a new game.

983
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:39,760
Let's play it together.

984
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,680
Sure, I want to play it.

985
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,399
Really?

986
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:47,720
I was going to invite you

987
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:50,479
to watch a short film
produced by my senior.

988
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:54,600
Do you prefer games?

989
01:17:58,439 --> 01:17:59,920
You have to choose

990
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,159
who you want to go with.

991
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,119
You chose a short film over a game.

992
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,920
I chose you over Song.

993
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,199
Nut.

994
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,880
Joi, hello.

995
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:34,680
Hello, how's it going? Long time no see.

996
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,039
I'm good.

997
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:38,119
-I would never miss
-Welcome.

998
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:39,359
your event.

999
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:40,880
Thank you so much.

1000
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,600
I ran into Juea.

1001
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,279
He said you were working on a series.

1002
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:46,319
That's right.

1003
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:47,439
I'm sorry.

1004
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,279
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Thank you.

1005
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:51,359
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Thank you.

1006
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,079
Let's watch the film.

1007
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,760
Why are you smiling?

1008
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,520
I'm glad to see you happy.

1009
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:26,600
You must love your job.

1010
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,439
You've been smiling nonstop.

1011
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
My job is what

1012
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,680
I'm most proud of

1013
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,840
in my life.

1014
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:40,479
When I work,

1015
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,399
it feels like I can be myself.

1016
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:45,560
I can think and do anything

1017
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,039
I want to do.

1018
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:51,079
Your hard work

1019
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,880
will make the new series very successful.

1020
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:57,359
You are behind

1021
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:00,319
the success too.

1022
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,079
You were right.

1023
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,359
I wanted to do it.

1024
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:09,880
I want to tell the world
about many things in my life.

1025
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:12,920
I don't know why I was afraid.

1026
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,960
Thanks to you,

1027
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,359
I got through a hard scene.

1028
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:22,720
Thank you.

1029
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,720
Thank you so much.

1030
01:20:32,039 --> 01:20:33,239
Nut.

1031
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:34,520
You're here.

1032
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,840
Hurry.

1033
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,199
Bow. Joy.

1034
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Tofu, scoot over.

1035
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,760
What?

1036
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,079
Scoot over quickly.

1037
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:42,239
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

1038
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:43,680
Gosh.

1039
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,800
-Juea.
-Yes.

1040
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,880
-You came too?
-Joi, my junior, directed this film.

1041
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,239
He's a great director.

1042
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:51,199
You know?

1043
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:53,319
All right.

1044
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,039
Just wait.

1045
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,920
I was there during the first edit.

1046
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,800
It was amazing.
He put a love scene at the start.

1047
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:01,359
It's starting.

1048
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:24,239
What's happening?

1049
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:28,159
What the hell?

1050
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,319
Joi, what happened?
Why did you cut out the love scene?

1051
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,119
It was great.

1052
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,520
You ruined the whole film.

1053
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,640
You know?

1054
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:40,479
Gosh.

1055
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,800
-Nut.
-Tofu.

1056
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,119
I…

1057
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,279
I'm going to the toilet.

1058
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,840
Okay.

1059
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,840
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

1060
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
Do you understand?

1061
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,920
Yes.

1062
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,199
I'll be right back.

1063
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,319
Why does my heart keep racing today?

1064
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,760
During the film,

1065
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:25,760
I couldn't focus
because I was looking at Nut.

1066
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:28,680
What's happening to me?

1067
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:31,720
You're confessing your love.

1068
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,239
Is it possible

1069
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,520
that I really love Nut?

1070
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,399
If you want to be happy

1071
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,640
and Tofu makes you happy,

1072
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,600
why wait?

1073
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:09,239
Excuse me.

1074
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,880
Me?

1075
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,039
Yes.

1076
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,880
I think you're cute.

1077
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,720
Can we take a selfie?

1078
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,079
Can I have your contact info?
I'll send you the photo.

1079
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:36,439
Tofu!

1080
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,640
We're going home.

1081
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:47,119
Nut.

1082
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,000
Nut.

1083
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:46,359
How did it go?

1084
01:24:46,439 --> 01:24:48,760
-How was the film?
-It was good, Mom.

1085
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:14,560
Nut.

1086
01:25:20,439 --> 01:25:21,840
Nut, why are you mad at me?

1087
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:29,960
You said you would wait by the toilet.

1088
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,800
Where did you go?

1089
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,680
Well, while I was waiting for you,

1090
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:37,520
he asked to take a selfie.

1091
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,479
That's all.

1092
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,119
You went with him just like that?

1093
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:45,520
You should have told me.

1094
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,600
I thought you got lost.

1095
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:52,800
There's no need to be upset.

1096
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,359
I wasn't just worried about you.

1097
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:55,600
I was jealous.

1098
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,159
Forget what I said.

1099
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:08,560
I'm your boss.

1100
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,680
I'm talking crazy.

1101
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:15,479
But that was before.

1102
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:22,920
Things are different now.

1103
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,920
I don't know what these feelings are.

1104
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:35,159
But I want you to be more than my boss.

1105
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,039
I want to be by your side…

1106
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:44,520
hold your hand…

1107
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,960
and hug you.

1108
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,640
That's all?

1109
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,520
I'm sorry.

1110
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,840
You're such a kid.

1111
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:52,479
Why are you crying?

1112
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:56,600
Your lips…

1113
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:00,680
are sweet and soft like jelly.

1114
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,840
I'm afraid…

1115
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,520
What did you say?

1116
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:15,199
I said,

1117
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,119
your lips

1118
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,680
are sweet and soft like jelly.

1119
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,760
Why do you sound like…

1120
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,000
Who the hell are you?

1121
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,359
Why are you doing this?

1122
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,239
What do you want from me?

1123
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,039
What did I do?

1124
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,199
What you said just now…

1125
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,720
Why did you say that after I kissed you?

1126
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:49,039
It's how I felt.

1127
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,439
I don't believe you.

1128
01:29:54,279 --> 01:29:56,159
Who sent you here?

1129
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,840
Tell me.

1130
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,880
Tell me now.

1131
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:14,199
This is Nut. His first name is Peeranut.
He's 27 years old.

1132
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:16,079
His mom is Matana. His dog is Kuenchai.

1133
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,000
Tofu!

1134
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,359
That's plenty of information.

1135
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:21,680
You say you don't know him.

1136
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,439
I'm Tofu, your teddy bear.

1137
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:28,319
I never thought you would be such a liar.

1138
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:30,119
Excuse me.

1139
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:32,479
You seem lonely,

1140
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,199
like you have no friends to talk to.

1141
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,279
Right. Nut told me you live alone.

1142
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,319
Your husband doesn't visit.

1143
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,960
Is the room okay?

1144
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:44,079
Yes.

1145
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,920
I was Nut's teddy bear.

1146
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,800
Why did I become your look-alike?

1147
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,479
What are you doing, Dad?

1148
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:55,920
