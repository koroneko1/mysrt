1
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,958
WHEN HONG KONG'S TRIADS WERE IN POWER

2
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,041
Ma Si-feng, the head of Golden Dragon.

3
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,291
He controlled the market
and made a living by extorting people.

4
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,916
Shen Zhi-lang,
the head of the Ghost's Gate Gang.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,166
He controlled bars and brothels
and made a living by collecting rent.

6
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,708
Yi Tsun-pak, the head of Rong Jae Alley.

7
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,958
He had mahjong and fantan casinos.

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,583
After Ma Si-feng died,
Ma Zhen-li took over the gang.

9
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,541
He then fell ill with gout
and couldn't walk.

10
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,833
He passed away soon after.

11
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,625
Ma Zhen-li had three sons.

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,750
Ma Yong-chong, the eldest,
died after his father's death.

13
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:06,000
He said he wanted to follow his father
and take care of him.

14
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,791
Ma Yong-hai, the second eldest, took over.

15
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,125
Ma Yong-tai, the youngest son,
left the mafia world

16
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,875
because he loved beauty.

17
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,583
After Shen Zhi-lang died,

18
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,125
Shen-piao, his only son,
took control of the gang.

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,500
He only had daughters.

20
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,916
So, he stole a child from an orphanage,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,291
named him Shen-po,
and raised him to be the next leader.

22
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,375
Yi Tsun-pak died from unknown causes.

23
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,958
I'll tell you when I find out.

24
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,791
His son, Long-ye,
took control of the Rong Jae Alley Gang.

25
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,208
Finally, Fei, his son, took over from him.

26
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,541
These three gangs didn't want to
be friendly with one another.

27
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,000
They all wanted to be
the only one in control.

28
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,541
Even if you don't remember
anything from this, it's okay.

29
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,166
Because the movie hasn't started yet.

30
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,541
GTH presents

31
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,083
an Ar Ti Film production...

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,958
Kung Fu Tootsie

33
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:23,791
A toast to Tao, who will be
the next leader of the Golden Dragon Gang!

34
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,125
My man, one larb and one Pedigree, please.

35
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,750
Did you bring your dog here?

36
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,416
No. I ordered it for myself.

37
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,458
Tao! Something happened!

38
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,041
Tao.

39
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,458
The next in line to lead Golden Dragon.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,583
Let's go!

41
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,291
Some of the characters are
dubbed in Thai by Panthamitr.

42
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,666
Follow him.

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,041
Go!

44
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,125
Help! I think they got my ear!

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,416
Where are they? Stop following them.

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
They're all bleeding already.

47
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,333
They were foolishly outnumbered.

48
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,125
You didn't know
how many of them would show up?

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,833
I did, but I didn't know Tao and you guys
would be ready to fight.

50
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,416
Nobody listened to me
after Tao said, "Let's go."

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait, Nokroo. Why aren't you hurt at all?

52
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,500
I didn't follow you.

53
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,958
Hey.

54
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,166
Where's Tao?

55
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,541
The Golden Dragon Den.

56
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,166
How pathetic.

57
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,083
You've hurt so many people.

58
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,791
It seems like he won't last long.

59
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,625
Ma Yong-hai, the leader of Golden Dragon.

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,208
You would've been the next leader.

61
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,166
What are we going to do?

62
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,666
Hai is very sick already.

63
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,333
He's old and his brain is damaged.

64
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,083
Have you eaten?

65
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,416
Out.

66
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,750
I ask if you've eaten yet.
What do you mean "out"?

67
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
Stuck.

68
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,791
What do you mean "stuck"?

69
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,000
If Ghost's Gate
and Rong Jae Alley knew about this,

70
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,750
they would laugh their asses off.

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,458
You still have me, Kun!

72
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,833
You?

73
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,333
Hai. Look at your son.
How could he say that?

74
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,041
Out.

75
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,250
I'll lead Golden Dragon myself!

76
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,833
You? You can't even wipe your own butt!

77
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,416
Out.

78
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,125
What do you mean?

79
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

80
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,250
Out.

81
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,916
You have gout too?

82
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,041
How did it get in there?

83
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,041
Why are you whimpering?

84
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,666
-Why didn't you tell me that?
-I did tell you.

85
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,041
Where are you going?

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
To the market.

87
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,500
Why?

88
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,916
To get my arm.

89
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,083
A dog must have eaten it already.

90
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,875
Tao.

91
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,666
What are you looking for?

92
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,750
The heirloom ring.

93
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,750
How did it get lost?

94
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,750
Let me. I'll look for it myself.

95
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,958
It's not in here.

96
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,041
Is it in your pocket?

97
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,500
Let me see.

98
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,333
Oh, no.

99
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,875
Yes.

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,916
-He's doing the lion dance? How can he?
-I know.

101
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,958
Look at him.

102
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,291
-Look at him.
-This is atrocious.

103
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,291
-He can do this all day.
-How nasty.

104
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,166
-This will ruin our reputation.
-Yes.

105
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,833
Tien is Tao's twin brother.

106
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,666
He already knew he was gay
from a young age.

107
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,166
Ma Yong-hai couldn't accept him,

108
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,125
so his mother raised him on her own.

109
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,000
You look so old for a queer,
do you know that?

110
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,125
Yes.

111
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,833
And your arms are not feminine at all.
They're hairy, too.

112
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,125
Yes.

113
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,625
The lion dance is for men.

114
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,458
You shouldn't do it.

115
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,750
Shame on you!

116
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,791
Wait.

117
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,208
What do I have to do
to be feminine like you?

118
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:06,166
Please help me.
I really want to be feminine.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,041
I can see your dedication.

120
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,541
The three angels will help you.

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,416
We'll turn you from a gorilla to an angel,

122
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,875
like us.

123
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,916
Can I change my mind right now?

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,541
Shut up!

125
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,291
This is my signature move.

126
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,833
All the boys fall for me because of this.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,500
It's important for gay people
to be foul-mouthed.

128
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,250
I'll teach you how to use words
as your weapons.

129
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
Bitch. Dummy.

130
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,916
You filthy cow.

131
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,541
Dickhead. Bastard.

132
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,666
-Fuck you, bitch!
-Good.

133
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,250
-What the hell are you looking at?
-Great.

134
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,250
-Shut the fuck up, whore!
-Awesome.

135
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,916
Say that again and I'll mess you up.

136
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:36,291
You talked so much about Lady's Kung Fu.
Let's see it.

137
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,666
-Yes. Show it to us.
-Yes.

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,083
No. I don't want to make a scene.

139
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,750
You think it'll cause a scene?
Are you going to show it to us or not?

140
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
-Show it.
-Yes.

141
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,666
Tien!

142
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,625
What are you doing?

143
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,833
Tien, what are you doing?

144
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,708
This is the Lady's Kung Fu
that my mom taught me.

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,916
What did you do?

146
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,958
Do you want to buy
some illegal lottery tickets?

147
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,416
Aren't you afraid of getting caught?

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,666
The police just bought two.

149
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,500
Good. Go ahead and sell them.

150
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,000
Mom, why do I have to carry this?

151
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,833
You have so many servants.

152
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,208
The Lady's Kung Fu relies on your wrists.

153
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,750
But what are these bags for?

154
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,291
-Are they heavy?
-Yes.

155
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,666
There. That's the wrist workout for you.

156
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,125
Then why don't you carry them too?

157
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,416
No.

158
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,708
I'm good enough. Wait here.

159
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,333
Where are you going?

160
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:53,416
Don't worry. I'm not looking for
a new husband, not right now.

161
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,458
They're fighting now?

162
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,083
They're not animals, you know.

163
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,875
Hey, don't hurt the helpless woman!

164
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,708
Kun?

165
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,500
Hai, how are you?

166
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,833
Let me see my son first.

167
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,750
Mom.

168
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
No. You lost your arm?

169
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,500
-It's okay.
-What about the rest of your body?

170
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,333
Dad!

171
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,833
Dad.

172
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,458
Tao.

173
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,666
Tien.

174
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,500
No one in the house knows about
what happened to Tao.

175
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,333
Why didn't you tell them?

176
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,125
If you had stopped being gay,
I would have told them.

177
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,833
What does that have to do with me?

178
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,916
You have to be the next head
of Golden Dragon.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,083
What about me and Dad?

180
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,458
I'll take them to Jew Jow Gow
for treatment.

181
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,000
Tien,

182
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,500
I believe you can do it.
And you can do it well...

183
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,833
if you stop...

184
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,166
being gay.

185
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,333
Please, it's for your dad
and your brother.

186
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,791
Dad.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,083
Hai.

188
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,625
Dad.

189
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,833
Hai.

190
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,416
Dad.

191
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,541
Hai.

192
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,541
-Dad.
-Hai.

193
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,875
Hey!

194
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey.

195
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,958
What's up with that hand?

196
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
-Hey!
-Good!

197
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,666
What the hell was that?

198
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,833
Chin up. Chest out. Tuck your butt in.

199
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,291
Stand straight!

200
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,000
Your hands go like this.

201
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,333
The men in these photos.

202
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,958
You have to remember their names.

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,416
Do you understand?

204
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,333
This is Shen-po of the Ghost's Gate Gang.

205
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,083
They have control over the nightclubs.

206
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Fei of the Rong Jae Alley Gang.

207
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,291
They control the casinos.

208
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,208
This is Three.
She takes care of the place.

209
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,875
This is our gang.
They are Ler, Nokroo, Jer, and Sing.

210
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,708
And this is Pei-pei, your girlfriend.

211
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,916
You failed from the start, bitch.

212
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,500
Who says you can touch me?
You think I was going to fall?

213
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
-Oh, Tao.
-Let me stop you right there.

214
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,416
You messed up, Nokroo.

215
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,750
I'm Jer.

216
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,250
Why didn't you tell us, Nokroo?

217
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,500
I'm Sing.

218
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,333
Why didn't you check
if we were outnumbered or not?

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,208
If I wasn't Tao,
the head of the Golden Dragon Gang,

220
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,041
I wouldn't be standing right here.

221
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,250
It's a good thing he's safe.

222
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,750
Tao.

223
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,291
What is it, Six?

224
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,125
That's not my name.

225
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,541
What is it, Three?

226
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,666
Miss Pei-pei is here.

227
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,875
Tao.

228
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,541
Pei-pei!

229
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,208
Pei-pei!

230
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,750
Pei-pei.

231
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,833
Pei-pei.

232
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,125
The Ghost's Gate Bar.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,041
We're foreigners.
Show some hospitality here.

234
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,666
Yes, you're foreigners.
But you're not the owners.

235
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,750
So, pay up.

236
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,666
Damn it.

237
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,958
That hurts.

238
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,208
Go ask Shen-po

239
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,750
if he's going to sell this bar to my boss.

240
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,916
Shen-po.

241
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
Do you see that I'm hurt?

242
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,916
Shen-po, the head of
the Ghost's Gate Gang.

243
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,541
Hey, I asked you to look after the bar.
Why are you sleeping here?

244
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,125
I was beaten up.

245
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,625
Krapa. Meow-sao. Go in there.

246
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,166
Don't take too long. I'm hungry.
I'm having dinner with my kid.

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,416
He came out, Krapa. Get him, Meow-sao.

248
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,458
Oh, are you okay?

249
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,708
-Are you okay?
-Okay.

250
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,875
Come on.

251
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,708
Now that's a knockout.

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,958
Is anyone in there?

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,291
Come out already.

254
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,583
That's enough! I can't take it anymore!

255
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,916
Tell your boss
that my boss won't sell this place.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,833
There!

257
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,416
Who was that? He almost hit my toe.

258
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,041
Rong Jae Alley Casino.

259
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,083
Fei, the head of Rong Jae Alley.

260
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,875
Steady, boss. Steady.

261
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,458
A little to the left and then...
Go ahead. Good.

262
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,041
Fei.

263
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,333
You can't even catch the watermelon.
You think you can beat me?

264
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,583
I've got a full house.

265
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,166
I'm so sorry, Fei.

266
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,333
I've got a straight flush.

267
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,666
Hey.

268
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,833
No!

269
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,916
No! Fei, please, don't!

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,666
-Fei, please spare my life!
-Go!

271
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,291
Come here!

272
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,916
-Fei. No!
-Stay still.

273
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,833
-No, Fei! Let me go!
-I said stay still.

274
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,541
Fei, please. I beg you!

275
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,875
Fei, don't!

276
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,500
I'll give you seven days
to find the money.

277
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,333
Thank you so much, Fei.

278
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,958
Thank you.

279
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
You've got it.

280
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,250
Now I've got it.

281
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,875
Remember, Tien.

282
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,208
Our gang relies on extortion.

283
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,833
Come on, Kun-kun.

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Some vendors aren't selling well.
Where will they get the money to pay?

285
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,833
Think.

286
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,416
I'm already ashamed that you're gay.

287
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,291
Now you're calling me by that silly name.

288
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,166
My name is Kun, not Kun-kun.

289
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,291
If people hear this,
they will lose respect for us.

290
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,916
Act like a man, for God's sake.

291
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,875
You keep saying that every day.

292
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm trying so hard,
I think I look a couple of years older.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,166
What more do you want from me?

294
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,833
Tao.

295
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,708
If they say things like that again,
I'll beat them up.

296
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,791
-Don't be afraid of them.
-I know.

297
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,833
This is your soup. Be careful. It's hot.

298
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,166
Thank you, Three.

299
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,208
Both Shen-po and Fei...

300
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,833
Do you want some congee?

301
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:39,291
-They want to take over the market.
-I think I'll make you some noodles.

302
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,666
-Don't trust them.
-Which one would you like?

303
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,666
If you can't stand them, just shoot them!

304
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,833
-Who?
-I'm going to shoot you. Damn it!

305
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,083
Fine. No soup for you, then.

306
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,208
Ghost's Gate Gang.

307
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,708
Pei-pei.

308
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,833
Do you want me to die of grief?

309
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,458
You know Tao is my enemy!

310
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,666
How could you be in love with him?

311
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,750
Why are you so upset?
You're not the one who's marrying him.

312
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,000
But he's the son of Ma Yong-hai!

313
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,000
You need to know the difference
between love and revenge.

314
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,333
When your sister married Fei's son, Kung,

315
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,416
it almost drove me crazy.

316
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
What is this for?
I'm talking to my daughter.

317
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,833
-Are you done?
-Yes, honey.

318
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,583
-Good. Let's change the subject.
-Yes, honey.

319
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,083
Someone is bugging us.

320
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,791
What kind of bugs are they?

321
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,250
There are foreigners disturbing the
casino.

322
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,208
Jeez.

323
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,041
Please, boss.

324
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,416
Damn it.

325
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,250
He cheated.

326
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,833
He started acting like this
when we found out.

327
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,166
They're not bugs.

328
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,500
What are they, then?

329
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,750
They're dead.

330
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,083
What do you mean they're dead?

331
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,916
I mean, they're going to be dead soon
if they don't stop that.

332
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,041
Are you messing with me?

333
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,583
I told you not to use old cards, didn't I?

334
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:26,250
How did you know we used old cards?
You didn't even look.

335
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,250
-It was salty, dummy!
-Yes, sir.

336
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,250
You've been here a lot lately,
haven't you?

337
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,500
It's good that you're here.
My boss told me to ask you

338
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,416
whether you want to
sell this place or not.

339
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,416
Tell your boss I won't sell it!

340
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,166
I mean, my boss won't sell it.

341
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:49,250
People say your kung fu is the best.

342
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:53,916
If you don't mind, please show it to us.

343
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,500
He took his jacket off. What's next?

344
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,125
-He clapped and snapped.
-Clean up.

345
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,458
Wow, that's some talent.

346
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,208
This must be your first time.

347
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,500
Let me show you what's next.

348
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,291
Please, be my guest.

349
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,083
Things are about to get real.

350
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:46,958
Be careful.

351
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,416
Will their moms know
that they gave birth to punching bags?

352
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,708
-He got him.
-Yes.

353
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,208
He's so kind.

354
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,166
What now, boss?

355
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,708
Can you find it? No, you won't find it.

356
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,416
What are you looking for?

357
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,833
A weiner?

358
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,166
I can't find it.

359
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,750
Come on!

360
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,208
Hang on a little longer.

361
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,458
You almost got him.

362
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,708
-Are you okay, Fei?
-He doesn't look so good.

363
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,958
-Yes.
-Oh, no. He's going to fall.

364
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,958
Oh, the big guy fell instead.

365
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,083
You're the greatest, Fei.

366
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,500
Please use this chair.

367
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,291
He doesn't need a chair.

368
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,125
I thought you didn't need it.

369
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,291
Shit.

370
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:27,708
-What did he say?
-I don't know. I'm not a foreigner.

371
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,541
If he's not a foreigner,

372
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,333
-then what the hell is he?
-I don't know.

373
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,041
Tao.

374
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,666
Do you remember what happened last month?

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,625
Yes. I remember. Last month,

376
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,333
we went out somewhere, right?

377
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,875
No, we didn't.

378
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,750
Last month,

379
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,416
you were tackled
by a bunch of foreign men.

380
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,291
Oh, really?

381
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:02,958
Yes.

382
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:07,416
Every single one of them was ripped.

383
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:13,125
It took you all night to take them down.
Do you remember?

384
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,250
Wow, we were at it all night?

385
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,208
Yes. And when you were in there,

386
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:23,083
you used your entire body against them.

387
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,583
Your face was pressed against them.

388
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,583
You could feel them breathe behind you.

389
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,833
You were so cool when you were fighting.

390
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,125
That really turned me on, damn it.

391
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,500
I might decide to crash
your side of the car.

392
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,333
Then I might hit your face.

393
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:44,458
I might kick you.

394
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,000
I might slash your throat.

395
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:51,833
This is love, we're in love

396
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:57,458
It's like you swept me off my feet

397
00:26:57,791 --> 00:27:02,875
You and I, we'll be together forever

398
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:07,500
-How much is this stinky tofu?
-Four dollars a plate

399
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:12,125
-I'll take one, please
-Okay

400
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:17,250
Ler, do you have any money?

401
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:21,458
I have some

402
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:26,541
-Keep the change
-You don't have to

403
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,833
Take it

404
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,083
That's so kind of you

405
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,333
Try this, Pei-pei

406
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:39,333
Oh, your pinky is out

407
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:44,458
We're so in love

408
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:49,500
We're creating our own happiness

409
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:55,208
You smile gave me meaning and hope

410
00:27:55,458 --> 00:28:00,083
The world seems pure and sweet
With you in it

411
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:04,458
Do you notice something weird?

412
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:08,916
That was odd

413
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,750
He has never paid for the food

414
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,125
But today, he did

415
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:19,708
Stop being nosy, let's go get ice cream

416
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,333
Did that hurt? How about this?

417
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,125
Do you know that Fei is going to
take over this market?

418
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,625
Pay me right now.

419
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,666
I already paid.

420
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,000
There.

421
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,458
That hurts.

422
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,083
That hurts.

423
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,875
-What's up with the noise?
-It hurts.

424
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,458
That hurts.

425
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,416
Tao, I already paid you.
Why is this happening?

426
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,666
Stop talking.

427
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,916
Oh, he's alone.

428
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,125
Hey.

429
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,916
Let's make Fei proud.

430
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,541
Sure.

431
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,291
Tao, be careful!

432
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,750
Tao.

433
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,500
Tao.

434
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,333
Tao.

435
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,666
Here. Take that. Damn it.

436
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,416
Oh, what is this? I can't see.

437
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,708
What is going on?

438
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,125
That hurts.

439
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,750
There.

440
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,500
Again?

441
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,166
Oh, my.

442
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,583
I've got you.

443
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,250
Hey, what's this?

444
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,708
Hey.

445
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,500
Hey!

446
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,083
-What happened?
-I was beaten.

447
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,333
Left. Right.

448
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:49,708
Oh, I'm stuck.

449
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,333
Help me, I'm being assaulted!

450
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,583
What is this?

451
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,291
-Gosh.
-Hey.

452
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,916
What do we do?

453
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,541
Let's go.

454
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,708
Going home already?

455
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,041
Look at these goons.

456
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,166
You're rolling him like a burrito.

457
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,583
To compensate for that,
you won't have to pay me for three months.

458
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,208
Let's make it a year. I was so shaken.

459
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,541
Six months.
I've never given anyone this much.

460
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,541
Eight months. Do we have a deal?

461
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,166
Why didn't you take it off?

462
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,291
Oh, right.

463
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,500
From now on,

464
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:49,625
if anyone goes against my orders,
I'll kill them.

465
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,125
That's too much.

466
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,708
Jer! Sing!

467
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,500
Why did our income
for this month decrease?

468
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,250
You told us not to take money
from those who didn't have it.

469
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,791
Yes.

470
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:07,166
And you gave some money
to our wives and children.

471
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,500
-Yes.
-That was awesome.

472
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,666
To keep my men happy,
I must keep their families happy.

473
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,958
-Right?
-Yes.

474
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,333
-That's right.
-My wife just got some money from him.

475
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,166
I was fortunate

476
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
to meet the saint of the mafia world.

477
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,458
No way.

478
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,333
Tao, one of Fei's men
wants to talk to you.

479
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,416
Hey.

480
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,208
What is it?

481
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,125
Would you like to join forces
with Rong Jae Alley

482
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,583
and destroy Ghost's Gate?

483
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,541
-Show me the Lady's Kung Fu.
-Fei is asking you.

484
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,958
-Make it brutal.
-If you don't want to, we'll destroy you.

485
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,625
Oh, sure.

486
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,500
"Pew!"

487
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,541
That "pew" part was gross.

488
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,166
That was the most brutal thing I've seen.

489
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,000
Deadly striking.

490
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,750
Fei, eat some more.

491
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,958
Open your mouth.

492
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,500
Fei.

493
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,208
-What?
-He said that

494
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,333
he's going to take over
Rong Jae Alley soon.

495
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,458
How dare he say that!

496
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,708
-Fei, don't waste food.
-Yes.

497
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,041
-Tao.
-Yes, honey.

498
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,208
One of Shen-po's men wants to talk to you.

499
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,500
My job here is done.

500
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,333
You don't have to say anything.

501
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:52,541
Tell Shen-po that the bars and nightclubs
are going to be mine soon!

502
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,791
Oh, take that.

503
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:03,166
Tell him I punched you in the gut
and I don't care!

504
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:09,666
That was cool.

505
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,333
I asked you. What did he do to you?

506
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,583
Why can't you say it?

507
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:20,791
If you can't say it, just act it out!

508
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,208
Do you want to die? Do you?

509
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,291
Then he said, "I punched you in the gut

510
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,708
and I don't care!"

511
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:46,416
But they are the enemy of Ghost's Gate.

512
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,833
What does that have to do with me?

513
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:50,166
Please, listen to what I'm saying here.

514
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,083
What the hell did she say?

515
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,583
What did you say?

516
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,916
Oh, she heard me.

517
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,416
What do you want me to do?

518
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,916
Stop being part of the mafia.

519
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,958
What are we going to eat, then?

520
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,916
You can be a stinky tofu vendor.

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,500
That's what you want me to do?

522
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,416
-How about this?
-Yes?

523
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,083
You can...

524
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,125
merge your gang with Golden Dragon.

525
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,166
To hell with that.

526
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,333
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,625
You know that's impossible.

528
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,583
Do you even think of me at all?

529
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,583
You're just like your mother.

530
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,041
Please listen to me.

531
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,291
Stop it, Three!

532
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:24,875
Don't say anything.

533
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,416
Wait until we leave before you say it.

534
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,166
See? Everyone is hot-blooded.

535
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,958
And then what happened? You all swallowed.

536
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,458
You mean you all suck?

537
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,125
-Well, you more than just suck.
-Yes.

538
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,791
-Kun--
-Stop it, Three!

539
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:48,583
And now, we're getting less money.

540
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,500
You need to take care of this.

541
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,416
Now you can say it.

542
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,666
You forgot to wear your pants.

543
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:17,458
We want to have
braised pork intestines tonight.

544
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,791
I don't think that's going to be
a problem, Mr. Chang.

545
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,250
I don't think that's possible.

546
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:26,208
My restaurant is quite small.
It's not suited for Golden Dragon.

547
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:31,000
We will expand the restaurant
to match the gang's greatness.

548
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:37,041
But I don't think
you'll like the food here.

549
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:44,583
Oh, the best chef in Asia
just arrived here.

550
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,791
But if you're going to fight in here,

551
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,333
I'm afraid things might get damaged.

552
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:58,666
Well, we can fix them.
The honor of the gang must come first.

553
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:04,833
The head of Golden Dragon invited you
to an event to introduce their new leader.

554
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:09,125
Tao said the casinos we own

555
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,041
and the nightclubs that Ghost's Gate runs
are going to be his.

556
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,791
Get me another one of this.

557
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,458
The vendor said they ran out of noodles.

558
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,916
Take this gun and shoot them.

559
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
-Easy there, Fei.
-Why?

560
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,166
You can order one tomorrow.

561
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,000
No! I want it today!

562
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:44,083
If they don't have it,
just shoot up their shop.

563
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,791
It's my father's.

564
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,125
Shall we shoot them up now?

565
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,333
-Who are you going to shoot?
-Your dad.

566
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:31,833
Go ahead. I'm not telling anyone.

567
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,833
They'll make fun of me too.

568
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,791
The celebration for the new leader.

569
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,041
Let's toast to Tao.

570
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,166
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

571
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,875
To greatness.

572
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,291
You get to eat. And you get to eat.

573
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,791
And you get to eat. You get to eat, too.

574
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,708
There.

575
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,583
That was stupid!

576
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,083
How dare you disrespect Tao,
the leader of Golden Dragon!

577
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,458
Apologize to him.

578
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,291
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

579
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,541
This is a happy event.

580
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,458
Please don't ruin it.

581
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,666
Are you the leader here, Kun?

582
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,125
Shut up!

583
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,333
Now, Fei, if you're here
with good intentions, sit.

584
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,833
Thank you.
May you be blessed with greatness.

585
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:44,208
Hey! Say,
"May you be blessed with greatness."

586
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,958
-May you be blessed with greatness.
-May you be blessed with greatness.

587
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,833
The rule here is "no weapons."

588
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,000
How is it going?

589
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,833
Oh, Shen-po. I thought you weren't coming.

590
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:10,000
We're pals. How could I not be here?

591
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:16,250
Oh, Fei is here.

592
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:20,166
Hey, guys. Look, Fei is here.

593
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,000
-Hi, Fei.
-Hi, Fei.

594
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,541
I don't know you!

595
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,666
Po, please don't bring weapons in here.

596
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,083
-Excuse me, Shen-po.
-It's fine.

597
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,125
I've got it.

598
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,041
Is it a gun?

599
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,833
It's a fish.

600
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:38,833
A fish?

601
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,833
Why does he have a fish?

602
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,333
General Jia is here.

603
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,583
Stand up, Po. The police are here.

604
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,583
It's nothing, Jia.

605
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,250
Nothing?

606
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,666
Hey, what's going on?

607
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,000
That hurt.

608
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,791
Have you been glassed before?

609
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,875
No, but I've had a glazed donut.

610
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,166
Oh, they're discussing the menu.

611
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,708
Let's go.

612
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,500
Who discusses the menu
with broken bottles?

613
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,208
Don't. We can't fight them.

614
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,833
This is my territory.
Please show some respect!

615
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:29,625
Here we go.

616
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:37,208
The rule is "no weapons."

617
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,333
Why don't you people listen?

618
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,416
They must have hidden them
between their butt cheeks.

619
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,708
I hope the guns go off and blow up
your butts if you do this again.

620
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,416
-That would be nasty.
-Put them away.

621
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,750
I'll sell them later.

622
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,708
Dang it. I thought I would
get to shoot people.

623
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,958
Sit down.

624
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,958
Now that that's over, please have a drink.

625
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,666
Since you're going to be
the new leader of Golden Dragon,

626
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,833
why don't you show us some moves?

627
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,916
It's up to you.

628
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,083
I can't even take care of myself
these days.

629
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,916
If you and Po assist,
I can certainly do that.

630
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,166
Okay.

631
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,541
Then, we split the area in half.

632
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:21,541
That side will be for Po's men.
This side will be for Krapa and Meow-sao.

633
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,416
If you're still standing
after ten minutes,

634
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:28,083
then you're fit to be the new leader.

635
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:33,916
Begin.

636
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:42,333
Give me back my belt. My pants are loose.

637
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,500
Oh, no.

638
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,250
Look at that white butt.

639
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,333
Let me do this.

640
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,666
Watch out.

641
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,458
I can't do it anymore.

642
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,833
I heard someone calling you.

643
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:13,833
Me too.

644
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,333
-His leg.
-Don't share this.

645
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,791
I can see it now.

646
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,583
That must hurt.

647
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,500
Are you okay?

648
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,416
Is your back turning red?

649
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,958
-He's been defeated.
-How is his back?

650
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,500
Oh, that's a good one.

651
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:35,958
-Hey, you.
-There.

652
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,708
-Did you call me?
-Hang in there.

653
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,541
There.

654
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,833
Wait!

655
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,416
Does it hurt?

656
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,416
If I said it doesn't,
would you believe me?

657
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,583
No. I have to try it myself.

658
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,666
Yes, it does hurt.

659
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,458
Serves you right. You wanted it.

660
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,958
-You just knew it hurts?
-Hey.

661
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,625
Hey.

662
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,250
I think my spine just got crooked.

663
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,625
-Stop!
-He doesn't care who he hits.

664
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,958
-Let me do this.
-Sure. You're going to get hurt.

665
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,500
You think you're so good?

666
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,458
Why did you hit me? You...

667
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:16,958
Hey, wait.

668
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:20,166
This isn't about you anymore.
Let me finish this first.

669
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,958
Why did you hit me?

670
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,125
-Hey, stop.
-Don't stop us!

671
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,541
-A knockout.
-What do we do now?

672
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,000
He still has five minutes left.

673
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,208
Look at him. He's mad.

674
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:50,791
Hey.

675
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,208
Get out of the way, losers.

676
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,666
I'm not seeing you out, Fei.

677
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:07,500
Hey! I already surrendered!
What more do you want?

678
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:09,000
What?

679
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,583
Who tripped me?

680
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:11,916
That thing.

681
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:15,500
Oh, I didn't see that.

682
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,250
Get out of the way!

683
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:27,750
Everything looks normal.

684
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,416
Don't fight in here.

685
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,291
You really don't know
that they're fighting?

686
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:34,875
They're all sweaty.

687
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:37,416
I've got cataracts.
I've been meaning to get eye surgery.

688
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,625
-Hello, Tao.
-Hello, Tao.

689
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,541
-Hello, Tao.
-Hello, Tao.

690
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,541
Hello, Tao.

691
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,458
-Hello.
-Tao.

692
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,041
Hello, Tao.

693
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,750
Kun, can you not walk this close to me?

694
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:54,583
I want to be with Pei-pei.

695
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,125
Now, before I lose my patience.

696
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:01,500
I'll be like Tien if you don't.

697
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,333
Hey, go wait in the market!

698
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,333
But this is the market.

699
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,625
I'm coming with you.

700
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,458
-Where are you going?
-Just tell us where in the market.

701
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,916
Yes.

702
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,416
You're right.

703
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:18,250
Pei-pei, are we going to stand here
and get darker and darker?

704
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,208
Let's go over there. There's some shade.

705
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:24,083
Oh, my!
Why are these roses so fabulously red?

706
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,083
-Why are they so red?
-I painted them.

707
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,416
-Let's go over there.
-Why?

708
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,208
To look at some hairpins.

709
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,416
For you, of course.

710
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,916
-Tien!
-Crap!

711
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,416
Gorilla!

712
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,041
You lion-dancing bitch!

713
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,541
Who's Tien? Why are we running away?

714
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,083
Wait for me, you unfeminine gay.

715
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:50,291
A fortune-teller told me
I killed a eunuch in my past life.

716
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,916
-What does that have to do with this?
-They're taking revenge.

717
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,833
Can we slow down?

718
00:48:57,333 --> 00:49:00,125
Those three gays over there.
Distract them, but don't hurt them.

719
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,666
-Hurry.
-Where are we going?

720
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,291
We've got them.

721
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,083
And this is what we'll do.

722
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,208
We're so proud.

723
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,208
-Shit! Who was that?
-Right.

724
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,666
Damn it! I think it was Shen-po!

725
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,208
But it's more likely to be Fei.

726
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,000
There were ducks over there.

727
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,333
Give me the gun.

728
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,041
You already have one.

729
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,208
I can't use this one.

730
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,708
Why?

731
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,041
It's been gunned down.

732
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:14,125
Do you want me to kick you in the face
or are you going to laugh at my puns?

733
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:20,958
Good.

734
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,666
That was cool, Fei. You shot a duck.

735
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,666
I'm getting old.
So, I just shoot ducks now.

736
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,625
When I was younger, I never shot them.

737
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:37,875
So what did you do?

738
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,500
Duck.

739
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,041
My baby.

740
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,333
Fei is crazy.

741
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,583
Back in the day,
when your dad was the leader,

742
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:55,291
Fei barged into our house

743
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,916
and shot your dad multiple times.

744
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:59,833
Over there. On that chair.

745
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,916
He fired until he ran out of bullets.

746
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,666
Then he reloaded and started firing again.

747
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,416
Why didn't he die?

748
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,833
Dad was at the market.

749
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:12,208
I'm right here.

750
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:18,750
That's enough. Alcohol isn't good for you.

751
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:24,166
I have some soup for you. It's really hot.

752
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,791
You're so nosy.

753
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,916
Three, do you remember
when Fei came in here and shot Hai?

754
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,125
Of course.

755
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:40,500
That crazy man was just shooting
at the same chair over and over.

756
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:59,833
Kun, do you want some braised intestines
for breakfast tomorrow?

757
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,083
Nobody respects me in this house.

758
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,416
Those people in the mafia are perverts.

759
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,041
-Yes, I'm very mad at them.
-They like seeing us naked.

760
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,833
It's embarrassing.

761
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:23,291
Hey, give it back. That's mine.

762
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,416
It's lipstick.

763
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,791
This is not sold in Hong Kong.

764
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,291
You have to buy it in Thailand.

765
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,500
So what can you get in Hong Kong?

766
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,083
The better kind.

767
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,958
Why didn't you buy one there, then?

768
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,916
I wanted something cheap.
You got a problem with that?

769
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,041
Bitch.

770
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,625
Hey, why did you say that?

771
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:53,750
I want lipstick now that I've seen one.

772
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:58,666
I want to wear makeup to be feminine.
I'm so repressed.

773
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,791
I want to act gay again!

774
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:04,583
Oh, shut up, Tien.
Don't act like you don't want this.

775
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,125
You're living in paradise now.

776
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:10,583
You're surrounded
by handsome, muscular men.

777
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,291
We're thinking of applying to your gang.

778
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,625
Yes.

779
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,625
Don't you get hot and bothered

780
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,541
whenever you see the hair
on their broad chests?

781
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:26,958
That sounds amazing.

782
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,833
-That's right.
-Hey.

783
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:33,958
Don't say it like that.
I might not be able to stop myself.

784
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:37,291
Are you sure you can take them all?

785
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,666
Let me take some off your plate.

786
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,041
Hey, I think Tao is acting weird.

787
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:46,166
How so?

788
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,833
The other day, he asked me
to practice using a lance with him.

789
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,625
But I didn't do it.

790
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:55,708
Why? There's nothing odd about that.

791
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,291
Nothing odd?
We don't have a lance in the house.

792
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,000
You're reading too much into things.
Let's go pee.

793
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:06,500
How could he not ask me to come with him?

794
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,833
Stop right there.

795
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,541
Let the seniors pee first.

796
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,000
-I'm waiting at the bus station.
-I'm waiting at the airport.

797
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:24,583
-I'm waiting at the intersection.
-I'm waiting at the police station.

798
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:29,250
It's all done, Ler. We beat them up.

799
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,666
Whose men were they?

800
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,166
They were ours.

801
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:43,916
So why did they beat us up?

802
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,083
The other day, we got information

803
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,833
that Fei's men were going to pee there,

804
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,208
so our men waited there.

805
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,333
Then, you got here and went to pee there.

806
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,875
So, you three got beat up there.

807
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,500
And you walked back here.

808
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:09,083
And then you laid here.

809
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:11,083
-We're going over there.
-We're going over there.

810
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:17,416
It hurts here and there.

811
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:22,750
Tao is a cruel man.
He bullies the people in the village.

812
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:26,416
They come to me
and complain about it every day.

813
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,083
So you're running a crisis center now?

814
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,041
I didn't mean that. What I meant was,

815
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,041
he's an immoral man,
so why are you sleeping with him?

816
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,166
Wait. Why are you still with him?

817
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:42,958
Seriously, who are you going to choose?
Me or him?

818
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,583
-Do you want the drumstick?
-Yes, thank you, honey.

819
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:50,041
You need to stop contacting him
from now on. He's my enemy.

820
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,333
-The chicken is a bit salty.
-Yes, I think so too.

821
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:55,041
I think I need to tell that to the butler.

822
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,875
If you keep seeing him, I'll disown you!

823
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,041
Ming called from Singapore.

824
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:04,750
His gang and our gang
never got along, anyway.

825
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,541
She said she's coming back to see you.

826
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,333
Let's just say that
you need to stop seeing him.

827
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:10,291
-Piow is coming too.
-Like, never ever see him again.

828
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,583
What? Ming and Piow are coming?

829
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,291
Eight years ago...

830
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,000
Don't let Kung come near my daughter.

831
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,583
-Why?
-Your son is bad.

832
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,208
Your daughter is fat.

833
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,875
Just like her mother.

834
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,875
I'll find other women for you.
Eight of them, all right?

835
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:30,291
The only woman I want is Ming!

836
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,666
If he wasn't Fei's son,
I would let you see him.

837
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,333
-Will you let me see him?
-No!

838
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,250
-You need to break up with him!
-No way!

839
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,833
What does that mean?

840
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:39,666
What are you going to do?

841
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:43,291
It's okay. We'll get Song to help.

842
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:48,125
Kung and Ming are like
my nephew and niece.

843
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,708
I have to ask you two
not to stand between them.

844
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,041
Po. Fei.

845
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,416
What can I say? You asked.

846
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,416
If that's what you want,
then I won't do anything.

847
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:04,958
Good! It looks like
no one wants to disobey me.

848
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:08,125
So, making money is now a little easier.

849
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:18,166
Dad, you have a grandson.

850
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,958
Grandpa!

851
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,833
Piow!

852
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
-Grandpa.
-Piow.

853
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,833
Piow.

854
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,791
-Grandpa, I miss you.
-Piow, my beloved grandson.

855
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,416
-Grandpa.
-Piow.

856
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,333
-Dad.
-Kung!

857
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,166
Kung...

858
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,000
Piow.

859
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,500
How is living with Song?

860
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:52,875
-It was great at first, but last month...
-What?

861
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,750
He took a lot of money to gamble in Macao.

862
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:58,083
His opponent was Master Kao.

863
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,666
What? Master Kao?

864
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,750
In the end, he lost.

865
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,833
So, Master Kao killed him?

866
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,583
He didn't kill him.

867
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:11,291
But Song lost all of his money.
He didn't have any food.

868
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,291
So, he died of starvation.

869
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,083
Oh, Song.

870
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,208
Even if you have a child together,
I won't let him come to my house.

871
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:25,666
Why?

872
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,333
Because he's Fei's son.

873
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,833
Oh, you're a good boy.

874
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,500
You should break up with him.

875
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:40,000
That's nice, Piow.

876
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,041
Then, come back and live with me.

877
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:50,875
Good.

878
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,916
We have a deal, right?

879
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,166
Jeez.

880
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,750
Piow, you little piece of shit!

881
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,041
FEI GUILD HALL

882
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,666
Please come in.

883
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,541
If you've run out of money, please leave.

884
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,416
Come back when you have the money.

885
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,708
Please come in.

886
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,583
Please come in. Bet on anything you want.

887
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,291
We'll call the police at 10:00 p.m.

888
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,208
Come and catch me.

889
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,208
-I finished my meal. I'm going to play.
-Piow, don't run around.

890
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:29,541
He didn't eat his vegetables.

891
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,541
Go play outside, all right?

892
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes, Grandpa.

893
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:39,000
Good.

894
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:40,958
Piow, what's in the bag?

895
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,125
It's Wong Fei-hung.

896
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,833
What is Wong Fei-hung?

897
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,541
You're not giving me that?

898
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,625
This is funny.

899
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,125
What was that? Synchronized dancing?

900
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:34,458
Kung, get your child away from me. Go!

901
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,583
Grandpa is scolding you. Do you hear that?

902
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,333
Wong Fei-hung is a snake.

903
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:39,625
I know!

904
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:43,458
Ming, Tao has been acting weird lately.

905
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,583
He's not as bad as he used to be.

906
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,916
Pei-pei, you are a grown-up now.

907
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,250
You know the right thing to do.

908
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:52,833
What do you mean by that?

909
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:57,458
Go to his house and find
the right moment to have sex with him.

910
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,833
EXTRA-STRONG APHRODISIAC

911
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,166
I'm going to get laid tonight.

912
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:32,833
Tao.

913
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,500
I've got some soup for you.

914
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:40,666
Thank you.

915
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,958
I don't have any.

916
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:30,750
What are you doing here?
Go get me some men!

917
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,125
Get me some men!

918
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,333
Where are all the men? Go get me some men!

919
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,458
Whip me!

920
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:03,875
Bring out the candles!

921
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,291
Candles!

922
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,500
What is going on? Hey!

923
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,791
What is this?

924
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:28,500
Don't do this to me!

925
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,541
Thank you, Pei-pei.

926
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:51,916
If you hadn't been here,
I would have become his wife.

927
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,833
It's nothing.

928
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,333
I think he passed out.

929
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,750
But the drug is still in his system.

930
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,500
So, like I said...

931
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:11,958
My Tao lost an arm.

932
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
My beloved amputee.

933
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:21,083
Do you miss him?

934
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,958
Don't say that.

935
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:28,041
You need to keep quiet about this.

936
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,625
I know that.

937
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,125
Hey, come to think of it,

938
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,625
what did you put in the soup?

939
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:37,708
An aphrodisiac.

940
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,791
An aphrodisiac?

941
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,041
Kung, how is Piow doing in the casino?

942
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:54,458
Don't worry.
There's only one thing he hasn't done.

943
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,916
What is that?

944
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,666
He hasn't burned the place down yet.

945
01:04:58,041 --> 01:04:59,750
Hey, that's Fei's son.

946
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,500
He must be here to mess up our market.

947
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,833
Hey, step back. Let me handle this.

948
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,125
-Kung.
-What?

949
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,875
-Are you here to mess up our market?
-No.

950
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,041
Hey!

951
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:15,750
Kung.

952
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Kung.

953
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:23,041
What? You've got a problem?

954
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,833
You can hurt him back.
So there's no need to hold grudges.

955
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:28,875
Are you sure?

956
01:05:30,916 --> 01:05:32,500
I think we can just look past this.

957
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,958
It was a misunderstanding. Believe me.

958
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,125
Let's be friends.

959
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,833
Jer, are you okay?

960
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,583
You keep talking
like you're being nice to me.

961
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:52,000
Ming, let's go before he wakes up.

962
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:02,416
The gangsters are here.
Normal people, please make way!

963
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,500
How dare you ask me out for tea?

964
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,541
Stay calm, Shen-po.

965
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,666
-I'll order some good food for you.
-Hey.

966
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,458
-Fei. Shen-po.
-Hi.

967
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:31,458
Mr. Chang, how are you doing?

968
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:38,958
I'm doing great.

969
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,750
Bring out the shark fins for Po.

970
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:43,833
-We're out.
-Give me your ear, then!

971
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,458
Yes, sir! Please wait.

972
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:48,083
How hungry must he be to eat my ear?

973
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,416
We should gang up
and take over Golden Dragon.

974
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:59,333
Fine. But Piow stays with me.

975
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,541
He must stay with me!

976
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:09,666
General Jia is here.

977
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,000
Hi, Po and Fei.

978
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,000
To keep the peace in this town,
can I show some IDs?

979
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,291
Yes, give me yours.

980
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,166
Everything looks good. You can go.

981
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,708
Thank you.

982
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:35,875
-General.
-General.

983
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,666
-General.
-Stop talking.

984
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:40,000
You saw what happened.
Don't tell that to anyone.

985
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,083
Ma Yong-hai is still alive.
I don't feel good about this.

986
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:54,333
People say he plays with
his own poop when he wakes up.

987
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,708
-What do you mean?
-He's retarded now.

988
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,208
In English, they say "antarctic."

989
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,583
It's "autistic."

990
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:06,500
Fei.

991
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,541
What are you doing?

992
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:11,875
Stay still.

993
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,458
Yes, Fei.

994
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,458
What is coming out of my stomach?

995
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,666
Fei, you stabbed me!

996
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:30,916
You tricked me.

997
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,500
Remember, Po.

998
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,833
Skepticism is what makes
good gang leaders.

999
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:36,958
Or else you'll get this.

1000
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,958
Like this?

1001
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,916
Ma Yong-hai?

1002
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,208
Does it hurt?

1003
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,458
I'm glad you're here.

1004
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,541
Please give this to Tao.

1005
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,750
That hurts.

1006
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,166
No.

1007
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,416
That hurts.

1008
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,708
Daddy!

1009
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:12,416
He even put a knife in my dad's head.
I don't want to be in this anymore.

1010
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,125
Don't worry about it, Tien.
It's just a dream.

1011
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,541
But what if it becomes a reality?

1012
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,541
I'm sorry.

1013
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,541
We must not let that happen.

1014
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,541
We should wait here

1015
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:30,958
to see your father, my husband.

1016
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,291
He'll come see us.

1017
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:42,208
Why did you bring me here to see him?

1018
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:48,500
It's because you're the one
he loves the most,

1019
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:55,083
and you're the one I love the most.

1020
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:05,416
Yes, you are the one they love the most.

1021
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,208
That must be a sign from the gods.

1022
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:22,708
The one they love the most is Piow.

1023
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:24,041
What about him?

1024
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:27,500
Think about it.

1025
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,958
Think.

1026
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:42,666
I know what to do now.

1027
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:47,166
Take Piow to the market.

1028
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,041
And then what?

1029
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:54,500
Next, Nokroo will take Piow

1030
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,416
and fake his kidnapping.

1031
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,500
Then, you go back and tell your father.

1032
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:02,750
I'll be a man and bring Piow back.

1033
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:07,708
Then Shen-po and Fei will be grateful
for what I've done.

1034
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,666
Our three gangs can finally be united.

1035
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:12,958
How does that sound?

1036
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:15,791
Do as he says
and everything will get better.

1037
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:25,333
This is a waste of my time. If you don't
have anything else to say, leave.

1038
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:29,500
Do as I say. Now you have to leave.

1039
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,166
Fortunately, he doesn't understand
what we're saying.

1040
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,291
He must think that
I don't understand what he's saying.

1041
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,458
I think he understands.

1042
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:02,875
-Tien, I have--
-Try this mung bean soup.

1043
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:05,291
It's very good.

1044
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,416
-I want to--
-Does it taste good?

1045
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,125
-I--
-I think it's really good.

1046
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,708
Open your mouth.

1047
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,916
Do you think it's too sweet?

1048
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:15,916
No. It's good.

1049
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,000
What were you going to say?

1050
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,541
I forgot.

1051
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:28,416
Your plan isn't working.

1052
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,583
When will their businesses be mine?

1053
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,166
Soon.

1054
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:38,625
I cut off Tao's arm. I shot them.

1055
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,250
Who do I have to kill...

1056
01:12:40,666 --> 01:12:41,833
"Kill this time."

1057
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,708
Yes, who do I have to kill this time?

1058
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,083
You don't have to kill anyone.

1059
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,458
We must take the thing they love the most.

1060
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:59,250
Oh, Piow. It's nothing.

1061
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:04,625
Oh, candy.

1062
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,625
Can I have one bag of these?

1063
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:11,750
Where are they?

1064
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,458
-These ones too.
-Why aren't they here?

1065
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,291
-Who are those people?
-Farmworkers, maybe.

1066
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,083
You've got the wrong person. He's there.

1067
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,916
It's that one, not me! There!

1068
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,458
-Hey. It's not me!
-Let me go!

1069
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,833
You've got the wrong person!

1070
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,458
Dad, Piow is missing!

1071
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,875
What? He's missing?

1072
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,500
What? He's missing?

1073
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:43,125
Piow is missing?

1074
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,333
He really is missing!

1075
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,125
-Pei-pei too.
-Pei-pei?

1076
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:49,458
Who took him? When did he go missing?

1077
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:53,041
This morning. Kung called.

1078
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:54,833
Three people in ski masks took him.

1079
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:58,541
It was my fault. Please forgive me.

1080
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,041
Forgive you?

1081
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,833
You can't even
take care of your own child.

1082
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,125
You're so stupid!

1083
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,416
Tao must have done this.

1084
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:15,750
Why did you take Pei-pei?
I didn't order you to do that!

1085
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,625
We didn't take them.

1086
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,125
What do you mean?

1087
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,083
If you didn't take them, then who did?

1088
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,875
I don't know.
They took them before we got there.

1089
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:30,583
Our lives depend on your mercy now.

1090
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,583
You couldn't do what I said
so you ask for mercy?

1091
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,125
Form a circle!

1092
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,916
-Form a circle, hey!
-Form a circle, hey!

1093
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,333
Knock in a circle!

1094
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,208
-Knock in a circle, hey!
-Knock in a circle, hey!

1095
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:00,500
He said "knock," Jer.

1096
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:03,708
Good.

1097
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,833
Come here.

1098
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:09,166
I found out that he's gay.

1099
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,250
He was peeping while I was pooping.

1100
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,000
Now I know
why he looked at me in a weird way.

1101
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,041
-What about you--
-Kick in a circle!

1102
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:20,125
-Kick in a circle!
-No!

1103
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,291
There are so many vegetables.

1104
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:34,500
Can you please eat it?

1105
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,291
I want chicken drumsticks!

1106
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:42,708
Shit, I didn't know
that he doesn't eat vegetables.

1107
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:47,625
Chicken drumsticks, bacon, steaks, bread,

1108
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,000
butter, and jam.

1109
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:53,250
Did we get them all? No vegetables.

1110
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,750
You don't eat vegetables?

1111
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,166
He just said he doesn't eat them.

1112
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:01,458
-Just like Piow.
-What?

1113
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:02,916
Who's that?

1114
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05,333
That fat kid who is Po and Fei's grandson.

1115
01:16:05,916 --> 01:16:07,416
Are you buying those for him?

1116
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,333
Don't talk about that!
People might hear us!

1117
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,833
Where did you hide Piow?

1118
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:34,166
I'll count to three.
If you don't tell me, I'll shoot.

1119
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,708
One, two, three.

1120
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,625
I'll count three more.

1121
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,750
Four, five, six.

1122
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:46,833
Dad. Tao didn't do it.

1123
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:49,416
And he said he's going to find him.

1124
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,708
You're going too far, Po and Fei.

1125
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,958
-How about I shoot you instead?
-Yes.

1126
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:04,208
-We found Pei-pei and Piow.
-And Piow.

1127
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
How about that?

1128
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:08,833
People in Golden Dragon get things done,

1129
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,625
unlike other gangs.

1130
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:14,625
They do nothing
but put guns to people's heads.

1131
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:19,625
We followed them.

1132
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:21,916
-Where are they?
-Yes.

1133
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,666
At an abandoned Changzhou rice mill.

1134
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:27,333
At an abandoned Changzhou rice mill.

1135
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:31,250
General Jia, why are you here?

1136
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,083
I'm not the general for nothing.

1137
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,125
-What are you waiting for? Let's go in.
-Yes.

1138
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,583
Wait.

1139
01:17:38,833 --> 01:17:42,416
If we all go in there,
I'm afraid it might endanger the hostages.

1140
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,458
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1141
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,916
Dad! Tao!

1142
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,250
-Pei-pei.
-Hey.

1143
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:06,708
Dad! Tao! Help!

1144
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,958
Don't come any closer!

1145
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:10,583
Or I might let go of the rope.

1146
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:13,041
Dad! Tao! Help!

1147
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:16,458
Do you want to know what happens
if they fall into the pan?

1148
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,458
What are you doing?

1149
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,750
Hey, what do you want?

1150
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:32,166
I want what I want. It's up to me.

1151
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,458
You don't get a say in it.

1152
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:37,041
-We must do as he says.
-What?

1153
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,416
Or they might end up like that duck.

1154
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:42,416
I want 50 percent of your businesses.

1155
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,458
Hey, if we go in right now,

1156
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,833
even if they burn the ropes,
we might still have time

1157
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,791
to save Piow and Pei-pei.

1158
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,500
-Are you sure?
-What if things don't go well?

1159
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:55,916
Get them!

1160
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,500
No, Dad!

1161
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,833
If they want to risk it, let them.

1162
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,041
Sure.

1163
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,958
Don't!

1164
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:09,625
Help!

1165
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,750
Help!

1166
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,583
Dad!

1167
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,291
You...

1168
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,166
son of a bitch!

1169
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,000
Why are you just standing there?
Come and help us!

1170
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:48,500
How could I?
Even you people got beat up like that.

1171
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:51,208
I wouldn't stand a chance!

1172
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,250
Tao, put out the fire!

1173
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:00,750
What is this?

1174
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:03,041
Put out the fire!

1175
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,791
Help!

1176
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,125
Pei-pei!

1177
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,458
Tao!

1178
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,208
You got here just in time, Tao.

1179
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Take out these four and put out the fire.

1180
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:56,125
I'll take out this one, okay?

1181
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,250
"Okay"? You got one and I got four.
Go put out the fire.

1182
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,583
-I'm gay!
-I have one arm!

1183
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:08,291
Gay? I can take him down.

1184
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,208
You're fast. Are you sure you're human?

1185
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:48,166
Oh, I thought I dodged it.

1186
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,750
-Tao!
-Put out the fire!

1187
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:39,833
Tao!

1188
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,541
Tien!

1189
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:10,625
Why did you just stand there?

1190
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,750
Remember, Tien.

1191
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:49,083
Women like us have
a higher pain tolerance than men.

1192
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:53,500
The feminine power
will unleash its full potential

1193
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:56,166
only when we've reached our limit.

1194
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:01,000
The Lady's Kung Fu has ten moves.

1195
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:16,166
The first one is the Lady Butterfly.

1196
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,916
The second one is the Hiding Lady.

1197
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:32,541
The Lady Opening the Gateway.

1198
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,791
My butthole!

1199
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,208
It's coming out!

1200
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,791
My mom taught me. This is the Lady's Feet.

1201
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,750
This is the Lady Picking a Carrot.

1202
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:19,083
What are you doing?

1203
01:25:20,625 --> 01:25:23,208
I haven't seen anything like it!

1204
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:26,000
This is the Lady Weaving Silk!

1205
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,041
That's enough!

1206
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:42,083
That's the Lady's Bite.

1207
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,500
This is called the Lady's Butt.

1208
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:12,750
This is called the Lady Monkey.

1209
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:25,583
The last move of the Lady's Kung Fu
is one you must come up with yourself.

1210
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:29,500
You're living in paradise now.

1211
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:32,125
You're surrounded
by handsome, muscular men.

1212
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:34,666
If I were you, I would eat them all up.

1213
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,250
Think.

1214
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,625
That was the Lady Having a Meal.
I came up with it.

1215
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,125
You're under arrest, Mr. Jonas.

1216
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:21,666
General Jia was the one who ordered me
to do all this.

1217
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:24,500
He ordered me to cut off Tao's arm

1218
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,000
and fire guns at you.

1219
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:36,458
The rope is breaking!

1220
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,708
Do something!

1221
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:42,500
Hurry!

1222
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,833
Yes, that's good!

1223
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:58,291
Hurry!

1224
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,333
How are you feeling?

1225
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,583
Warm.

1226
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:09,875
-How warm?
-Yes.

1227
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,250
I pooped my pants.

1228
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,708
That must be warm.

1229
01:28:14,166 --> 01:28:15,791
How are you feeling, Pei-pei?

1230
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:19,708
Pei-pei!

1231
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:39,166
ETERNAL HARMONY IN MARRIAGE

1232
01:28:41,625 --> 01:28:42,708
Are you ready?

1233
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:43,916
Come a little closer.

1234
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,791
I'm very happy today.

1235
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:51,833
Why?

1236
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,625
Our three gangs will become
one big family.

1237
01:28:56,416 --> 01:28:57,666
Why are you here?

1238
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:58,750
What was that?

1239
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:01,333
Why are you in my house?

1240
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:04,666
We are a family now.

1241
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:07,791
Tao is getting married to Pei-pei.

1242
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:15,000
This is a lucky day.

1243
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,041
Golden Dragon wants to present

1244
01:29:19,166 --> 01:29:21,541
its new leader.

1245
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:44,166
Kun-kun, tell the men to bring out
the gang's new sign.

1246
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,625
He forced me to do this.

1247
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,541
Nokroo! Jer! Sing!

1248
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:05,250
Nokroo. Jer. Sing.

1249
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,291
-Ler!
-Ler!

1250
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:20,750
-Ler.
-Ler.

1251
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,291
He's a natural.

1252
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:31,791
He was born to do this.

1253
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:33,875
Let's open it.

1254
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:38,458
GOLDEN DRAGON

1255
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,958
Are those balloons?

1256
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:54,583
We're sorry.

1257
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:58,041
But we are not accepting
new members right now.

1258
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,666
Didn't you hear?
We don't want new members.

1259
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,833
Go!

1260
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,708
Wait.

1261
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:13,583
Go home and come back tomorrow.

1262
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:15,833
And change your outfits.

1263
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,791
Damn it. This is all my fault.

1264
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:26,875
I made a gay the head of the gang.

1265
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:32,166
Kun-kun, come join us.

1266
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,333
No, thank you.

1267
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:53,166
Have fun.

1268
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:55,708
Look at what he did to his dad.

1269
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:46,708
