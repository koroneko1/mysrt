&lrm;It's no good! The brakes are busted!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.740
&lrm;-Ready, Cat Noir?
&lrm;-I'm always ready.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.020
&lrm;Who needs brakes when they've got us?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.300
&lrm;So, er, Ladybug, what would you say
&lrm;if you and I met up tonight

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.500
&lrm;for a little dinner, rooftop-style?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.060
&lrm;-For dinner? As superheroes?
&lrm;-Well, uh... yeah! That's right!

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.420
&lrm;We're only together
&lrm;when we're saving Paris.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.020
&lrm;-Shouldn't we get to know one another?
&lrm;-I... That's so thoughtful. But I can't.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.980
&lrm;I have to... I've already
&lrm;got plans with some friends!

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.380
&lrm;Thank you. Thank you, Ladybug.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.020
&lrm;Well, if your plans end early,
&lrm;come and join me!

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.220
&lrm;-We'll see!
&lrm;-I'll be waiting, Milady!

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
&lrm;-It was delicious, sweetheart!
&lrm;-And, as a dessert...

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.580
&lrm;Ta-dah!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.340
&lrm;Wow! Oh! No, thanks, Dad.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.220
&lrm;-But isn't this your favourite?
&lrm;-And it still is, Dad! But...

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.380
&lrm;I told you I was going
&lrm;to get ice cream at André's.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.580
&lrm;[both]
&lrm;Oh! Sweethearts ice cream!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.860
&lrm;-That was where your father asked me...
&lrm;-To marry him.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.220
&lrm;He hid the ring
&lrm;in a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340
&lrm;And you almost swallowed it, too!

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.340
&lrm;They say that couples who eat ice cream
&lrm;at André's will stay in love forever.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.180
&lrm;By the way,
&lrm;who are you getting ice cream with?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.260
&lrm;Oops! Gotta go! Don't wanna be late!
&lrm;See you later, guys!

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.580
&lrm;[both]
&lrm;Oh...

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.220
&lrm;[sighs]

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.780
&lrm;There's no point
&lrm;in waiting for your father.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.020
&lrm;He'll be eating in his office.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.940
&lrm;What's the point of keeping me here
&lrm;if he's never going to show up?

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.660
&lrm;Don't forget to practise your piano
&lrm;before bed.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.340
&lrm;You could've at least grabbed
&lrm;that piece of &lrm;<i>camembert</i>&lrm;!

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.300
&lrm;Fuel up, Plagg! Adrien may not be allowed
&lrm;out of the house, but Cat Noir is!

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.740
&lrm;-You seem in a hurry to get stood up.
&lrm;-She didn't say she wasn't coming.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220
&lrm;But she didn't say she was, either.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.540
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.700
&lrm;Don't I even get a minute
&lrm;to digest my food?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020
&lrm;-Hey, Alya!
&lrm;-Hey, Marinette!

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.500
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;-Don't get upset, OK,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.100
&lrm;but Nino just got a text.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.500
&lrm;Adrien's dad isn't letting him go out.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420
&lrm;-Once again.
&lrm;-Yo, Marinette!

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.620
&lrm;-What's up, M?
&lrm;-How are you, Marinette?

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.540
&lrm;I'm fine, thanks.
&lrm;So, do you know where André is today?

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.740
&lrm;The deal with André is that
&lrm;you never know where he's gonna be.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.060
&lrm;You gotta follow his clues
&lrm;to find out.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.820
&lrm;The first time Mylène and I
&lrm;wanted André's ice cream,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.540
&lrm;it took us three hours to find his cart!
&lrm;Do you remember?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.700
&lrm;Hey! Someone posted a photo!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.700
&lrm;-He's on his way to the Pont des Arts!
&lrm;-Let's go!

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.940
&lrm;-Come on, Marinette!
&lrm;-Yeah! Awesome!

&lrm;the cutest lovebirds I've seen!

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.700
&lrm;Chocolate, praline
&lrm;and white nougat for you!

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.620
&lrm;A special concoction
&lrm;to keep your love true!

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.220
&lrm;Ah, these two I've never seen!
&lrm;This your first time here with me?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.100
&lrm;[both laugh]
&lrm;Yeah!

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.500
&lrm;Coconut, banana,

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.700
&lrm;-and a touch passionfruit!
&lrm;-Why don't you go and get one too?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.100
&lrm;What's the point? Adrien won't be coming.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.900
&lrm;He might not be here, but that shouldn't
&lrm;stop you from enjoying an ice cream

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.700
&lrm;and a fun night with your friends.
&lrm;And you could give me a taste, too!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.260
&lrm;And how about this young Miss,
&lrm;the pretty one who sighs?

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.340
&lrm;I've a flavour just for her.
&lrm;It's sure to make her smile.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.620
&lrm;-Me?
&lrm;-What's your name, dear?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.220
&lrm;Marinette.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.900
&lrm;Peach pink like his lips
&lrm;and mint like his eyes.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.100
&lrm;Eat this, my dear,
&lrm;and your love will materialise!

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.100
&lrm;No! There's been a mistake.
&lrm;I'm not in love with anyone

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.940
&lrm;and I think I've just lost my appetite.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.660
&lrm;But of course you are!

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.580
&lrm;When there's love burning in one's heart,
&lrm;André knows it from the start!

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.900
&lrm;Enjoy your ice cream, Marinette.
&lrm;I know he will be here.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.340
&lrm;Green eyes, like mint!
&lrm;Now who could that be?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.540
&lrm;Thank you. But you've got it all wrong.
&lrm;I don't have a...

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.380
&lrm;[whistling]

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.460
&lrm;Adrien?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.820
&lrm;Hey, you finally made it. That's great!

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.220
&lrm;[gasps] André's ice cream
&lrm;has always melted hearts!

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.540
&lrm;But the magic will only work
&lrm;if you eat it! I'll make another one.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.060
&lrm;-Thanks, but it's really not necessary.
&lrm;-Yes, it is, my dear!

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.020
&lrm;See here? My ice cream
&lrm;has brought everyone together!

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.540
&lrm;Every famous loving couple in Paris!
&lrm;Edith and Marcel,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.860
&lrm;Jeanne and Serge, Olive and Tom!
&lrm;Your loved one is out there! Somewhere!

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.500
&lrm;All you need is to believe in the magic
&lrm;of André's ice cream!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.740
&lrm;You're very nice, André.
&lrm;But I don't have a loved one.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.740
&lrm;Who has green eyes?
&lrm;Do you think we know him?

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.540
&lrm;Lay off, Ivan. There's no one, OK?

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.420
&lrm;And I don't think there's something
&lrm;magical about your ice cream.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.140
&lrm;It's just... ice cream!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.980
&lrm;Hey! I was going to get another one!

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.300
&lrm;But André's ice cream
&lrm;always melts people's hearts!

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.380
&lrm;At least, it used to.
&lrm;[sobs]

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.820
&lrm;A thwarted artisan, his shattered dreams,
&lrm;and the collapse of his whole world.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.620
&lrm;Quite chilling.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.900
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma, and freeze
&lrm;the heart of this ice-cream maker!

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.580
&lrm;I don't understand.
&lrm;It's never failed... ever!

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.980
&lrm;Glaciator, I am Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Revenge is a dish best served cold.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.540
&lrm;Since they refused
&lrm;to let you melt their hearts,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.500
&lrm;I'm giving you the power to melt
&lrm;their entire bodies instead.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.460
&lrm;I only ask a little favour in return.
&lrm;Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.900
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir-flavoured ice cream?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.060
&lrm;It's a deal, Hawk Moth.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.900
&lrm;I'll get even give a double scoop!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.660
&lrm;[screaming]

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.980
&lrm;Hello! How about some ice cream?
&lrm;Will that do?

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.500
&lrm;Enjoy it. It's just for you!

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.380
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.780
&lrm;Marinette!

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.300
&lrm;What a disaster! I ruined
&lrm;the whole night for all of my friends.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.980
&lrm;And I was mean to André. I'm so lame!

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.060
&lrm;You're not lame.
&lrm;You just overreacted a little.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.460
&lrm;Just let it go.
&lrm;Tomorrow will be a new day.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.860
&lrm;I'll never get to eat
&lrm;ice cream with Adrien!

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.740
&lrm;She loves me, she loves me not.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.420
&lrm;She loves me,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.620
&lrm;she loves me...

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.780
&lrm;-Hello.
&lrm;-Cat Noir?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.220
&lrm;Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.260
&lrm;What are you doing here? Don't you have,
&lrm;like, "superhero-y things" to do?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.860
&lrm;No. I don't feel like
&lrm;being a superhero tonight.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.420
&lrm;And I also don't feel like
&lrm;being alone tonight.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.140
&lrm;Would you mind if I hung out here
&lrm;for a little while?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.340
&lrm;Marinette, right?
&lrm;We've bumped into each other before.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.620
&lrm;Yeah, a bunch of times.
&lrm;I mean, yes, we have.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.260
&lrm;One time, a supervillain fell in love
&lrm;with me! Talk about bad luck!

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.020
&lrm;Seriously, I seem to be having some
&lrm;bad luck in the love department myself.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.580
&lrm;Really? What kind?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.980
&lrm;Well, tonight I had this special surprise
&lrm;all planned for Ladybug.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.460
&lrm;You're in love with Ladybug?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.780
&lrm;For real?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.780
&lrm;So, what was this special surprise?

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.380
&lrm;[sighs] It doesn't really matter,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.380
&lrm;'cause she never showed.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.900
&lrm;Sounds like you and I both need
&lrm;a bit of cheering up tonight.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.060
&lrm;You...
&lrm;You've gotten your heart broken too?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.220
&lrm;Yep.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.020
&lrm;Hey, come with me.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.460
&lrm;Close your eyes and hold on tight, OK?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.300
&lrm;Just give me a minute.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.500
&lrm;All right, you can open your eyes now.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.540
&lrm;Wow!

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.500
&lrm;Cat Noir... this is...

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.060
&lrm;beautiful!

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.620
&lrm;I'm so sorry.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.620
&lrm;-Why? It's not your fault.
&lrm;-No. Yeah.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.220
&lrm;I mean, what I mean is,
&lrm;I'm very sorry for you

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.540
&lrm;'cause, um, you prepared all this
&lrm;and then...&lrm;<i> she</i>&lrm; didn't show!

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.900
&lrm;She told me she might not make it,
&lrm;but I really wanted her to come.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.300
&lrm;Maybe she had a really good reason for not
&lrm;coming, like... a problem or something.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.740
&lrm;You're only saying that
&lrm;to make me feel better.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.420
&lrm;Yeah. I mean, no. I mean ... Look out!

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.980
&lrm;Marinette, party-pooper,
&lrm;you're looking so sad and surly!

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.300
&lrm;But Glaciator will make it all better,
&lrm;don't you worry!

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.020
&lrm;What's that?
&lrm;Another supervillain in love with you?

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.460
&lrm;No! That's... André the ice-cream maker!

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.340
&lrm;The sweethearts guy?
&lrm;He isn't looking too sweet now.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.540
&lrm;It's... it's a long story...

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.780

&lrm;Go inside, Marinette!
&lrm;I'll lead him away from you!

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.980
&lrm;Cat Noir!

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.260
&lrm;Thanks for cheering me up!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.180
&lrm;It was the least I could do.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.580
&lrm;Wow! I've never seen this sensitive side
&lrm;of Cat Noir before!

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.620
&lrm;Yeah, maybe I was wrong about him.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.980
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.020
&lrm;Ha!

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.900
&lrm;-Hey! Snow-dude! You looking for me?
&lrm;-Bad kitty!

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.860
&lrm;Where have you hidden Marinette?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.820
&lrm;Hi!
&lrm;Did the bad guys leave you cold?

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.540
&lrm;How was your amazing evening
&lrm;with your "friends"?

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.620
&lrm;I've never tasted "superhero"
&lrm;flavour before!

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.060
&lrm;I can't wait to serve myself
&lrm;a double scoop!

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.500
&lrm;[screaming]

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.500
&lrm;Don't forget what you promised me.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.100
&lrm;Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.540
&lrm;I'm a man of my word, Hawk Moth.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.980
&lrm;Come out now or I'll bury Paris
&lrm;in an entire layer of ice cream!

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.780
&lrm;The ice cream fires out of his hand.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.460
&lrm;And before André got akumatized,
&lrm;he served his ice creams using a...

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.900
&lrm;-A whatchamacallit!
&lrm;-That's called an ice-cream scooper.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.900
&lrm;-That must be where the akuma's located!
&lrm;-It's been a ball!

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.380
&lrm;But now it's time to turn you
&lrm;into popsicles, once and for all!

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.180
&lrm;[gasp]

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.900
&lrm;That's weird!
&lrm;He's leaving the couples alone.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.860
&lrm;-Too bad for us!
&lrm;-You don't understand!

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.740
&lrm;He doesn't attack couples,
&lrm;so we could pretend...

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.460
&lrm;Pretend?

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.140
&lrm;To be in love.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.220
&lrm;Sorry. It's not cool
&lrm;to play with people's feelings.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.100
&lrm;Are you mad
&lrm;because I didn't show up?

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.860
&lrm;-What do you think?
&lrm;-I didn't mean to hurt you.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.020
&lrm;-And I also had a surprise for you, too.
&lrm;-I really am sorry.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.260
&lrm;No, I'm the one who's sorry.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.300
&lrm;-Maybe another time.
&lrm;-Show yourselves, cowards!

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.060
&lrm;-Let's try your idea.
&lrm;-Perfect.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.780
&lrm;[Glaciator] I know you're here!

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.460
&lrm;Glaciator, fire!
&lrm;Now's the time! Freeze them forever!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.900
&lrm;-Hey!
&lrm;-It's all part of the plan.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.460
&lrm;I can't, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;They look so... in love!

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.540
&lrm;Now! Ha!

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.900
&lrm;I hit something inside!
&lrm;André's inside the monster!

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.700
&lrm;-[shouts]
&lrm;-Look out!

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.780
&lrm;This isn't over!

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.220
&lrm;-What should we do?
&lrm;-We must take care of him

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.860
&lrm;before all these people totally melt away!

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.180
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.980
&lrm;Looks like someone's going for a ride.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.020

&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.380
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.660
&lrm;Gotcha!

&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.300
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.500

&lrm;<i>Sacrebleu</i>&lrm;! How enchanting!

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.380
&lrm;He said it!

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.740
&lrm;Ladybug! You've melted all my plans!
&lrm;But someday, I will triumph.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.380
&lrm;And it will taste of such sweet revenge!

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.820
&lrm;-It's beautiful, Cat Noir.
&lrm;-Aren't you glad you finally came?

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.460
&lrm;Listen, I don't want to play around
&lrm;with your feelings.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.820
&lrm;It would be the same as lying to you
&lrm;and I don't want to do that.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.300
&lrm;You're more than a partner, Cat Noir.
&lrm;You're my friend.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.620
&lrm;And I'd never want to lie to a friend.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.380
&lrm;But why do you think it'd be lying?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.860
&lrm;Because there's this boy I...

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.620
&lrm;There's a boy? Who is... ?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.580
&lrm;It's...

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.180
&lrm;I can't tell you who it is.
&lrm;We can't know anything about each other.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.820
&lrm;Our identities must remain a secret.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.060
&lrm;We're both superheroes, Cat Noir.
&lrm;We don't have a choice.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.220
&lrm;I get it, Ladybug.
&lrm;Your friendship means everything to me.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.300
&lrm;You can keep the rose.
&lrm;It goes with your costume!

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.780
&lrm;The only way to get over a heartache is
&lrm;to eat a whole bunch of cheese. Shall we?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.420
&lrm;I don't have a heartache, Plagg.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.300
&lrm;Great! So, then, no cheese fest?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.420
&lrm;Perhaps Ladybug will love me some day.
&lrm;I mean, like I love her.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.300
&lrm;I have to believe. In the meantime,
&lrm;her friendship is the best gift of all.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:54.020
&lrm;Ugh! All this sweet talk
&lrm;is grossing me out! I need &lrm;<i>camembert</i>&lrm;!

&lrm;-Hey, pretty Marinette!

&lrm;Can I offer you some ice cream,
&lrm;to eat, this time?

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.900
&lrm;Of course! How else will I know
&lrm;if it's really the best in Paris?

&lrm;Peach pink like his lips
&lrm;and mint like his eyes.

&lrm;It's delicious!

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.940
&lrm;Still think
&lrm;it doesn't lock loves together?

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.340
&lrm;Never say never! Have a good day, André.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.620
&lrm;See you again soon, my dear.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.340
&lrm;Mmm!
&lrm;[laughs]

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.660
&lrm;Another customer! Welcome!

&lrm;On the house!

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.140
&lrm;There's love in your eyes.
&lrm;André can see it, clear as day!

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.420
&lrm;-This love is true!
&lrm;-Have a good day.
