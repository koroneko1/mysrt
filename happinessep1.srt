3
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,217
JUNG YI-HYUN,
THE PRIDE OF SEYANG HIGH SCHOOL

4
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,510
HIS KNEE IS BUSTED!

5
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,303
HE'S DOOMED!

6
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,313
The megaphone.

7
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,775
Jung Yi-hyun!

8
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,611
I know how you feel.
I was in Little League too.

9
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,365
So come down and talk. Come down.

10
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,158
You can just talk from there.

11
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,036
-What did he say?
-I couldn't hear him.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,038
Then give him a megaphone too.

13
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,417
I'll go up there, so wait a bit.

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,795
Let's talk when I get up there.

15
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,213
Where are the stairs?

16
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,388
He's just not coming down.

17
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,932
Focus on your books.

18
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,353
If you focus, you can't even hear
a bomb exploding next to you.

19
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,605
But classes are over.
Why aren't we going home?

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,232
No one can focus right now anyway.

21
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,443
Do you think Yi-hyun would be
happy if you ran out in a crowd?

22
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,904
He's already mentally unstable.

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,490
And if he jumps off impulsively
after seeing you guys,

24
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,411
I'm sure that'll help you focus
when you get home.

25
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,330
So you'll send us home
if he comes down, right?

26
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,167
Yes, I'll send you home right away.

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,918
The police are negotiating with him,

28
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,421
so don’t provoke me.
Just lie on your desk and sleep.

29
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,424
You've been a student for a long time.

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,925
It must be hard for you too.

31
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,429
-I'm going to the restroom.
-Hey, I told you not to provoke me…

32
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,516
Well, let's just keep quiet, please.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,851
Hey, all of you, focus!

34
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,103
Focus on your books.
The bomb is being dropped.

35
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,944
I will make sure
that you're all cured, okay?

36
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,906
If that can't be done,
I'll make you a cop at the very least.

37
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,116
So trust me and come down, okay?

38
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,868
I don't want to be a cop.

39
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,202
All right!

40
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,084
I'm his friend. I was told to come up
so I can help negotiate with him.

41
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,379
Talk here. I won't go. Talk here, okay?

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,423
Calm down first.

43
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,842
Yoon Sae-bom?

44
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,761
Hey!

45
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,846
Hey!

46
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,891
Hey, young lady!

47
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,434
Wait!

48
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,602
Who are you?

49
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,229
-Are you his girlfriend?
-No.

50
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,190
Hey, we can't go home because of you!

51
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,568
Mister, I will persuade him,
so wait there for a moment.

52
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,363
What's wrong with
the students at this school?

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,912
Are you upset you can't play baseball?

54
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,789
That's not what it is.

55
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
I just came up here
because I was frustrated,

56
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,419
but ambulances and police cars
suddenly arrived.

57
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,214
Which idiot made a report?

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,884
I'm just waiting to see
how far this will go.

59
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,261
I have nothing to do anyway.

60
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,138
Don't you have anything to do
besides baseball?

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,056
I don't.

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,183
I did it my entire life.

63
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,768
I was really good at it too.

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,896
And I ended up like this.
Would you be okay if you were me?

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,232
I did nothing my entire life,
but I was okay.

66
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,693
Hey, doing nothing is way better.

67
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,861
I was hospitalized for a long time.

68
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,489
And you know, it all just becomes
a good memory later on.

69
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,826
I can't play baseball ever again.

70
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,288
My life is over.
I don't know what to do in my life.

71
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,876
What about you, then?

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,545
What are you going to do?

73
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,506
I wanted to be a nurse until last week,

74
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,300
but a public official seems nice too.

75
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,844
I would need a monthly paycheck,

76
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,220
but I keep changing my mind.

77
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,974
See? You're feeling unsettled too
for being two years behind.

78
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,267
No.

79
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,563
I'm saying there's no limit
to our futures.

80
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,985
It's okay, so just do it,

81
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,279
and think that it's fine
even if it doesn't work.

82
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,714
Like me.

83
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,797
No, Mister.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,550
I planned to make him fall
onto the cushion.

85
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,156
Okay, let's talk when we get there.

86
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,283
-Let go of me!
-Hey!

87
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,077
Jung Yi-hyun!

88
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,038
Tell him that you don't want me
to get punished.

89
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,623
He's going to arrest me.

90
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,999
Hey, Yoon Sae-bom.

91
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,757
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

What are you doing? Treat him!

96
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,956
What are his injuries?

97
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,583
He got shot in the chest,

98
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,293
and he can't breathe.

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,843
It's a pneumothorax.

100
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,970
The air's leaking
from the hole in his lung

101
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,765
-and creating pressure--
-Don’t explain. Treat him!

00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,818
Don't think. Just do as you learned.

You're going to break my ribs, you jerk.

Instructor.

108
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,026
That was my clavicle, you idiot.

109
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,492
Trainee Lee Jong-tae,
you just killed your teammate.

110
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,869

-Did I do great?
-Yes.

115
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,978
Wear your gloves, or you'll slip.

116
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,313
Bye.

117
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,606
Are you really deducting points?

118
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,359
Yes, he's slow in making judgments,
and he's cowardly.

119
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,156
Based on your standards,
everyone in the world is slow, Sae-bom.

00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,220
what are you supposed to--

00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,972
What the…

125
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,893
Hey, don't do that!

126

Yoon Sae-bom!

127
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,897
What are you doing?

128
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,525
They had to make this because of you.

129
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,362
You stabbed his chest directly with it

130
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,199
and had Team Chief Choi
demoted to a patrol division.

131
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,286
He called me recently
and said it's the perfect place for him.

132
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,287
Really?

133
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,623
He sent me a gift coupon.

134
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,583
Then what about me?

135
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,127
Why didn't he send me one?

136
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,962
I'm sure he had a reason.

137
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
I'm hungry.

138
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,299

Hello, this is the front desk.

141
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,075
Yes, I can hear it too.

142
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,952
The second floor?

143
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,496
Okay, I'll go talk to them.

144
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,419
What are they doing
at this early hour? Seriously…

145
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,643
Excuse me, you have to pay
if you damage the motel's property.

146
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,902
Do you want to get beaten up?

147
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,002
It's hard to endure weather
that's gradually getting hotter,

148
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,048
but we're happy for being able
to breathe without wearing masks now.

149
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,260
The world has changed a bit
from before the COVID-19 pandemic,

150
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,264
but thanks to that, we learned
how precious normal daily lives are.

151
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,560
Dear listeners, I hope you can smile
looking at each other's uncovered faces,

152
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,605
take a deep breath
upon looking at the blue sky,

153
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,608
and have a great afternoon.

154
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,819
Dear listeners, have a great day,

155
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,613
and tomorrow…

156
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,074
COVID-19 MAY BE OVER BUT WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN ANOTHER DISEASE MAY BREAK OUT AGAIN

Here.

159
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,340
Hey, do you still want to play
baseball even with that knee?

160
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,717
I get paid to play for this team.

161
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,886
-What kind of a case is it?
-Murder.

162
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,971
You didn't even know what the case was?

163
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,098
I was told to come, so I came.

164
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,059
I even gave up my day off and my game.

165
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,520
-You should thank me.
-Oh, thank you so much.

166
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,980
People from the next room reported it.

167
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,732
-I heard the scream and--
-Excuse me.

168
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,276
-Who's the victim?
-The front desk employee.

169
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,194
Let's go.

170
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,905
-All I need to do is testify?
-I can't believe this.

171
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,227
What did they do to his neck?

172
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,438
Well, that looks like

173
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,191
it was done with a dull blade, right?

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,818
Perhaps they wanted him to suffer.

175
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,696
-Who's the suspect?
-The guest who stayed here.

176
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,240
There were a lot of complaints
because he was so noisy.

177
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,909
But who covered him with this?

178
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,084
-Did you meddle with the crime scene?
-No, we didn't touch anything.

179
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,378
-Any witnesses?
-None so far.

180
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,506
He said it was like this from the start.

181
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
Did they check the security cams?

182
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,387
Right. The security cams.

183
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,852
Hey, what about the security cams?

184
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,190
They're checking it now,
but they can't find the suspect leaving.

185
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,737
He covered the victim's face and ran away.

186
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,741
But the camera didn't catch him leaving.

187
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,036
I'm sure he did
an electronic access register,

188
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,829
but the CDSCHQ won't let us see it.

189
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,206
It's a breach
of personal information protection.

190
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,875
Hey, killers have no rights.

191
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,003
They should integrate
the information and arrest all of them.

192
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,838
I don't understand.

193
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,260
Oh, I didn't mean you.

194
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,470
Okay.

195
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,685
I'm sure they didn't
search in there, right?

196
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,328
Hey, I know you investigate recklessly,
hoping for good luck, but--

197
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,997
It can't even go near the "reckless" part.

198
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,293
I know someone who's even more…

199
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,505
Sir…

200
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,091
come out.

201
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,175
Are you kidding me?

202
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,012
If this is another joke,
I'm going to kill you today.

203
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,267
Damn it!

204
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,936
Our eyes just met.

205
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,856
Hey, we got the culprit. Don't come in.

206
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,984
Come in later.

207
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,160
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD, SUNG WOO-JAE

208
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,496
Did you do this, Mr. Sung Woo-jae?

209
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,707
I don't know.

210
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,461
Did you cover the body
because you were scared to see the body?

211
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,797
Then why did you kill him?

212
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,298
You don't remember that either?

213
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,512
I had a dream, but…

214
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,765
Was the dream about killing him?

215
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,771
You’re covered in blood,
so you couldn't run away.

216
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,067
You were panicking, but the police came,
so you must've hidden.

217
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,194
By the way, where's the weapon?

218
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,573
What did you kill him with in the dream?

219
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,616
Oh, that's right.

220
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,369
The court won't acknowledge it
if there's no weapon.

221
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,249
You see,

222
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,210
I was thirsty for some reason, so…

223
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,682
Did you bite him?

224
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,026
Give me one more.

225
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,281
ONE MAIN SIDE DISH PER PERSON

226
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,920
Were you doing physical labor or what?

227
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,005
Why are you eating so much?

228
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm upset, so don't say anything.

229
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
Here.

230
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,682
If you have something to say, go ahead.

231
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,442
SEYANG FOREST LE CIEL
PUBLIC RENTAL APARTMENT NOTICE FOR POLICE

232
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,444
What are you reading?

233
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,739
They're developing
the National Police Agency's old location.

234
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,115
They're building apartments.

235
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,036
Three police officers' households
will get special provisions for that.

236
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,122
Really? What are the conditions?

237
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,749
My wife's dream is to move
into that new apartment.

238
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,001
They give extra points
for long-term service,

239
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,087
family members to provide for,
and newlyweds.

240
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,715
The biggest chunks come from
arrest records and work evaluations.

241
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,968
Once I'm chosen,
I'll get an apartment for sure.

242
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,761
It's like winning the lottery.

243
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,639
Who are we going to arrest? Terrorists?

244
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,309
You never know
what might happen in life, okay?

245
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,979
If I show something today…

246
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,856
What are you going to show?

247
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,774
I'm thinking.

248
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,997
Take it easy with sports.
Don't get injured again.

249
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,164
Okay.

250
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,590
(I AM) THE LIFESAVER

251
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,801
Sae-bom, are you religious now?

252
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,428
It's my friend.

253
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,724
The timing isn't very…

254
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,102
Hey, what is it?

255
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,063
Your unit was mentioned
during an investigation, so…

256
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:50,981
Why?

257
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,567
You're instructing
a training course, right?

258
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,611
He said he got drugs from an SOU trainee.

259
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,330
He said the drug was perfectly legal.

260
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,499
I'm sure he just meant
you wouldn't get caught.

261
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,711
Do you have any leftover drugs?

262
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,882
I received three or four tablets,
but I think I took them all.

263
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,676
-What's the name of the trainee?
-Lee Jong-tae.

264
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,137
Lee Jong-tae?

265
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,889
Salute!

266
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,474
TRAINEE LEE JONG-TAE

267
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,811
Anyway, we're sending the document.
I thought you should know.

268
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,939
Well done.

269
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,317
If I find the entire gang,
then I'll get an arrest record.

270
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,693
What are you talking about?

271
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
I'm just letting you know.

272
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,835
I'll be back soon,
so keep an eye on my food.

273
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,380
It's more important than food?

274
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,347
That's strange.

275
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,153
Don’t worry. I warned everyone

276
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,447
that they're dead
if they eat your pork cutlet.

277
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,158
What are they doing?

278
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,995
Are they actually having sex here?

279
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,538
Those punks…

280
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,916
Trainee Lee Jong-tae.

281
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,088
Trainee Lee Jong-tae!

282
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,298
Help!

283
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,602
What is that?

284
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,398
Lee Jong-tae, stop right there!

285
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,128
Seung-young, take him and go.

286
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,699
Next, it'll be your pelvis.

287
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,917
What is that?

288
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,294
How should I know?

289
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,435
I'll stay here,

290
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,854
so you take him and get him treated.

291
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,569
We have an emergency patient!
Anyone there?

292
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,404
This is not a drill!

293
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:44,214
Instructor, please call an ambulance.

294
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,549
Instructor!

295
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,847
Instructor…

296
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,399
Instructor…

297
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,621
Get the medical trolley.

298
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,880
Be careful not to get bitten.

299
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,474
(I AM) THE LIFESAVER

300
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,157
Hey.

301
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,951
You should've told me it was dangerous!
I almost got killed!

302
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,078
What are you saying?
Why would you get killed?

303
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,998
How could he not feel pain
even when he got shot?

304
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,917
Who shot who? Hey, are you okay?

305
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,128
I'm okay, of course, but…

306
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,547
How could you catch someone
like that without a gun?

307
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,425
I just persuaded him by talking to him.

308
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,428
How is that possible?
You could get through to him?

309
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,014
Hey, tell me what happened in detail.

310
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,432
Did you meet Lee Jong-tae?

311
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,475
Yes.

312
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,646
Did he… try to bite you?

313
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,189
So you do know about it.

314
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,192
What kind of nonsense is this…

315
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,738
Hello? Hey, Yoon Sae-bom!

316
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,865
Hey, are you okay?

317
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,493
Hey, answer me! Hey!

318
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,410
Yes?

319
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,706
Why didn't you answer? You scared me.

320
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,175
Corporal Yoon Sae-bom.

321
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,264
This is the ladies' restroom.

322
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,182
The guy you shot.

323
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,310
There's a possibility
he has an infectious disease.

324
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,530
What infectious disease?

325
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,449
We're currently investigating.

326
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,201
Sae-bom, who are you talking to right now?

327
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,667
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok from
the Crisis Management Center at CDSCHQ.

328
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,253
Corporal Yoon will call you back.

329
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,550
Give me your gun and cooperate
with the disease investigation.

330
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,328
Who are you people?

331
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,413
-You can eat my pork cutlet.
-Sae-bom.

332
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,083
The National Police Agency
will send guidelines soon.

333
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,959
What happened earlier was an accident.

334
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,044
So keep this secret.

335
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,089
Corporal Yoon has the risk
of infection, so we're taking her.

336
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,469
(I AM) THE LIFESAVER

337
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,932
-Hello?
-Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok?

338
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,017
Wait, please don't hang up.

339
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,770
I'm Corporal Jung Yi-hyun
from Seyang Police Station.

340
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,564
Can you please briefly explain
what's going on?

341
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,652
Corporal Yoon has been in contact with
an infected trainee so she must be tested.

342
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
Does that mean she's okay now?

343
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,243
She's essential personnel,
so she's fully vaccinated too.

344
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,870
What infection are you talking about?

345
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,997
We'll have to find out. I'll hang up now.

346
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,959
It's Lee Jong-tae, right?
The infected trainee.

347
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,670
We also arrested a murder suspect

348
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,005
who was in contact with Lee Jong-tae.

349
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,465
Did you say murder?

350
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,676
He bit someone's neck.

351
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,512
Is that symptom related to the infection?

352
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,057
Did you say Seyang Station? I'll be there.

353
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,434
Wait.

354
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,270
Should all those who were
in contact be in quarantine too?

355
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,730
If they were bitten or scratched, yes.

356
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,200
SEYANG POLICE STATION

357
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,793
As long as you weren't bitten
or scratched, you're fine.

358
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,463
You're Mr. Han Tae-seok, right?

359
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,423
Where's Sae-bom?

360
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,886
She's being tested in a safe place.

361
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,686
THE 3RD WONJUNG UNIVERSITY
ANTI-REDEVELOPMENT RALLY

362
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,903
WONJUNG UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING

363
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,536
STOP

364
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,431
LIEUTENANT COLONEL HAN TAE-SEOK

365
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,143
You're military,
but you're doing civilian work.

366
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,396
It's important to show that
the two can cooperate in times of crisis.

367
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,443
So this is an infectious disease
that makes people bite other people?

368
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,656
We're thinking that it's
a mutant virus that affects the brain.

369
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,701
When you're bitten, you either die
from excessive bleeding or get infected.

370
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,081
Gosh, droplets aren't enough anymore,
now the diseases even spread from bites.

371
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,542
The infection channels are limited,
so don't worry,

372
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,044
and just work hard
on your assigned duties.

373
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,921
Hang on.

374
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,298
We don't need to be
in self-quarantine, right?

375
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,926
You just need to write
and sign a confidentiality oath.

376
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,304
That suspect said that he did it
after he took drugs.

377
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,184
The drugs he received
from his SOU trainee friend.

378
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
Do you have that drug?

379
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,566
No.

380
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,319
Maybe it's just a side effect
of a hallucinogenic, not a disease.

381
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,615
There's no possibility of that,
but it may have had an influence.

382
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,492
Contact me when you find the drug.

383
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,914
Corporal Jung Yi-hyun.

384
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,251
Are you playing baseball again?

385
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,670
You were quite
a rising star in high school.

386
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,591
I can't run at my full speed anymore, so…

387
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,760
That's too bad.

388
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,809
He must be a big baseball fan.
He recognized you.

389
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,644
Did Sung Woo-jae get tested for narcotics?

390
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,313
Yes, we sent his hair to KCSI.

391
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,316
I'll give you a number,
so track it down and find where it is.

392
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,652
-Hey, where are you going?
-To find the drug.

393
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,931
Jung-kook, I found it.

394
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,308
I'm calling you
so you won't waste your time.

395
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,644
The test results just came out.

396
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,812
It's perfectly clean.

397
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,190
Oh, really?

398
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,776
Yes, I guess it really is
an infectious disease.

399
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,946
Would it be okay for me to go home today?

400
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,948
Hey, if I show my teeth to my wife…

401
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,950
-Wait…
-Then I'll lose all of them.

402
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,785
Then what about what I found?

403
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,870
Cold remedies, painkillers, vitamins…

404
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,288
There are all kinds of drugs.

405
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,458
Stop wasting your time. Just go home.

406
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:43,938
SUPER ROOKIE BASEBALL ACADEMY

407
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,863
Hey, Il-ho.

408
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,170
Hey, why didn't you play
at the game today?

409
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,546
Come inside.

410
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,059
You should call me
or answer my calls, at least.

411
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,935
Everyone nagged me about it.

412
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,353
Stop nagging me.

413
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,397
Hey, more than that…

414
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,858
Look at this.

415
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,234
What is this?

416
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,487
I think it's a narcotic.
Do you know what it is?

417
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,072
Why would you bring this to me?

418
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,657
Don't get the wrong idea
and listen to me, okay?

419
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,743
You got kicked out because of drugs.

420
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,578
I only took it by mistake.

421
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,705
You call yourself a friend?

422
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,832
No, you were trying
to get better at baseball.

423
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,126
I wanted to be good too,
but it didn't work out.

424
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,961
Don't even bring up the past.

425
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,546
Right. The past.

426
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,882
You later made up your mind
and studied very hard.

427
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,343
Sports medicine and computers.

428
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,306
This is really important to me, all right?

429
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,686
This isn't a narcotic.

430
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,271
Why not?

431
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
Do you see the serial numbers here?

432
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,443
No one does that for narcotics.

433
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,446
This was made by a pharmaceutical company.

434
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,241
You'll be able to find it
in the pharmaceutical database.

435
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,201
-Find out what it is.
-Me?

436
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,036
-Until when?
-Now.

437
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,499
Wake me up when you're done.

438
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,191
Are you collecting my blood, too?

439
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,233
What is this place?

440
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,737
It doesn't look like a hospital.
It looks like a school.

441
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,407
We can't set neck-biting infected free
in a place crowded with people.

442
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,245
Am I going to become like
Trainee Lee Jong-tae, too?

443
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,381
I was teasing. I won't bite.

444
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,552
-You'll get hurt if you do that.
-So please answer me.

445
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,726
I thought you were putting ointment on me.

446
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,361
What should I do now
until the results come out?

447
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,155
Testify.

448
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,325
Tell me about what happened today.

449
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,872
I saw Trainee Lee Jong-tae
attacking a fellow trainee,

450
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,457
and tried to stop him.

451
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,251
How did Lee Jong-tae seem?

452
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,669
He was in a bad condition.

453
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,462
Be more specific, please.

454
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:41,133
Both of his eyes were milky,
like he had cataracts,

455
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,719
and he tried to bite me like a beast.

456
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:48,266
I shot him twice, but it seemed like
he couldn't feel any pain.

457
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:53,354
Is this like some kind of rabies?

458
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,940
It's similar.

459
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,194
My detective friend said that
he might've been on narcotics.

460
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,154
If someone goes mad and bites a person,

461
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,657
the police would believe
that it was because of drugs.

462
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,534
Because that's the easiest answer.

463
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,288
And an infectious disease is
an easier answer for you.

464
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,707
Because people see what they believe.

465
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,791
But…

466
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,627
aren't you a police officer, too?

467
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,214
We specialize in dealing
with terrorist attacks.

468
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,924
We only get paid by the police.

469
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,598
Is Trainee Lee Jong-tae…

470
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,351
okay?

471
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,562
He's miraculously recovering.

472
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,315
We will get you a place to rest
until the test results come out.

473
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,610
Aren't you giving my phone back?

474
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,904
We'll bring a telephone to your room.

475
00:38:53,289 --> 00:39:00,296
UNKNOWN NUMBER

476
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,848
-Hello?
-You got me into this mess!

477
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:13,476
Yoon Sae-bom?

478
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,562
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

479
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,939
It's cleaner than
the public official apartment.

480
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,775
That place is over 50 years old.

481
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,110
It always leaked
and the pipes froze in winter.

482
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,946
And they put three people into one house!

483
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,490
It's cold.

484
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,537
Can they afford to pay
the electricity bills?

485
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,915
How's your condition? Did you get tested?

486
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,875
Yes, I got tested for everything.

487
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,045
Goodness, I got this year's
health checkup all cleared.

488
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,839
I have to stay here
until the results come out.

489
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,175
I told your mom about you.

490
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,302
You couldn't wait for half a day?

491
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:51,222
Hey, no news is good news.

492
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,848
Don't worry, okay?

493
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,434
I told her you're busy
because of the training.

494
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,896
Well, you've got that much sense,
at least.

495
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,649
I'm also looking into this
to find out what's going on.

496
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,026
By the way, where are you?

497
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,570
I don't know.
It looks like a school dormitory.

498
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,657
Hey, don't worry.
I'm sure they won't kill me.

499
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,159
I don't feel particularly ill,
so I can just rest up

500
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,661
until the results are out.

501
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,998
We got the narcotics test results
for our suspect, and he's clean.

502
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,959
Really?

503
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,962
Is it really an infectious disease?

504
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,505
From what I see, it's narcotics.

505
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,966
You really are a cop.

506
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,342
What do you mean?

507
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,803
It's nothing.

508
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:37,017
Anyway, I'll catch the culprit
and let you rest without any worries,

509
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,644
so just rest there a bit, okay?

510
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,521
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

511
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,148
It's late. Go to bed.

512
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,650
LYTTA VIRUS RESULT REPORT

SUPER ROOKIE BASEBALL ACADEMY

521
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,403
Hey, get up. I found it.

522
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,696
What?

523
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,408
You found it?

524
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,576
Let me see.

525
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,244
"Next."

526
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:44,913
"Next"?

527
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,124
What is that?

528
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,420
Oral medication for pneumonia.

529
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,589
Many antivirus studies
took place during COVID-19.

530
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,090
It came out then,

531
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,926
but the side effects were serious,
so it was quickly dropped.

532
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,053
Side effects?

533
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,641
Addiction, hallucinations, mood swings…

534
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,643
And enhanced concentration too.

535
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,479
It had one good thing about it, at least.

536
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,356
Then why did it pass the drug test?

537
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,941
Causing hallucinations
doesn't just make it a narcotic.

538
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,486
It's a narcotic only when
the law says it's a narcotic.

539
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,365
Hey, Il-ho.

540
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,575
By any chance…

541
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:28,082
what if this causes something like rabies?

542
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,210
There will be a frenzy.
This has spread widely already.

543
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,421
But that's not going to happen.

544
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,131
Why not?

545
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,136
Nothing has happened until now.
Why would things suddenly go wrong?

546
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,402
SEYANG POLICE STATION

547
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,738
Jung-kook, did you track down that number?

548
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,241
Oh, wait. Here.

549
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,369
They're at a university. Is it a student?

550
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,247
Isn't this a crappy university?

551
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,249
I guess they had terrible grades.

552
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:12,876
Thanks.

553
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,794
Hey…

554
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,089
Was I too harsh?

555
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,479
No one wakes me up
and I don't have to go to work.

556
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,647
How nice.

557
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,025
It's cold.

558
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,576
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom, please come out.

559
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,620
First Lieutenant, when did you…

560
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,457
Are the test results out?

561
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,916
We're testing you again.

562
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,216
First Lieutenant, please tell me
before you cut my flesh off today.

563
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,135
My feelings will be really hurt.

564
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,480
Are there other patients here, too?

565
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,905
Lee Jong-tae?

566
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,701
-Let me talk to him.
-No.

567
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,331
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom!

568
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,458
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom!

569
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,878
It won't take long.

570
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,723
Are you okay?

571
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,394
I feel a bit cold, but I'm okay.

572
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,699
Do you remember being shot by me?

573
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:09,993
Yes.

574
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,080
What about biting your fellow trainee
and attacking me?

575
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,874
I don't know.

576
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,044
You do remember.

577
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,632
Ms. Yoon Sae-bom, stand back!
It may be dangerous!

578
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,843
It's okay. He looks fine right now.

579
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,642
Did you go mad after taking a drug?

580
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,310
Where did you get that drug?

581
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,315
I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,360
The guy you gave
the drug to got arrested already.

583
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:47,406
You know you'll get an additional penalty
because you're a police officer, right?

584
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,160
Do you see this?

585
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,289
You scratched me, Jong-tae.

586
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,792
They say it's an infectious disease,
but I'm not sure.

587
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:05,382
We have to find out if it's
a disease or if it's because of the drug.

588
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,968
Understand?

589
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,014
That's the only way
I can be relieved and get tested.

590
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,769
Can I have a drink of water, please?

591
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,062
Absolutely not!

592
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,981
I'm just so thirsty.

593
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,399
She said you can’t.

594
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,195
I'm thirsty.

595
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,702
Hey, what are you doing?

596
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,288
Open your eyes. I'm talking to you.

597
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:42,878
Hey.

598
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,560
Lee Jong-tae.

599
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,136
Give me water. I'm thirsty.

600
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,520
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok,
are you there?

601
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,831
THERE ARE NO REDEVELOPMENT PLANS
DO NOT BE FOOLED

602
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,878
You are approaching your destination.

603
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,137
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT

604
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,849
You have reached your destination.
Ending route guide.

605
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,191
How can we help you?

606
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,485
Isn't this Wonjung University?

607
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,113
It was closed for being substandard
and now the military is using it.

608
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,951
I'm from the police.
Can I meet the person in charge?

609
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,746
This a classified military area,
so I'm afraid you can't.

610
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:32,422
Then please tell Lieutenant Colonel Han
that I brought the drug I told him about.

611
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,349
Let him in.

612
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,607
You made me meet Lee Jong-tae
on purpose, didn't you?

613
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,317
You even installed a camera there.

614
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,945
I wanted to know when he'd feel thirsty.

615
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,198
Thirsty?

616
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,909
The infected lose their senses
and bite people.

617
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,536
They feel extreme thirst…

618
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,622
but water can't quench it.

619
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:17,926
They keep feeling thirsty and going crazy
even after coming back to normal.

620
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,554
We're trying to find out
the conditions for that

621
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,222
and I was curious

622
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,683
about how Lee Jong-tae
would react if he saw you.

623
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,811
So you wanted to see how he would be
if he saw the one who shot him?

624
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,397
They can recognize their families,

625
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,940
so I wondered about the others.

626
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,068
That wasn't all of it.

627
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,823
His heart beat slower,
he seemingly felt less pain,

628
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,158
and his wound healed faster too.

629
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,996
If it can be controlled,
it can be lucrative.

630
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,086
So that's why
you're investigating it secretly.

631
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,007
It's not highly contagious,
but it can scare people.

632
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,342
Everyone's already tired of diseases,

633
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,261
so we don't need to make things worse.

634
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,522
So why do you turn
the air conditioners on?

635
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,525
The occurrence of the disease
slows down in low temperatures.

636
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,033
Is this a test too?

637
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,826
To see if I'm thirsty or not?

638
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,663
According to the test results,
you really are okay.

639
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,209
I'm usually not that lucky.

640
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,296
You need to get some rest for a while.

641
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,131
Here?

642
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,634
Wherever you want.

643
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,138
Really? Is that possible?

644
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:51,061
Just say you contributed to the nation
and got injured in the process.

645
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,356
And we have to collect
your blood every two weeks.

646
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,067
You're not showing any symptoms,

647
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,487
so it means the antibody
might have formed in your body.

648
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,659
THE ARMED FORCES MEDICAL COMMAND

649
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,208
I feel like I'm someone quite important.

650
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,877
One more thing.

651
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,676
I've contributed to the nation.

652
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,596
Then give me
top work evaluation points for this year.

653
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,348
What?

654
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,768
The apartments in Seyang
provided to the police officers.

655
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,520
The selection is based on points.

656
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,856
Newlyweds, family to provide for,
years in service, and work evaluation.

657
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,024
They're all added up.

658
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,113
You're powerful enough
to at least do that, right?

659
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,033
I think that would be possible.

660
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,869
You have a decent evaluation too, so…

661
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,247
I have the best evaluation.

662
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,499
I was born to subdue terrorist attacks.

663
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,171
I'm glad that we're on the same page.

664
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,177
-People don't shake hands these days.
-My phone.

665
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,019
By the way, don't you even offer
breakfast here?

666
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,196
Thank you. I'll enjoy this at home.

667
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,535
Do you have a boyfriend?

668
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,542
It's not that I don't like you,

669
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,670
but the age gap between us is way too big.

670
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,923
Work evaluation points won't be enough.

671
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,508
You'll need more points.

672
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,302
So I was wondering if you had a plan.

673
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,346
I can start making plans now.

674
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,098
Aren't you worried?

675
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,437
I will get the apartment,
so you don't need to worry.

676
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,731
I meant what you saw yesterday and today.

677
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,486
If something goes wrong,
the world may collapse.

678
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,864
Worrying won't change anything.

679
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,117
Perhaps it may not collapse.

680
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,424
First Lieutenant,

681
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,010
what about the clothes I was wearing?

682
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,763
We burned them.

683
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,725
Then should I go home in these?

684
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,855
Yoon Sae-bom? Hey.

685
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,982
Are you okay? Let me see.

686
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,740
First Lieutenant, can't you trust me?

687
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,326
I'm hurt.

688
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,454
They said I'm okay and told me to go home.

689
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,042
I'm sorry. This is because of me.

690
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,712
-You look thinner.
-Really?

691
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,589
It's because I didn't have breakfast.

692
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,425
How did you get in here?

693
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:14,264
-Did you get caught too? Were you bitten?
-No, I came to rescue you.

694
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,269
Wait here. I need to go talk to someone.

695
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,279
That punk.

696
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,542
I think you're good enough
to play baseball again.

697
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,217
Is this the drug?

698
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:55,763
Yes, I heard it's
a failed pneumonia medicine.

699
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,349
And I heard that tons of people
have taken that already.

700
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,853
I also heard that wasn't the cause,
but a promise is a promise.

701
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,148
Just because it was okay yesterday

702
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,359
doesn't mean it will be okay today.

703
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,617
Bye.

704
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,070
Come on. I'll take you home.

705
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,658
Yes, it was right next to me.

706
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,621
Yi-hyun.

707
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,583
Do you have a girlfriend?

708
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,293
Why are you asking that?

709
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,003
-Do you?
-I don't.

710
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:12,048
-Do you snore? Or grind your teeth?
-I don't think so.

711
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,383
Will you marry me?

712
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,177
Jung Yi-hyun!

713
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,806
Tell him that you don't want me
to get punished.

714
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,224
He's going to arrest me.

715
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,642
Hey, Yoon Sae-bom.

716
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,813
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

717
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,819
No.

718
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,533
I told you I was just kidding back then.

719
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,286
I'm not kidding.

720
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,329
I mean it.

721
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,497
If people suddenly start
to go mad like that…

722
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,792
Info on Han Tae-seok like you asked…

723
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,421
I seriously hate him.

724
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,632
I got a house.

725
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,301
It won't open.
The lower floors are public rentals,

726
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,511
and the upper ones are regular apartments.

727
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,222
I got a call from a journalist.

728
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,100
There's a way to make money,
and safety is guaranteed.

729
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,686
-Seung-young!
-We have a problem at the dorm.

730
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,105
Where are the seriously ill patients?

731
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,608
But aren’t they living human beings?

732
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,234
If we're late,
even more people will get hurt.

733
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:02,909
