00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,171
Uh, one of each.

161
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,030
[old man]
Are you people in a hurry?

162
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,930
Uh, I'm trying to get to Wembley
a little early

163
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,427
to set up for the competition.

164
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,845
I'm one of the contestants.

165
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,179
Well, you know what they say.

166
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,975
Life is what happens when you're busy
making other plans.

167
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,978
That's the second time
someone said that to me.

168
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,605
Maybe you need to hear it.

169
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,149
Right.

170
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,694
Merry Christmas.

171
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,903
Merry Christmas.

172
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,865
[honks]

173
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,533
Hey! Slow down!

174
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,452
Would you watch where you're going?

175
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,120
Who's yelling?

176
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,621
A tourist, sir.

177
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,706
Hmm.

178
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,666
Probably from the States.

179
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,750
Probably.

180
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,880
[Stacy]
Piping bag, prep spoons,

181
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,841
rolling pan, sifter, and sauté pan.

182
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,134
It is all here.

183
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,595
Alphabetized the equipment list?

184
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,888
Yeah, of course I did.

185
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,140
I don't like the handle on this one.

186
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,534
- Get a new one tomorrow?
- Great.

187
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,686
Stacy De Novo. What a surprise!

188
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,647
Brianna Michaels.
I didn't know you were going to be here.

189
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,441
I won the competition last year.

190
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,943
[Stacy]
Oh! Well, congratulations.

191
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,607
And what are you making
for your <i>pièce de résistance?</i>

192
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,114
Cheetos à la mode?

193
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,365
Hey! I like Cheetos.

194
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,328
- And you are?
- Kevin Richards. I work with Stacy.

195
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,371
Stacy and I went
to Le Cordon Bleu together.

196
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,874
Yeah, Brianna was really close
to some of the faculty.

197
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,584
They knew I had talent.

198
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, yeah, like when you sauced
Professor Kendall's berries?

199
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,505
[chuckles sarcastically]

200
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,924
[gasps]

201
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,260
Oh, I'm so sorry.

202
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,512
Let me help you.

203
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,888
Thanks. I'm fine.

204
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>Enchanté.</i>

205
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,894
- She seemed...
- [Olivia] Mean?

206
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,856
I better go clean up.

207
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,409
- [woman] Oh!
- I am so sorry.

208
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,702
No problem.

209
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,622
[both gasp]

210
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
Who are you?

211
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,883
Lady Margaret Delacourt,
Duchess of Montenaro.

212
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,013
- You're the one who's marrying the Prince?
- Yes.

213
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,516
Oh, right. You're here for that tour.

214
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,936
Uh, look, I am really sorry
for running into you.

215
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,729
I'm usually not this messy,

216
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,607
uh, but I'm one of the contestants
at the baking contest,

217
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,818
and there was an accident
in the kitchen.

218
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,779
I'm sorry. I'm Stacy De Novo, by the way.

219
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,158
Nice to meet you.

220
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh!

221
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,957
Miss De Novo.

222
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,877
Did you say you were a baker?

223
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Uh, yeah. As a matter of fact,
I have my own shop in Chicago.

224
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,802
Well, as you know, I'm getting married,

225
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:22,557
and I could really use an expert opinion
on my wedding cake.

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
From me?

227
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,397
The Royal pastry chef here
has a way of doing things,

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,483
and I'm not sure they're to my liking.

229
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,862
Well, when it comes to wedding cakes,
the bride is always right.

230
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,030
Precisely.

231
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
I know it's short notice,

232
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:45,246
but would you join me at the palace
for a consultation later on today?

233
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,414
A consultation?

234
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
Wow!

235
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,543
I would be so honored.

236
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,880
- Shall we say in an hour or so?
- An hour?

237
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,090
Yeah, sure.

238
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,509
I mean, I was going to go sightseeing
with my friends,

239
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,553
but I'm sure they'll understand
if I tell them...

240
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,681
Oh, no. You can't tell a soul about this.

241
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,059
I wouldn't want to risk offending
the King and Queen.

242
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,687
Right, of course not.
My lips are sealed.

243
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,147
Brilliant.

244
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,231
Great.

245
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,569
Do I really need to bow or something
before I go?

246
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,780
It really isn't necessary.

247
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,489
Great.

248
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,669
I tested out the oven
while you were gone,

249
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,546
and it doesn't look like you had
much luck with that stain.

250
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,006
- Stain?
- Your apron.

251
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,218
[laughs] Right, my apron.

252
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,681
Um, you know, I think the best thing to do
would be to just go buy a new one.

253
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,016
If you hang on a sec,
I'll pack this stuff up,

254
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,393
and we can all go together.

255
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,560
No!

256
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,147
What I mean is
Olivia doesn't want to go shopping

257
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,857
for some silly, old apron.

258
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,110
Maybe you and I can watch
some more of the ballet.

259
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,779
And you can ask
how much the summer program costs.

260
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,282
Liv, you know we could never afford
something like that.

261
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,575
Meet you back at the cottage in an hour.
Deal?

262
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,659
Deal.

263
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,208
Hey!
[laughs]

264
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,214
I really wish you and Stacy were a thing.

265
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,843
Stacy and I have been friends
since high school.

266
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,429
If sparks were gonna fly,
we'd know by now.

267
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,431
Maybe you're just not trying hard enough.

268
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,516
She's my best friend, Liv. You know that.

269
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,103
Besides, she's just a little too intense
for someone like me.

270
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,229
People change.

271
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,230
Not that much.

272
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,112
[Mrs. Donatelli]
It's uncanny.

273
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,076
Do you think we could be related somehow?

274
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,080
Three generations ago,
your great-grandmother's cousin, Cecil,

275
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,169
fled the country after a dalliance
with a vulgar American divorcée.

276
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,380
It was rumored
that Cecil settled in the United States.

277
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,758
His daughter married
a man named De N'Ofrio,

278
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,259
but the families lost touch.

279
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,429
De N'Ofrio, De Novo... It could be.

280
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,391
Stacy, I think we were destined
to run into each other.

281
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,475
Don't you?

282
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,771
I don't know about destined...
[chuckles]

283
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,315
But I am so happy
to help you with your cake.

284
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,817
I do need a favor,

285
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,071
but it has nothing to do
with baked goods.

286
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,280
What kind of a favor?

287
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,617
Would you like some tea?

288
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,621
Sure.

289
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,335
I'm supposed to marry Prince Edward
on New Year's Day,

290
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,338
but I don't know anything
about the people here

291
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,383
or what a normal life here,
or anywhere, is like.

292
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,928
So, you want me to teach you
how to be normal?

293
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,722
No. I want to be you.

294
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,141
I want to switch places with you.

295
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,476
Switch places?

296
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,146
I become you, and you become me.

297
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,482
Get out!

298
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,983
It would only be for two days.

299
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,944
No one would even notice.

300
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,279
I'm kind of guessing
your fiancé would notice.

301
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:09,200
Edward is leaving town tonight
to meet with the Spanish Ambassador.

302
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,203
He won't be back
until the day after tomorrow.

303
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,705
So, you wouldn't have to deal
with him at all.

304
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,167
You know, it doesn't sound like
you're too excited about getting married.

305
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,379
My parents taught me
that marriage is about duty,

306
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,548
about alliances between nations.

307
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,343
Now that they're gone,
I'm not going to disappoint them.

308
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,346
So, what?
It's, like, an arranged marriage?

309
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,686
Edward and I met twice
before we were engaged.

310
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,980
It's not that he's unpleasant.

311
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,607
He's just very... formal.

312
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,403
Does he happen to have
one of those fancy limousines?

313
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,447
I believe so.
Why do you ask?

314
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,407
Not important.

315
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,162
Look, the only thing on my schedule
is breakfast with the King and Queen.

316
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,123
You can spend the rest of your time
relaxing right here.

317
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,291
Please.

318
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,585

It's one of the Royal Charities.

So if an adorable,

to do the summer program?

481
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,097
Yes.

482
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,392
I believe you will be.

483
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,191
[sighs]

484
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,491
[giggles]

485
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,911
[laughs] Oh!

486
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,371
[gasps]

487
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,419
[laughs]

488
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,093
Hello, darling.

489
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,678
[giggles]

490
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,096
[knocking on door]

491
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,933
Mrs. Donatelli?

492
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,815
[knocking on door]

493
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:07,941
[Stacy]
I'm coming!

494
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,572
It's you again.

495
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,866
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

496
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,496
No. No, not at all.

497
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,582
Mrs. Donatelli went to fetch some tea,

498
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:28,087
and in Montenaro, it's the custom
to always wear a hat to tea.

499
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,630
Even in one's nightgown?

500
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,508
Yes, yes.

501
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,636
There can be no exceptions,
substitutions, or exchanges.

502
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,389
- Excuse me?
- Our code of etiquette was drafted

503
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,767
by a rather fastidious attorney.

504
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,230
Is there something I can do for you?

505
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,524
Yes, I just wanted to say

506
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,236
I hope you understand
that I wish I could rearrange my schedule.

507
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,029
I hate to leave at such short notice.

508
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,614
I completely understand.

509
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,033
Schedules are important
to keep things organized.

510
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,576
I couldn't agree more.

511
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,121
- "A goal without a plan is..."
- "Just a wish."

512
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,956
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

513
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,417
<i>The Little Prince.</i>

514
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,171
One of my favorites.

515
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,589
Mine too.

516
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,971
Well, safe travels.

517
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,054
Thank you.

518
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,306
Oh.

519
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,232
Really?

520
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,532
So much to do,
and so little time to do it.

521
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
[King George]
Hmm.

522
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,703
- Mmm.
- Ah.

523
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,288
Please join us, dear.

524
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,957
Your Majesties.

525
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,138
[King George]
I trust you slept well.

526
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,973
Very well indeed.

527
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,438
The weather is particularly
splendid today, isn't it?

528
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,607
Hmm. If one is a fan of frostbite.

529
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,608
Oh.

530
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,652
[Queen Caroline]
I'm so glad to see you, my dear.

531
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,989
I've been talking with chef
about the menu for the reception.

532
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,366
What about the menu? Prithee, tell.

533
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,247
It's the salad course.

534
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,500
Chef was thinking
about a peanut sauce for salad dressing.

535
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,961
But I seem to recall
that one of your relatives is allergic.

536
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,922
I just can't recall which one.

537
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,132
My mother's side.

538
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,216
The Pembrokes.

539
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,719
Lord Percival?

540
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,304
Didn't he die last spring?

541
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,305
Mmm.

542
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,933
Yes. Yes, he did.

543
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,602
Suddenly, in fact.
The dear thing.

544
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,064
So we won't have to worry
about poor Percy.

545
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,107
You know? I never did like peanuts.

546
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,234
Hmm.

547
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,946
Well, then we'll find something else.

548
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,029
Oh, you all right?

549
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,409
Oh, yes. Just... surprised.

550
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,036
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

551
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,039
Of course. I just...

552
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,209
Didn't you leave for your meeting
with Spain last night?

553
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,755
Edward had the good sense to turn around
before he arrived at the airport.

554
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,342
Yes, I thought it wrong to be concerned
with affairs of state

555
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,025
with our wedding just around the corner.

556
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,763
And I'm determined to spend
as much time together as we can

557
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,181
over the next few days.

558
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,975
How smashing!

559
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,935
And now, you can both attend

560
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,229
the St. Andrew's Shelter
Charity Ball tonight.

561
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,984
How doubly smashing!

562
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,319
Which reminds me.
I have something for you.

563
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,363
Oh.

564
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,493
Wow!

565
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,997
I had it made for your engagement present.
I hope it's suitable.

566
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,457
It's... It's very suitable.

567
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,629
Extremely suitable.

568
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:58,547
[Prince Edward]
Good.

569
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,300
Well, in the meantime,
I've spoken to Miles at the stables,

570
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,261
- and he'll be ready for us in an hour.
- Ready?

571
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,014
For us to do what?

572
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,099
I thought a nice ride
through the countryside

573
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,059
would be a fun surprise
for you this morning.

574
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,936
Oh!

575
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,147
Isn't it too cold to go riding?

576
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,858
- I thought you said you love the cold air.
- I do.

577
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,943
I... I do.

578
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,237
But I'm worried about the horses.

579
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,491
[laughs] The horses live in the stables.
They're used to the cold.

580
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,827
Well, of course they are, here.

581
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:33,915
But not in Montenaro.
It's much warmer back home.

582
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,335
I thought you had
a terrible snow storm last winter.

583
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,795
We did.

584
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:39,963
Terrible.

585
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,382
Dreadful, really.

586
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,678
But we have heated stables.

587
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,139
Ah, well...
[chuckles]

588
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,726
- How very nice for the horses!
- Yes, well, you know what they say.

589
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,270
A warm horse is a happy horse.

590
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,606
And there's nothing better
than a happy horse.

591
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,441
Hmm.

592
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,736
Well, I better change
if we're going riding.

593
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,446
- Yes.
- Yes, all right.

594
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,551
- Frank?
- Sir?

595
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,765
I want you to keep a close eye
on the Duchess.

596
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,267
- She seems, um...
- Different?

597
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,395
Hmm.

598
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,938
Different.

599
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,399
Hmm.

600
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:47,239
All right, we have our eggs, our pancakes.
Should be enough.

601
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,492
Breakfast is ready.

602
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,795
You never burn anything.

603
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:06,466
Uh, I guess I'm a bit nervous
with the big contest coming up.

604
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,592
Maybe we should eat out.

605
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,095
- Splendid.
- Splendid?

606
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,932
Splendidly super.

607
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,018
Stacy, what did you do to your hair?

608
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,438
Oh, I got a trim.

609
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,731
Thought I'd mix things up a little.

610
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,942
Are you feeling okay?

611
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Super.

612
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,823
Uh, will your father be joining us?

613
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,116
[chuckles]

614
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,368
Father went out to get that sauté pan,

615
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,662
and he said he'd pick you up a new apron.

616
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,789
Super-duper.

617
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,584
So, where should we go?

618
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,003
There was a place right on the square.

619
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,086
Right.

620
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,671
The square.

621
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,759
Where we bought the Christmas tree,
remember?

622
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,888
Right! The Christmas tree.

623
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,727
Tell you what, you get the coats,
and I'll wash the dishes, deal?

624
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,519
Deal.

625
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,314
Secret handshake?

626
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,695
[clears throat]

627
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,990
[Margaret]
Oh! [laughs]

628
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,290
Hey! [giggles]

629
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,342
Okay.

630
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,184
[phone vibrates]

631
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,228
Stacy, phone!

632
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:48,193
[phone continues vibrating]

633
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,577
[phone ringing]

634
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,246
Oh, come on, Margaret. Pick up.

635
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,664
[phone continues ringing]

636
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,747
[clears throat]

637
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,877
Was Your Grace having difficulty
with her mobile telephone?

638
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,922
Oh, no. It's nothing.

639
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,258
Just a dropped signal.

640
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,385
Would you like borrow mine?

641
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,762
Oh, no. I wouldn't want to impose.

642
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,807
Oh, it's no imposition.

643
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:25,230
The Duchess is quite capable
of placing her own calls, Mr. De Luca.

644
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,190
I was just trying to be of service.

645
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,609
Well then,
you may take these to the laundry.

646
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,112
It's that way.

647
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,742
[quietly] The laundry.
For God's sake!

648
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,231
- Shall we?
- We shall.

649
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,524
Good.

650
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Oh, dear God!

651
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,115
[chuckles awkwardly]

652
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,325
Is there a problem?

653
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,493
Not at all. It's just...

654
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:25,248
The horses in Montenaro are a bit shorter,
like large ponies.

655
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,585
But... no problem.
[laughs]

656
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,378
None in the least.

657
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,966
Here we go.

658
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:41,473
- Are you all right?
- Mm-hmm.

659
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,683
I thought you said
you were a competitive rider.

660
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,437
Oh. Uh, I'm quite competitive indeed.
[laughs]

661
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,857
It's the pants.

662
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,486
They must have shrunk in the royal wash.

663
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,570
Huh.

664
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,532
Wouldn't want to split a seam.

665
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,203
All right, there we go.

666
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,246
You know, we really don't have to do this.

667
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,502
Oh, no. We are scheduled to go riding,
so that's what we're going to do.

668
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,213
- Well, then let me give you a hand.
- All right.

669
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,135
Ready? One, two, three.

670
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,555
- Better?
- Much.

671
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,474
Good. Okay.

672
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,186
Right.
[clicking tongue]

673
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,106
All right. Oh! Oh!
[laughs]

674
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,151
[Stacy chuckles awkwardly]

675
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,004
[sighs]

676
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,297
Here. Let me help you.

677
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,882
I'm quite all right.

678
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,217
Well, just in case.

679
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,263
[giggles]

680
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,225
You have something in your eye.

681
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,488
This really is quite breathtaking.

682
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,324
Yes. Yes, it is.

683
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,827
I come here when I need to get away.

684
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,454
Do you need to get away a lot?

685
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,540
Sometimes the affairs of state
can be a burden.

686
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:35,336
Burdens usually aren't so bad
when you have someone to share them with.

687
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,381
[laughs] I doubt you'd be interested
in the details of foreign trade.

688
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,342
- Why not?
- You shouldn't have to worry about that.

689
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,970
Because I'm not bright enough?

690
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,222
No, because you have a wedding to plan.

691
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,267
So I should stick to things
like polishing my tiara?

692
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,436
No, I didn't mean it like that.

693
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,189
Well, I think it's precisely
what you meant.

694
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,776
It's getting a bit chilly.
I think it's time to head back.

695
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,444
Margaret...

696
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,865
[Stacy clicks tongue]

697
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,207
[phone vibrates]

698
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,417
Hello.

699
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,878
Ugh! Boy, am I glad you picked up.

700
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,047
[Margaret on phone]
<i>I was going to call you.</i>

701
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,216
There's been a bit of a snag
at this end.

702
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,299
What happened?

703
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,888
Hey there, Princess.

704
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,474
Oh! You figured us out!

705
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,100
It wasn't rocket science.

706
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,185
You okay with this, Liv?

707
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,549
[Olivia on phone]
<i>You kidding? I get to hang with royalty.</i>

708
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,440
And Margaret told me
all about that ballet scholarship,

709
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,317
and that's so totally cool.

710
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,945
I'm glad you're all right.
Let me talk to Margaret.

711
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,157
We're getting on fabulously.

712
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,868
Well, that's great
because things are not fabulous here.

713
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,329
- [Margaret on phone] <i>Why not?</i>
- Edward is back.

714
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,331
Get out!

715
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,541
I'm not kidding.

716
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,393
[Margaret on phone]
<i>But he's supposed to be...</i>

717
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,044
Never mind where he's supposed to be.

718
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,965
The fact is he came back
to spend time with you, with me, with...

719
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
I don't know, us?

720
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,387
Oh, and you didn't tell me
about the charity thing tonight.

721
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,056
- Didn't I?
- [Stacy on phone] <i>No, you didn't.</i>

722
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,517
I suppose it must have slipped my mind.

723
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,310
Well, you need to get back here pronto.

724
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,479
I'm afraid I can't do that.

725
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,065
- Why not?
- With all the preparations for the ball,

726
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,818
there's no possible way
I could sneak in without someone seeing.

727
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,904
Besides, it sounds like
you're getting on famously.

728
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,365
I vaulted over a horse!

729
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,953
If Edward hasn't found out yet,
we're in the clear.

730
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,705
I don't know if I can keep this up.

731
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,626
Oh, I must run. Ask Mrs. Donatelli
for anything you need. Toodles.

732
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,378
Wait.

733
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,504
[sighs]

734
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,716
[sighs]

735
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,552
- I got the apron and the sauté pan.
- Super.

736
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,635
You decided to eat out?

737
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,598
Stacy's decided she's gonna be
spontaneous from now on.

738
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,475
I'll believe that when I see it.

739
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,852
- I mean it!
- Okay.

740
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,105
Then let's forget about that schedule
of yours and just hang out.

741
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,188
Super.

742
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,109
You sure about that?

743
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,449
[laughs]

744
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,382
May I help you?

745
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:30,470
The Prince would like to see the Duchess
in the Portrait Library.

746
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,597
I'll be sure to let her know.

747
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,390
Oh, Mr. De Luca.

748
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,060
Ms. Donatelli.

749
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,774
These need to go to the kitchen.

["Joy to the World" playing]

751
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,336

00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,631
What do you think?

00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,883
- It's pretty.
- Let me see.

00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,094
Oh! Gorgeous!

755

Okay.

756
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,138
Huh?

757
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,100
And what's that supposed to be?

758
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,435
Rudolph!

759
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,562
Rudolph the blood-sucking Reindeer?

[laughs]

761
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,608
Okay, smarty-pants, let me see yours.

762
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,529
Christmas should be about love.

763
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,865
I've never seen you so sentimental.

764
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,159
Maybe you don't know me that well.

765
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,953
[Santa Claus]
Ho, ho, ho!

766
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,122
[Olivia]
Look, it's Santa!

767
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,250
- Go for it. I'll wait for these to dry.
- Come on!

768
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,631
Does the heart good
to see two people in love.

769
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,968
Who, me? With her?

770
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,651
Looks like a match made in heaven to me.

771
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,138
We're just friends. I mean...

772
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:56,722
She's not my type.

773
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,350
I wouldn't be so sure.

Go on, babe. Go.

00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,076
And what would you like for Christmas?

Um, let me see.

A new pair of ballet slippers,

00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,330
a skateboard,

780
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,541
and oh, yeah, a new mom.

[shutter clicks]

788
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,617
She's very regal.

789
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,077
That's my grandmother.

790
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:02,830
Her necklace, is that a family crest?

791
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,959
It's been passed down from generation
to generation for over 300 years.

792
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,503
That's a lot of generations.

793
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,090
Granny was a bit of a rebel.
She had an opinion on everything

794
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,926
and wasn't afraid
to let everyone know what it was.

795
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,803
The palace wasn't used to it.

796
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,806
She sounds like she was ahead of her time.

797
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,101
Palace could use someone like her again.

798
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,188
So, you wanted to see me?

799
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,899
Yes, I did. Um...

800
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,069
I believe I need to apologize.

801
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,696
You believe you need to apologize.

802
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,073
You're not certain.

803
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,158
No, actually, I know I do.

804
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,410
Apologies are important.

805
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,332
The truth is when we were out there

00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,402
I'll take that as a compliment.

970
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:17,749
"He sprang to his sleigh,
to his team gave a whistle,

971
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:22,004
and away they all flew
like the down of a thistle."

972
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:27,718
Isn't she wonderful?
Reading to the children like that?

973
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,386
The Duchess is very special.

974
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:34,099
"And I heard him exclaim
as he rose out of sight,

975
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,018
'Merry Christmas to all,

976
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,562
and to all a good night.'"

977
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,234
Yes?

978
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,737
Is it true you're really a princess?

979
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,824
Not yet. But I will be
after I marry Prince Edward.

980
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:53,952
Are you in love with him?

981
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,537
[children giggle]

982
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,539
Very much.

983
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,461
I wish I could be a princess.

984
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,714
The most important thing
about being a princess

985
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,133
is caring about other people.

986
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,429
And if you do that,
then you're a princess in your heart.

987
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,266
Can we all please say,
"Thank you, Lady Margaret"

988
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,101
for her time here today?

989
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,146
[in unison]
Thank you, Lady Margaret!

990
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,899
You're very welcome.

991
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,363
Is that your Christmas tree?

992
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,615
Yes, it is.

993
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:32,908
Where are the presents?

994
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,869
We don't have the budget for presents.

995
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,829
What about the money from the ball?

996
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:41,750
It is earmarked for the essentials:
food, clothes.

997
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,169
So the children don't get any toys?

998
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,755
Toys are in short supply.

999
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:50,592
But we usually manage
to find a wee little something

1000
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,762
to pop in their stockings
on Christmas morning.

1001
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,773
I trust it was a good visit?

1002
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,776
It was very educational.

1003
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,903
The families here don't have
a real Christmas tree

1004
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,147
or presents for the children.

1005
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:18,120
Unless we do the shopping,
and the wrapping, and the baking.

1006
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,956
You and I?

1007
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:21,957
Why not?

1008
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
You've already made
the proper gesture, Your Grace.

1009
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,045
A gesture isn't what Christmas is about.

1010
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,508
We have the afternoon free.

1011
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,801
Well...

1012
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,262
It's a very ambitious undertaking.

1013
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,643
So I suppose we'd better get right to it.

1014
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,021
[squeals]

1015
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,357
Oh! Uh, sorry.

1016
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,276
That wasn't very dignified.

1017
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,029
It's all right. I liked it actually.

1018
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,283
Frank, the nearest toy emporium
on the double.

1019
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,453
A toy emporium.

1020
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,789
Frederick's on Palmetto Road,
Your Majesty.

1021
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:03,957
Frederick's.

1022
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,924
Palmetto Road.

1023
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,428
According to the guide book,
the fountain is right up ahead.

1024
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,014
Can I get a candy cane?

1025
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,224
Yeah. There you go. Knock yourself out.

1026
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:23,142
[chuckles]

1027
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:30,525
You know, there is a legend that says
the St. Nicholas Fountain never freezes

1028
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,111
because of the warmth
of the Christmas spirit.

1029
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,489
I'm guessing there's
an underground spring.

1030
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,283
Well, I like the legend better.

1031
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,036
You know what?
So do I.

1032
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:42,787
[chuckles]

1033
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,000
[man]
Excuse me? Are you Stacy De Novo?

1034
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,752
Yes. Yes, I am.

1035
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,088
Adam Delaney, <i>Food Insider</i> Magazine.

1036
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:54,800
I heard about your bakery in Chicago.
I'd love to do a feature on you.

1037
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,760
Hello! Brianna Michaels.

1038
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,595
I won the competition last year.

1039
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,971
Great.

1040
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:03,433
So the buzz is
you're the one to beat this year.

1041
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:07,771
Oh, well, uh, it's not just me.

1042
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,523
We are a team.

1043
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,777
This is Kevin, my very talented sous-chef.

1044
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,863
Kevin. Can I get your full name please?

1045
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:19,574
Yeah, sure. I'm Kevin Richards.

1046
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,868
[Delaney]
And how long have you been a team?

1047
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,915
- [Kevin] A long time now.
- [Stacy] Very.

1048
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,386
[Prince Edward]
This is nice.

1049
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,471
[Prince Edward and Stacy laugh]

1050
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,224
Oh, very nice.

1051
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,644
[gasps] I always wanted one of these.

1052
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,563
- [laughs]
- [gun sounds]

1053
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,022
My parents never let me have one.

1054
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,817
Well, what's wrong with saving the Earth
from an alien invasion?

1055
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,194
If you're going to save
the Earth from an alien invasion,

1056
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,613
you should probably do it
by diplomacy not warfare.

1057
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,906
- [scoffs]
- [gun sounds]

1058
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,200
Yes. We'll need about a dozen.

1059
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,036
Ooh! And a few of these as well.

1060
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,332
Edward, look what they have.

1061
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:15,046
Ooh! It's a mat
with... large colored circles.

1062
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:19,259
[laughs]
You've never played Twister before?

1063
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,552
Ah, it's a game.

1064
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,722
Take off your shoes this instant.

1065
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,432
- [chuckles]
- Now.

1066
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,102
[giggles]

1067
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,397
Has the Duchess always been so different?

1068
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,110
Tell me, has the Prince always been so...

1069
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,320
ordinary?

1070
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,948
You're hiding something.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

1071
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,203
You're going to be looking
for a long, long time.

1072
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,750
[Stacy and Prince Edward laughing]

1073
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,043
Right hand red.

1074
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,295
[both laughing]

1075
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:00,717
So, that's how you do things in Montenaro.

1076
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,221
It was nice of you
to let me do that interview.

1077
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,680
Well, you deserve it.

1078
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,059
Guys, come look! It's a toy store!

1079
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,810
I've never been in a toy store.

1080
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:12,479
What?

1081
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,773
Um, what she means is

1082
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:19,110
she's never been
to a "Belgravian" toy store.

1083
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,070
Oh.

1084
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,947
- [Olivia] Come on!
- Lead the way!

1085
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,161
All right.

1086
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,042
Oh, wow!

1087
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,214
Geez Louise!

1088
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:41,508
Excuse me?

1089
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,386
My earring from Aunt Louise, it's gone!

1090
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,597
Yes, yes. Maybe look over there.

1091
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,642
- I changed my mind. Let's go see Santa.
- Yeah!

1092
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,687
- We just saw Santa.
- Yeah, but he and I didn't go deep.

1093
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:59,025
Oh! Oh, my goodness!
I feel so... so faint!

1094
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,070
First, you wanna go shopping.
Now, you wanna see Santa.

1095
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,321
What's going on with you?

1096
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,198
Come on, Liv. Spill.

1097
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:10,203
Excuse me. Sorry to be a bother.
My car has run out of petrol.

1098
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,706
The station is down the street,
but I can't push it myself.

1099
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,958
Think you could give an old man a hand?

1100
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,793
Of course we can.

1101
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,754
- Yes, here we go.
- Just hot. Thank you.

1102
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,131
Wait a second. I know you.

1103
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,591
On the square in town,
you had one of those booths.

1104
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,594
Closed early today.
Rheumatism's acting up.

1105
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,305
The car's right outside.

1106
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,098
Great! Let's go.

1107
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,433
Okay.

1108
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,857
Oh, wait! I see it.

1109
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,525
- Here it is.
- Ah!

1110
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,403
- Yes. Close one.
- Right.

1111
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,657
- Cooled down?
- Yes.

1112
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,201
There we go. I feel much better now.
It's fine.

1113
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,508
Here. Try this.

1114
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,093
[chuckles]

1115
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:14,768
Where did a Duchess learn
to bake like this?

1116
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,019
My father.

1117
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,272
Your father?

1118
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,858
The Grand Duke of Montenaro baked cookies?

1119
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,109
Best cookies in the world.

1120
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,652
You miss him, don't you?

1121
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,323
I'm generally not the sentimental type,

1122
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:32,077
but doing things like this helps
keep a piece of the past alive.

1123
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,800
[Prince Edward]
Yes, I know what you mean.

1124
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,581
I used to love the smell
of turkey roasting at Christmas.

1125
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,875
It meant my cousins were coming over
to play.

1126
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,460
That was a long time ago.

1127
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,422
It's still all right to play sometimes.

1128
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,175
[Prince Edward chuckles wryly]
Not so sure about that.

1129
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:48,843
Well, I am.

1130
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,848
[Prince Edward]
All right.

1131
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,895
- [laughs] Here.
- Okay.

1132
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,565
Hang on. I think there's a couple more.

1133
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,403
I wrapped that one.

1134
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,780
Your Highness wrapped
the presents himself?

1135
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,949
- Really?
- A few. With a little help.

1136
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:14,244
Taking the time to wrap a gift
is part of the gift itself.

1137
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,121
It's what we say in Montenaro anyway.

1138
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,540
Well, it's not very dignified for a royal.

1139
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,583
It's always dignified to be kind, Frank.

1140
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,920
- Right. Shall we?
- Yes.

1141
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,843
- Do you see what's going on out there?
- I do.

1142
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,511
[King George]
I don't like it.

1143
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,055
There's something about that girl.

1144
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,017
George! She's a breath of fresh air.

1145
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:41,896
And it seems your son
is falling in love with her.

1146
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,649
Yes.

1147
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,818
Well, I suppose that's all that matters.

1148
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,696
You know that's all that matters.

I've always wanted one of these!

Good. We need someone
to defend our galaxy.

When diplomacy fails.

Look! I really am a princess!

Your Majesty!

1166
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:46,669
Your Royal Highness and Lady Margaret
have given us so much this Christmas.

1167
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,630
Well, it was all the Duchess's idea.

1168
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,008
Well, it was a very gracious gesture.

1169
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:57,055
That's just it. Christmas is about more
than just a gesture,

1170
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,306
which is why I've decided

1171
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,142
that Lady Margaret and I are going
to make it a tradition

1172
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:03,186
to come here once a month
and get to know you all.

1173
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,861
That's wonderful.

1174
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,614
Excuse me.

1175
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,325
You're standing under the mistletoe.

1176
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,618
[Mrs. McBride]
Oh!

1177
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,911
Ah, so we are!

1178
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:36,928
- Who wants to go play Twister?
- Twister? My favorite. Come on, Frank.

1179
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,972
That's not really
in my job description, sir.

1180
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,682
It is now. Come on.

1181
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,854
Oh! That was the best spaghetti
I've ever had.

1182
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:49,857
Since you're doing the heavy lifting
at the competition tomorrow,

1183
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,026
I figured it's the least I could do.

1184
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,323
- So, are we going out tonight?
- Ooh!

1185
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,759
- You're going to bed.
- [grumbles]

1186
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,536
We have an early start tomorrow.
We got to be at Wembley by 8:00.

1187
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,037
- But...
- Pajamas.

1188
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,038
Now.

1189
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,415
Can Stacy tuck me in?

1190
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,916
Sure.

1191
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,468
She never runs out of energy, does she?

1192
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,304
Her mom was like that.

1193
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,056
Do you miss her mother?

1194
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:24,976
- You know me better than that, Stace.
- [chuckles]

1195
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,477
Karen and I weren't meant to be.

1196
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,147
Like you and Paul.

1197
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,400
Well, you're right.

1198
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:34,944
We weren't.

[knocks]

1200
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,752
So I guess you're leaving tonight.

1201
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:51,919
I don't have a choice.

1202
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:53,671
I wish you could stay.

1203
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,342
I wish I could too.

1204
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,969
But you'll have Stacy back,

1205
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,055
and I must get on with my duty.

1206
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:06,392
Which means you have to do things
even if you don't want to do them?

1207
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:08,186
Something like that.

1208
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,604
That's not fair.

1209
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,687
It's complicated,

1210
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,691
but I'll never forget you
and your father.

1211
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,818
You'll always be special to me.

1212
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,154
But you're meant to be here.

1213
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,076
I'm afraid I don't get
to decide things like that.

1214
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,661
You should.

1215
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,470
[sighs]

1216
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,849
You know, I think this trip
has done you a lot of good.

1217
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,310
- You do?
- I mean,

1218
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,604
it's almost like
you're not the same person.

[laughs]

1220
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,982
- Please!
- No, I mean it.

1221
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,485
There's just something less...

1222
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,696
intense about you.

1223
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,115
I don't know.

1224
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,409
Just being here,

1225
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,911
making Christmas ornaments,

1226
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,914
singing carols.

1227
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,543
I mean, all those little moments with you.

1228
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,130
It's what life's really about.

1229
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,844
That is the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1230
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,554
Well, it's true.

1231
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:28,432
So...

1232
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,145
- Wanna watch a Christmas movie?
- Sure.

1233
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:33,771
Which one?

1234
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,774
The... one with Santa.

1235
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,944
Stace, they all got Santa.
[chuckles]

1236
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:43,698
[laughs] Right.
Then you choose.

This one.

- No, it's your favorite.
- Right.

I was just messing with you.

1241
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,422
I'll pop the corn.

1242
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,312
[Prince Edward]
I've learned so much from you.

1243
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:11,100
Like how to bake cookies
and wrap presents?

1244
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:15,396
Like how to understand people
and how to reach out to them.

1245
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,316
You have a good heart, Edward.

1246
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,026
You're going to do just fine.

1247
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,487
As long as you're here to help me.

1248
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:27,074
Well, I suppose it's time to turn in.

1249
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,036
I wanted to give you something.

1250
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,873
Didn't have time to wrap it,
but... probably for the best.

The family crest.

1255
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,310
The one from the painting.

1256
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,647
It belonged to your grandmother.

1257
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,900
Margaret, if I'm being truthful...

1258
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,612
I was worried about us,
about the wedding, about...

1259
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,698
- not knowing who you are.
- Yeah.

1260
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:08,782
But after today,

1261
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,993
I'm not worried anymore.

1262
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,872
You really are Prince Charming.

1263
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:23,631
I...

1264
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,925
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

1265
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,637
No, you did everything right.

1266
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,532
Well, then I'll see you in the morning.

1267
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,270
You will see your Duchess in the morning.

1268
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:49,782
[sniffles]

1269
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:05,548
There is nothing like a happy ending
to make someone cry.

1270
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,259
Endings usually aren't very happy.

1271
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,557
Hey, what is it, Stace?

1272
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:19,896
I don't know.
Just feeling sentimental again.

1273
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,315
Must be the movie.

1274
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,319
Well, speaking of sentimental...

1275
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:27,986
Don't kill me.

1276
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,532
I got you a little something.

1277
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,367
But it's not Christmas yet.

1278
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,787
- It's not for Christmas.
- Then what's it for?

1279
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,583
It's in your stocking.

1280
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,222
Open it.

1281
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,397
What do you think?

1282
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,320
It's the most beautiful gift
I've ever received.

1283
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,282
Thank you so much.

1284
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,242
May I?

1285
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:22,959
Look, I know...
we've been friends for so long.

1286
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:31,092
But these last few days, I...

1287
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,053
I felt like it could be more.

1288
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,932
At least... to me.

1289
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,979
I think you felt it too.

1290
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,489
- Something wrong?
- No.

1291
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,701
Yes.

1292
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:01,747
I mean, it's me.
I should not have done that.

1293
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:05,084
- It's okay.
- No, it's... It's not.

1294
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,382
Can we just pretend this never happened?

1295
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,300
Why?

1296
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:19,849
Please, you just have to trust me on this.

1297
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,477
Yeah, sure.

1298
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,061
Whatever you say.

1299
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,773
Thank you.

1300
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,405
Good night.

1301
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,742
Good night.

1302
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:12,610
[clock chiming]

1303
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,695
[knocking on door]

1304
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,041
I will be right outside.

1305
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,667
Thank you.

1306
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,177
[Stacy] So, did you get to do
everything you wanted?

1307
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,844
Almost.

1308
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,765
And you and Edward got on all right?

1309
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,184
Yeah. Everything's set for your wedding.

1310
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,144
Splendid.

1311
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:52,942
You know, Edward's really special.
He's thoughtful. He's kind.

1312
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,569
Your friend Kevin is the real prince.

1313
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,738
No, Kevin is just Kevin.

1314
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,115
He's one in a million.

1315
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,617
No, Edward is the one who...

1316
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,413
You're in love with Edward!

1317
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,378
And you're in love with Kevin!

1318
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:14,754
Oh!

1319
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,551
Well, this wasn't supposed to happen.

1320
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,261
No, it wasn't.

1321
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,764
So, what do we do?

1322
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:25,766
Nothing.

1323
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,394
You go back to being the Duchess,

1324
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,856
and I hop on a plane back to Chicago
as soon as the competition's over.

1325
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,113
Oh, I believe this belongs to you.

1326
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:50,124
[shutter clicking]

1327
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,459
What?

1328
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,718
[shutter clicking]

1329
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,804
Whoa! [yells]

1330
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,478
[sighs with satisfaction]

1331
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:13,981
Ow!

1332
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,374
Is it really you?

1333
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,919
[chuckles]
It's really me.

1334
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:39,923
[chuckles]

1335
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,264
[laughs]

1336
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,099
It really is you.

1337
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,062
Well, do you have
to sound so disappointed?

1338
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:55,481
No, no, no.
I'm really glad that you're back.

1339
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,859
It's just I really wish
Margaret didn't have to go.

1340
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:01,320
And now she has to marry
that creepy, old prince

1341
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,280
who probably smells like mothballs.

1342
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,327
Okay, first of all, the Prince
does not smell like mothballs,

1343
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,454
and he's definitely not creepy.

1344
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,622
Then what was he?

1345
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:12,957
Dreamy.

1346
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,251
Sweet.

1347
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:17,836
[chuckles]
Funny.

1348
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:22,216
Sounds like someone's crushing big time
on Prince Mothballs.

1349
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,513
Look, all I know is we have got
a big competition today, which means...

1350
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,391
we need to focus, okay?

1351
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,069
Yes?

1352
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,029
I have urgent business with the King.

1353
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,241
Anything that concerns the King
concerns me as well.

1354
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,492
It's a very delicate matter.

1355
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:52,288
I really should speak
to His Royal Highness directly.

1356
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:54,540
I see.

1357
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:59,336
It would be such a shame to lose one's job
right before Christmas, wouldn't it?

1358
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,547
- But...
- Hand me the envelope, Frank.

1359
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,548
But it's...

1360
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,967
Or would you prefer
to hand in your resignation?

1361
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,677
No. No.

1362
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,512
Your Majesty.

1363
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,099
Oh, and, Frank,

1364
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:15,644
there seems to be a plumbing problem
in the privy next to the study.

1365
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,104
Would you mind taking a look?

1366
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:21,859
It would be my great honor, Your Majesty.

1367
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,586
- Your bath is ready, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

1368
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,713
Forgive me for speaking plainly,

1369
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,716
but that doesn't sound
like a very happy bride-to-be.

1370
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,635
My happiness isn't what matters.

1371
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:50,595
It's my duty.

1372
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,851
Oh, before I forget,
Miss De Novo gave me this to give to you.

1373
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,936
It's a gift from Edward.

1374
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,860
<i>"Veritas, Anoris, Amare."</i>

1375
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,781
"Truth, honor, and love."

1376
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,698
Funny thing,

1377
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:12,743
it doesn't say a word about duty.

1378
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:31,929
Remarkable.

1379
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:36,266
A remarkable resemblance,
wouldn't you say?

1380
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:41,271
Apparently, she's a baker
at the competition in Wembley.

1381
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,903
Looks like a princess to me.

1382
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,627
[show host] Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could please find your places

1383
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,755
and make way to your seats.
The competition is about to begin.

1384
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,926
- Looks like we're good to go.
- Great.

1385
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,597
Stace, about last night...

1386
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,433
Let's just talk about it
on the plane, okay?

1387
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,476
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1388
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,813
Good afternoon, and welcome

1389
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:26,859
to Belgravia's 56th Annual International
Christmas Baking Competition.

1390
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,112
The finest bakers from around the world
will have five hours

1391
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:32,990
to prepare the most spectacular
Christmas cake.

1392
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,409
Only one will be crowned winner.

1393
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:37,411
And the competition begins...

1394
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:39,370
now.

1395
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:52,885
Darling!

1396
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,847
And how is the blushing bride-to-be?

1397
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,849
Very well, Your Majesty.

1398
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,017
Edward has been telling us

1399
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,227
about your adventure
at the shelter yesterday.

1400
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:05,397
I understand you made
a lot of people very happy.

1401
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,442
She was magnificent, a born leader.

1402
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,277
I must say I'm very impressed.

1403
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,154
Thank you, Your Highness.

1404
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,115
You know, I'm feeling
a bit under the weather.

1405
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,660
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- No, it's just a bit of fatigue.

1406
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,079
Edward, would you be a dove

1407
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:25,542
and take my place with Margaret
at the baking competition today?

1408
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:27,377
I'm supposed to be handing out
some ribbons,

1409
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,004
and I don't think I have the strength.

1410
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,048
Oh, yes, we'd be glad to.

1411
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,050
Something wrong, my dear?

1412
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,345
I...

1413
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,139
I don't know if we have the time.

1414
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:40,682
Of course we have the time.

1415
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,559
But the wedding...

1416
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:45,395
I would imagine the staff
has everything under control.

1417
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,527
Will you excuse me for a moment?

1418
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,752
More gold! More sparkles.

1419
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,129
This isn't a funeral. It's Christmas!

1420
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,219
- We're gonna need more poinsettias.
- I'm on it!

1421
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,387
Those layers cool yet?

1422
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,389
Uh... Needs five more minutes.

1423
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:22,683
- I'm gonna start on the filling.
- Yeah.

1424
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:27,729
Kevin?

1425
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:28,813
[Kevin]
Jeez!

1426
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,608
How am I supposed to puree the berries?

1427
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,318
You're gonna have to do it by hand.

1428
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,409
- You got this, okay?
- Okay.

1429
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,243
Yeah, we're good.

1430
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,166
I've been looking all over for you.

1431
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,543
I needed some fresh air.

1432
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,002
Oh.

1433
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,172
Well, I was worried about you.

1434
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,051
Please don't.

1435
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,223
Look, Margaret,
I don't know what's wrong.

1436
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,686
Whatever it is, if you don't want
to hand out a bunch of silly ribbons,

1437
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,563
just say so. We don't have to.

1438
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,609
No, we have to go.

1439
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:15,444
But...

1440
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,656
There's something
I need to tell you first.

1441
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,409
Sounds serious.

1442
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,453
Well, it is.

1443
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,538
It's about truth and honor.

1444
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,750
But mostly, it's about love.

1445
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:36,715
[show host]
Eight, seven, six, five,

1446

four, three, two, one...

1447
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:43,263
Time is up. Well done.

1448
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,613
Frank, we need to get
to Wembley on the double.

1449
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,537
- Now this should be interesting.
- Oh, shut it, Frank.

1450
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,458
It's incredible presentation.

1451
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,919
And your sugar work is commendable.

1452
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,128
Thank you, judge.

1453
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,922
[judge]
The filling is interesting.

1454
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,092
The puree isn't as smooth as I'd hoped.

1455
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,095
But it has a wonderful flavor.

1456
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,262
Nicely done.

1457
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,527
The judges have reached a decision.

1458

In third place...

1459
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,700
is Zachary Brachmann of Munich, Germany.
Well done, Zachary.

1460
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,414
In second place is...

1461
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,295
Is Brianna Michaels of Beverly Hills, USA.

1462

Well done, Brianna.

01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,591
Okay. who's next?

1464
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,179
And in first place,

1465
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:07,389
the winner

1466
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:11,768
of the 56th Annual International
Christmas Baking Competition is...

1467
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,522
Stacy De Novo, Chicago, USA.

1468
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:16,605
Well done, Stacy.

1469

Now, since Queen Caroline was unable
to attend today's ceremony,

1470
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:26,575
presenting the award...

1471
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,162
is Prince Edward of Belgravia
and his fiancée,

1472
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,247
Duchess Margaret of Montenaro.

1473
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:34,791
Now if the winners
would like to please join me on stage

1474
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,626
for the awards ceremony. Thank you.

1475
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,088
You know, who needs a silly medal?

1476
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:41,465
I think we should go.

1477
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,800
Are you crazy?
Stace, this is our moment.

1478
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,886
Yeah, but we're gonna be late
for the plane, so...

1479
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:47,929
I'm going up there,
and you're coming with me.

1480
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,892
[show host] Ladies and gentlemen,
Prince Edward and Duchess Margaret.

1481
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:53,977
[crowd applauding]

1482
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,204
And here it goes.

1483
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:13,830
What's going on?

1484
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,416
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

1485
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,418
Try me.

1486
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,420
I think I can explain.

1487
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,635
There's...

1488
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,221
- There's two of you?
- No.

1489
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,182
No. But we think that we may be related

1490
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,893
through some great, great someone in-law.

1491
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,436
- Cousin Cecil.
- Yeah.

1492
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,689
I think we need a moment to ourselves.

1493
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:42,067
- Maybe let's go backstage.
- Perfect.

1494
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,155
[Stacy]
Let's go.

1495
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,289
Can someone please explain
what's going on?

1496
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,707
This is my fault.

1497
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,792
How's that?

1498
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:03,004
All I wanted to do was to get to know
what it was like to be a normal girl.

1499
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,173
Even if it was only for a few days.

1500
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,633
When I saw Stacy,

1501
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,719
the idea just came to me.

1502
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,140
- You two switched places?
- Yeah.

1503
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,143
You've been with Margaret
for the past two days.

1504
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,521
And Stacy has been with the Prince.

1505
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,440
I'm sorry.

1506
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,026
I didn't think things would get
so complicated.

1507
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,320
Complicated is an interesting word for it.

1508
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,574
But there's more.

1509
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,201
How can there be more?

1510
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,829
I like being normal.

1511
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,998
I hate being in the spotlight.

1512
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:43,879
Edward needs a partner who likes
taking charge, who has a good heart.

1513
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,923
Someone who is meant to be a princess.

1514
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,884
Someone like Stacy.

1515
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:50,594
Wait. Me?

1516
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,932
I didn't plan any of this,

1517
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:59,102
but I suppose I found out
I'm just a normal girl.

1518
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,438
And normal girls,

1519
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,899
they fall in love with normal boys.

1520
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,069
Like you.

1521
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,616
- But you're not Stacy. You're...
- Margaret Delacourt,

1522
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:13,992
Duchess of Montenaro.

1523
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,661
Aren't you supposed to marry the Prince?

1524
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,539
I know this is a little confusing, but...

1525
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:22,542
Lady Margaret is trying to say
that she's in love with you.

1526
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:25,545
Oh!

1527
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,925
Doesn't that kind of piss you off?

1528
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:31,217
Not at all, actually.

1529
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,430
Because I'm in love with her.

1530
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,684
Stacy brings out the best in me.

1531
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,481
The way you bring out the best in me.

1532
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,275
You're not mad at me?

1533
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,527
At us?

1534
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,989
If all of this ends with me getting
to be with the woman that I love,

1535
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,824
I am very happy.

1536
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,161
I intend to keep being happy
for the rest of my life.

1537
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,585
No. Edward, I...

1538
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:07,671
I can't let you do this.

1539
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:11,841
Stacy. Stacy, wait!

1540
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,015
We need to talk.

1541
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,853
How about we do it over a movie
and hot chocolate?

1542
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,439
It's a date.

01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,841
Edward, you can't be in love with me.

01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,343
- Says who?
- It isn't right.

1547
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:57,929
Okay, things happen according to plan.

1548
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:00,849
Life happens according to plan,
and this...

1549
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,767
This is not the way it was planned.

1550
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:06,271
- So you're saying you don't love me.
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

1551
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:11,192
I love you more than I've ever loved
anyone in my whole life.

1552
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,237
Then I'm not giving you up
without a fight.

1553
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,533
I'm not a duchess or a princess.

I'm a baker from Chicago.

You can still be a baker from Chicago.

1556

We'll pick up your shop,
and we'll move it here.

[Stacy]
No, you can't do that.

1558
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,670
Then you can open up another shop here.

1559
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,672
You can bake to your heart's content.

1560

As long as we're together.

will you marry me next Christmas?
