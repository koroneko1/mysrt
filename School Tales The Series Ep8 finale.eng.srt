1
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,840
It is said that strange things that can't be explained

2
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,320
exist everywhere…

3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,280
like the unsolved mystery of what lies beyond death.

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,800
There are ghost stories everywhere in every school.

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,000
They are told during the day

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,240
by one student to another, from generation to generation.

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,880
They are told, retold, twisted, and distorted

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,480
until their origins are lost.

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,280
Ghost stories are created from the dark,

10
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,840
from the fear rooted deep in the hearts of students

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,120
who imagine the school at night

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
as a realm where spirits roam.

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,040
It's no longer somewhere they belong.

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,280
It becomes a place for…

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
ghosts.

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,040
Ghosts are created from humans' unconscious fear of death.

17
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Everyone has a fear of death,

18
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,600
so we created the idea of life after death to go on existing and to become immortal.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
But it's not real.

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,440
In modern science, quantum physicists have stated that

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,640
humans are merely made of particles and energy.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,920
When the brain stops working and the heart stops beating,

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
those particles will disappear.

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,560
Therefore, life after death, spirits, and ghosts don't exist.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840
Statistically, almost 80% of people who claim to have seen ghosts

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
are mentally ill.

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,400
GHOSTS

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
We said we'd meet up. Remember?

29
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,080
We did?

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,040
You know. Tonight at school.

31
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Boyd, are you serious about this?

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,600
Of course. Am I the type to joke around?

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't say you'll bail on me again.

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
You promised me.

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Okay.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,920
-Fine. -Great.

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,640
What's this clip you sent me?

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,640
Fucking hilarious.

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,920
Come on, Boyd. Don't you know the Jinx app?

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Most teens are on it.

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,040
And about the students who believe ghosts cursed them…

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
What app and what curse?

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,240
It's a place to vent, a bit like Twitter.

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Those kids believe ghosts order the students in class M.6/4

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,440
to bring the books listed on the board to class every day at 7:00 a.m.

46
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,480
If they don't do it, they'll die.

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
Students still believe that shit?

48
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Old superstitions.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,280
You're the only one trying so hard to debunk ghosts.

50
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah.

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,040
Hey, Boyd. Why hasn't Tum joined us yet?

52
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
Right?

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,440
You're right.

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,920
But I'm meeting him at 10:00 p.m.

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
to prove that the ghost stories that we've told at school for years

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,480
are all lies.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
You're always teasing him.

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
-He'll piss himself. -Damn wuss.

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,200
-Wow. -Hey, Boyd.

60
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,160
Don't forget to go live. We want to see Tum piss himself.

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,040
Sure. I'll go live for you guys.

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
-I can't wait. -I'll make a meme out of it.

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,640
The whole school will see.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
-He'll be famous. -Good idea!

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Awesome!

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Earth!

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,120
TUM

68
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,920
Hey, Tum.

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,400
Where the hell are you? I couldn't reach you.

70
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,160
I was helping my mom deliver stuff to her customers.

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
Where are you now? Are you at home? I'll pick you up.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm already at school.

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,560
You went without telling me? I've been waiting for you.

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Well, I forgot.

75
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
I thought you'd be here. You said we'd meet at ten, right?

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
Fine. Wait there. I'm coming. Don't chicken out and leave.

77
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,320
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,640
OPEN FROM 5:00 A.M. CLOSED FROM 10:30 P.M.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,360
TUM

80
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,760
Boyd, come on in. I'm already inside.

81
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,920
How the hell did he get in?

82
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,600
Where is he?

83
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,280
Where the hell is he?

84
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,520
Tum.

85
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
Tum.

86
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,120
-Boo! -Hey!

87
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,240
Tum, what the hell are you doing in there?

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Well, it's scary outside,

89
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680
with all those ghosts, strangers,

90
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,960
and stray dogs.

91
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,400
When the guard wasn't around, I snuck in.

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
And then I saw you.

93
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,200
I thought you weren't afraid of ghosts. That was quite a high-pitched scream.

94
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Anyone would be scared when you pop out of the dark like that.

95
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,800
Is that the guard?

96
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,760
Hey, get inside and hide.

97
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Let's step back a bit.

98
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,240
Hey. Why are you trying so hard to disprove ghosts?

99
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,960
People have believed in ghosts for centuries.

100
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,240
Exactly. It's been centuries,

101
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,800
so I have to convince people like you to stop believing old superstitions

102
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
and live in the present

103
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
to make progress in the world.

104
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Hey.

105
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
You're too close.

106
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,320
Well, I don't want to get caught.

107
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,880
Whatever.

108
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
I think he left.

109
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,920
Let's get out. It's getting cramped.

110
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
-Okay. -Let's go.

111
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,920
-Ouch. -Go on.

112
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,520
-You go first. -You can go first.

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You go first.

114
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,720
No, you first.

115
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,880
-Together? -Okay.

116
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,720
Okay. You go first.

117
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,040
-I'll go first. -Okay.

118
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
-Hey, Boyd! -What?

119
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Where are we going?

120
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,880
We're gonna debunk old horror stories.

121
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,440
Hold on.

122
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,760
What?

123
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
You take this.

124
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,640
And I'll take this.

125
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,560
There.

126
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,480
What is this?

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Your job is to show me the way.

128
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,080
-And your job? -I'm going live.

129
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,120
Get in the frame.

130
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,520
That's better.

131
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,400
Hi. It's me, Boyd.

132
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,000
Today, I'm taking you all

133
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,720
on a mission to debunk ancient beliefs

134
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,280
that ghosts exist and that every school has them.

135
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,160
The first stop I'm taking you to is the traditional dance club.

136
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
Today, I'm with a friend.

137
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,360
This is Tum.

138
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,080
He's still a believer in old ghost stories,

139
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,800
despite all the scientific theories that have debunked them.

140
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
Today, Tum and I

141
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,920
will take you guys with us to prove that those old tales

142
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
are all lies.

143
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,640
PIMRY CAREFUL

144
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
Ready, Tum?

145
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
Yeah, he's ready.

146
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
TRADITIONAL DANCE CLUB

147
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,080

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,560
Don't point it at my eyes.

152
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,480
Get in.

153
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,640

-Tum. -What?

155
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,760
Light the candles.

156
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,600
-What for? -To create the vibe.

157
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,200
Go on.

158
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,680

168
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
MING ISSMINK CALLING

169
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,480
Hey.

170
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
Guys,

171
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
stop calling me.

172
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
I'm going live now.

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,760
And stop sending me this alien gibberish.

174
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,720
I can't read it. Type something I can read.

175
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,760
PIMRY - YEAH, DON'T KILL THE VIBE

176
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
MWUANG CA - THAT LOOKS ALIVE BACK THERE

177
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
What's up with my phone?

178
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,520
All right. You guys look out for me, then.

179
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
Tell me if you see anything.

180
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
PIMRY - IT'S GETTING EXCITING

181
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,000
Hey.

182
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,840
THAT LOOKS ALIVE BACK THERE

183
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,080
-Shit! -What is it?

184
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,720
LOL9 - HILARIOUS. HE SCARED HIMSELF

185
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,400
-What? -Did you try to scare me?

186
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,320
Why would I do that? I'm scared too.

187
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
All right.

188
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
I'll tell you a story.

189
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
MWUANG CA - IT WAS SO REAL

190
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,640
The first story is called Love Letter.

191
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,040
PANUMAT KTK - SO SCARY

192
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,920
There was once a young man who had a man's body,

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
but a woman's heart.

194
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,120
This person was quite ugly,

195
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,080
so they always got the part of Hanuman,

196
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
but they wanted to play Sita.

197
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,280
One day, they got a love letter from an admirer.

198
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,440
It was full of sweet words of his adoration for them.

199
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,360
YOU'RE SO CUTE. ANYONE WOULD LOVE YOU AS I DO

200
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,400
But alas,

201
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,120
the letter was fake.

202
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,760
A letter from a secret admirer?

203
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Who is it from? Do you know?

204
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,640
No clue, huh? You stupid bitch.

205
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,160
-Harsh. -Look at you. Who would like you?

206
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,400
Gosh. So mean.

207
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,760
Art, was it you?

208
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,320
-Oh. -Did you write that?

209
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,240
-Oh. -Did you?

210
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
-No, not me. -You look suspicious.

211
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,240
Who would like him? He's so dark.

212
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,560
Don't ever think I'd like someone like you.

213
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,160
But I thought you liked him.

214
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,720
Ew.

215
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
Leave me out of this.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,840
You should cover your face with a mask like this.

217
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
That's right.

218
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,600
-You ugly freak. -You'd look better that way.

219
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,520
You're crying, dark boy? Keep crying. Boo-hoo.

220
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Let's go.

221
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,320
They were bullied by the Ravana actor and the dancers

222
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,760
who had planned it all.

223
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,760
They were enraged, so they decided to replace a prop

224
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,680
in their performance with a real weapon.

225
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
They stabbed the guy who played Ravana on the stage.

226
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,040
He died on the spot…

227
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,000
during the scene where Hanuman defeats Ravana.

228
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,360
Art!

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,560
FRRIEND TF - DON'T TOUCH IT, DUDE

230
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,760
Oh shit!

231
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
Why are you so jumpy?

232
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,080
And this is the trident I was talking about.

233
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,800
It's the weapon that was swapped in the show.

234
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,840
But that's impossible.

235
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,360
Performers are not allowed to change their props.

236
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
Besides,

237
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,480
the managers of the props and costumes are the teachers and staff.

238
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,720
JAMES - SERIOUSLY?

239
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
The story that we hear

240
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,040
might be adapted from Macbeth.

241
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,280
And one more thing.

242
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,400
The guy who played Ravana is still alive.

243
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,760
His name's Art. Don't believe me? Check Facebook.

244
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,680
Nui!

245
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
-Hey, Boyd. -What?

246
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,960
He's not the only Art around.

247
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,320
And the Hanuman story

248
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,680
was all over the news.

249
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
They said the dancers who were the bullies

250
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,120
all fainted in the theater.

251
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Reporters even showed up to get the story.

252
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,240
What Tum just said was about the dancers who were possessed.

253
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,640
They even told the reporters that

254
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,280
they could see the ghost of Hanuman dancing with them.

255
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,840
This, in fact,

256
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,240
is called mass hysteria.

257
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,600
PANUMAT KTK - THAT SHIT'S HARDCORE MWUANG CA - REALLY?

258
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,760
Do you understand?

259
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,080
Yeah.

260
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Good.

261
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,480
We have more ghost stories to tell.

262
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
Stay tuned for the second one.

263
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,680
Ready to go, Tum?

264
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,320
Are you pranking me?

265
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,640
No, I'm not pranking you.

266
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,160
By the way, does your head hurt?

267
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,560
Why would it hurt?

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,120
Because of that.

269
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,960
Maybe I got scraped by the fence.

270
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,840
-Come here. I'll get it. -Okay.

271
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,920
Thanks, man.

272
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,120
Done.

273
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,800
Come on. Let's get going.

274
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Okay.

275
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Are you ready?

276
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
-Yeah. -Let's go.

277
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,360
Let's go.

278
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,720
The second story is called

279
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,520
The Gym.

280
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,600
Tum.

281
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,480
-Tum. -What?

282
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Go over there.

283
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,800
Why?

284
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,800
Because…

285
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,120
I want you to tell this story.

286
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Why don't you do it?

287
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,080
I want you to do it. You can do it. Trust me.

288
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,600
Go on.

289
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,600
Just read it.

290
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,120
Hurry up.

291
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,920
LOL9 - HYPING IT UP? MWUANG CA - I LIKE IT

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,240
-Where? -There. Right there.

293
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,800
TIME - ARE YOU TELLING IT OR NAH?

294
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Yeah.

295
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,560
All right.

296
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,360
Okay.

297
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,760
There. Right there. Stop.

298
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,120
Now, a little to the left. To the left. Okay.

299
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
All right.

300
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,880
Go. We're all waiting.

301
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,240
TIME - WE HAVE TROLLS MWUANG CA - I'M SCARED

302
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,160
"The second story is about the Gym Ghost."

303
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
SHAVED ICE - WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

304
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,080
"This is the story of a national gymnastics team contender."

305
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,800
"They say a competitor who also wanted to get into the national team put a nail

306
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,000
on the balance beam,

307
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,080
so the contender stepped on it

308
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,520
and fell over."

309
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,680
"Her head hit the floor."

310
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,040
"Her neck broke instantly."

311
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
"And ever since,

312
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,560
people would often hear someone running

313
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,720
and practicing in this gym."

314
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,880
And now for the facts.

315
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,480
LOL9 - MY SCHOOL'S STORY IS MUCH SCARIER

316
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,160
Planting a nail on the balance beam

317
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,520
is impossible.

318
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,320
Before the practice session,

319
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,680
the space would be cleared first,

320
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,280
by either the coaches or the gymnasts.

321
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,640
Everyone practices on the beam before solo practice, so they'd see it.

322
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,800
JAMES - YES, GO ON

323
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,720
All right? And the sound everyone hears,

324
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,400
whether it's the sound of someone running or practicing,

325
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,840
when the guards and the students come in here to check, they see nothing at all.

326
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
TIME - SHUT UP, SKEPTIC

327
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,280
The truth is, the sound that everyone hears comes from the wood

328
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,760
that gets swollen because of the humidity.

329
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,880
Therefore, although it sounds like someone running or practicing,

330
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,720
it's not real.

331
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,920
BEM - SO SCIENTIFIC

332
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,720
In short, this ghost story is

333
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,720
just another lie.

334
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,480
Believe me now?

335
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah.

336
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
Even Tum believes me now.

337
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,320
LOL9 - YOU GOTTA SEE THE REAL SHIT

338
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,200
We'll take you guys on a tour around the school one more time.

339
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
Let's go, Tum.

340
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
-For real? -Let's go. Yeah, for real.

341
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Damn it.

342
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,640
Come on. Let's go.

343
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,640
FIRE ESCAPE

344
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,200
Tum.

345
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
What?

346
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
Not so scared now, huh? Leading the way, I see.

347
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Do you believe me now when I say that ghosts don't exist?

348
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,080
Have you seen any since we started walking around here?

349
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,440
Hey, Boyd.
What?

350
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,520
Will you tell the other one?

351
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,440
They all talk about it.

352
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,360
I know every ghost story in this school without exception.

353
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,840
I guess you're not the expert that you claim to be.

354
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,520
What don't I know?

355
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,320
Hey, it's not a big deal.

356
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,280
-Why are you mad? -I'm not mad.

357
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,200
I just wanna know. What is it that you know that I don't?

358
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
Or are you just making it up to bluff me?

359
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,720
Well, it's the story people are talking about.

360
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,720
They're talking about it? Okay.

361
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,920
So tell me.

362
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,440
What is this story people are talking about?

363
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,640
Go on. Our friends are waiting.

364
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,680
Story number three.

365
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,080
Once, there were two best friends

366
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,680
who went to debunk the school's ghost stories.

367
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,080
When the two of them went to the last haunted spot,

368
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,840
which was the school's top floor that was closed down,

369
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,400
they decided to play a game there.

370
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,280
The one who came up with the mission told the other to pick heads or tails.

371
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
And the winner could order the loser

372
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,800
to do anything.

373
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,560
This is not a real story.

374
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,160
I know all this school's ghost stories. Don't make stuff up, Tum.

375
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm not making it up.

376
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,800
I heard it from someone else.

377
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,640
Who?

378
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
The one who told you.

379
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,440
Who was it?

380
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Tell me, then.

381
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,040
Well, I don't know.

382
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,240
If you don't know…

383
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,400
then just shut up.

384
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,240
Let's say that today's mission

385
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
has been completed.

386
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,120
We found nothing here.

387
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,320
Not even a single ghost.

388
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,440
And Tum already admitted that ghosts aren't real.

389
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,760
Catch you guys later.

390
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,640
Come on, Tum. Let's go home.

391
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,440
Hey, Boyd.

392
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,520
How can you be sure

393
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,480
that ghosts aren't real?

394
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,920
Well, do you see any?

395
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,480
They're real.

396
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,720
We just didn't see any.

397
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,080
Who's pulling this prank?

398
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Traditional Thai music and traditional dancers?

399
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
Clichés can't scare me.

400
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,200
Boyd.

401
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,480
Stop saying stuff that you don't know for sure.

402
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, I'm not scared!

403
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
Unlike you who's scared of everything.

404
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,080
Did you plot this prank with the others behind my back?

405
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
If you're scared,

406
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,600
then stay here.

407
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,760
I'll go by myself.

408
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Boyd.

409
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,800
Who the hell are you guys?

410
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,360
Boyd, get back here!

411
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
Shit!

412
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,960
Boyd, run!

413
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,800
Hurry!

414
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Be honest.

415
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,360
You guys pranked me, right?

416
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,800
Who would prank you?

417
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,520
I should be asking you.

418
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
Did you guys plan to prank me?

419
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,520
If I did try to prank you,

420
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,840
do you think the others would join me?

421
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,240
They are your friends.

422
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
And if I were not your friend,

423
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
they wouldn't care about me

424
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,480
or even be my friends.

425
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,480
I'm not buying it.

426
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,280
There's no way the ghosts we just saw are real.

427
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,280
I bet they knew I brought you to debunk ghost stories,

428
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,520
so they pranked us both.

429
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,680
Hide over there!

430
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,720
Hurry!

431
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
You said the stories weren't true.

432
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,560
This is just like the story we told.

433
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,920
Well,

434
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,840
I think

435
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,840
we should run.

436
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
Come on.

437
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,960
Boyd!

438
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
Boyd, hurry up!

439
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,680
Hurry up, Tum! Keep running.

440
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
-No! -Hey!

441
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,120
Let's find another way.

442
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,120
Yeah, let's go.

443
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,920
-Hey, Boyd! -Tum.

444
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,840
An exit!

445
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,920
-Hurry. -Okay.
Hurry up, Tum!

446
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,040
Boyd. Upstairs. Hurry!

447
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
-Upstairs, Tum. -Yeah.

448
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Shit.

449
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
Hey.

450
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,520
Hey.

451
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Tum.

452
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Boyd!

453
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,000
Hey. That way.

454
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,920
Yeah.

455
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,720
Tum.

456
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,400
-Tum! -What?

457
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,760
I think

458
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
we should go downstairs.

459
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,000
There may be another exit.

460
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,800
The ghosts are downstairs.

461
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Wouldn't it be better to go up?

462
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm not going.

463
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't trust what's behind that.

464
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,400
Let's make a bet.

465
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
I'll flip a coin.

466
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,240
If you win,

467
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,480
we go down.

468
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
But if I win,

469
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,880
we go up together.

470
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,040
Stop messing around.

471
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,480
Now's not the time.

472
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,560
Right. We don't have time,

473
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,560
so I'm making you choose.

474
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,840
If you don't choose,

475
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,320
I'll choose first.

476
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,680
The side of the coin that I didn't pick

477
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
is yours.

478
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,560
And if I lose…

479
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,080
I'll do what you say.

480
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,120
No way.

481
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,160
I call heads,

482
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,840
so you're tails.

483
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,320
Wait!

484
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
Heads.

485
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,040
I win.

486
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,000
This time, we both go up.

487
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Or do you want me to go first,

488
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,200
so you can leave me again?

489
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,640
Boyd!

490
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,280
Wait for me.

491
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Boyd, where are you taking me?

492
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,960
The door's closed.

493
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Fine. You're right.

494
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,960
Ghosts aren't real.

495
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,360
Let's just do this

496
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,600
so we can go home.

497
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,520
In that case,

498
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,720
let's flip a coin.

499
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,600
The loser does what the winner says.

500
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,120
I call tails. You're heads, okay?

501
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
Tails.

502
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,680
I win.

503
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,960
You go first.

504
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,800
After the winner

505
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,280
told the loser

506
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
to open the door

507
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,080
to take a look and see

508
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,440
if there were ghosts behind it,

509
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,400
the loser

510
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,560
had to comply.

511
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,440
But what he saw

512
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,280
made him cry out for his friend for help.

513
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
Shit! Help me!

514
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,640
-Boyd, help me! -Shit.

515
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,840
He couldn't leave.

516
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,960
-Earth! -Boyd!

517
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,280
Help me! Boyd, help me! Boyd!

518
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,400
The winner

519
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,120
heard his friend crying for help

520
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,120
and got scared.

521
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,080
He left him to face what was behind that door alone.

522
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,440
After that, the abandoned friend never came back to school again.

523
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
And the one who got away

524
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
resumed his normal life at school.

525
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,720
Remember what I said at the gym?

526
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Just because you can't see it,

527
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,160
that doesn't mean it's not real.

528
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,800
You're just trying to turn a blind eye,

529
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,520
so you tried to find every theory to debunk this kind of belief

530
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,400
just so you can move on with your life,

531
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,920
clinging to your own beliefs.

532
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,680
But deep down, you know

533
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
those things are real.

534
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,760
Hey, someone's calling.

535
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,600
Pick it up.

536
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,160
Boyd.

537
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,520
Why didn't you take my calls? I've called you so many times.

538
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,440
Are you with Tum now?

539
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,960
Yeah.

540
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,960
He's right in front of me.

541
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,440
I have something to tell you. Look at the group chat right now.

542
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,160
That's all I'll say.

543
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,920
TUM HAD AN ACCIDENT ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL

544
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,840
Shit.

545
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,480
Today, Tum and I will take you guys with us to prove

546
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,760
that those old tales

547
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,240
are all lies.

548
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,840
Ready, Tum?
PIMRY - CAREFUL

549
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
Yeah, he's ready.

550
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
BOATSEED CALLING

551
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,720
MEBBAITOEY - READ THE GROUP CHAT

552
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,000
Why are you calling?

553
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,320
MING ISSMINK CALLING

554
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,040
Guys, stop calling me. I'm going live now.

555
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,200
MING ISSMINK - RUN

556
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,240
And stop sending me this alien gibberish. I can't read it.

557
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,920
Type something I can read.

558
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,440
PIMRY - YEAH, DON'T KILL THE VIBE BOATSEED - STOP IT NOW

559
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,200
Tell me if you see anything.

560
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,480
Boyd.

561
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,040
This time, you lose.

562
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,240
Will you leave me again?

563
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,120
Hey, Boyd.

564
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,360
What?

565
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,200
We're about to graduate.

566
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,880
But I still wanna hang with you.

567
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,640
You're such a baby.

568
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,440
Well, I don't know

569
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,760
if we'll still be friends in the future.

570
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,480
Sure we will.

571
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,080
You're the only best friend I have.

572
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,840
I…

573
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,800
I will never leave you.

574
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,720
It is said

575
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,680
that every school has a story.
