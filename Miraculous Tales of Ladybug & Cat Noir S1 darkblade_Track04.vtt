00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
&lrm;And yet again, I hope I have time

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.460
&lrm;to finish my magic box.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;What's it for?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.580
&lrm;To lock up my diary and secrets.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.020
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Every secret?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.460
&lrm;You write everything in there?

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.660
&lrm;Well... yeah. Why?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.620
&lrm;First, what if someone finds out
&lrm;you're Ladybug?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.580
&lrm;And two, what if
&lrm;someone finds out your ladybag?

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.580
&lrm;Not gonna happen. Try it.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.300
&lrm;Hey!

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.700
&lrm;It works.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.140
<i>&lrm;Mr. Bourgeois was re-elected</i>

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.740
<i>&lrm;Here, we see him with his daughter.</i>

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.980
&lrm;Look at Chloe.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.420
&lrm;acting as if she were the mayor.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.540
&lrm;Which reminds me,
&lrm;class elections are tomorrow!

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.940
&lrm;What's bad about that?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.020
&lrm;Chloe is running for class rep,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.300
&lrm;the person who cares about herself
&lrm;more than students.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.220
&lrm;Well, maybe you should run.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.540
&lrm;I totally would

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.380
&lrm;but I've enough to do
&lrm;with Ladybug and my schoolwork.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.060
&lrm;But if you believe in something,
&lrm;you have to try.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.900
&lrm;It's better to fail trying
&lrm;than not trying.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.980
&lrm;Maybe.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
&lrm;Don't underestimate yourself.

&lrm;I'm gonna be late for school, again.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.700
&lrm;See? This is what I'm talking about.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.580
&lrm;[teacher] Chloe is running
&lrm;for class representative.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.180
&lrm;Sabrina will be her deputy.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.380
&lrm;Any other candidates?

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.700
&lrm;- Yes, Kim?
&lrm;- N-Nothing.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.540
&lrm;I'm sorry. I...

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.740
&lrm;The bus...

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.060
&lrm;[coughing]
&lrm;Dry throat.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.700
&lrm;Chloe is running again.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.180
&lrm;She's been class rep
&lrm;since kindergarten.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.500
&lrm;[gasping] Why don't you run?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.340
&lrm;You'd be an awesome rep.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.220
&lrm;No can do. My blog is a full-time job.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.300
&lrm;[teacher] Alright,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.180
&lrm;I'll give you
&lrm;until the end of lunch to decide.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.300
&lrm;[Chloe] Or I'll tell everyone.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.020
&lrm;[chattering]

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.340
&lrm;What did Chloe say this time?
&lrm;She offered to go on a date you?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.220
&lrm;She said she'd tell everyone
&lrm;I'm afraid of spiders.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.100
&lrm;She said I'd get kicked out
&lrm;of Scrapbooking Club.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.340
&lrm;And you know I love all that
&lrm;colourful paper and gluing.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.420
&lrm;I don't care about running.
&lrm;What's your excuse?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980
&lrm;[hesitantly] Well, I'm ... really busy.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.500
&lrm;With what, oversleeping?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.300
&lrm;Well, no... but...well...

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.700
&lrm;I guess I would run if no one else did.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.220
&lrm;Do any new candidates
&lrm;want to run against Chloe?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.500
&lrm;[groaning]

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.740
&lrm;[sigh] No.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.740
&lrm;[whimpering]

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.540
&lrm;[groaning]

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.540
&lrm;Chloe and Sabrina are the only candidates,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.740
&lrm;so there's no vote. Chloe, Sabrina...

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.500
&lrm;I'll run!

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.700
&lrm;Wonderful! Develop your campaign

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.020
&lrm;and have a speech ready
&lrm;for tomorrow when we vote.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.940
&lrm;[chattering]

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.580
&lrm;Let's hear the scoop on your campaign.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.380
&lrm;How are you gonna represent?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.580
&lrm;Represent?

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.260
&lrm;I have no idea.
&lrm;I can't believe I raised my hand.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.700
&lrm;Way to go, Marinette.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.020
&lrm;You spoke from the heart.
&lrm;It was truly authentic.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.380
&lrm;[gasping] Oh... thanks.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.900
&lrm;When you win, can we get new chairs?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.340
&lrm;Ours are so hard I can't think.
&lrm;Maybe pink ones!

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
&lrm;Could we listen to music in the library?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.860
&lrm;[mumbling] You know... I... you know.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.180
&lrm;[nervous laugh] Sure, Juleka.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.340
&lrm;Adrien!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.300
&lrm;Can Marinette count on your vote?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.260
&lrm;Sure, depending on her speech.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.060
&lrm;Better get cracking then.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.140
&lrm;I've watched how my daddy wins elections.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.180
&lrm;I'm going to follow in his footsteps.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.860
&lrm;I know just how to win.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.700
&lrm;By having the best campaign?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.500
&lrm;Whatever!

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.260
&lrm;The secret to winning

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.980
&lrm;is ruining your opponent's reputation.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.980
&lrm;Softer chairs...

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.700
&lrm;music in library,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.340
&lrm;whatever Juleka said.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.380
&lrm;I'm writing down all the issues.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.660
&lrm;I just have to get it all in my speech.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.220
&lrm;I'm proud of you. I'm sure you'll win.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.820
&lrm;You'll be an awesome rep.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.940
&lrm;They're relying on me to defeat Chloe,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.260
&lrm;even Adrian, do you realise that?

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.860
&lrm;[phone vibrates]

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.700
&lrm;- <i>&lrm;Marinette, battles on.</i>
&lrm;- Why?

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.660
&lrm;Chloe invited everyone
&lrm;to her campaign launch.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.620
&lrm;She's got Jagged Stone coming.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.580
&lrm;Seriously? Jagged Stone my favourite star.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.940
&lrm;I love him!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.940
&lrm;[groaning] As does everyone else.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.820
<i>&lrm;She's trying to buy votes with autographs.</i>

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.940
&lrm;Not if I have anything to say about it.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.180
&lrm;Meet you there.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.620

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.020
&lrm;I'm going in, Chloe.

&lrm;[bell rings]

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.300
&lrm;- Hello.
&lrm;- Hi, there.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.820
&lrm;Marinette borrowed my math book
&lrm;but I need it back.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.740
&lrm;She isn't here.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.540
&lrm;I've got customers to attend to.
&lrm;Go on up if you don't mind.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.420
&lrm;I'd be glad to, thanks.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.100
&lrm;[struggling]

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.500
&lrm;[struggling]

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.100
&lrm;Wow, Mr. D'Argencourt.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.660
&lrm;You're on fire. That was some attack.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.660
&lrm;It ought to be. This manoeuvre
&lrm;was developed by my ancestor,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.420
&lrm;- Darkblade.
&lrm;- Darkblade?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.220
&lrm;Darkblade conquered Paris
&lrm;and ruled over it with an iron fist

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.020
&lrm;until he was overthrown
&lrm;by a wealthy Frenchman

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.340
&lrm;who used gold to buy
&lrm;the loyalties of the people.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.260
<i>&lrm;Not long ago, my ancestors' flag</i>
<i>&lrm;was waving above Paris.</i>

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.500
<i>&lrm;Is that why you ran</i>
<i>&lrm;in the election, to seek revenge?</i>

<i>&lrm;Who dost we have hither?</i>

<i>&lrm;Don't be bemused, it's just The News.</i>

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.540
<i>&lrm;Do you have anything to say about</i>
<i>&lrm;your "landslide defeat"?</i>

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.660
<i>&lrm;Hey, you. How did you get in here?</i>

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.500
&lrm;- <i>&lrm;Time to go.</i>
&lrm;- Get back here.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.860
&lrm;Here endeth the lesson.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.700
&lrm;[evil voice] A loser and an utter failure,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.740
&lrm;the perfect candidate
&lrm;to lobby my own campaign.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.220

&lrm;[whooshing]

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.660
&lrm;Fly away, my evil little Akuma,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.860
&lrm;and take control of this defeated fighter.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.140
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.580
&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt, someone said

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.500
&lrm;"You're stuck in the dark ages."
&lrm;What do you have to say to that?

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.500
&lrm;Poisonous wretch.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.780
&lrm;Stop thou venomous questions?
&lrm;Be gone, you pain in the neck!

&lrm;[whooshing]

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.700
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Darkblade,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.540
&lrm;in return for these powers,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.860
&lrm;capture Ladybug's
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.020
&lrm;When the flag of mine ancestors
&lrm;flies once again upon City Hall,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.660
&lrm;then to thee I shall be indebted.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.940
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.820
&lrm;Anything y-you'd like to say
&lrm;about your transformation

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.180
&lrm;- into a...
&lrm;- Darkblade,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.700
&lrm;the Lord of Paris.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.620
&lrm;[zapping]
&lrm;[gasping]

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.380
&lrm;Thou shalt become mine knights.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.620
&lrm;Soon mine army shalt be
&lrm;immense and unstoppable.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.020
&lrm;We shalt take City Hall

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.980
&lrm;and reclaim the throne
&lrm;from Bourgeois, the usurper.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.420
&lrm;[Plagg] That's some medieval madness.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.700
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.420
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.580
&lrm;[lively music]

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.420
&lrm;What a great beast
&lrm;to join our conquest.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:37.260
&lrm;[chanting]
<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER! PAR LE FER!</i>

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.380
&lrm;[D'Argencourt]
&lrm;Let us to battle, knights!

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.820
<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER!</i>

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.260
&lrm;The people chose Bourgeois over you.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.220
&lrm;Thy peoples matter not to me.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.820
&lrm;D'Argencourt was defeated,
&lrm;not Darkblade.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.260
<i>&lrm;En garde!</i>

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.500
&lrm;Chloe,

<i>&lrm;I'm in. What am I looking for?</i>

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.700
<i>&lrm;Anything,</i>
<i>&lrm;as long as it's totally embarrassing.</i>

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.380
&lrm;Wait... I have one just like this.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.980
&lrm;How about... a ball of yarn?
&lrm;Or a screwdriver.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.980
<i>&lrm;No, dingbat, a disgusting photo of her,</i>

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.980
<i>&lrm;or some tacky clothing.</i>

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.540
<i>&lrm;Dig around a bit.</i>

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.740
&lrm;[gasping] How about her diary!

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.220
<i>&lrm;Wow, you can actually do something</i>

<i>&lrm;Sabrina? Sabrina!</i>

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.740
&lrm;Welcome all,

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.460
&lrm;to the launch
&lrm;of Chloe's electoral campaign.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.260
&lrm;And a special thank you

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.860
&lrm;to world-famous popstar
&lrm;Jagged Stone for endorsing her

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.380
&lrm;If you vote for me,

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.900
&lrm;you'll get free tickets
&lrm;to Jagged's next concert.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.660
&lrm;[she screams]

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.140
&lrm;[angrily] You got an autograph?

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.060
&lrm;Yeah. Got you one, too.
&lrm;Sorry, couldn't help myself.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.140
&lrm;No, I'm not falling for it.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.380
&lrm;But I'll forgive you if you vote for me.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.620
&lrm;How did I not see that coming?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.020
&lrm;Take him.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.100
&lrm;[roaring]

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.140
&lrm;Not a minute to be wasted.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.940
&lrm;City Hall awaits us!

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.340
&lrm;City Hall?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.180
&lrm;You go first. I'll catch up.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.100
&lrm;[panting]

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.940
&lrm;What took you?
&lrm;You better have her diary.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.780
&lrm;I did... sorta.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.580
&lrm;What's that?

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.220
&lrm;When I grabbed the diary,
&lrm;this crazy box closed on my hand.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.300
&lrm;And I'm supposed to believe you?

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.220
&lrm;[angry sigh] Why do I bother?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.500
&lrm;Do you realise you're being bribed?

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.100
&lrm;Concert tickets are awesome,
&lrm;but they won't solve our problems.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.940
&lrm;What's your campaign then?

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.740
&lrm;Well... I'm...

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.980
&lrm;I think cushions are
&lrm;more realistic than new chairs.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.140
&lrm;Your cushion could be pink.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.820
&lrm;I'll see about music in the library,
&lrm;using headphones.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.420
&lrm;Remarkable.
&lrm;You actually sound like a class rep.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.860
&lrm;Too bad you have no chance of winning.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.420
&lrm;A word?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.420
&lrm;My diary! What were you...?

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.020
&lrm;If you don't pull out,
&lrm;all your secrets will be revealed.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.100
&lrm;Don't! I mean... What secrets?

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.060
&lrm;We'll find out,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.220
&lrm;as soon as I get my hands on a chainsaw.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.460
&lrm;Oh ye, oh ye!
&lrm;Darkblade shalt speak now.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.300
&lrm;Listen or be imprisoned!

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.540
&lrm;Henceforth,
&lrm;my flag shalt fly over thy kingdom.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.220
&lrm;Bourgeois, pathetic knave,
&lrm;come hither and do battle!

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.780
&lrm;What did he say?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.220
&lrm;Basically, he's gonna bust you up.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.860
&lrm;Ask my secretary for an appointment.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.860
&lrm;[cackling] Bow down to Darkblade

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.260

&lrm;Take him!

&lrm;Do you only know heavy metal?

&lrm;I can get them under control.

&lrm;Guys, guys, I know you love me,

&lrm;Are you the usurper's champion?

&lrm;Say what?

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.140
&lrm;- No!

&lrm;Cloe, what should we do?
&lrm;What would a class rep do?

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.780
&lrm;Well, if you vote for me

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.060
&lrm;I'll give you an answer... tomorrow.

&lrm;But we can't wait that long.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.580
&lrm;Then tough luck. Ask someone else.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.620
&lrm;[lively music] Tikki, we need to talk.

&lrm;What are you going to do?

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.500
&lrm;Cat Noir needs Ladybug,

&lrm;Cat Noir!

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.860
&lrm;Don't let him get his banner!

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.700
&lrm;[groaning]

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.660
&lrm;Villains. Thou impress me not.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.940
&lrm;By the blade of darkness, I declare

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.220
&lrm;all peoples of this kingdom
&lrm;are henceforth mine!

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.780

&lrm;Bow to King Darkblade!

&lrm;[cackling]

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.580
&lrm;Soon thou shalt join my army,
&lrm;you venomous insect.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.980
&lrm;Not... so... fast! <i>&lrm;En garde!</i>

&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.100
&lrm;Soon Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will meet their doom.

&lrm;[struggling]

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.660
&lrm;We'll be turned into knights.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.140
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.740

<i>&lrm;PAR LE FER!</i>

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.580
&lrm;Lucky charm!

&lrm;[lively music]

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.820
&lrm;[confused] OK?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.100
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.940
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.580
&lrm;Let's hope he's ticklish.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.620
&lrm;[struggling]

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.460
&lrm;Not this time.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.540
&lrm;[struggling]

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.260

&lrm;[whooshing]

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.060
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, Akuma.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.300
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.860
&lrm;[lively music]

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.060
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.980
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.740
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.060

&lrm;[confused sigh]

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.060
&lrm;POUND IT!

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.940
&lrm;[he gasps] Gotta take off. See ya.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.980
&lrm;Our duel is not over, my dear Ladybug.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.860
&lrm;At the end of our battle,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.020
&lrm;I will rule!

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.540
&lrm;[dramatic music]

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.300

&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.380
&lrm;Great job.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.700
&lrm;You proved you can be
&lrm;both Ladybug and class rep.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.260
&lrm;It wasn't easy
&lrm;but I'm glad I tried,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.140
&lrm;If I hadn't
&lrm;I'd never have known I could do it!

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.980
&lrm;Where were you?

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.820
&lrm;- Hiding under a rock?
&lrm;- Very funny.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.580
&lrm;I got... transformed into a knight.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.820
&lrm;So did I. What a 'knightmare".

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.540
&lrm;Now this is all over,
&lrm;I want my personal items back.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.980
&lrm;[gasping]

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.380
&lrm;What are you talking about?

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.580
&lrm;Yes, please take it off.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.100
&lrm;Thank you.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.980
&lrm;Got an explanation, Chloe?

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:49.780
<i>&lrm;I told you I never took her diary.</i>
<i>&lrm;I'm offended at you accusing me.</i>

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.660
&lrm;Then how did you know
&lrm;my diary was in here?

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.380
&lrm;[gasps]

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.220
&lrm;Well... I...

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.940
&lrm;Sabrina told me. It was all her idea.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.860
&lrm;So uncool.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.740
&lrm;Now we know nobody will vote for Chloe.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.020
&lrm;You're gonna be our new class rep.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.500
&lrm;Not so fast.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.260
&lrm;See? She's undependable.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.900
&lrm;She's already giving up.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.620
&lrm;No, I'm not. I want to be voted in fairly

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.380
&lrm;not because
&lrm;you don't want to vote for Chloe

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.140
&lrm;but because you believe in me.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.300
&lrm;I won't make promises I can't keep,
&lrm;I won't get you everything you want,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.220
&lrm;but I am resourceful,
&lrm;and I know how to prioritise.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.540
&lrm;I'm good at listening and multi-tasking.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.420
&lrm;Representing you all is what I believe in

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.820
&lrm;and I believe in myself.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.180
&lrm;So vote for Marinette
&lrm;for class representative.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.540
&lrm;[cheering]

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.300
&lrm;What are you doing?
&lrm;Are you out of your mind?

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.420
&lrm;[groaning] What are you good for?

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.340
&lrm;By majority vote,
&lrm;Marinette is the new class representative

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.420
&lrm;and Alya will be her deputy.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.820
&lrm;You'll be able to do your blog
&lrm;and be deputy.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.220
&lrm;We can do anything
&lrm;if we put our minds to it.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.500
&lrm;I'm with you, girl.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.580
&lrm;[chuckling]

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.460
