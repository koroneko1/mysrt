1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,646
Wyatt:
Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,715
‐Have you seen Savannah?
‐No. Not all day.

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,617
Caroline:
I thought she might be
helping you out again.

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:09,019
Sam: Savannah!
Are you down there?

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,055
(grunting)

6
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,492
Topher: It's the ghost
sending a message
loud and clear.

7
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:17,627
You don't have
to leave tonight.

8
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,797
Haunted or just cursed,
that place wants us out.

9
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:23,600
‐firefighter:
Anyone living in room 205?
‐Sarah: Why?

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,102
firefighter:
When I was checking it out,
I noticed it seemed very cold.

11
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,771
Wyatt:
There's a ghost in that hotel.

12
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,439
Griffin:
There's no telling
how this is gonna end.

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,008
Your family can't let
that slimy judge win.

14
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,610
You got the document
for their farm?

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,378
If you mean the original,

16
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:36,880
it can go out
with tonight's trash.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,582
I'll take care of it
tomorrow.

18
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:39,716
You need to switch
with Harper

19
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:41,217
and make sure
she gets back here.

20
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,787
There's something
you need to know
about the farm.

21
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:46,122
The judge tricked
your dad with a switch
of the documents.

22
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,458
Take this inside,
and the land stays
yours forever.

23
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,226
Only it's not
what you're going to do.

24
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,395
In fact,
that's the last thing
you're going to do.

25
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,299
If what you're saying
is true,

26
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,368
that document will allow us
to stay on our property.

27
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,071
Harper, come on,
give it to Daisy.

28
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,073
‐Wasn't that the plan?
‐I'm changing the plan.

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,508
I can't give you
the document.

30
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:06,610
But I don't
understand.

31
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,744
It's too big a risk.

32
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,212
If we change things
in 1930,

33
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,547
the future will be altered.

34
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,215
Yes, the farm would stay
in the Tremont family,

35
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:14,184
but you'd grow up
a completely different person.

36
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:16,152
Maybe you'd
never get married.

37
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,621
Maybe you'd
never have children.

38
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,923
The entire Tremont lineage
would be interrupted.

39
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,691
And you and your brother
would never be born.

40
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,193
Griffin said the same thing.

41
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:25,962
Harper, you're just
thinking about this now?

42
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,631
Why did we swipe it
in the first place?

43
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,999
You have to go back.

44
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,201
Live your life.
It will all work out.

45
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,203
Your father only wants
what's best for you and Sam.

46
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:35,038
But my mother will be trapped
in that hotel forever.

47
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,106
Not forever.

48
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,841
I promise.

49
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,414
Strange saying goodbye
to someone who hasn't
even been born yet.

50
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,250
I so want
more time with you,

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,618
my great‐granddaughter.

52
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:49,853
I want the same thing.

53
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,091
Okay, you two,
don't be bashful.
Hug it out.

54
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,100
Wyatt: Pretty obvious
Dad believes in ghosts now.

55
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,635
All that yelling
proves it.

56
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,937
That was so cool
when he took on the ghost.

57
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:10,006
You believe now too,
right, Mom?

58
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,174
Pretty much.

59
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,676
I'll loan you my hat,
if you want.

60
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:13,843
Uh, I'll let you know.

61
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:16,579
Meanwhile, I think
our ghost is on notice,

62
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,681
thanks to your dad.

63
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,882
Or he made her mad.

64
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,050
Her?

65
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,418
W‐‐ Why do you think
it's a woman?

66
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:23,887
We don't, really.
It goes back and forth.

67
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:25,689
One day she's a "she,"

68
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,190
the next he's a "he,"

69
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,958
or our favorite,
"it."

70
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,061
Covers all the bases.

71
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,730
If there was just some way
to free her from that mirror...

72
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,865
That‐‐ that's where
Topher says she's trapped.

73
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,934
You wouldn't have any ideas,
would you, Mom?

74
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,670
I mean, like
how to un‐trap her,

75
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,207
or de‐trap her,
or whatever the word is.

76
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,742
I'll give it some thought.

77
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,711
Meantime, you two need
to get to sleep.

78
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,745
It's been a long day.

79
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,816
‐On or off?
‐What do you think?

80
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:54,951
Sleep tight, you two.

81
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,821
As if any of us will sleep.

82
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,262
(ominous music)

83
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,633
Ben: Hey.

84
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,035
Twins in bed?

85
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,270
Uh, half of them.

86
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,905
Wyatt's on the floor.

87
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:21,177
You know, it actually feels
calm around here,

88
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,647
like... kinda peaceful.

89
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,516
Do you trust it?

90
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,453
Not for a second.

91
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,195
Daisy! What are you
still doing here?

92
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,797
You're supposed
to switch back
with Harper.

93
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,433
‐I know, and‐‐
‐This is crazy!

94
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,768
I mean, you know
what Harper means to me

95
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,169
and how much
I need her back here.

96
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,204
I know now.

97
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,240
Wait a second.

98
00:03:50,974 --> 00:03:52,776
You're... Harper?

99
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:54,277
(laughs) Yeah.

100
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,382
‐You're home.
‐I'm home.

101
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,453
(theme music playing)

102
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,944
(siren wailing)

103
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,216
(indistinct chatter)

104
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,993
There you are!
Is everything all right?

105
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,061
I'm fine.

106
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,230
What happened?

107
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,799
Sam took a fall
down the basement stairs.

108
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,837
He's unconscious.
Nasty bump on the head.

109
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,438
After all the times
he's been down those stairs,

110
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:56,773
it seems crazy he fell.

111
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,174
He'll be all right.

112
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,176
Mom, I really need
to see him.

113
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,377
In time.

114
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,713
No, you don't understand.

115
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,682
I have to. Right away.

116
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,485
Wait. So Savannah
was in 1930?

117
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,387
She'd intercepted a note
in the floorboard

118
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,655
I'd put there for you,

119
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,257
that I was stuck
in 1930.

120
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:15,959
Then grown‐up Sam
finished the radio,

121
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,094
and Savannah was able
to open the portal
and come through.

122
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:20,530
I guess her idea
was to rescue me.

123
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,798
Everyone's idea.

124
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,034
You'll never believe
what I found out in 1930.

125
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,070
The land, the house,
and the springs were stolen

126
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,138
from my relatives,
the Tremonts.

127
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,473
This judge was behind it.

128
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,176
And probably the one
who turned it into a hotel.

129
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,612
Okay, I wanna hear all this
but we've got to get up there

130
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:37,013
before someone else
finds this place.

131
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:38,982
Wait. Someone else?
Who else?

132
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,618
‐Your brother.
‐Topher?

133
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,019
He was in the bunker?

134
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,554
And he swiped
the crystal.

135
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,689
‐Which is how I got stuck.
‐Right.

136
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,524
Anyway, you've got
your long story

137
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,493
and I've got mine,
and both will have to wait.

138
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:51,661
After you.

139
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,766
(portal opening)

140
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,602
You're not finished,
are you?

141
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:06,109
Please, leave my family alone.

142
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,514
I know you're hiding in there.

143
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,454
You talked to me before,
just talk to me again.

144
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,726
Tell me what we can do
to help you.

145
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:39,943
Harper:
Your mom was talking
to the mirror.

146
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:41,344
She knows?

147
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,246
My dad too.

148
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,321
Do they know its history?
That it's Grace?

149
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,290
No, but we almost
had a fire today.

150
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,160
Fire trucks,
lots of smoke.

151
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,329
What?

152
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,431
Remember when I told you
about my dream,

153
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,433
that nightmare
about smoke and a fire?

154
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,935
Sure. The day
you switched places
and got stuck.

155
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,604
In 1930, I learned
it wasn't a dream,

156
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:09,639
it was a vision.

157
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,607
I had more too.

158
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,444
Glimpses of the future,
of things to come.

159
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:18,281
I have this gift,
the same gift Grace had,

160
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,482
of seeing
into the future.

161
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,884
Bad things mostly,

162
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,920
like the smoke
and fire

163
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,823
that I thought
was gonna be in 1930,

164
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,591
but it must've been
in the present.

165
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,892
The Tremont now.

166
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,028
No one found any fire.

167
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,396
They couldn't explain it.

168
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,035
Wow. You've been to the past
and you can see into the future.

169
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,471
It's pretty impressive,
Harper.

170
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:42,705
Well, thank you.

171
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,545
Excuse me.

172
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,247
We're looking
for Sam Townsend.

173
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,882
He was admitted
earlier.

174
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:54,117
Colored ward is that way.

175
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,621
doctor: Still waiting
on those test results.

176
00:07:58,621 --> 00:07:59,789
Can you check
with the lab?

177
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,793
Doctor,
you've just been in
with Sam Townsend?

178
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,762
‐Yes.
‐How is he?

179
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:06,996
His vitals are strong,

180
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,631
but he remains
unconscious.

181
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,832
Time will tell.

182
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:12,301
Uh, do you know
where I can get
his medical record?

183
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,870
Sorry, I don't.

184
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,109
(whispering):
Sam. Sam!

185
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:24,313
Your time machine,
it works.

186
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,848
I used it, Sam.

187
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,051
I went back to 1930
when you were a kid.

188
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,086
I saw the hotel
when it was the farm.

189
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:32,889
I saw your father.
I saw you.

190
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,025
Caroline:
Honey, we have to go.

191
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,061
The doctor said
no visitors just yet.

192
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,931
(whispering):
Get better, Sam.

193
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,635
You have to see it working.

194
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,538
It's a beautiful thing
you created.

195
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,924
Harper:
It's all here.
The sale of the farm.

196
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,692
The judge's plans
to build the hotel.

197
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,794
The healing springs.

198
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,363
Delay after delay,

199
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,332
problems with
construction...

200
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,568
The judge went through
like six architects,

201
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:20,503
had to go to Baton Rouge
to find the right one.

202
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,672
The first grand opening.

203
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,540
1944.

204
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:26,509
Fourteen years later.

205
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:28,044
Harper:
When you take a look
at the false starts

206
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:29,011
and the construction delays,

207
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,880
it becomes so obvious.

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,281
The ghost of Grace
was behind it.

209
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,749
Ninety years
of blinking lights,

210
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,451
cold spots, and water leaks.

211
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,553
You said you had a way
to free her?

212
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:38,888
Harper:
With this‐‐

213
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,523
the document
that'll change everything.

214
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,425
This is the original,

215
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,527
which would have allowed
Elijah to stay on his land.

216
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,729
The forged second document
was used against him.

217
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,999
This is proof
the land was stolen.

218
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,935
Which means the land
still belongs to the Tremonts,

219
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,137
to my family.

220
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,672
Explaining why Grace
won't leave the hotel.

221
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,474
Anyone other than a Tremont
is an intruder

222
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,642
and must be dealt with.

223
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,278
Plus, I've always been
drawn to it.

224
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:03,613
My father too.

225
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:04,847
Even Topher.

226
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,916
And I'm thinking
it's because
it's still ours.

227
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:10,453
You realize my father's put
his whole life in that place?

228
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,857
This is huge.

229
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:17,793
One hotel, two owners.

230
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,296
What're we gonna do?

231
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:21,898
What we always do.

232
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,733
Figure it out.

233
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,905
And we're very close
to finishing.

234
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,007
Spackle, paint,
uh, a tricky furnace,

235
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,708
but the place
has good bones.

236
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,810
I don't know
if you've ever been
out there...

237
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,145
Sure. As a kid.

238
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:38,080
We'd throw rocks
through the windows and run.

239
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:41,217
I'm sure you know, the place
has quite a reputation.

240
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,190
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell,
you seem like nice people

241
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,925
and certainly very competent.

242
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:51,360
But there's
obvious risk here.

243
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,629
I noticed
you didn't mention
the recent fire.

244
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,866
Oh, that?
Mostly just smoke.
Right, Ben?

245
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,801
No damage,
aired it right out.

246
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,171
banker:
And lost a few contractors
along the way.

247
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,740
Some back pay is owed,
I understand.

248
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:07,310
‐Any refills?
‐banker: No, not for me.

249
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,547
Your passion
for this project
is undeniable.

250
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,384
But bottom line,
I can't recommend this
for a loan.

251
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:18,854
Thank you for your time.

252
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,029
You guys okay?

253
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:29,298
How could we be anything but

254
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,133
after your incredible pastries?

255
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,302
What Ben is trying to say

256
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:35,571
is that we may have
just lost our last chance

257
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,572
to finish the hotel.

258
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,774
Ben: Why don't you
join us, Jess?

259
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:40,943
As someone once said,
"Misery loves company."

260
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,181
(rooster crowing)

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,522
‐Hey, Sam.
‐I don't get it.

262
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:55,958
I packed this whole crate
two hours ago.

263
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,094
You didn't pull
all this stuff out,
did you?

264
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,061
Can't say I did.

265
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:02,898
Maybe it was Papa.

266
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,433
Now, why would he
do that?

267
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,905
I can't believe
we're actually leaving
this place.

268
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:13,309
Well, one chapter ends,
another one begins.

269
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,977
Unless you're at the end
of the book.

270
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,981
Sam, I'm saying
you're destined
to do great things.

271
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,484
You have to continue work
on your special project.

272
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:22,885
See it through.

273
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,553
Never give up on your dream.

274
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:27,556
Having visions again?
Looking into the future?

275
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:30,893
Something like that.
Something just as cool.

276
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:34,930
Cool? What does that mean?
Like chilly? Cold?

277
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,366
Like... magical.

278
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,237
Knock it off!

279
00:12:42,905 --> 00:12:44,674
Every day a new Daisy.

280
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:02,725
Is he...

281
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,694
Is he gone?

282
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:07,396
nurse: Not in the way
you're thinking.

283
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:10,433
He disappeared
during the middle
of the night.

284
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,803
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

285
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,440
Actually, I just might.

286
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,378
Harper:
It's the best way
to help Grace move on.

287
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,480
In fact, it may be
the only way.

288
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:26,849
I'm not disagreeing.

289
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,451
You're not agreeing
either.

290
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:30,119
It's just‐‐ (sighs)

291
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,588
My parents have
so many other problems
right now.

292
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:35,691
Piling more on them
just seems crazy.

293
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,994
I don't see this
as a problem.

294
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,831
Like you said,
we just need to get it
all out in the open.

295
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:44,867
My mom's car...
She's here.

296
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,702
We'll have everyone together.

297
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:49,004
Come on.
Now's the perfect time.

298
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,313
Harper:
It's a document that shows
this land, the springs,

299
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,482
all of it still belongs
to our family,

300
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,549
to the Tremonts.

301
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,185
Those signatures,
back in 1930,

302
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,687
they guaranteed
we'd never be evicted.

303
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:08,891
‐Where did you find this?
‐Harper: Archives downtown.

304
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,593
When I learned
we'd owned the land,

305
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:13,796
I was curious, so...
I did some research.

306
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:17,066
‐Griffin helped.
‐Sarah: So you're saying

307
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,235
this land was stolen
from the Tremonts

308
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,403
by this judge?

309
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,604
Technically, yes.

310
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:23,072
Jess: Exactly.
Technically.

311
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:25,274
This is an old document.

312
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,743
I mean, any lawyer
could easily argue
it's no longer valid...

313
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,479
no matter
what our kids uncovered.

314
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,014
Doesn't change things.

315
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:36,118
I, we, everyone knows
how you invested in this place.

316
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,153
It's your dream.

317
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,423
It was your husband,
my father's dream too.

318
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:44,560
That paper,
that lie has lasted
generations,

319
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,128
and we have to make it right.

320
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:48,998
Ben, you don't owe us anything.

321
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,599
Ben:
Harper's right.

322
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:55,104
If it's true,
if any of it is true, we...

323
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:00,376
we have an obligation,

324
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,748
a moral obligation
to return the land.

325
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,250
What happens to us?

326
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,385
Griffin:
Guys, it's‐‐ it's okay.

327
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:11,387
I mean, they're just
figuring things out.

328
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:14,223
Nothing has to change.

329
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:16,992
Right?

330
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,161
Jess:
Wait. Everyone...

331
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,797
I have an idea.

332
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:27,903
Now, hear me out.

333
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,373
You need money,
and I've been saving

334
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,209
to buy a better
and more upscale restaurant.

335
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,179
What if I put
the money in here?
Into the hotel?

336
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:39,615
50‐50 partner.

337
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,318
You'll have the money
you need to finish.

338
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,486
I can have my restaurant.

339
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:46,055
And we can restore
The Tremont back
to its greatness.

340
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,925
I mean,
it is your legacy, kids.

341
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:52,428
You okay with this?

342
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:54,864
Yeah. Yes, of course!

343
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:55,898
And yes from me too.

344
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:58,667
Ben?

345
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,538
Th‐‐ Th‐‐ This is...

346
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:05,374
It's‐‐ It's incredible.

347
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,376
Wyatt:
I vote...

348
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:11,514
‐Take the deal, Dad.
‐I'll second that.

349
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:13,082
‐Third.
‐Fourth.

350
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,819
‐It's unanimous.
‐Hm. Looks like a quorum, Ben.

351
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:20,523
Jess, I‐‐

352
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:23,292
‐We...
‐Jess: I know.

353
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,994
Enough said.

354
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:28,964
So, what do you say

355
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,033
we break out
some sparkling cider

356
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,234
to celebrate?

357
00:16:32,234 --> 00:16:33,302
Sarah:
I'm on it.

358
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,704
Wyatt, Zoey,
I'll need help
with the glasses.

359
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,374
I hate sparkling cider.
Makes me sneeze.

360
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,575
Zoey:
No one cares, Wyatt.

361
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:40,576
Hey, which room is mine?

362
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,244
Jess:
So what do you think?

363
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:43,946
How soon can you get
the contractors back?

364
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,981
Oh, now that there's
a paycheck in their futures,

365
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:47,483
I'd say sooner
than later.

366
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,785
Well, Tremonts back
in The Tremont.

367
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:51,287
What Grace wanted
all along.

368
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,955
I hope you're listening,
great‐great grandmother.

369
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:54,857
(light flickering)

370
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,898
Sam?

371
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,145
"I've gone on a journey
through time.

372
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,980
"Don't come after me.

373
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,416
"If I'm not back
in three weeks...

374
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,118
destroy the radio."

375
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:34,763
2024. The future.

376
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,441
You can rest easy now,
great‐great grandmother.

377
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,476
It's over.
You're free.

378
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,712
The Tremonts are back
on the land

379
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:50,980
just like
you always wanted.

380
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:55,751
(voice humming "Amazing Grace")

381
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,921
(thudding)

382
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:03,626
(mirror cracks)

383
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,806
(humming continues)

384
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,522
I sneezed, like, five times.
Now I have to pee.

385
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:35,157
Really more information
than we need.

386
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,461
Is it just me,
or does this place
feel different?

387
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:41,730
Different, how?

388
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,899
Like, peaceful?

389
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:45,934
Yeah, I'm getting
the same vibe.

390
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:48,771
Maybe because
we all want it
to feel that way.

391
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,012
Don't turn around,
Zoey.

392
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,380
No, turn around.

393
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,315
Don't‐‐ Do‐‐
Don't‐‐ Do, do.
Don't‐‐

394
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,623
You see it, right?

395
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,491
It came from the mirror.

396
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,160
We freed her.

397
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:26,608
(dramatic music)

398
00:19:56,605 --> 00:20:01,276
(singing "Amazing Grace")

399
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:12,421
Oh, my gosh!

400
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,630
Topher:
We did it.

401
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,799
We freed her, guys.

402
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:29,138
(singing continues)

403
00:20:48,423 --> 00:20:50,592
‐I don't think
we tell our parents.
‐Agreed.

404
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,060
They wouldn't
believe us, anyway.

405
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:54,062
Is it over?

406
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,832
Well, her spirit's freed,

407
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:58,500
and there aren't
any more ghosts.

408
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,604
Yeah. It's over.

409
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,642
Zoey:
Which means you can
finally go back

410
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,043
to snoring
in your own room.

411
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:10,712
She is so going to miss me!

412
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,250
‐Heading home, Harper?
‐Go ahead, Toph,
I'll catch up.

413
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:28,997
‐So‐‐
‐I, uh‐‐

414
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,465
(chuckles)
You can go first.

415
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,604
If it's not obvious,

416
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,006
I missed you
while you were gone.

417
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:42,044
Like... a lot.

418
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,547
I missed you too.

419
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:53,989
I, uh...
I better get inside.

420
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:56,024
Right. And I have
to catch up to Topher.

421
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,359
Yeah.

422
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,096
‐Good night, Griffin.
‐Good night, Harper.

423
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:29,958
(ominous music playing)

424
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:32,154

Harper:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

427
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,768
Sarah:
It's our pleasure
to finally say...

428
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:49,071
all:
Welcome to The Tremont!

429
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:50,472
(all cheering)

430
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,307
Finally found the key
to 205.

431
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,775
Sarah:
But it has that draft.

432
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,610
We still haven't figured out
where that's coming from.

433
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,746
That is not
a little hiccup.

434
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:00,082
Well, we can't close the hotel.
That would be a disaster.

435
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,150
Sam went into the future
and hasn't come back yet.

Crystal's cracking,
Savannah.

If you don't go home now,
you might not get
another chance.
