I said get the first aid kit!

Hurt as hell.

[On-jo] I told you not to go.

[Cheong-san] There's a zombie there.

362
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,792
It's caught under a piano,
so it can't go anywhere.

We can't…

go to the roof?

There are zombies out there, so…

Let's just think a little.

371
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,443
This is so annoying.

Hey, Nam-ra.

I'm good.

387
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,312
Are the cell phones working in here?

388
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,982
No. There won't be service here.

[Eun-hee sighs]

390
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,194
So you're telling me…

391
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,781
a politician can't talk
a way out of here?

392
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,284
It's true.

393
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,411
I've never been treated this way before.

394
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,247
There's nothing politicians
can't do in our country, right?

395
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,582
Don't be sarcastic.

396
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,210
I've never done anything illegal.

397
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,754
Never did anything improper my whole life.

398
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,547
Then can't you do it just this one time?

399
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,383
I really need to leave.

400
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,760
Wait a little.

401
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,471
I'll get you a helicopter
after we're tested,

402
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,306
and send you to your daughter's school.

403
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,599
The test isn't the problem.

404
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,936
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine here.

405
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,897
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

406
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,774
and even three weeks for Ebola.

407
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,526
And then what?

408
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,945
Are you saying we have to stay here
even after we get tested?

409
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,531
It depends what they consider
the incubation period is.

[gate clanks open]

by the door.

I was a Master Sergeant when I left.

Are you our senior officer?

417
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,223
He was also Special Mission Unit.

418
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,391
Nice to meet you.

419
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,686
Sorry. I'd buy you a drink
if we had met outside.

420
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,979
[military medic 1] It's fine.

421
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,065
Tell me, how long are they considering
for quarantine?

422
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,442
We don't know, sir.

423
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,651
Sure you do.

424
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,652
[military medic 1] It's true.

425
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,947
They don't know what this virus is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

426
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,367
From what I hear, they're thinking
a minimum of, I don't know, four weeks.

427
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,203
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month!

428
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,955
Wait until you get tested.

Wait a minute.

-Yes, sir.
-Well…

I'm sorry,

I already said I'd follow protocol
and help you.

Don't even think about coming with me.

You weren't bitten by a zombie.

If you get bitten by zombies,
you turn into one.

Guys, say something. This is wrong.

665
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,564
She said herself
that she wanted to bite him.

She has zombie blood in her veins.

The earlier one was in an accident.
That's obviously fine.
