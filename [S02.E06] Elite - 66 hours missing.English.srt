1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
66 HOURS MISSING

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,000
I regret that we meet again, Guzmán.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,759
At least it has nothing to do with me
this time.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,960
Are you sure about that?

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,199
I have no relationship whatsoever
with Samuel or his brother.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,559
For me, it's as though they didn't exist.

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,039
Good evening.

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,840
What the fuck are you doing here?

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm alone.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,799
Come and get me.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,679
You don't have the balls.

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,479
You'd only dare go after Carla?

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,119
Or my sister.

14
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,439
You don't have the balls!

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,120
What I do have is brains.

16
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,439
If I hit you, you'll call the police...

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
And which one of us is out on bail
and would end up back in jail?

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,760
I didn't do it.

19
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,599
I didn't do it, Guzmán.

20
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,040
I didn't kill her.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,799
Are you going to let me wreck it?

22
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,920
Good night.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,319
So you were avoiding both Nano and Samuel.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,680
I didn't go near them.

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
I didn't want to catch anything from them.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,120
And you don't know anything
about either of their whereabouts?

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,560
Nor do I care.

28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,159
-Are we done yet?
-No.

29
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,719
We've only just started.

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,400
Good evening, miss.
Room service has arrived.

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,080
Tuna sashimi with a subtle touch...

32
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,199
A very subtle touch of ginger.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
I said I'm not hungry.

34
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,719
It has everything that you like.
I know you better than anyone.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,800
Sure. You know me better than anyone.

36
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,039
If you knew me that well,

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,759
you'd know that you're the last person
I want to see right now.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,759
What if people find out?

39
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,560
What then?

40
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,879
Excuse me?

41
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,400
We are half-brother and sister.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,479
Nobody was taking advantage of the other.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,599
And we're not planning
on bringing children into the world.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
What's the problem?

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,479
-Tell me, what's the problem?
-Whatever.

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,719
Maybe that you're a junkie?

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,560
A little boy with credit cards?

48
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,400
That everything is all a joke to you,
including your own future, including me?

49
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,360
I was already like that when you used
to come to my room every night.

50
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,479
You started this shitty game.

51
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,639
When you kissed me for the first time.

52
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,159
Like the other night at the party.

53
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,759
Sure.

54
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,439
Do you know why I kissed you at the party?

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
Because you love me?

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Because you drugged me.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,199
You know it was undetectable.

58
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,199
What happened to your car?

59
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,960
Good morning.

60
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,039
I came back and found it like that.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Sure.

62
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,399
It was probably the same drunks

63
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,199
that beat you up the other night
for nothing, right?

64
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,920
I'd guess...

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,439
I've got the message loud and clear.
I'm a fucking nuisance.

66
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,959
Don't worry,
you'll be rid of me soon enough.

67
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm leaving.

68
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,879
-What do you mean you're leaving?
-I'm leaving the country.

69
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm not gonna let those bastards
lock me up for life.

70
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,360
That's fucking great.

71
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,360
Your brother and I spent the whole summer
working to get you out of prison,

72
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,120
and now you want to go on the run?
That's great.

73
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,240
If you skip bail,
there goes the bond we paid.

74
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

75
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,639
Nano.

76
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,360
Nano!

77
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,560
Samu...

78
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,360
You smell so good. Can we talk?

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,600
What you saw the other day at the party
was just a misunderstanding.

80
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,439
I don't want you
to get the wrong impression.

81
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,319
Your brother had his tongue
right down your throat.

82
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,839
Wrong.

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,160
Half-brother.

84
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,920
And I don't remember anything about that.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,439
I was drunk.

86
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,240
What can I do to make you
forget all about it, too?

87
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Ask anything you want.

88
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,920
Are you trying to buy me off?

89
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,519
Don't tell me you don't need anything.

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,439
Because I can think
of basically everything.

91
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,360
You can stick your money
where the sun don't shine.

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,519
Okay...

93
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,839
Pride is a luxury
that only we rich folk can afford.

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,279
Looking down on others is a luxury
that you can't afford right now.

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,680
So what the fuck do you want?

96
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,720
I want you to go to bed every night

97
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,000
not knowing whether you'll be
the next outcast at school.

98
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,399
Will everyone look you up
and down in the halls?

99
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,600
Will they whisper about you?

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,279
Will they make you feel like a weirdo?

101
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,399
Darling...

102
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,800
If I go down,

103
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm dragging you down with me. Understood?

104
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
-I couldn't get any lower, Lucrecia.
-You're right.

105
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,639
How many broken bones
does your brother have?

106
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,759
Are you regretting it now?

107
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm so glad you've seen the light, Samu!

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Why aren't you going to report him?

109
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,240
He barely touched me.

110
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,839
Are we waiting until he kills you
before we go to the station?

111
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
Welcome to fucking reality, Guzmán.

112
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,000
When a woman reports a guy,
it's her word against his.

113
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,600
The most likely thing is
that she won't be believed.

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,920
Anyway, the last thing I want is for that
bastard to end up on the streets again,

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,839
even more pissed off at me than before.

116
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
Why does he hate you?

117
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,839
What?

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,319
I mean, why did he go after you?

119
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,240
He went for all of us.

120
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,920
I was an easy target.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
The girl walking home alone.

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,959
Good morning.

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
I have the exam results.

124
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
I'm sorry.
I'm what you got in the divorce.

125
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,399
Guzmán.

126
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,879
Guzmán!

127
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,040
-What?
-You have to...

128
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,639
We all have to move on.

129
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
He's a fucking murderer.

130
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,199
He's killed once,
who says he won't do it again?

131
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,600
I wanted to talk to you.

132
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,759
You and I. Dinner. Tonight.

133
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,040
Lu recommended a great restaurant.
At 8:30 p.m.

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
He can't.

135
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,639
Why?

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,440
It's Ander's birthday.
We're celebrating like we do every year.

137
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,960
Okay. Tomorrow, then.

138
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,440
Happy birthday to you

139
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,279
Happy birthday to you

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,879
Happy birthday, bro.

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,320
Happy birthday, dear...

142
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,600
Thanks.

143
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,519
What's up?

144
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
Where are we celebrating?

145
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,240
-I'm gonna pass this year.
-Why's that?

146
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,960
We have an exam tomorrow.

147
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,320
And I'm the principal's son.
I should pass at least one.

148
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,639
Shit, man,
why are you acting so strange lately?

149
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,879
Nothing. The divorce thing, I guess.

150
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,600
That's what friends are for, right?

151
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,480
To help each other through rough patches.
With a couple of drinks and some chatting.

152
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,679
We'll celebrate later.

153
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,799
When all this is over.
Exams and everything.

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,639
So, you're free tonight, then.

155
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,759
What time did you say?

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Carla.

157
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
What do you want?

158
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,600
To thank you for not reporting my brother.

159
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,200
They wouldn't have believed me
without any evidence.

160
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,279
They wouldn't have believed most girls.

161
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,799
But your word is not worth
the same as the others.

162
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,320
You're rich,
the daughter of a marchioness.

163
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,960
That is also "fucking reality."

164
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,480
If you had gone to the police,
Nano would be behind bars now.

165
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,840
And you didn't do it because of me.

166
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,960
And you also beat your own brother
to death because of me.

167
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,960
Maybe we should stop doing things
for one another, Samuel.

168
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,679
We should leave it.

169
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,480
What happened wasn't your fault.

170
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,440
Well, I'm always there
when something bad happens.

171
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,679
It's not your fault.

172
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,759
-What if it is?
-It's not.

173
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
How do you know?

174
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,440
I just know.

175
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,799
I look at you
and I know you don't want to harm anyone.

176
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,360
Sure.

177
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,159
You've been pussy-whipped.
I often have that effect on guys.

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,960
Not on me.

179
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,320
What if we just go with it?

180
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,480
-Weren't we going to leave this?
-We're leaving it.

181
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,840
Little by little.

182
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,679
For someone that's leaving it,
you look very turned on.

183
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,559
Rich kid stuff.

184
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,840
You're fighting hard today.

185
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,480
You only hit hard
when you're defending Miss Marchioness?

186
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,320
-What did you want me to do?
-I don't know...

187
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,279
I thought the idea of all this was to help
your brother, not to send him to hospital.

188
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,759
-That's between Nano and me.
-Excuse me?

189
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
It's not your business.

190
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,919
Bullshit. Not my business...

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,120
You made it my business
the first day I met you.

192
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
You've been doing my head in with it.
Now I should forget about it?

193
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,279
The way you forget about it as soon as
that chick sticks her pussy in your face?

194
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,279
Fuck's sake!

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Didn't you want to find out
who killed Marina?

196
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,519
What do you want me to do?

197
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,440
Not throw the fucking towel in!

198
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,720
Get up! Up!

199
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,720
I don't know where to go from here.

200
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,200
So start again from scratch.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,559
You may have missed something.

202
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,559
You never see
what's right under your nose.

203
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,639
Good afternoon.

204
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,039
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

205
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Nadia, my dear!

206
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
I'd like to have a chat with you
in private.

207
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,519
I'd rather not.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,759
I'm being cautious.

209
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,879
It'd be better for you if they don't hear
what I have to say to you.

210
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,399
Lucrecia...

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,759
Why did you come here?

212
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
Do they know that you fucked Guzmán?

213
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,519
Get out of here.

214
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,360
I give the orders around here.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
What are you talking about?

216
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,799
I want you to fail
all the exams this week.

217
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,200
Why?

218
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,600
Because I want you to know how it feels

219
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,799
when the thing that matters most to you
is ripped away.

220
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
Your scholarship, for example.

221
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,879
If you don't fail,

222
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,759
I'll come back and tell your mom
and dad that their daughter is a slut.

223
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,840
That she's tried her first Christian dick.

224
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,919
Shut up.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You decide

226
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,919
whether you'd rather be kicked out
of your house or out of school.

227
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Have a nice day!

228
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,279
Bye.

229
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
Instagram accounts were the first thing
I looked at.

230
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,240
I didn't find anything.

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,360
Because you didn't know where to look.

232
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,840
END OF YEAR PARTY

233
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,240
This is Polo,
the guy that sent the message confessing?

234
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,279
Stop. Go back to one before.

235
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,879
He's not wearing the same shirt.

236
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,960
Why would you change your clothes
in the middle of the party?

237
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,879
Because they get stained
with the usual stuff.

238
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,879
-Vomit, alcohol or cum.
-Blood.

239
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,360
That photo is before Marina was killed.

240
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
This one is afterwards.

241
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,120
He had a spare shirt in his locker
just in case he killed someone?

242
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,519
That's not his shirt.

243
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,120
I've seen it before.

244
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,360
It's Christian's shirt.

245
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,960
Christian helped him when it got stained.
He knew why it got stained.

246
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,720
He knew, but he said nothing.

247
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,440
That's why he was acting so strange
all summer.

248
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,320
-And when he wanted to talk...
-Fucking hell, Samuel.

249
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,399
Where are you going?

250
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
I love it.
It's really beautiful and all that.

251
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
I've been on it many times,
but you have to look for things to do.

252
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,840
-Either that or you get all bored.
-I see.

253
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,480
I love these chopsticks. They're so cute.

254
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,360
-So basically, we got on his yacht.
-Listen.

255
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,279
What?

256
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,080
How about we talk about something else?

257
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,519
It's all about trips
to the most beautiful places,

258
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,120
delicious food, your best friends...

259
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,200
Guilty.

260
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,320
What's wrong with that?

261
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,639
It makes me feel
like my life is shit in comparison.

262
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,279
Maybe it is, but...

263
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
I have so many problems

264
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,600
that I have no strength left
to even smile for the camera.

265
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,200
Tell me about something bad
that has happened to you.

266
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,080
I suppose you don't have any problems.

267
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,759
Well, it's hard to live alone sometimes.

268
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,159
My mom is never home.

269
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,919
-Sure, sure...
-And...

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,240
-Sure?
-Sure.

271
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,960
With an entire palace all to yourself,
it must be fucking hard as hell.

272
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,080
Tell the waiter about it.
I'm sure he'll end up you giving a tip.

273
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:33,600
Sorry.

274
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,799
-It's okay...
-I didn't mean to offend you.

275
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,919
No worries.

276
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,679
It's just another photo, bro.
It's not much.

277
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,919
Basically, these motherfuckers
already have a scapegoat.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,200
Let's check it out.

279
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,519
Let's go to the police.

280
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,120
All they'll see, Samu, is the brother
of a stray bullet trying to save his ass.

281
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,679
So then what? Are you giving up?

282
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,600
No.

283
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm going out in style.

284
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,839
If they don't catch me
at the border, of course.

285
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,279
If you leave, you're as good as admitting
that you're guilty.

286
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,799
Wait. At least you're not in prison now.

287
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
This is worse than prison. Much worse.

288
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,599
In my dingy four by four cell,
I couldn't hurt anyone.

289
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,319
Here, on the other hand,
I feel like I'm radioactive.

290
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
Everything I touch turns to shit.

291
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,720
I want to live in peace. That's all.

292
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,799
And so do you two.

293
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
With you here.

294
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
We want you here.

295
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,319
The other night you didn't want me there.

296
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,319
The other night I was an animal.

297
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,480
Look, I don't know
if I'll ever be able to forgive you.

298
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,559
But if you leave,
neither of us will ever know.

299
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,759
Have you seen the car?

300
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,119
It's worse than me.

301
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,559
What's that got to do with anything?

302
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,759
Next time blondie shows up,
he won't just scratch the bodywork.

303
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
-Guzmán?
-I don't blame him.

304
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,839
I don't blame him.

305
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,920
If I believed he had killed my brother,
I'd do the same.

306
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,799
Give me time, Nano.

307
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
Hang in there a little longer.
I'm about to figure it all out.

308
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,599
Find a job, don't get into trouble.

309
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,279
Do it for me.

310
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
For Mom.

311
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,680
For Marina.

312
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,119
This is the point
where Samuel disappeared.

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,359
But the last indication of him
being alive was here.

314
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,799
The last time his cell phone was active.

315
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,039
Do you recognize the area?

316
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,039
Maybe...

317
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,559
Your grandparents have a country house.

318
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,119
That's where Marina's ashes are buried.

319
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,799
What was Samuel doing around there?

320
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Well...

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,359
He could have been delivering
lemon chicken. How should I know?

322
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,599
He wasn't working that night.

323
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,039
Now you're studying shots?

324
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm keeping Omar company.

325
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
I could have kept you company.

326
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,599
But you didn't want that.

327
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,119
Enjoy.

328
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Guzmán...

329
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
What's going on with him?

330
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,759
Pour me some more.

331
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
Honey, you're really going for it tonight.

332
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,240
"Honey"?

333
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,160
Here we go. Again?

334
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,759
-You're looking fantastic, gayboy!
-Here she comes!

335
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,960
Happy birthday, handsome.

336
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,759
-How's my favorite customer?
-Fucking great.

337
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,720
-Really?
-Really.

338
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,319
I wouldn't say so.
You don't look too good.

339
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,359
-I'm good!
-What's wrong?

340
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,119
I was all wound up at home and I thought
I would come see my friend, the Sultan.

341
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,480
I can't allow that! Let me get you a drink
and let's have some fun.

342
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,480
On the house.

343
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,240
-But first, got anything to say to me?
-Yeah, you look so handsome!

344
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,039
Weird... I thought you'd quit.

345
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,160
Ander is ignoring me,
Lu won't even look at me

346
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,960
and Polo is hooking up with the new girl.

347
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,160
I think you're my best friend right now.
What about that?

348
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Funny...

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,119
I thought this was all because of Nadia.

350
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,319
What the fuck would you know
about loving someone who loves you,

351
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,480
but you can't be together because
of the fucking society you live in?

352
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,319
You're absolutely right.

353
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,480
I have no fucking clue.

354
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,519
What the fuck are you doing?

355
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,319
I'm doing you a favor as your best friend.

356
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,799
Do me a favor now. Go home.

357
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,200
-Fucking hell!
-Good night.

358
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,200
Thank you very much.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,039
Get me some rum and coke.

360
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,400
Right away.

361
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,519
Gaydar, my ass!

362
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,519
This song is the authentic gay magnet.
I'm off to scout out the talent again.

363
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay, good luck. We'll catch up later.

364
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,680
Hey.

365
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:57,119
Honey, you look
like SpongeBob SquarePants.

366
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,400
Not again! Don't call me that.

367
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,519
What? SpongeBob SquarePants?

368
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,400
You could also stop doing that,
couldn't you?

369
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,960
Doing what?

370
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,839
You know what. Don't play dumb.

371
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,480
The looks, the little remarks.
I'm not a fool.

372
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,880
Because of the way
you've been acting all night.

373
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,160
Acting?

374
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,559
I'm not acting.

375
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,880
Look, forget it.

376
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,319
I don't want to.

377
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Come on, say what's on your mind.

378
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,319
What is wrong with you?

379
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,759
This isn't the Omar I fell for!
Do you get it? I like the other one.

380
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, then I don't know
why you're wasting time with this guy.

381
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,839
-Almost.
-What's up with you?

382
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
Hey... Good night.

383
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,759
Do you only use your phone
for taking trashy selfies or what?

384
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,440
Trashy people also run out of battery.

385
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,519
What's wrong with you?

386
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,599
What's wrong with me?

387
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,279
I was worried sick about you.
That's what's wrong.

388
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
It wouldn't be the first time.

389
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,839
Look at me.

390
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,079
From now on,
the chauffeur will escort you everywhere.

391
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,240
Even to the toilet, if necessary.

392
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,759
And you'll have a charger with you
all the time.

393
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,279
What's going on, Mom?

394
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,880
Mr. Biker.

395
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,920
Leave my family in peace.

396
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,000
A bit ironic, coming from you. Isn't it?

397
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,480
You think it's bad that I have a problem
with the guy that murdered my sister?

398
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,079
It was your friend Polo, you asshole.

399
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you talking about, you scumbag?

400
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,839
-It was Polo. Listen to me!
-I'm having a shit day

401
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,759
-and now you come to piss me off!
-Listen to me!

402
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,559
He wanted to get Carla's watch back.

403
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,279
Christian knew.
He was going to tell the whole story.

404
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,000
Or do you think what happened to him
was an accident?

405
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,359
Sir!

406
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
They're fighting.

407
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,680
Guys, stop now!

408
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,880
This is not the first time...

409
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,359
and I will not tolerate it.

410
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,279
I didn't do anything! He came after me.

411
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,480
Is that true?

412
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,759
It was Guzmán who attacked Samuel.

413
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,240
-What are you talking about?
-Don't play dumb.

414
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,960
I don't recognize him lately.

415
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,000
He must be hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

416
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,160
Don't think you're escaping unscathed.
I'll be talking to your mother as well.

417
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,039
Guzmán, you are suspended.

418
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,359
-For two days.
-What?

419
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
We're in exams! You're suspending me now?

420
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,599
Three days. Come with me, please.

421
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,559
You owe me one.

422
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,440
JOB POSTINGS

423
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,599
There's fuck all...

424
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,599
Of course, don't worry, I'll talk to him.

425
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,960
It won't happen again.

426
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,079
Okay. Thank you.

427
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,720
You get out of prison and all of a sudden,
your brother starts getting in trouble.

428
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,440
What a coincidence, huh?

429
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,880
It wouldn't have something to do with you?

430
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
-It has everything to do with me.
-For fuck's sake, Nano!

431
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,759
Shit...

432
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,119
Listen, why don't you stop
looking for work

433
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,839
and start looking for a ticket
out of here?

434
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
A one-way ticket.

435
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,839
What's going on?

436
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm going to fail.

437
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,559
You? Impossible.

438
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,880
Your darling sister is forcing me to fail.

439
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Or she will tell something.

440
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Something?

441
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,519
What?

442
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,799
Think of the worst.

443
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,279
If she threatens to tell on you,

444
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,240
tell her you'll tell everyone
about the Valerio thing.

445
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,960
I promise she will never mess with you
ever again.

446
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,519
And what is the "Valerio thing"?

447
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,039
Think of the worst,
and you wouldn't even come close.

448
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,160
How was your date?

449
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,400
Great.

450
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,559
After so many years,
do you think you can deceive me?

451
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:17,680
SAMUEL - I want to see you after class,
in the classroom.

452
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
How's lover boy doing?

453
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,480
Please... He's not my lover boy.

454
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,799
You know I'm only with him for one reason,
and love has nothing to do with it.

455
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,599
After so many years,
do you think you can deceive me?

456
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,119
Good morning!
What tired little faces you have.

457
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,920
I hope that's from all the studying.

458
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,480
He came after me. I didn't do anything!

459
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,039
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Getting the best mark in the class.

461
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,880
You'll be forcing me to have
a very unpleasant conversation

462
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,839
with your parents.

463
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,000
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.

464
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,759
Not unless you want people to find out...

465
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,759
about the Valerio thing.

466
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,799
What did you say?

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,359
In fact, either you fail this test,

468
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,200
or everyone will know.

469
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,279
Have a nice day.

470
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,680
-He provoked me. He said that...
-What?

471
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,200
Some bullshit.

472
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,119
He said that...

473
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,799
-That...
-Guzmán, you can't... Guzmán!

474
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,079
You need to move on
or things will end badly.

475
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,039
For fuck's sake, what if that guy
had attacked you last night?

476
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,119
I'm not afraid of him.

477
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,759
I'm not afraid of him either.

478
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,920
I'm afraid of you.

479
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
I'm afraid you'll do something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

480
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,279
It only takes a second.

481
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,440
If you don't control your anger,
one bad punch, one bad fall...

482
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,880
and you make everything go to shit.

483
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,440
Polo.

484
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,039
Fucking hell...

485
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,480
Can we talk a moment?

486
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,079
I just got the feeling
that you were avoiding me. I get it but...

487
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,359
-Not at all.
-Yes! He is avoiding you!

488
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,000
He doesn't like you, you're not his type.
It's not you, it's him.

489
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,880
He just came out of a relationship
and doesn't want a new one.

490
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,759
Pick the excuse you like most,
the end result will be the same.

491
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,559
-He doesn't want anything to do with you.
-Guzmán!

492
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,160
What, Polo?

493
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,880
If you haven't got the guts to say it,
someone has to do it for you.

494
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,920
So you stop messing the poor girl around.

495
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,839
Right?

496
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,799
I'm sorry. It's for your own good.

497
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,799
Okay...

498
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,359
I don't know how to thank you.

499
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,680
I would offer to send you to rehab,

500
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,200
but I've only got enough
to buy you a coffee.

501
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm not that cheap.

502
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,680
How did it go?

503
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,000
What is it that Lu has got against you?
If you want to let me know...

504
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,640
Guzmán and I slept together.

505
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,319
So what?

506
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,200
-It's just sex. What's wrong with that?
-No.

507
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,759
Between us, it would never only be that.

508
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,599
And I knew it.

509
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,640
I knew I would turn my life upside down,

510
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,519
as well as Guzmán's, and Lu's...

511
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,240
But I did it anyway.

512
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Because I'm in love.

513
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,880
As though that were an excuse.

514
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,640
Love is supposedly very beautiful,

515
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,079
but it also turns you
into someone very selfish.

516
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,079
Your turn.

517
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,359
What is the "Valerio thing" anyway?

518
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,319
Do you want to know something, Nadia?

519
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,119
You've become something like a friend.

520
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,839
If I tell you about this,
you may not want to be my friend anymore.

521
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,960
I don't know what to do.

522
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,759
I'm more open than you think.

523
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,720
Nothing surprises me
at this school anymore.

524
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,720
It was a pleasure being your friend.

525
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,880
Are you all right?

526
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,359
You're a dead man, you son of a bitch.

527
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,559
Come on, Caye.

528
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,640
I don't understand what I did wrong.

529
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
-You didn't do anything wrong.
-Okay.

530
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,160
We're just at different points
in our lives.

531
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,960
Your life is all rosy
and mine is black right now.

532
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,200
-Very black.
-Yeah, okay, but why?

533
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,279
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

534
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,559
I wouldn't expect someone like you
to understand it.

535
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,240
Your biggest problem seems to be

536
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,079
deciding which of your ten bathrooms
to use each morning.

537
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,720
Sorry. I'm sorry.

538
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,839
You don't know me.

539
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,000
You don't know who I am.

540
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,319
You think I don't have problems?

541
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
Seriously?

542
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,319
You want me to tell you
something ugly about me, right?

543
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,440
Fine...

544
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,599
Fine.

545
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,319
How much time do you have?

546
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,039
Thanks.

547
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,319
Don't you like it?

548
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,359
Yeah, I like it.

549
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
It's just that I don't have this console.

550
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,119
But it's the thought that counts.

551
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,920
You didn't have to come
if you didn't want to.

552
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,559
Of course I wanted to come, Ander.

553
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,960
So that mom doesn't bother you.

554
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,320
Look, son,
if you don't like the game, I'm sorry.

555
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,079
It's not easy to know what you like now.

556
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,000
What?

557
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,960
-Do you really have to come out with that?
-It's true.

558
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,280
I feel like I don't know anything
about my son. He's changed.

559
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,039
I don't know who he is!
He used to like things and now...

560
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,679
What does that matter?

561
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,599
-Omar, darling...
-No.

562
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,199
What does it matter if he doesn't like
tennis or girls? He's still Ander.

563
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,800
You only just met him.
What would you know?

564
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,480
I know that they say I've changed, too,
but I haven't. I've always been this way.

565
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,320
I had to pretend so as not to disappoint,
but I'm tired of it.

566
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
And anyone who doesn't like it...

567
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,639
Anyone who doesn't like it
will be out of my life.

568
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,880
Ander is also tired of pretending.

569
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
If you don't learn to love him as he is,
you will lose him forever.

570
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,159
I don't know what it's like
to lose a child,

571
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,719
but I swear to you,
losing a father is a fucking bitch.

572
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,039
What a time to meet...

573
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,599
Looks like we are alone.

574
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,719
That was the idea.

575
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,440
Why did Polo change
the night of the party?

576
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,199
He threw up on himself.

577
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,599
He put on Christian's shirt.

578
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,280
He had the same one.

579
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,960
They both bought the same one
when we went shopping one day.

580
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,199
It sounds as though you had your answers
prepared in advance.

581
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,880
You are so predictable.

582
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,559
Don't lie to me, Carla.

583
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,440
You are covering for a murderer.

584
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,159
I don't know what you think you're going
to achieve with your questions.

585
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,400
You've been at it for weeks
and you've gotten nowhere.

586
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,320
And you're not going to.

587
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,559
Why are you being like this?

588
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,159
I'm not being like anything.

589
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,159
If you carry on with your investigation,

590
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,480
the only thing you will really achieve
will be ending up like Christian.

591
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,519
Who did that to him?

592
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
Polo?

593
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,079
Samuel...

594
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,519
Why do you keep playing this game,
if you keep on losing?

595
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm tired of it.

596
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,159
I can say it louder but not any clearer.

597
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,360
My grandparents don't live at that farm.

598
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,159
-I haven't been there in months.
-Sure.

599
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,079
So it's a coincidence

600
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,320
that the last time Samuel was seen alive
was close to one of your properties

601
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,920
and the last time Nano was seen alive
was at your house, right?

602
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,960
The door was open.

603
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,679
Get out. Get out of here!

604
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,719
I'm calling the police!

605
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,440
I'm going. But before I do,
I have a message for your son.

606
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:39,199
And for your whole family. Let's see
if you can get this straight for once.

607
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,400
Don't come any closer.

608
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,480
That's the number
we were given in the clinic

609
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,719
when she went to have an abortion.

610
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,079
We left before they called us.
Do you know why?

611
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,119
Because we were so in love, we thought
that we could have a kid together.

612
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,599
What a pair of idiots.

613
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,760
I was so madly in love with your daughter

614
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,239
that I kept this shitty little piece
of paper as a keepsake.

615
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,079
It's the only thing I have of hers.

616
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,599
The only thing I can touch.

617
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,400
Do you really think I could have been
capable of hurting your daughter?

618
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,400
Do you really think that?

619
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,559
Thank you.

620
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,760
I think I should go.

621
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:10,960
See?

622
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,239
That's why we all pretend to be happy,

623
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,519
because none of you tolerate
the misfortunes of others.

624
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,800
The fantasy you made up?
What for, to be just another posh girl?

625
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,719
-No...
-Really?

626
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
No, Polo.

627
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,119
So that people like you would talk to me.

628
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,000
Or have dinner with me.

629
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,480
Just so you know, the real Cayetana...

630
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,559
-Cayetana is your name, right?
-Yes.

631
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,760
The real one is a lot more interesting.

632
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
Or, at least, different.

633
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,239
I've never met anyone like this before.

634
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,719
Well, at least the exotic species
has kept you entertained.

635
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
-You can go if you want.
-No.

636
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,639
Go.

637
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,079
How can I help you?

638
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,159
You don't get it. What now?

639
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,079
I don't have money,
so all you can do for me is help?

640
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,119
Are you for real?

641
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,519
I don't need your help, Polo.

642
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,639
I need you.

643
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,559
But I know that's not possible...

644
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:32,599
Cayetana.

645
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,639
I'm leaving.

646
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,079
Don't. This is Polo.

647
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,719
Tell your friend to leave.
I need to talk to you.

648
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,199
He knows...

649
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,719
He knows everything. What's wrong?

650
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,199
Does he know that you stole a dress?

651
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,039
Not that part.

652
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,199
And that its owner has called round
all my houses and I've lost all of them?

653
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,760
We will find more.

654
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
That's it.

655
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,239
-No.
-Yes...

656
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,480
Not here. I've been blacklisted.

657
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,840
And now what?
How are we going to pay the bills?

658
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,239
Shit...

659
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,159
And now this?

660
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,519
Who the fuck does he think he is?

661
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,960
-I'm going to kill him!
-Ventura, please... Calm down.

662
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,639
Calm down? My ass!

663
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,760
Haven't we suffered enough?

664
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,719
Hi.

665
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,880
Hi, darling.

666
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,119
This is not
because I was suspended, right?

667
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,840
That murderer had the balls to come here.

668
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
If you have something to accuse me of,

669
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,360
get on with it.
Otherwise, leave me in peace.

670
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,159
I'm supposed to be studying
with my friends.

671
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,400
We can continue tomorrow.

672
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,559
Thank you very much.

673
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:07,559
Nano!

674
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,440
Nano! I've got something!

675
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,679
Nano!

676
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:14,880
No...

677
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,320
Where is he?

678
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,400
Where the fuck is he?

679
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,199
He's gone! It's your fucking fault!

680
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,559
-That's not true!
-It is!

681
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,119
The typical thing you do
when you're innocent, right?

682
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:46,960
What do you think you're going to achieve
with your questions?

683
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,159
You've been at it for weeks

684
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,599
-and you've gotten nowhere.
-What's that?

685
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,760
-And you're not going to.
-Why are you being like this?

686
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,880
I'm not being like anything.

687
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,360
If you carry on with your investigation,

688
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,719
the only thing you will really achieve
will be ending up like Christian.

689
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
