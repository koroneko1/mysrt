1
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,625
May you have a long life,
beauty, happiness, health.

2
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,458
Today I'd like to discuss 
death with you.

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,833
[laughs softly]

4
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:39,750
Yes.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,541
Death is about dharma.

00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,958
JOIN ONLINE CHANTING WITH US HERE.

7
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,791
It's nature's way.

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:51,791
Yes.

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,125
Everybody dies someday.

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,375
Even someone who tries to evade death.

11
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,666
Is that possible?

12
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:01,916
No.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
[laughs]

14
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,833
That's what I thought.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,833
One should lead a peaceful life.

16
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,000
Live quietly.

17
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,291
Oh.

18
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,125
-[whispers] Okay, I've turned it down.
-[door opens]

19
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,083
And when it's already light and quiet,

20
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,666
you still suffer, keep smiling.

21
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,708
Whenever you smile, you can be happy.

22
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,708
Amen.

23
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,958
[gasps] Shit.

24
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,958
Shit what? It's me.

25
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,666
When will you quit talking to 
a monk online?

26
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,250
What's so bad about it, Muay Lek?

27
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,333
Just log in, and there he is.

28
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,125
No need to go to the temple.

29
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,375
It's bliss. [laughs]

30
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,166
Where is Golf?

31
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,958
Is he up now?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,791
Here I am. Meeting you again with T26.

33
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,125
Don't forget, folks.

34
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:15,791
T26 is derived from our daily routines. 
Easy peasy.

35
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:20,333
First, we start from... Golfy's sure, 
you all know how to iron your clothes.

36
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,166
Press, press, press, press.

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,625
What do we gain from this move?

38
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,500
We got waistline, waistline.

39
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,416
Waistline.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,583
Chest firm.

41
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,791
Now up the beat!

42
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,833
Advance, advance!

43
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,125
Press, press, press, press.

44
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,791
Stay focused on the iron all the time,
so your clothes won't burn.

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,833
After ironing the clothes, what's next?

46
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,750
It's clothes hanging. Pick them up.

47
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,875
Shake, shake,

48
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,708
shake, shake, and hang!

49
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,583
Very easy. Easy step.

50
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,166
And what do we do after hanging?

51
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,375
We collect them.

52
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,416
Pick and throw, pick and throw.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,750
Faster, faster.

54
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,791
What do we gain from this move?

55
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,583
Nothing. It's just for fun.

56
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,208
Faster, faster.

57
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,125
Faster, faster, faster.

58
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,041
Hey, Golf.

59
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,250
What's with you?

60
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,875
Why haven't you had a shower?

61
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,458
[panting] I just woke up.

62
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,625
Tidying up my bed, see?

63
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,541
-Hurry up, we'll be late for work.
-I am on it, okay?

64
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,625
Hey, hey.

65
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,000
What's up?

66
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,666
The preaching this morning was great.

67
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,500
When I hear a good teaching,
I feel great and weirdly refreshed.

68
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,125
[inhales deeply]

69
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,416
You're weird.

70
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,000
People don't take their breath
with their arms wide open like that.

71
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,333
I told you not to watch Thai soaps
or Thai advertisements too much.

72
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,208
You watch them and remember.

73
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,875
When you remember, you copy them.
And it eventually becomes overacting.

74
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,291
Overacting suits my type
better than yours.

75
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,250
You should leave this to us, okay?

76
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,000
You kinky head.

77
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,250
Okay.

78
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,125
I'll breathe without 
my arms wide open, then.

79
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,250
[inhales deeply]

80
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,750
Oh, man. Still on your shoulders.

81

[Pii exhales]

82
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
I don't think she gets my point.

83
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:16,083
Don't you think 
it's tiring being around her?

84
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,125
I feel the same about you.

85
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,083
[Pii] Hello, Nop.

86
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,208
How is it going? On the way to work?

87
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:35,000
Hey, I can't stand those who cover 
their whole face with a tablet.

88
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,166
[laughing] Last night I was searching 
for places to go on New Years.

89
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,416
Guess what I found?

90
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,916
This is it! 
The amazing bridge of the River Kwai!

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,500
Since when is that old bridge exciting?

92
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,583
We have been going there
since we were three.

93
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,458
If you see the bridge of the Thames,

94
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,541
won't you be in shock, Frizzy?

95
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,666
Um, yeah.

96
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,166
As if she cares.

97
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,833
No, nothing important.

98
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,666
I just want to say,

99
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,666
if a cow is not moving...

100
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,458
If a cow is not moving,

101
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,291
-then it's moo-ing.
-[mouthing]

102
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,000
Lame joke again.

103
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,833
How dare you pull this donkey joke?

104
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,958
It's not a donkey, but a cow!

105
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,541
Mooooooo.

106
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,000
Mooooooo.

107
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,250
Isn't that cute? [laughs]

[indistinct chatter on car radio]

All right, all right.

00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,208
You're going to work now?

111
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,416
Okay, stay focused. See you later.

112

Bye-bye.

113
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,916
Nop wants to see me this evening.
He has something he wants to talk about.

114
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,125
Or...

115
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,041
He might have a surprise for me!

116
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,041
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,041
I really hate your acting, frizzy head.

118
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,458
Isn't he cute?

119
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,500
Yeah, but he's never asked you 
to be his girlfriend.

120
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,666
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,125
What did you say sorry for?

122
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,916
They've known each other 
since they were three.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,916
Almost 30 now, and still just friends.

When will you guys become a couple?

[woman on radio] Traffic on Rama1 
in front of Siam Square.

126
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,208
One lane is blocked 
due to the construction.

127
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,208
One should take other ways 
instead of Henri Dunant Rd.

128
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,333
Let's do this. 
I'll pull over so you guys can get out.

129

Come on, we're almost there.

130
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,875
No, I'll make a U-turn.

131
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,666
It's just a little further.

132
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,791
I said I won't.
I need to refill my gas.

133

Refill your gas?

hadn't you just come out of the station?

Yes! Yes! Yes!

-Pii.
-Hmm?

179
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,791
This headphone needs to be checked.

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,583
-Wow, the color.
-See what's wrong.

181
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:58,958
Excuse me.

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,875
Yes?

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,125
Do you have selfie sticks?

184
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,416
Selfie stick, yes. Here, the latest model.

185
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,458
Here, this one.

186
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,041
I give you the best price, 350 baht.

187
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,416
Try this.

188
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,625
Like it?

189
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,625
Have a longer one?

190
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,041
Longer? You've come to the right place.

191
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,791
I told you the latest model, right?

192
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,916
Here it is, longer.

193
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,250
Look.

194
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,500
Is it better?

195
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,208
Any longer than this?

196
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,500
-Longer than this?
-Yes.

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,041
That would be a fishing pole.

198
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,666
It might work.

00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,750
-How is it?
-[Muay Lek] You guys.

Peak called
a midday meeting, it's important.

202
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,000
We're in economic recession,

203
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,166
the shop owner told me

204
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,583
that they have to reduce the costs.

205
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,041
So one of us

206
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,208
will have to get laid off.

I don't want to.

209
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:09,916
But it's necessary.

210
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,875
I chose the most reasonable solution.

211
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,500
Based on performance?

212
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,958
Based on a lucky draw.

213
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,916
Are you kidding?

214
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,583
I always mean what I say.

215
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,083
Okay.

216
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,416
All of our names are in the bowl.

217
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,833
But not your name?

218
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,208
Yes.

219
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,916
Three pieces.

220
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,541
I'll begin now.

221
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,291
[exhales]

222
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:58,583
Uh, let's take this one I have
in my hand

223
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,666
as the game changer.

224
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,500
Hold this please.

225
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,083
Pii Suk.

226
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,583
If you chose the other one,
it might not be Pii's name.

227
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,750
It could actually be your name
because there are three pieces.

228
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,666
Muay, pick it up.
Take a look and see who it is.

229
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,875
Open it, read it out loud.

230
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,000
Kiattisak.

231
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,791
That's it. Gotcha!

232
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,291
Whose name is that?

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,083
It's mine.

234
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,666
Isn't it Prajuab?

235
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,125
The fortune-teller told me 
to change it two days ago.

236
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,041
He said it would bring me a goddamn luck.

237
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,041
Yeah, it's goddamn but there is no luck.

238
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,583
What now? Should we try again?

239
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:15,916
No.

240
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,791
So what now?

241
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,916
Let's leave it this way.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,750
It's my name that was called first.

243
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,458
Are you sure?

244
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,083
Yes, I am.

245
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,583
I think if it was Golf's name,

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,166
he would do the same.

247
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,416
No, I wouldn't.

248
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,916
Oh, did I say that out loud?

249
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,000
Muay Lek.

250
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,125
I don't feel well.

251
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,416
I have butterflies in my stomach.

252
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,625
I can't think straight, I feel like shit.

253
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,166
You feel like a bastard.

254
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,833
Oh, you're so blunt.

255
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,458
18,250.

256
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,416
What?

257
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,416
We die at 80 on average.

258
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,666
If I retire at 60,
I will have 20 years of free time.

259
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,625
Which means...

260
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,708
7,300 days.

261
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
But if I retire today,

262
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,708
that means I would have
18,250 days of free time.

263
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,500
Look! It's the silver lining!

264
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
What a happy thought.

265
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,541
It's a crazy thought.

266
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,333
You think you're an optimist.

267
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,875
But you're just comforting yourself.

268
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,958
[sighs]

269
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:49,708
Right.

270
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,708
I'm comforting myself.

271
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,250
But if it keeps me smiling,

272
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,375
what's wrong with it?

273
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,041
I'm okay, I really am.

274
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,875
It's fine, I'm happy.

275
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,125
It's good.

276
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,583
Even though I'm unemployed,
I still have both of you

277
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,083
and Nop.

278

[sighs happily]

00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,750
Really?

280
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:26,916
Yes.

281
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,333
Since when?

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,416
Three days ago.

283
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,875
How did you meet her?

284
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,208
Just by shaking BeeTalk.

285
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,666
BeeTalk?

286
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,500
[mouthing]

287
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,000
The first time I shook for a friend, 
I got her,

288
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,375
and the second shake was her.

289
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:46,916
I thought it was a fluke.

290
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,625
And the third was still her.

291
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,375
It's just spot on.

292
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,958
Yeah, so freaky spot on.

293
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:01,833
When I heard "thud, thud, thud"
in your room last night,

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,416
you weren't chopping pork then?

295
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,375
I don't have pork,

I think you're not...

307
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,583
I'll never think of you that way.

308
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,125
I like people for what's inside.

309
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,875
I have a good heart, 
if you're talking about inside.

310
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,208
I mean inside the clothes.

I don't know what you mean.

He meant the boobs!

Hey, girl, are those boobs or a 3D movie?

Those are really poking our eyes.

Two, three, maybe four more times?

318

Pii, that's enough.

You're too persistent.

Don't you see that 
Nop is talking to my friend?

324

When people are talking, 
you shouldn't interrupt.

00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,750
Pii.

338
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,083
Golf!

339
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
Does she have any insurance?

340
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,416
Yes, here.

341
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,000
One moment.

342
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,791
I've just checked.

343
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,416
She is insured with Thai Life Insurance.

344
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:23,708
We will contact your insurance,
so you don't need to pay the advance.

345
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,750
-That's great.
-Yes.

346
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,708
Thank you.

347
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,541
Kiattisak.

348
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,958
You were hit by a car and 
crashed your head into a bin.

349
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,583
I have good news and bad news.

350
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,875
The good news is

351
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,333
your brain and body scan results 
look fine.

352
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,666
But the bad news is,

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,458
you have an acute cardiac arrhythmia.

354
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,000
You might only have one month.

355
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,375
[crying] Pii!

356
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,291
No,

357
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,708
it's not you.

358
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,333
You.

359
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,333
Huh?

360
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,083
Pii.

361
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,125
[doctor] You have had this 
since you were born.

362
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,083
But the symptoms have just appeared

363
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,250
because you are probably feeling
stressed out

364
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,250
and it affects your heart condition.

365
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,208
There is no treatment for it.

366
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,333
If you go to other doctors,

367
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
they will all have the same diagnosis.

368
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,333
I'm sorry that I have to tell you this.

369
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:19,041
But you should make your time worthwhile.

370
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,375
Pii.

371
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,166
We're worried about you.

372
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,958
Don't worry.

373
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,500
How could we not? 
You're always like this.

374
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,000
Like this? How?

375
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,833
It's good.

376
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,166
I don't have to rush to work.

377
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,166
I don’t have to daydream

378
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,291
about being with Nop.

379
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,791
Although having 
a good boyfriend is my dream.

380
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,666
Stopping dreaming is good.

381
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,166
At least I won't be too tired.

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,541
And next month...

383
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,000
I won't wake up to see 
friends like you two.

384
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,166
I barely have any relatives.

385
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,583
My parents have passed away.

386
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,666
What else is left to worry about?

387
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,375
[inhales softly]

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,291
I can just die tomorrow.

389
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,541
I'm happy. It's bliss.

390
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,750
[exhales sharply]

391
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:50,000
If I see her sadness, I cry.

392
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,791
Are you gonna leave her there?

393
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:54,625
You're right.

394
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,833
Hang in there, you still have friends.

395
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,791
Pii!

396
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:04,916
She's smiling.

397
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:17,791
Hello.

398
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:22,291
I take photos and make videos, 
mostly at events:

399
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:26,541
weddings, graduations, 
ordination ceremonies.

400
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,750
Anywhere they pay me, I'm willing to go.

401
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,458
But what you're about to see

402
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,041
is what I least want to do.

403
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,791
It's the video of the house owner,

404
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,708
and she is dying.

405
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,125
[speaking French]

406
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,291
Hello.

407
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,500
My name is Barbara.

408
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,666
The doctor told me 
I have last stage heart condition.

409
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,500
[man] She asked me to record 
all her memories for her son

410
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,500
before she leaves this world.

411
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,333
[in French] I will do anything I want.

412
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,791
Mom, here's the medicine.

413
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,833
[man] Barbara.

414
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,083
Help, help.

415
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,791
Mom, Mom.

416
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,250
I know you will eventually leave.

417
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,166
But I want you to live on

418
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,000
even for one more day.

419
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,208
[man] Barbara, what are you looking for?

420
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,416
[in French] I'm looking for these.

421
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,625
This pair of shoes.

422
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,291
[chiming]

[clock chiming]

424
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:13,875
I think there must be 
a complicated scientific reason

425
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:15,958
or it could simply be

426
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,375
that God hasn't come to take her away yet.

427
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,458
Or it could be no reason at all.

428
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:27,833
She just wants to wear her old shoes
and dance every midday.

429
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,000
And that allowed her to live a long time,
so much longer than the doctor said.

430
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,291
Sometimes,

431
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,625
life gives you the opportunity
to do what you want.

432
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,500
That's all.

433
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,083
-Hey, Golf.
-What?

434
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,416
-It's almost midday.
-Tell me about it.

435
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,250
I don't know what dance moves 
to do. Help me out.

436
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,458
I don't know, I don't like this idea.

437
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,250
Muay Lek, help me think.

438
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:08,625
You can do whatever. Just improvise.

439
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,291
Improvise, huh?

440
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,833
Uh...

441
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:16,958
Pii.

442
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,666
We are in McDonald's.

443
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,541
[softly] Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

444
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:24,791
Gentle?

445
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,583
Right next to you.

446
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,500
Just wait and see.

447
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,875
She can never make it gentle.

448
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,875
See? A lucky touch before she starts.

449
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,750
There, the little bird flaps.

450
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,416
[inaudible]

451
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,041
Look at those Chinese ghost's long arms.

452
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,125
Gosh, I almost had a heart attack.

453
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,750
[Pii exclaiming happily]

454
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,208
Sweetie,

455
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,125
if you want to go full-on like this,

456
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,375
why don't you do the cover dance?

457
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:20,125
Cover dance? That's a good idea.

458
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,666
All three of us, awesome!

459
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,750
Cover, cover, cover, cover.

460
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,500
Let's do that, Golf. I'd love that.

461
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,833
Come on, Golf.

462
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,833
-Let's dance.
-[mouthing]

463
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:29,750
Golf.

464
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,500
I can't think of a dance routine.

465
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,416
Hmm.

466
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:42,041
[in English] I have no idea, honey.

467
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,916
[in Thai] Why don't you let Pii
dance like your morning routines?

468
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,125
You saw it?

469
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,583
Yes.

470
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,125
T26 is a visionary dance 
of our daily routines

471
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,000
that mixes the moves with cha-cha.

472
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:08,041
It's joyful, energetic, and imaginative.

473
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:13,458
More importantly, 
it's way better than T25.

474
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,500
Wow.

475
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,583
How so?

476
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:18,875
Well, how long do you dance T25?

477
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,500
Twenty-five minutes, right?

478
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,416
And?

479
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:24,000
But the T26 that I invented,

480
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:28,916
you will only need 26 seconds.

481
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,500
My T26

482
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,916
will stimulate your seven chakras

483
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,333
to be energetic and full of joy.

484
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,125
Your diabetes will be better.

485
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,916
Your rash will be gone.

486
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,125
Your kidney will be clean.
Your rosy complexion will return.

487
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,583
Your face will be firm, 
firm, firm, firm, firm.

488
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:52,458
Your brain will be speedy fast.

489
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:53,416
Wanna try?

490
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,791
Yes!

491
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,583
Let's try it now!

492
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:01,541
When comes to Pii Suk,
she never lets me down, not even once!

493
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,500
I like it.

494
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:05,000
If you do, get in position!

Here.

00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,583

-Me too?
-Yes, you too.

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Are you ready?

00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,666
Over here.

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,041
Are you ready?

Our imaginative T26 today is derived from

505
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,083
the road bike cycling position.

506
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,083
Road bike.

507
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,708
Are you ready?

508
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,291
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

509
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,375
Ready? Ready?

510
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,291
Yeah, ready.

511
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,583
Road bike, in position.

512
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,000
Start cycling.

513
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,375
Wow.

514
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,291
Faster.

515
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,291
Faster.

516
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,375
Faster.

517
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,375
Wow.

518
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,333
Faster.

519
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,500
Faster.

520
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,333
Faster.

521
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,583
Faster.

522
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,250
Faster.

523
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:03,666
Pii Suk.

524
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:04,875
Enough.

525
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,083
What you just did,

526
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:10,875
it went way further 
than the T26 that I invented.

527
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,541
But it was so much fun. It's great.

528
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,708
Really?

529
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,625
When you dance, 
how is your heart condition?

530
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,250
I am okay. Everything is great.

531
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,916
It's brilliant, guys.

532
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,333
Golf, you're so good.

533
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:32,541
Muay Lek, talking about all my skills,

534
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:36,291
what you just saw is only a little,

535
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,625
tiny bit.

536
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,708
That's all.

537
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,833
Why are you pointing your leg?

538
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,833
I've got a leg cramp.

539
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,791
Hello, please come to Siam Fitness. 
Let's work out.

Right.

547

With also high levels of 
stress and diseases.

548
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:18,000
So you should take 
good care of yourself.

no diseases, no illness 
and no extra pounds.

00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,291
Yeah, that's right.

552
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,500
Don't look at me, Muay Lek. I'm not fat, 
I just have a very low waistline.

553
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:32,541

Thirteen.

573
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
If now's not convenient, 
I'll come by later.

574
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,208
We are, but please wait until after this.

[music playing]

586
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,708
[Pii] How's that?

587
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,375
That feels better.

588
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,208
Hey, where were we?

589
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,500
That's all right, I'll go now.

590
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,083
[Pii] Oh?

591
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,333
For today's T26,

592
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,500
it's an easy move that you all
have experienced in buying jeans 

593
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:02,083
from Platinum mall and
find that they are too small.

594
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,416
It's putting on skinny jeans move.

595
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,750
Put on.

596
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,833
Put on.

597
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:08,958
Pull them up, pull them up.

598
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:09,916
Bounce.

599
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,041
And take off.

600
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,666
Right off, left off.

601
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,791
Oops, stuck, shake it off.

602
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,875
Shake it off.

603
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,083
Stuck at your foot, kick it off.

604
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,041
Kick off.

605
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,125
It's gone now.

606
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,208
Pose.

607
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,583
Good work, everybody.
Great, now you feel better about yourself?

608
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,083
Do you feel good? You've done well.

Pii.

Are you the offspring of Cinderella?

T26.

612
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:40,458
For today's T26...

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,833
Pii, will you behave? I'm serious.

614

T26.

615
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,958
For today's T26,

616
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:51,750
Golfy invented these moves for
my very own dear friend

617
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:55,000
who has a heart condition.
And for those who think that

618
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:58,291
you easily get tired even if you haven't
done much or can't catch your breath.

619
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,583
We'll begin with massaging our heart.

620
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,500

Start over.

00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:30,000

so sentimental?

We work at the same advertising company.
We're partners of this place.

The thing is, 

676
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,208
Bob and Barbara are not mother and son.

677
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,750
Then what are they?

I'm his wife.

I'm her husband.

about dancing

It's not real.

No.

694
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,458
You can say you made that video 
just for a laugh,

695
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,458
you can be careless and selfish, 
you can say anything.

696
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,000
But don't say it's not real.

697
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,500
Or is it our fault?

698
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:57,000
That guy probably just made it 
for a laugh like your T26.

Unfortunately, we believed it.

from four to 28?

I have checked the IP address.

00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:26,166
There is one account that has been
watching the clip every day.

00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:26,666
That's irrelevant.

840
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,666
Then someone wanted to take over
our coffee shop, but I didn't sell it.

841
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,416
So what?

842
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:35,916
He then took over my girlfriend.

843
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,875
Hey.

844
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,166
That's so wrong.

845
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,708
Love is about heart, not about money.

846
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,958
[sighs in exasperation]

847
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:50,833
But it's okay. Whatever happens, 
I'll be by your side.

848
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,375
[laughing]

849
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,916
[all laughing]

850
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,791
Your skill level is so low.

851
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,666
[squeals happily]

852
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,958
[exclaims]

853
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,583
Eight scoops for two people.
Blended together. Let's drink.

854
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,166
[laughing]

855
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,333
You will get the three of us
on a screen this big?

856
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:07,375
Yes. But I can't ask my friend for 
too long, or he will get fired.

857
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,875
Come on. This makes me happy enough.

858
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:10,791
Let's go.

859
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,333
Action!

860
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,125
Three, four.

861
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,375
[heart beating]

862
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,166
Someone is here for me.

863
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,416
It feels great.

864
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:11,833
[sighs]

865
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,000
You still watch this clip?

866
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,500
It's not real.

867
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:43,125
Girls with fake boobs...
Why do guys like looking at them?

868
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,791
It's not the same.

869
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:48,375
What's the difference? It's the same.

870
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:51,000
At the end of the day, 
it's about our beliefs.

871
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:54,166
If we believe, 
we won't care if it's real or not.

872
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:55,875
Right?

873
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:04,333
Why did you make that video?

874
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,000
Do I have to tell you?

875
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:13,541
It's just for fun, right? 
You didn't mean to be serious.

876
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:17,750
You think life is funny? 
That's not right, you know?

877
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,541
You should think of other people,
it should be logical.

878
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,250
-My mom died.
-You should be reasonable... What?

879
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:31,375
She had cancer.

880
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:40,000
Most people say if we'd had faith in 
the higher spirits, she'd have survived.

881
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,958
I went to almost every temple,

882
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,583
made offerings at places I went.

883
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:50,833
But in the end,

884
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,541
she didn't make it.

885
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,458
Mmm.

886
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:05,166
So you made the video out of
sarcasm to fool people.

887
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,583
Such a bastard.

888
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:15,583
Not really.

889
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:19,750
To admit that you're a bastard,
that is not a bastard.

890
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,041
Pii.

891
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,500
He is gone.

892
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,708
[Muay Lek] Is it a good idea 
to bring her out to drink?

893
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,541
She looks so miserable.

894
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:26,625
Just watch my sorcerous power. I'll make 
her stop being miserable in three seconds.

895
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:27,541
Start.

896
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,000
So we're lovers now?

897
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:40,625
Golf.

898
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,291
Did you see my power?

899
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,208
Look.

900
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,375
Kinky hair,
being sad is not your style.

901
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,250
Let me tell you this, 
if I could die for you, I would.

902
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:59,958
Hmm. That doesn't sound convincing.

903
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,166
When did you ever do anything 
for anyone? Fat ass.

904
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,166
Well, 

905
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,166
let's do this.

906
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:09,041
Right here, right now,
what do you want me to do? Tell me.

907
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,125
I'll do it for you.

908
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,208
Really?

909
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,750
Yeah, I swear on my ancestor's name.

910
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,541
Will you chat up a girl, 
then hug her for me?

911
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:21,833
That's absurd.

912
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,750
It's easier to ask me to join the army.

913
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,750
Bleh!

914
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,916
Fine, okay.

915
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,291
Pick one, fine.

916
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:36,291
Which one do you want me to chat up?
Pick one now.

917
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:41,291
But only on one condition,
if I do this for you, you don't die.

918
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,833
-It's a deal.
-Very good.

919
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:56,500
At six o'clock.

920
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,333
Hello, we have a promotion today.
Are you interested?

921
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,291
Yes, what's the offer?

922
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,458
-We have--
-Hey, it's okay.

923
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,375
I will just take everything.

924
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:16,916
I have been very stressed. 
I just want to get drunk.

925
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,791
What are you stressed about?

926
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:24,208
You don't want to hear this.
It's kind of boring.

927
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:29,916
If you want to let it out, 
I'm willing to hear.

928
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:39,375
But will you be able to do it? 
You're working.

929
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,500
Of course. I'm almost finished.

930
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,708
-I'll take all the promotion offers.
-All right.

931
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,833
You're very drunk.

932
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:04,708
I'm drunk, you're stressed. 
I think we're even.

933
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:07,708
[bed squeaks]

934
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:14,958
-Darling.
-Yes.

935
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,083
[woman] You're cute.

936
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:20,416
-[Golf] Thank you
-[woman] You took me home.

937
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,000
So I'll give you a reward.

938
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:25,916
Yeah.

939
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,958
What do you want?

940
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,125
Just give me a hug.

941
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:31,708
Yes.

942
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,083
Let's hug.

943
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,541
I'm hugging you now.

944
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,458
Hey, look. I have something to show you.

945
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,416
-Isn't that pretty?
-Yes, very much.

946
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,958
Look, I work at night, right?

947
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:55,125
And I go to belly dance class during 
the day. Belly dance, you know?

948
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,041
Yes.

949
01:02:56,291 --> 01:03:01,541
My dance teacher said that 
I was born for this.

950
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:03,916
-Look here.
-Yes.

951
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,875
Come here.

952
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,083
Have a seat.

953
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,000
Look at me dancing.

954
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:14,375
Oh.

955
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,458
[laughs uncomfortably]

956
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:39,000
I think that'd be all for now.

957
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:40,375
Sure.

958
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:41,291
Yes.

959
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,833
Can we hug now?

960
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,458
Yes, darling.

961
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:47,541
Okay.

962
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,791
Let's hug.

963
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,833
Darling.

964
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:50,750
Yes.

965
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,833
Will you kiss me?

966
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,791
Let's hug first...

967
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,791
Please kiss me.

968
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,708
Kiss me.

969
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:12,583
I'm a bit sweaty.
Let me clean myself. Just a jiffy.

970
01:04:19,458 --> 01:04:21,666
Pii.

971
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,416
What now?

972
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,083
Kiss her, kiss her, kiss her.

973
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:29,833
Kiss my ass. My lips will be rotten.

974
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,875
-We have a problem.
-What?

975
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:33,000
What's going on?

976
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,750
My boyfriend is here.

977
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:35,833
Your boyfriend?

978
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,000
What?

979
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,958
What now?

980
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,291
Are you gay?

981
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,708
Yes, I'm gay. How?

982
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,041
I don't believe it.

983
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:47,916
Yeah, bitch. 
My parents don't believe it either.

984
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,833
Really?

985
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:53,083
Will you stop asking questions? My heart 
skips a beat now. Let's find a way out.

986
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:57,541
Who are you?

987
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:00,375
I'm...

988
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:04,875
So I'm not home and 
you bring another guy in?

989
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,666
Please listen to me.

990
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,625
The thing is I...
I'm not a real man. I'm transgender.

991
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,208
-You had an operation?
-I did.

992
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:21,833
I told you already
how much I hate transgender.

993
01:05:22,666 --> 01:05:27,125
It's okay when you bring men in,
but a transgender, I'll kill him.

994
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,666
I'm not transgender.

995
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:31,666
I'm a man.

996
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:34,916
What the hell?

997
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,708
I'm sorry that I pretended
to be transgender.

998
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,708
It's gone a bit too far.

999
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,916
Can you look more understanding?

1000
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,000
Well?

1001
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,541
It's...

1002
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,458
I didn’t know she had a boyfriend.

1003
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:03,583
Well, if I did, 
I wouldn't have gotten involved with her.

1004
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,500
But I haven't slept with her yet.

1005
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:11,083
You don't have to be angry at her.
You can be angry at me. But I'm sorry.

1006
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,833
My principle is, 
if I'm wrong, I apologize.

1007
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,333
If I'm mean, I'm sorry.

1008
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,750
But right now,

1009
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:20,833
I think all of us
understand one another.

1010
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,333
I think I should leave.

1011
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,250
Wait.

1012
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,958
Can I talk to you a bit more?

1013
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,291
Sure, bring it on. 
I have a lot of free time.

1014
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,666
[laughing]

1015
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,375
What are you laughing at?

1016
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:48,125
I had to pretend to be manly for seven 
hours. My gayhood is hurt, you know?

1017
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,458
I am very good friends with him now.

1018
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:52,375
I even know his parents' names.

1019
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,875
He asked me to join his Harley club.

1020
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:55,791
-Bitch.
-Aw.

1021
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:02,291
Hey. I was almost dead 
because of you, Pii.

1022
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,500
Aw...

1023
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,333
Thank you.

1024
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:12,625
But you didn't get to hug her.

1025
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,500
So I can die, right?

1026
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,000
Really, Pii?

1027
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,166
I’m kidding, come on.

1028
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:23,708
You can go now. 
Take a shower then go to work.

1029
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,625
Yeah.

1030
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm drunk and sleepy
and you dragged me out to tell the story.

1031
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,750
Muay Lek, let's go.

1032
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,458
Are you whining?

1033
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:49,041
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

1034
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:53,208
-I don't know what I was thinking.
-You slept with her already.

1035
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,166
I've tried to find the reason why.

1036
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:57,208
You like sleeping with her.

1037
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,333
I know she might look a bit off.

1038
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:05,791
But I want her to live.

1039
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,375
So you can keep sleeping with her.

1040
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:10,250
She is a good person.

1041
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,750
But you've definitely slept with her.

1042
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,041
[Barbara] We're being serious here.

1043
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:18,250
Will you stop being an asshole?

1044
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,416
But I'm certain,

1045
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:27,416
I don't want her to die.

1046
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,750
-What?
-Just look.

1047

1048
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,416
Hello.

1049
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:35,208
Our company is currently trying to target 
clients who live in apartments.

1050
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:38,416
So we have an offer 
to our clients which...

[man panting]

1053
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,000
Hello.

1054
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:49,125
Many people call this place
Nature's Window.

1055
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,750
I have an acute cardiac arrhythmia.

1056
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:57,125
The doctor told me that it couldn't 
be cured and I would die in three months.

1057
01:09:57,541 --> 01:10:00,875
I traveled around, 
beating the time I have left.

1058
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,333
Eventually, I found this place.

1059
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:07,458
Gozo island, one of the islands in Malta.

1060
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:13,333
It's where people say that the air is 
pure and the best in the world.

1061
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:14,958
Isn't that crazy?

1062
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:19,541
The doctor told me 
I only had three months to live.

1063
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,708
But I have lived much longer than that.

1064
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:25,791
The condition is still there 
but I'm still alive.

1065
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:30,916
If you ever make it here,
you might see a man standing right here.

1066
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:32,500
It's me.

1067
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,208
That's me.

1068
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,416
Bob found it and he showed it to me.

1069
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,666
I don't know if it's real.

1070
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:50,125
There is only one viewer.

1071
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:51,916
Less than mine.

1072
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:58,625
He could just be a bastard who wanted 
to make this video to fool people.

1073
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,000
But I wanted you to watch it.

1074
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,708
Maybe it's worth a try.

1075
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,625
Well, it doesn't look very convincing.

1076
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,750
How could it be possible?
Just take fresh air every morning.

1077
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:19,083
-But it might--
-Let's go.

1078
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,333
I'll go. 

1079
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:24,875
Wait.

1080
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:31,083
I want you to think thoroughly.
And you believe this video clip?

1081
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,958
I don’t believe in the video clip.

1082
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,708
I believe in you.

1083
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:41,875
I believe in you since you came back.

1084

[Pii sighs]

1085
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,083
[Muay Lek] Seriously,

1086
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:04,666
you're going because you want to be cured
or you really love this guy?

1087
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:09,416
Well,

1088
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,916
a bit of both.

1089

[Golf groans softly]

1090
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,208
Will it be more for the latter?

1091
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,708
What if I say yes, will you be mad at me?

1092
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:21,625
[Golf] Yes.

1093
01:12:22,625 --> 01:12:25,125
I'm not mad because of your stupid reason.

1094
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,041
But I'm mad at you, kinky head.

1095
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:33,333
You believed that clip of Barbara, bitch.
That was stupid enough.

1096
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:37,416
Now you believe in that old man in Malta.

1097
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,833
Seriously, I've just heard 
the name of this country.

1098
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,583
What are you smiling at?

1099
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:46,708
And that old man, does he really exist? 
You never figured it out.

1100
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,125
You were stupid once, I understand.

1101
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:53,916
But twice or more, it's getting annoying.

1102
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:58,125
So when you're stupid,
you'll find the truth at the end.

1103
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,958
Then when you find the truth,
you'll be hurt.

1104
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:05,250
How many more times will you be 
both stupid and hurt, kinky head?

Golf. I know you're mad at me.

1106
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,083
But I know that you always 
support me, right?

[Golf groans]

1108

Don't think that you know me.

Are you sure you know him well?

1110
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,083
Does he love you the way you love him?

1111

You're making an effort to go with him, 
have you ever asked him?

1112

Well...

Hmm.

Anyway, Uncle, the hole over there,
do they call it Nature's Window?

Yes.

go shout out the name there.

01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:41,041
Boriboon, damn.

1164
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,666
Mmm.

1165
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,500
You don't know each other's name?

1166
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,875
And you came together.

1167
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:53,708
Mmm.

01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,333

Hey.

1172
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:20,333
You should shout out my name, too.
So we can be a couple.

1173
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,541
We already are.

[Pii] To Golfy, the fatso, I sent you 
many emails and you haven't replied yet.

1175
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,791
I sent you a photo, are we good?
It's very beautiful here.

1176
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,250
Quit being mad at me, fatty.

1177
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:55,625
You told me you're mad at her. But you're
looking at her email. Miss her, huh?

1178
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:59,125
What email? I am watching the T26
that I've just uploaded.

1179
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:02,208
I have a new move.
I'll go home and write it down.

1180
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:10,208
This is a small city.
There are not many places to go.

1181
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,791
But it's beautiful.

1182
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:15,208
I never get bored of coming out every day.

1183
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:16,875
That's true.

1184
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:21,291
Stay here a while,
don't get bored so soon.

1185
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,333
Yes. I will stay a long time.

1186
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,791
Let's find something to eat.

-No, it's not mine.

1189
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:39,750
It's mine.

1190
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,291
I see.

1191
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,750
I set it for dancing.

1192
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:48,666
-Dancing for what?
-I watched some video clip.

Yes.

-Yes.

-And you believe it?
-Not only do I believe it, I love it.

He looks like you. But he can't be you.

1200
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,625
Do you have more questions?

-I don't think so.
-I'll excuse myself.

1202
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:22,583
Today's T26
is something we can improvise on the road.

1203
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,583
First, flag down a taxi.

1204
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:29,500
Lean and look out for a taxi. When we see 
one, we flag down, flag down, flag down.

1205
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:32,125
First one is done. Second one is easier.

Butt lift.

Side kick.

1209
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,583
Here we are.

The third one, phone in one hand.

1211

Flag down, flag down, flag down.

1212
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:45,000
While waiting for a taxi,
we play with our phone.

1213
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,000
Flag down, flag down, flag down.

1214
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:48,041
Play with the phone.

1215
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:51,208
Looking out, flag down, 
flag down, flag down.

1216
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,666
Good work, guys.

1217
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:53,708
Come here.

1218
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,125
Okay, keep going.

1219
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,500
What?

1220
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:59,000
Pii sent me an email from Malta.

1221
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,750
Why are you telling me?

1222
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,625
Pii asked us to meet her there.

1223
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:03,625
I'm busy.

1224
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:07,041
Hey, she bought me the ticket.

1225
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,166
I don't care.

1226
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:09,791
She bought it for you, too.

I am not going...

What is that?

01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:18,541
See?

1230
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:21,333
Finally, she's trying to make up with me.

1231
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,000
It's me we're talking about.

1232
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,375
But I won't make up with her that easily.

1233
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:28,000
She might have to wait longer.

1234
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,000
That'd be all.

You see a taxi. Look out.

01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,708
Flag down, flag down, 
flag down, very good.

1239
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,791
Should I get my hair permed?

1240
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:49,208
You better straighten it out.
If you made it more kinky,

1241
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,625
it would be my armpit hair.

1242
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:56,083
You never told me about your boyfriend.
What does he do?

1243
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,750
He is a firefighter.

01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,625
Wow...

01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,791
You've never introduced him to us.

We had not made it two months yet.
He got killed in a fire.

Shut your mouth, bitch.

As for me, it's not fat,

1251
01:23:12,416 --> 01:23:13,875
I just have a low waistline.
