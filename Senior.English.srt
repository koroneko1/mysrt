[narrator] Bhannawadee Mansion

3
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,320
was originally the residence of 
Princess Bhannawadee Rasmee.

4
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,560
She was murdered by her gardener,
53 years ago.

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,200
The building was inherited 
by her descendants

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,920
and later sold to a series of owners.

7
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,000
Finally, it was turned into 
St. Maria Convent.

8
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,520
It remains so to this day...

Stop screaming!

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
You'll get us into trouble!

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,759
I won't tell you another story again!

Shit. It's Ma Soeur.

25
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,159
[Ma Soeur Audrey] Who was that?

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
Piangfah?

27
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,080
Oh, the new girl, Ma Soeur.
Her name's Mon.

28
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,120
Mademoiselle Adhiti! Anything to say?

29
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,680
It wasn't me.

30
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,159
It's you!
The whole room heard it was you, right?

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,439
[all] Yes, it's her! Mon was screaming.

[all clamoring]

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
I didn't do it.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,840
I didn't do it.

Come in.

[Ma Mere Hannah] She doesn't get better?

44
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,759
Meningitis? That's too bad.

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,680
I pray every day for a miracle,
but there's no miracle.

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,120
You have to understand.

47
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,879
I wouldn't have been so strict
in trivial matters,

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,480
if your aunt hadn't left you in my care
when she got sick.

49
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,439
So don't disappoint her.

50
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,079
Now go.

[Adhiti] No...

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,240
I said no...

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Why keep bothering me?

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
No...

58
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,680
Damn it. I said no!

59
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,480
Um...

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,279
I don't want fish.

61
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,040
Piangfah, here she comes.

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,759
Don't be pushy! Beat it!

63
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,519

[Ant] Mon.

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
Can I sit with you?

70
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Yuck! What're you eating?

71
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Mashed potatoes? So gross!

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,600
Oh. Shit, I have mashed potatoes too.

73
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,199
Bummer!

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,079
When I was a child,
my mother made this for me every morning.

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,680
I think my head has more mashed potatoes
than brains. [chuckles]

76
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,959
[laughing]

77
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,879
She thinks she's so pretty, huh.

78
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,959
Looking for dicks everywhere.

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
[Ant continues talking]

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
I heard gossips from her old school mates.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,720
They confirmed she's a real slut.

82
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,240
Her dad's super-rich, the bitch's spoiled.

83
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
She slept around with a lot of boys.

84
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,639
[all] Eeh!

85
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,519
When school's out,
I usually go to Disneyland.

86
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,199
Have you been?

87
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,120
Hollywood too.

88
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,800
No wonder she has no friends
and has to hang out with that freak.

89
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,480
The old guy with long white hair...
The one in "Harry Potter".

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
What's his name?

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,319
Oh! I remember now. Gandalf!

92
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,040
Yes, Gandalf!

93
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,480
Gandalf your ass!
That's "Lord of the Rings"!

[car door closes]

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,759
My name's Adhiti,

105
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,920
but everyone calls me Mon.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
From the day my parents died,
12 years ago,

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,919
I'd began to feel that 
death always hovered around me.

108
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,279
Silence has been my best friend since.

109
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,320
I knew it better than anyone else.

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,879
Silence has many levels.

111
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,960
The silence that lets 
you hear leaves ruffle,

112
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,960
or insects flutter their wings...

113
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
The ticking of the clock,

114
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,039
the beating of your heart.

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,879
-[steady breathing]
-[monitor beeps]

116
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,919
And...

117
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,519
the silence of your own thought.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,960
[door opens]

119
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,960
Hi, Mon, you're here.

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,000
[sighs]

121
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,879
No, I'm not.

122
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,480
I've got this for you, almond cookies.

123
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,360
I saw it freshly-baked this morning
after I finished my shift.

124
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,120
I remember you like almonds, so--

125
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,960
Excuse me, Doctor No.

126
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,039
I gotta pee.

127
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,320
[stutters]

128
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,360
[Adhiti] But the deepest silence...

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,759
is the silence so complete that
you can hear the spirit talking to you.

130
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,679
[sniffing]

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,399
You're here?

132
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,519
Keep following me, huh?

133
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
[Senior] I've come for your answer.

134
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,600
What answer?

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,440
I already said no.

136
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,639
I already said no.

137
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,559
[Senior] Please. Only you can help me.

138
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,600
You're such a pest!

139
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,360
[Senior] If you don't help me,
I'll keep following you.

140
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,159
Just go away!

141
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,759
Watch the crazy bitch catching a frog.

142
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,240
[Senior] Watch out! Step over! Back-heel!

143
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
[grunting]

144
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Is it that good?

145
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,360
You eat like a starving pig!

146
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,080
[Senior] Please, only you can help me.

147
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,519
Shut up and get lost!

148
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,200
THE NIGHT BEFORE

149
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,519
[keyboard keys clicking]

150
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,759
[sniffs]

151
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,159
Who're you? How did you get in here?

152
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
[Senior] I was a student here
a long time ago.

153
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,559
Bullshit! This is a convent school.

154
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,840
[Senior] Thirty years ago,
it was a male-only business college.

155
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Yep! I see.

156
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,759
What's your name?

157
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
[Senior] Just call me "Senior".

158
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,159
[Adhiti] Senior?

159
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,519
Fine.

160
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,679
What do you want, Senior?

161
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,039
I need your help.

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,559
[Adhiti] That was the first time 
I met the mysterious Senior.

163
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
I didn't know why he told me 
about the murder 

164
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,600
in Bhannawadee Building 50 years ago.

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,679
[Senior] The gardener was sentenced to
death for the crime he didn't commit.

166
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,840
His ghost keeps coming back
to demand justice.

167
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,679
If the real murderer is still out there,
he will keep haunting the place forever.

168
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,360
Even the dead want justice.

169
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,240
Why are the dead asking
the living to help?

170
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,200
I think ghosts know everything.

171
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,679
[Senior] No, only what's left of
their memories when they're alive.

172
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,440
Some of the memories are lost,

173
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,360
and sometimes we don't even remember
how we died.

174
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,919
[girls talking indistinctly]

175
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,879
[mockingly laugh]

176
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,080
"GRADE WHORE!"

177
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
[Ant sobbing]

178
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,080
[crying tearfully]

179
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,559
[sniffling]

180
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,679
Leave me alone, Mon.

181
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,799
I'm a slut.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm a bitch, a spoiled child.
I'd sleep with any men!

183
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
I'm a whore, a skank, a shameless hooker.

184
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,879
When you finish punishing yourself,
tell me.

185
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,879
Wait!

186
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,759
I've just finished.

187
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,279
[Adhiti] Here.

188
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,799
Keep it. I don't need it.

189
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
[blowing nose]

190
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,480
They call me a slut...

191
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,200
because I get close to Master Rati,

192
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,759
the new chemistry teacher.
You know him, right?

193
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,240
Yeah.

194
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,440
When I got good marks,

195
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,480
they spread a rumor
that I slept with the teacher.

196
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,159
What should I do?

197
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm going crazy!

198
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,879
Ant, your mom's dead, right?

199
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,799
How do you know?

200
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
Five years ago, she hung herself

201
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,240
to get back at my father
for having a mistress.

202
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,320
Then my dad married his lover
and they moved to the US.

203
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,879
[sighs]

204
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,960
Hey, can I ask you something?

205
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,039
Why's your nickname "Mon"?

206
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,840
When you were a baby,
you were round and cute like Doraemon?

207
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,799
I don't know.

208
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,639
My guess is Mon is from "Salmon".

209
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,919
You like salmon?

210
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
No, I don't eat fish.

211
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,840
Duh!

212
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,320
What about your "Ant"?
A short for "Giant"?

213
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,519
Yes, when I was a kid I was so big,

214
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,240
my mom called me Giant.

215
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,200
Growing up, I was so embarrassed
by the name.

216
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,000
So I shortened it to "Ant". Cute?

217
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,399
As hell.

218
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,679
[both laugh]

219
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,720
[music playing]

220
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,920
Honestly,
I have a huge crush on Master Rati.

221
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,920
I think he likes me too.

222
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,599
Let me show you something.

223
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
Ta-da!

224
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,079
He gave it to me on Valentine's Day.

225
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,720
Lovely, isn't it?

226
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,279
To be frank,
I have a bad feeling about him.

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,279
How can you say that about my boyfriend!

228
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,880
You're jealous, aren't you?

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,039
[dog howling]

230
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:13,519
Dumb dogs!
Why do they make that stupid noise?

231
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,839
Mon, they say dogs howl
because they see ghosts, true?

232
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,519
Ant, do you know
dogs have such shitty eyesight?

233
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,000
But they have a very good nose.

234
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,039
So dogs can't see ghosts.

235
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,640
They smell them.

236
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,839
How come you know so much about dogs?

237
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,759
Were you one in your past life? [laughs]

238
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,960
No. But I can smell ghosts too.

239
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,880
Don't kid me, I'm scared!

240
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,359
I don't. It's a secret
I've never told anyone before.

241
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,359
[brakes screeching]

242
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,440
When I was four, I survived the car crash
that killed my parents.

243
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,559
Since then, I can smell dead people.

244
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Just by sniffing at the things 
they touched.

245
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Right now,

246
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,079
I can smell your mother.

247
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,640
You're bullshitting me.

248
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,920
Lavender... cool but sad.

249
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,920
That's my mom's favorite perfume.
How do you know?

250
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,279
Don't fool around with that man.

251
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,839
Your mom asked me to tell you.

252
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,000
[speaking in French]

253
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,359
PRINCESS MURDERED IN THE POOL

254
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,400
[Senior in Thai] So you've agreed to help?

255
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,319
You just had to play hard to get.
"No! No! No!"

256
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,759
Crazy!

257
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,400
Who was that?

258
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,960
You always wanted to help me, admit it.

259
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,160
You know it so why did you ask?

260
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,640
Adhiti, you want to test me?

261
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,319
[chuckles]

262
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,839
So hot-headed!

263
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,279
If you were my sister,
I'd smack your head.

264
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,559
Go on! I dare you!

265
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,519
Mademoiselle Adhiti!

[Senior chuckles]

268
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,680
[Senior] So we're partners now, right?

269
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,240
Partners in what?

270
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,559
Detective partners.

271
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,240
To investigate the case,
I need an assistant.

272
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,279
So I'm your hands and feet?

273
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,079
Come on, I mean,
I'm from a different period.

274
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,160
I don't know
what's going on in this world.

275
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:43,839
Like that flip-flop TV you have,
I never saw it before.

276
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,839
Flip-flop TV? Duh!

277
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,720
It's a notebook computer!

278
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,279
Anyway,

279
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,680
aren't you afraid someone will see you
walking around like this?

280
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,240
You're talking to me now
and you don't see me.

281
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,880
Don't be paranoid.

282
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,279
Why are you so sure?

283
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,559
The people who can see me
are only those who're about to die.

284
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,920
[Adhiti] Once I'd decided to help Senior,
I started digging for information.

285
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,119
The murder took place at night.

286
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,920
Princess Bhannawadee was hit 
by a hard object at the back of her head.

287
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,839
The impact broke 
the back part of her skull.

288
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Her body fell into the pool.

289
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,079
The police found a blood-stained shovel,

290
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,920
which led to the arrest of the suspect,

291
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
Jit, the long-serving gardener.

292
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,039
They searched his house 
and found a stash of jewelry,

293
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,720
which belonged to the princess.

294
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,039
The court ruled that 
the defendant's argument didn't add up.

295
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,160
Jit was sentenced to death 
by firing squad.

296
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,480
-[gun firing]
-[Jit screaming]

297
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,920
I found out that there were three people
involved with the case.

298
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,319
First is the princess's doctor, Dr. Saner.

299
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,480
He was the one who
found her body in the pool.

300
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
He's still alive today.

301
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,519
The second is Mr. Praphan,
the lawyer who was in charge of her will.

302
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,599
He died five years ago.

303
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,920
The third one is Miss Woranart,
the princess's former secretary.

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,119
She was fired for embezzlement

305
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,359
and disappeared shortly before the murder.

306
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,559
Anyway, how did you get in here?

307
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,839
You just walked right through the wall,
like in ghost movies?

308
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,920
When I was a student,
there was no washroom here.

309
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,119
Just a balcony.

310
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,079
I don't get it. Tell me.

311
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,319
People believe spirits can
walk through walls, but that's not true.

312
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,160
We can touch only the things or places

313
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,240
that existed when we were still alive.

314
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,599
When you see a spirit walk through a wall,

315
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
that's because in the past, 
there was no wall there.

316
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,079
So the spirit could simply walk through.

317
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,559
But if there was a wall there 
and now it becomes a door,

318
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,319
the spirit can't go through it.

319
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,359
[thuds]

320
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,039
This is why I need your help,

321
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,119
get it now?

322
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,119
Now you're right here, aren't you?

323
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
You can smell me?

324
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,119
Yes.

325
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Don't you want to know how I look?

326
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,559
I do. I have a mental image of you.

327
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
What's it like?

328
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,440
Well... you're good-looking, tall,
and slightly pretentious.

329
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,519
Whoa, you can tell that much
from the smell?

330
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,319
Senior, do you think we can touch?

331
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
In theory, no.

332
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,119
Because when I was alive,
you didn't exist.

333
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
Is that so?

334
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,559
Follow me.

335
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
Where are we going?

336
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,160
[Senior] The pool where
the princess's body was found.

337
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,680
When I was a student here 30 years ago,
the pool was still there.

338
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,599
But it was a forbidden area to all.

339
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,599
When the place was turned into
a convent school,

340
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,279
they filled up the pool
and turned it into a cemetery.

341
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,160
Where you're standing now
is the edge of the pool.

342
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,279
It's about ten metres wide.

343
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,240
Where? Left or right?

344
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,880
[Senior] Left.

345
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,640

That's where the body was found.

00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,000
I smell blood.

00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,599
Unlikely.

361
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,359
In the case file,
there's no mention of any gun.

362
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,440
The murder weapon was a shovel,
hidden near the pool.

363
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,920
With blood on it.

364
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,359
Proved to match
the blood type of the victim.

365
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,039
There was no DNA test back then.

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,440
I had to dig into old hospital
registrations. My eyes almost popped out.

372
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,559
The filing was a mess,
everything was manually done back then.

373
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,680
Thank you, Dr. No.

374
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:14,000
Instead of a thank-you,
let me take you to dinner.

[Senior] You have to go in by yourself.

382

In my time, this place was a swamp.

Excuse me, are you Dr. Saner?

385
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,839
I'd like to ask you about
the murder of Princess Bhannawadee.

Damn it! How did you get in here?

What do you want?

390
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,880
I want to ask you about "Baby Daeng".

391
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
What?

392
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,319
[Dr. Saner] Baby Daeng was an orphan 

393
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,720
whose mother died in the hospital 
where I worked.

394
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,079
The princess...

395
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,559
took pity on her 
and adopted her as a niece.

396
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,000
When she was 12,

397
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,480
Baby Daeng ran away and disappeared.

398
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,960

You know Mr. Praphan, right?

That vile lawyer? Of course I know him!

401
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,799
I know him more than anyone else,

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,400
and I'll never forget him
till my last day.

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
Where did you learn about Baby Daeng?

411
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
In the case file.

412
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,559
When the murder happened,
she was just six.

413
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,519
Eyewitnesses testified that
she was sleeping in her room.

414
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,359
The name sounds familiar to me.
I must've heard it before.

415
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,720
Anyway, how did you get into his house?

416
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,799
Just walked right through walls,
like in ghost movies?

00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,119
it was a female spirit that's related to 
someone in the mansion.

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,960
So often that it stopped being unusual.
See that room?

438
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,079
I used to see the ghost
of a pregnant nurse

walking in there every night. [laughs]

440
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,240
Dr. Saner worked as an obstetrician here.

441
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,680
The ghost of a pregnant nurse could be
another piece in the puzzle.

442
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,039
Or maybe she's the mysterious
spirit that appears on the school wall.

443
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,400
But from our research,
no one fits the description.

The only possibility is Miss Woranart.

445
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,480
Right, I found that Mr. Praphan had a wife
called Wipa.

She's still alive.

Maybe we should go talk to her.

[Rati] HCG is a hormone that can be
found in some types of drugs.

00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,320
Mix it with urine and put a drop
in the home pregnancy test,

she can't fool me.

Ant, did you lie to me?

493
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,559
I... No! I didn't!

494
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,440
That's it... Don't talk to me ever again.

495
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,280
You're no longer my friend.

496
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,360
Come back! Mon! Don't leave me!

497
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,559
Mon!

-[thunder rumbles]

Mon... I need to talk to you...
[sniffles] Please talk to me...

500
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,239
[sobbing] Mon.

501
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,119
Mon.

[knocking at door]

508
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
I'd like to...

509
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,440
I...

510
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,800
uh...

511
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,119
Dr. Saner already told me everything.

512
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,679
He said he'll tell the truth
and expose what you did.

513
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,440
That son of a bitch is still alive?

514
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,480
What has he told you?

515
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,480
You want me to say it right here?

516
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,320
Come in.

517
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,639
Let me tell you.

518
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,119
My husband had nothing to do
with the princess's death.

519
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:18,599
Even though he was named
the executor of the will,

520
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,039
that asshole died penniless.
He left me nothing.

521
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,719
I actually had to pay off
the mortgage for this house.

522
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
I'll go upstairs to look around.
You keep talking to her.

523
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,800
[Wipa] What happened, happened a long
time ago. I don't want to dig it up.

524
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,000
[sniffing]

525
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,960
[Wipa grunts]

526
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:46,440
Now tell me,
what fiction did that quack tell you?

527
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:48,880
Wipa already told me everything.

528
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,199
[scoffs]

529
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,880
Don't listen to that drunken bitch.

530
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,079
She's no different from
her deceitful husband.

531
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Dumb woman, she didn't know
that he had been cheating on her.

532
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,440
Cheating on her?

533
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,599
Yes, with that secretary.

534
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,239
Actually, I suspected that

535
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,719
Praphan killed his lover, Woranart.

536
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,599
On the day Woranart disappeared...

537
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,239
I found her bracelet 
on the floor in the library.

538
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,039
Praphan looked so nervous that day.

539
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,199
I also noticed cement powder 
on his elbows and shirt sleeves.

540
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,480
[Wipa] Back then, everyone knew that

541
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,159
the princess took fancy of her doctor.

542
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,840
There was an issue of age and class,

543
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,000
so they couldn't get married.

544
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,800
She was a princess,
and that quack was a lowborn commoner.

545
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,519
The royals would never allow that.

546
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,880
So they secretly had an affair.

547
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,840
They were lovers...

548
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,480
Whatever you call it,
but it was "adultery" in my time.

549
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,719
One day, he took a baby girl
from the hospital.

550
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,960
Told the princess, she was an orphan
whose mother died in childbirth.

That's enough! I can't stand it anymore.

575

Get out!

576
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,360
Get out of here!

Get out!

579
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,320
[Senior] I found another will. It names
Dr. Saner the executor of the estate.

580
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,239
But it doesn't have
the princess's signature.

581
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,920
In the real will,
Praphan was the executor.

582
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,960
Now Praphan has become my prime suspect.

583
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,840
Why?

584
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,559
If Dr. Saner has told us the truth,

585
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,360
then Praphan must have been
such an evil man.

586
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,920
He killed his own lover.

587
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,679
What would stop him from
killing his boss to steal her wealth?

588
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,480
Senior... I have to go now.

589
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,480
Where're you going?

590
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
I have a date.

[Ant screaming]

00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,920
So you're gonna stare at me
'til we get the check?

594
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:40,679
What about that thing I asked you?

595
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,719
"That thing"?

596
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,559
Yes, I did some research.

597
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,079
Sodium thiopental is a type of barbiturate

598
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,599
that can cause
sudden loss of consciousness.

599
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,360
If used in modest amount,
it will make you feel heady,

600
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,440
and do whatever you're told.
Like being hypnotized.

601
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,480
Thank you so much for
having dinner with me.

602
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,719
Come to think of it,
we have a lot in common.

603
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,039
Your nickname, Mon,
must've come from the cartoon "Doraemon".

604
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,800
My name's Mano.
I used to wear thick glasses

605
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,519
so my friends called me "Nobita".

606
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:34,480
Doraemon and Nobita [claps]
are from the same cartoon!

607
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,679
It's fate! Don't you think?

Thank you for your help. I have to go.

610
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,920
Actually, my nickname
is a short for "Demon".

611
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,719
You're following me again.

612
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,159
You want to know whom I just met?

613
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,760
No. I'm just wandering the streets
I used to walk.

614
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,000
This photo studio has been here
since my time.

615
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,320
You like old photographs?

616
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,519
Hmm.

617
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,079
Yes, I always stop to take a look.

618
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,639
Me too.

619
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:07,679
I've always thought that a photo studio...

620
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,719
is where the good moments of
the past generations are kept.

621
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,639
Some in these pictures no longer
have the smile they once had.

622
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,880
Some became nothing but ashes.

623
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,719
But here, they're frozen in time,
in eternity.

624
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,159
That's my parents' wedding picture.

We had a pleasant evening...

You're a real piece of work.

657
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,920
I really love him.

658
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,800
True love... you can call it that.

659
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,159
Don't throw up.

660
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,840
I dream of spending my life with him,
like husband and wife--

661
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,880
Ant.

662
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,000
I warn you to stay away from him.

663
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,760
That man is very dangerous.

664
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,719
How do you know?

665
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,239
I... I smelled something bad.

666
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,119
You really hate him, don't you?
What about your guy?

667
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,599
Hmm?

668
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,760
What guy? I don't have any.

669
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,679
Don't play dumb!

670
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,119
That day when Ma Soeur Audrey
punished you,

671
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,440
I saw a guy sitting next to you.

672
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:17,039
Real cute.

673
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,000
Who's he?

674
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,039
Ant,

675
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:26,599
what did you just say?

676
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,440
You saw him?

677
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,199
[groggily] Boyfriend you never
told me about.

[Wipa] When you were alive,
you treated me like dirt.

681
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:50,920
You never cared about me!

682
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,559
But when you were sick and dying,

683
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,159
you came crawling back.

684
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,719
Asshole husband!

Wake up! Doctor! Don't die!

689
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,360

690
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:46,280

00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,079
Thank you for visiting me.

695
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,599
Actually, I have a question.

696
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,639
But let's wait until you get better.

697
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,559
Just ask. I'll tell you
what you want to know.

698
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,320
The princess originally named you
the executor of her will.

699
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:38,480
But after she died, Mr. Praphan's name
was in the will instead.

700
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:43,719
Yes, Praphan switched the wills.

701
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,920
[panting] He wanted to have everything
for himself.

702
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,440
[breathing heavily]

703
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,000
You know, I never believed that

704
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,679
Baby Daeng just disappeared.

705
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm sure it's Praphan.

706
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,039
He's the one who got rid of her.

707
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,679
What?

708
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,679
Baby Daeng was murdered!

709
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,719
Yes.

710
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,559
It's getting more complicated.

711
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's weigh the possibilities here.

712
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,159
The will specifies clearly that
Bhannawadee Palace was not to be sold.

713
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,920
So Praphan managed to lease it

714
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,800
to a private business college
for many years.

715
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,920
That means he didn't get anything
from Baby Daeng's death, did he?

716
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,639
Correct. Had Baby Daeng been alive,
Praphan would've benefited more.

717
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:01,679

721
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,239
I spent hours picking it.

00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,159
It's Dora-Demon!

723
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,679
[Adhiti] You over-do it.

724
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,599
But well,

725
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,280
thanks.

726
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,000
Like I said before, instead of a thank-you
have dinner with me please!

727
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,960
I won't hear a "No".
I've already booked a table.

728
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,639
I bet you'll like it.
The mashed potatoes there are damn good!

729
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,320
And it won the Iron Chef Award

Must be the wind...

731
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,079
But how come there's a wind
in a closed room?

732
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,119
[Senior] How did you find me?

733
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:13,559
I followed your smell.

734
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,760
You're not going to your birthday dinner?

735
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:24,719
If I went, I wouldn't be here.

736
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:27,440
You're mocking me.

737
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,519
Can I ask you something?

738
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,960
When you were alive,
did you have a girlfriend?

739
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,639
[Senior] I don't remember,
it was a long time ago.

740
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:46,320
Let me guess,

741
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,079
you were good-looking
and tons of girls queued up for you.

742
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:56,480
But you're so sensitive. No girls would be
able to stand you, right?

743
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,599
Cheeky girl! A smack on the head
would do you good!

744
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,320
How did you hit on a girl in those days?

745
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,239
No cell phones, no internet.

746
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:17,599
You called her house number
or wrote her letters.

747
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,360
Sometimes, it took months to get a reply.

748
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:25,360
Your girlfriend must've married
someone else already.

749
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,519
It was exciting.

750
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,480
You wrote a letter and wait
in anticipation whether she'd write back.

751
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:40,679
Some women sprinkled her favorite perfume

752
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,320
into the letter.

753
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:50,960
When the guy opened it,
he would smell her.

754
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,280
So romantic!

755
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,000

756
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,360
Do what?

757
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,239
Wrote letters to your girlfriend.

758
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,320

it was such a long time ago.

When I was a student, it was still in use.

But it was closed along with the college.

772

separating the two sides of the room,

819
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,320
[Adhiti] The diary was a record of 
the affair between her and Mr. Praphan.

820
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,440
It also described how Praphan forced her 
to steal the princess's money

821
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:16,840
to pay off his gambling debts.

822
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,039
[Woranart] I will talk it over
with him tonight.

823
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,520
If he refuses to own up, 
I will hand this diary to the princess,

824
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,720
and the whole truth will come out.

825
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,439
[sniffing]

826
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,199
I get it!

[knocking at door]

828
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:38,399
Ma Soeur,

829
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,600
open the door. It's time. Let me out!

01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,560
Sorry, I forgot all about you.

833
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:54,880
Something terrible happened.

834
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000

841
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,720
[Ant] Mon, where are you? 

842
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,880
I called you a dozen times.

843
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,520
I'm depressed. No one loves me. 

844
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:10,479
I want to talk to you. 

845
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,880
I'll wait at the same place.

846

847
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:09,000
[Adhiti] Ant.

848
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,359
Why did you do it?

849
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,760
Why?

850
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:21,000
Why did you do it? Why? Why?

851
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,680
Why did you do it?

Don't you run away!

Now it's your turn.

...a popcorn ghost!

A popcorn ghost? Are you high or what?

886
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:55,000
This pallid face in the microwave oven.

887
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:02,279
And then...
its pus just pops like popcorn.

888
01:15:04,039 --> 01:15:05,159

[Adhiti] The next morning 

906
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:48,239
Master Rati, half-crazed, 
confessed everything to the police.

907
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,760
He said he preferred prison
to the most horrifying thing

that visited him last night.

Are you happy now? Witch hunter!

913
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,079
[sobbingly] Mon, I'm sorry!

914
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:32,079
About what?

915
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,840
About Ant... I know I was wrong.

916
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:43,600
I never thought what I did
would blow up into this.

917
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,119
After she died, 

918
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,119
I began to hallucinate.

919
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,399
I kept seeing Ant hang herself 
over and over.

920
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:00,159
Day and night...

[screams]

924
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,119
Mon, you don't have to forgive me.

925
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,119
But I should say sorry to you.

926
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,439
Ant would want me to do that.

927
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,119
She loved you so much.

928
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:48,720
[Adhiti] Ant was not born 
to know happiness.

929
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:55,760
But for a brief period in her life, 
she believed that she'd found true love

930
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:57,920
before it turned into a nightmare.

931
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,920
During that period, 

932
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,520
Ant found real happiness 
in her own private world,

933
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:13,359
the world that everyone condemned 
as naïve and promiscuous.

934
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,640
But she didn't care.

935
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,319
[sniffing]

936
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,520
Ant.

937
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,239
[Ant] Thank you, Mon.

938
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:47,279
You're the only friend I ever had 
in my life.

939
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:51,119
Goodbye.

940
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:55,520
[sobbing]

941
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,800
[Adhiti] At that moment,
I smelled Ant's favorite perfume. 

942
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,199
The smell of clear-eyed despair.

943
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,760
I felt her presence, 
coming to say goodbye...

944
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,039
for the last time.

945
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:26,199
[Adhiti] Where do we go after death?

946
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,159
[Senior] Nowhere.

947
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,199
The spirits remain where they're familiar
with until the time comes.

948
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,920
Like us?

949
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:38,279
Yes...

950
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:41,640
like us.

951
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,159
Let's see what we have
at this point. First,

952
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,239
the demon that tried to stop us
was Mr. Praphan.

953
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,960
He didn't want us to find out
about something.

954
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,960
The night Woranart confronted Praphan

955
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,800
and threatened to tell the princess 
about the embezzlement...

956
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,920
[choking]

957
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,880
...she was strangled to death.

958
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,039
Praphan covered up his crime

959
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,039
by hiding her body in the wall 
and put cement over it.

960
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:22,640
The building was being renovated, 

961
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:25,000
so no one took notice.

962
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:30,159
That's the reason 
Woranart disappeared without a trace.

963
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,760
Wait!

964
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:33,880
Something's not right.

965
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,640
You mean Praphan didn't strangle Woranart?

966
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,199
Yes, she was strangled,

967
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,680
but Praphan didn't do it!

968
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,600
[gasping]

969
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,520
[thuds]

970
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,560
Wipa! What did you do?

971
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,760
This slut... she deserved this!

972
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,760
[gasping]

973
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:10,920
[snarling]

974
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,560
Praphan's spirit tried to stop us,

975
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:27,279
because he didn't want us to expose
the murder committed by his wife.

976
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:35,479
In this regards,
he wasn't such an asshole of a husband.

977
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:37,640
Now let's consider the next point.

978
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,479
Dr. Saner and Praphan conspired
to steal the princess's wealth.

979
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,319
Dr. Saner gave her thiopental.

980
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,600
Then they tricked her to sign a will 
that gave everything to Baby Daeng,

981
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:57,479
with Dr. Saner as 
the caretaker of the benefits.

982
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:00,680
After the princess's death, 
the will was opened.

983
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,199
And Dr. Saner knew he was double-crossed.

984
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,760
Praphan had given the princess 
another will to sign.

985
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,039
That will name Praphan as 
the executor of the estate.

986
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:12,199
[Dr. Saner] We agreed to split it up!
You're a thief!

987
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,520
[Praphan] Back off, Doc. I have evidence
that could ruin your life.

988
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,239
If the police sees these prescriptions,
you're done for.

989
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,920
Get the hell out of this place
and don't ever come back!

990
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:28,640
Senior, I think I know
who the real murderer was.

991
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:30,359
Do you?

992
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,520
Who was it?

993
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:36,079
But first I need to ask you something.

994
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,479
Remember I told you once that
I smelled gunpowder at the pool.

995
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:48,039
I thought it had something to do
with the princess's murder.

996
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:55,239
But it was another murder
that happened 20 years later.

997
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:56,199
A MALE STUDENT OF RASMEE BUSINESS COLLEGE
WAS SHOT TO DEATH.

998
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:58,560
HIS BODY WAS FOUND IN THE SAME POOL
AS PRINCESS BHANNAWADEE'S BODY

999
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,119
[Adhiti] The murder victim was...

1000
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,800
you.

1001
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:14,479
[Senior] Spirits lost some parts
of their memories... 

1002
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,800
they can't remember how they died.

1003
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:29,279
Now...

1004
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,119
I remember...

1005
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,359
Actually, I was a distant relative
to Jit, the accused gardener.

1006
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,760
This case always troubled me.

1007
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:44,560
I sneaked in here one night
to look at the crime scene.

1008
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:46,359
[Senior grunts]

1009
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:59,760
I died not knowing who killed me,
so my spirit has wandered the building

1010
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,439
for 30 years trying to find the killer.

1011
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:09,159
So that's it!

1012
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:15,359
Senior.

1013
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,000
Senior!

Ma Mere Hannah?

1018
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,199
Ma Mere Hannah.

1019
01:25:56,119 --> 01:25:57,159
Baby Daeng!

1020
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:21,199
My time has come then.

1021
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,399
Where did you find it?

1022
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:43,279
This book was my birthday present
when I turned six.

1023
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:49,600
It was the only happiness 
in my forgettable childhood.

1024
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:56,640
Princess Bhannawadee was a cruel person.

1025
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,199
In public, she treated me with mercy. 

1026
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,319
-In private, she beat me and tortured me.
-[Princess scolding]

1027
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,039
[Ma Mere Hannah]
She locked me up in a closet.

[Baby Daeng crying]

1029
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,720
[Ma Mere Hannah] I only had this book
to keep me company.

1030
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,560
I read it over and over.

1031
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:23,479
The more I read it, the more 
I saw her as the witch in the book.

1032
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,199
[witchy cackle]

1033
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:32,239
My hatred for her grew, 
fueled by my childish imagination.

1034
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:37,840
One night, the princess
was about to lock me up again. 

1035
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,680
I ran away to the pool.

1036
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,319
[Princess] You brat!
You can't hide from me!

1037
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:48,760
I'll beat you up when I find you!

1038
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,520
Baby Daeng!

[groaning]

1049
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:08,119
[Ma Mere Hannah]
I remained in shock for years.

1050
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,640
When I turned 12, I decided to run away.

1051
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,920
I wandered about, until...

1052
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,960
I found a new life through 
the mercy of God.

1053
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,399
I took my vows and
changed my name to Sister Hannah.

1054
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:34,920
I took possession of

1055
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,159
Bhannawadee Building
as stated in the will,

1056
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,520
and donated the building to
the Catholic Council to redeem my sins.

1057
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,600
Twenty years later,

1058
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,520
I was chosen as Mother Superior.

1059
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,319
Here at my old home.

1060
01:29:53,479 --> 01:29:58,560
God is merciful.
I don't have to run away anymore.

1061
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:11,039
Ma Mere!

1062
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,399
[man] Don't be alarmed.

1063
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,680
It's just a tranquilizer.

[tranquilizer clatters]

1065

Dr. Saner.

1066
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:32,079
I just don't want her to hear
what we're going to discuss.

1067
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,840
You don't have heart disease?

[chuckling]

1069
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,199
I'm healthy.

1070
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,840
I like you a lot,

1071
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:53,119
you remind me of my daughter.

1072
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,000
Is Baby Daeng your daughter?

1073
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:00,319
Yes,

1074
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:06,119
but I don't want her to know 
that I'm her real father.

1075
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,720
She's a beautiful thing,

1076
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:16,039
the last beautiful thing
in my sordid life.

1077

[glass breaks]

1078
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:19,399
Asshole!

1079
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:23,279
[Dr. Saner] The princess
was a very possessive woman.

1080
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:26,000
When she found out 
that I already had a wife, 

1081
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:28,159
a nurse who was pregnant at that time,

1082
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:29,800
the princess gave me an ultimatum.

1083
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,880
Choose one,
either that bitch or your child.

1084
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,000
Or I'll destroy your career
and your family.

1085
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,840
[Dr. Saner] I was so scared, 

1086
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:43,560
she was powerful and could do 
what she threatened to.

1087
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,920
I chose my daughter.

1088
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,800
I injected a drug that 
made my wife's heart stop 

1089
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,760
after she gave birth to the baby.

1090
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,119
That night when I arrived, 

1091
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:56,119
I saw Baby Daeng with 
a blood-stained shovel in her hand,

1092
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:57,760
frozen in a state of shock.

1093
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:01,039
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

1094
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:03,840
If they ask you, say you were sleeping.
You don't know anything.

1095
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,760
Remember! I'll take care of it.

1096
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:17,199
After I left the palace, I tried to
find out what happened to Baby Daeng.

1097
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:24,079
When I learnt that she became
a nun in a convent,

1098
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,199
I was relieved.

1099
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:33,039
The secret of the case would
remain hidden I thought.

1100
01:32:34,119 --> 01:32:35,279
But one day, 

1101
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:39,439
a college student came to see me 
and asked about the case.

1102
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,560
He was getting close to 
know the existence of Baby Daeng.

1103
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,840
I decided to protect my girl

1104
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:52,560
by following him back to the pool.

1105
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:58,960
I thought it was all over.

1106
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:04,039
I never thought that 30 years later,

1107
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,199
I'd have to come out to save my girl again

[exclaims]

1150
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,159
Doctor!

1151
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:26,399
[Adhiti] I smelled the spirit
of the nurse, the doctor's wife.

1152
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:31,199
She'd been patiently waiting for 50 years.

1153
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,840
Now the wait was over.

1154
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,840
Senior,

1155
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:44,239
why is your scent getting weaker?

1156
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,960
[sniffing]

1157
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:51,199
[Senior] Everyone has a fixed time.
Spirits as well.

1158
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,600
When I know the truth about myself,

1159
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:01,439
it's time... I'll be gone... forever.

1160
01:37:02,439 --> 01:37:03,560
Senior!

1161
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:06,920
Senior! Don't go!

1162
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,279
Senior!

[sniffles]

1164
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,640
We're in different worlds.

1165
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:18,600
Sooner or later I have to go.

1166
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:24,439
All I want you to know is...

1167
01:37:26,439 --> 01:37:30,560
you're the best memory
in my life after death.

1168
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:36,840
Don't cry.

1169
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,239
Take good care of yourself
after I've gone.

1170
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,800
No! Senior... don't go.

Good bye, partner.

1173

Senior... don't go. Senior!

Come back...

01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,600
[Adhiti] After 53 years, 

1183
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:27,239
the murder case of 
Princess Bhannawadee Rasmee 

1184
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:30,199
was reopened

1185
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,800
based on the confession
of Mother Superior Hannah.

1186
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,479
Jit was declared innocent.

1187
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:41,840
All the blames wrongly put on the gardener
were cleared.

1188
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:47,279
From then on, 
his spirit never came back again.

1189
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:52,399
As for Hannah, her crime was ruled 

1190
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,680
as unintentional wrongdoing.

1191
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,880
and the case's statute of limitations 
had expired.

1192
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,119
Still, she vowed to devote herself
to the Carmelite convent,

1193
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,239
turning her back to the world 
for the rest of her life.

1194
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,960
The mysterious skeleton inside the wall 

1195
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,680
matched the DNA of Miss Woranart.

1196
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,760
After that, no one ever heard any sound 
coming out of the wall again.

1197
01:40:23,239 --> 01:40:24,960
[Ma Soeur Audrey] Mademoiselle Adhiti.

1198
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:31,520
Good luck. May God bless you.

1199
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,560
Goodbye, Ma Soeur Audrey.

1200
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,159
[Adhiti] Senior never returned since. 

1201
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,279
He disappeared just as mysteriously 
as when he came.

1202
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,039
As if...

1203
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,640
he never existed.

01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,840
where are you?

1207
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,359
[Adhiti] Dear Senior, 

1208
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:20,199
you told me that writing letters 
is very romantic.

1209
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,640
I've never written one before, 
I don't know what to write.

1210
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:29,279
Well, 

1211
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:31,840
I miss you. 

1212
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,760
When will you come back to hang out 
with me again?

1213
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:39,800
I'll let you smack my head, all right?

1214
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,760
Your Partner.

1215

[reporter on tv] An old photo studio that
has been here since the revolution time

1217
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:02,159
is going to be demolished to build a new
condominium in the heart of the city.

1218
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:04,920
The conservationist groups
have come out to oppose it

1219
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:08,439
because the building has already been
registered with the Fine Arts Department.

1220
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,880
We will update you
on the progress of this...

1221

[electricity buzzing]

1222
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:18,119
THE OLD PHOTO STUDIO...

BOTTOM ROW, THE LAST PICTURE ON THE RIGHT

1224
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:43,199
[Adhiti] Since we were partners 
in the investigation,

1225
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:48,800
it was the first time I saw Senior.

1226
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:56,680
The photo seemed to be smiling at me
from the distant past...

1227
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:04,119
[sniffing]

1228
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:12,079
[Senior] A photo studio is where the good 
moments of the past generations are kept.

1229
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:17,439
Some in these pictures no longer 
have the smile they once had.

1230
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:21,479
Some became nothing but ashes.

1231
01:43:23,159 --> 01:43:24,399
But here, 

1232
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,479
they're frozen in time, in eternity.

1233
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,199
See you around,

1234
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:04,239
