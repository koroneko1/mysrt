00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:17,541
MAY 20TH, 1997

2
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,541
We are going to record our demo
in two days.

3
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,208
The label company is waiting.
Are you leaving us?

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,208
You guys know I have a reason to leave.

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,291
The board exams are important for me.

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,666
I need to be a civil servant
and support my family.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,291
Enough! Can you guys stop fighting?

8
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,291
We're going to perform in a minute.
Grow up!

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,000
Ju, where's your guitar?

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,291
I'll just use the guitar that's here.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,166
Ju, that guitar is damaged.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,125
It's a cheap guitar
and it has a bad pickup.

13
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,625
Don't worry about that
as long as it performs.

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,625
But the sound is awful, right?

15
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,791
-What?
-What's with you and your nose hair?

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:57,916
What happened?

17
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,458
Am I the only one
who cares about this band?

18
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,333
Are you saying I don't care
about this band?

19
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,625
Don't block my way.

20
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,541
You scream like a girl.

21
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,875
Move, move. Move aside!

22
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,291
You fatso!

23
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,958
All right, you guys are Mabok Edan?

24
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,875
Kagok Edan.

25
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,458
Okay, can you move please?

26
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,791
Okay, you're next. Get ready!

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,833
Let's give a big applause
to the next band!

28
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:36,500
Tabok Edan!

29
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,708
Good afternoon, Zenithers!

30
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,833
We are Kagok Edan.

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,333
ZENITH HIGH SCHOOL
MUSICAL PERFORMANCES

32
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,041
Hey, your guitar is too loud and noisy!

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,166
Don't worry, nobody cares about us.

34
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,458
Can you turn it down?

35
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,708
You want to fight?

36
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,083
Fight!

37
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:02,958
They're fighting!

38
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,958
Why isn't it coming out?

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,291
What's happening?

40
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,833
Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

41
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,541
Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

42
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,208
Your water pump broke? You can't shower?

43
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,166
Use Suzumi!

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,083
BUY NOW: 1080-1920

45
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,750
It sprays just right!

46
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,583
Suzumi, the king of pump.

47
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:57,625
Acclaimed film director Joko Anwar
is on the search for a lead actor

48
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,541
to be in his new colossal horror film
"Kabayan and Satan's Slaves."

49
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:05,666
How is the progress of
"Kabayan and Satan's Slaves"?

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,375
I'm looking for a star currently.

51
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:14,208
This film is a mix of horror,
art house, and some religious elements.

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:51,666
So I have to find the right actor
for this role.

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,125
Where are you taking the monkey?

54
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,291
This? We are going to put it to sleep.

55
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,250
Isn't that too cruel? Why?

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,666
This one is carrying a deadly virus.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,250
If we don't kill it,
the virus can spread to humans.

58
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,791
The speaker is dead. We need
classical music for the monkey to be calm.

59
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,625
My battery is low.

60
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,750
Do you have any classical music
on your phone?

61
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,125
-Do you have any?
-Just Indonesian songs.

62
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,000
Is it Koplo or a remix?

63
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,875
No, forget it.

64
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,541
Can you find someone
who has classical music on their phone?

65
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,750
I'm going to charge my phone first.

66
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,625
Excuse me.

67
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,541
I'm taking back the bowl.
Where is everyone?

68
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,916
Hey, Monkey. What are you doing here?
You want to come home with me?

69
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,666
You're so cute.

70
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,125
What do you want? You want to eat?

71
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:02,083
You are so cute. Why are you so cute?

72
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,583
That's not nice.
You're lucky you're inside there!

73
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,500
If I see you outside,
I will turn you into meatballs!

74
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:22,875
UJANG MEATBALL
ORDER HERE FOR FEASTS

75
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,708
ZENITH HIGH SCHOOL REUNION

76
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,291
ACCEPT

77
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,875
Will we always be together

78
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:32,500
Despite the distance between us?

79
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,958
-What's up, Dip?
-Instead of going to that reunion,

80
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:42,500
I have lined up an MC job for you.
It's good money.

81
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,583
Are you taking a dump while talking to me?

82
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,750
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,833
Ju, there are few offers.
You just need to choose.

84
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,916
I can't. I confirmed I would go.

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,083
Come on.

86
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,916
You just want to show off
in front of your high school friends.

87
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,083
Dip, instead of arguing with me,

88
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,083
why don't you try to get me
an audition for Joko Anwar's movie?

89
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,250
He's making Kabayan and Satan's Slaves.

90
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,083
I think I would be perfect for the role.

91
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,250
Jimmy and Reza are getting too old.

92
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,166
Do you remember your last three films?

93
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,208
They're all average.

94
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,458
Joko Anwar will not give that role to you.

95
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:24,500
An actor who is known for his line
"Ku, ku… Kunaon, eh?"

96
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,958
You're wrong. Its Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

97
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,291
If you don't get me an audition by Monday,
I will start looking for a new manager.

98
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,416
Come on, Ju.

99
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,125
I know grandpa uses a strong cologne,

100
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,875
but can you just bear with it?

101
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,125
Stop screaming. I want to talk to Wina.

102
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,250
Wina, don't put the slime
inside your brother's pants.

103
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,833
You can't put the slime or the sand!
Don't do that.

104
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,958
Why are you crying now? Hello, Wina, wait.

105
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,625
-Jef, can you talk to your children?
-Wait, I just got a comment.

106
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:11,250
Shit, asshole, idiot!

107
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,083
What do you know about art?

108
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,958
You have no idea what's good talent.

109
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,041
I have been playing guitar

110
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:24,750
since you were still in your diapers.

111
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,750
Think before you make a comment, idiot!

112
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,166
Wait, another comment just came in.

113
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,500
IS THAT YOUR MASTURBATING FACE?

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,291
What does her picture look like you?

115
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,875
-Is this your account?
-Yep.

116
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,583
Good comment. Very constructive.

117
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,083
Hurry up. It's getting late.

118
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,875
Can I erase the comment, honey?

119

ZENITH HIGH SCHOOL REUNION INVITATION

120
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,416
ZENITH HIGH SCHOOL

121
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,750
-Kagok Edan!
-Shit! Are you crazy?

122
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,041
I didn't know celebrities get scared.

123
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:58,541
Ju, do you still remember me?
Do you? Come on.

124
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,166
I'm Erwan.

125
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,625
I don't care if you are Erwan or Erwin.
You scared me.

126
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,375
Ju, what's your famous line?

127
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,916
Just once, all right?
Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

128
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,750
That's so you!
Ju, can we take a picture together?

129
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:21,541
-I want to show my wife.
-Can you just tell your wife to come here?

130
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:25,125
-Hey, Ju, aren't you shooting?
-I just finished a project.

131
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you guys dating?
I thought you broke up.

132
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,041
Hi, Ju? How are you?

133
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,708
Twenty years,
and you haven't changed a bit.

134
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,458
I have, Ju. Seriously.

135
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:39,166
-Ku, ku, kunaon, eh?
-Ku, ku, kunaon, eh?

136
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,625
That's wrong. It's, Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

137
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,375
Can I have a picture with a movie star?

138
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,625
I didn't see you coming.

139
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,416
-Hi, Ju. How are you?
-Hi, Lulu. I'm fine.

140
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,458
I miss you.

141
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,583
Honey, you were talking
about him in the car. He's here now.

142
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,000
Stop it.

143
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,333
-Is that so?
-Yes.

144
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,666
Ju.

145
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,833
-Where are your kids?
-With their grandparents.

146
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
Everything is still the same.

147
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,750
Who is this?

148
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
-This must be Mansur!
-We meet again.

149
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:32,500
Look at my finger.
If we give you a wedgie, you'll enjoy it.

150
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,291
-Please, no!
-Are you still poor?

151
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,333
-No.
-Are you still poor?

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,708
-Why are you so smelly?
-You stink!

153
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,083
They still like to give wedgies.

154
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,375
-They are your friends, right?
-Jeffri's friends.

155
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,083
You must be kidding.

156
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,125
Isn't that…

157
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,750
The one who likes to…

158
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,375
-Mansur!
-Mansur!

159
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm married.

160
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,416
Hey, don't tell me that after 20 years,

161
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,166
my sex is the only thing that changed.

162
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,708
You guys haven't changed?
Are you still fighting?

163
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,708
No, they're fine now.

164
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,041
Honey, how are you?

165
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,583
I'm fine.
I'm so happy to see you this way.

166
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,958
It's like you've lost weight.

167
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,958
I haven't lost weight.
In fact, I have added more weight.

168
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,083
Is this all built up, Sur?

169
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes, I'm still going back and forth
to Bangkok.

170
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,916
A little touch up here and there.

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,833
And from now on, my name is Marina.

172
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:09,125
So if you call me Mansur,
I will cut off your balls.

173
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,291
Let's party.

174
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,166
Attention everyone.

175
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,958
All of you over there,

176
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,000
please line up. Stop pushing.

177
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,708
Everyone will get a name tag, okay?

178
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,625
Wait.

179
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,625
Let me guess.

180
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,958
I know this one.

181
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,750
A famous star. Jupiter, right?

182
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,291
Jupiter? That's a planet. It's Juhana.

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,250
All right, Juhana. Here.

184
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,416
Welcome.

185
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,041
As I remember,
you guys are in a band, right?

186
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,750
Mabok Edan!

187
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,583
Kagok Edan.

188
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,375
I was close. Lulu, right?

189
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,041
Yes.

190
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,416
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

191
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,625
This must be Jeffri.

192
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,750
Hi, Raina.

193
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,166
-Thank you.
-Sure.

194
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,583
And you must be…

195
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,541
Who are you?

196
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,208
Marina.

197
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
Previously Mansur.

198
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,750
-Mansur?
-Yes.

199
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,125
-Okay, Mansur.
-It's "Marina."

200
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,958
Mansur?

201
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,291
It's "Marina!"

202
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,791
Why am I getting chills?

203
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,291
CLASS OF '97

204
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,375
I don’t know who this girl is,
but I'm going to get her.

205
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,166
Tonight, she will go back home with me.

206
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,250
She will enter my room.

207
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,375
And sleep with me.

208
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,708
Cupi!

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,958
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,583
Hello.

211
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,166
I'm Jody.

212
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,791
Marina.

213
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,875
I'm Cupi.

214
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,000
Marina.

215
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm Tyo.

216
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,416
Marina.

217
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,250
Jody, weren't you a science major?

218
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,958
-How do you know?
-Yes. How?

219
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,041
How do you know?

220
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,458
Who are you? I can't recall you.

221
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe you don't know who I am,

222
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,166
but you know who I was.

223
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,750
-You know her?
-No, I don't.

224
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,916
So you're divorced?

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,958
It's been three years, Ju.

226
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:31,083
Too bad. You guys were the ideal couple.

227
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,083
Rudy and Nining were like
the legendary Anjasmara and Dian Nitami.

228
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,958
Well, this is real life.
Not as good as soap operas.

229
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,208
So, are you dating anyone now?

230
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,083
The toilet stinks.

231
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,166
Ju, this is Febby. Febby, this is Juhana.

232
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
He's working in the entertain industry.

233
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,166
-Entertainment.
-You're in the entertain?

234
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,333
Entertainment.

235
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:06,541
But as far as I know,
Juhana is very typical with his line…

236
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,000
-Ku, ku…
-Kou, kou, kou naon, eh?

237
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,416
That's the one! It's spot on.

238
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,500
How are you able to imitate that guy?

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,166
Why can't I remember which class
you were in or who your friends were?

240
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,000
Try to remember.

241
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:28,208
You used to give me wedgies.

242
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,333
-What?
-What?

243
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,250
That's not possible.

244
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,833
I would never forget pulling the underwear
of a beautiful girl like you.

245
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,416
You're perfect.

246
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,416
Besides, you always gave wedgies
with us, didn't you?

247
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,750
Wait. You must have been doing this
alone without telling us.

248
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,000
-Right.
-That's my own underwear.

249
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:55,166
I know. You're Erik's friend, right?
You dated Erik, the basketball player.

250
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,166
But I didn't.

251
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,500
I have to go to the restroom.

252
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,500
One of our friends
used to pull their nose hair.

253
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,250
-Who is it?
-Nose hair?

254
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,833
I know Ridho
who use to pull his chest hair.

255
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,291
If it's a chicken feather,
he's a chicken butcher.

256
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,666
Why do I even bother to ask you?

257
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,833
-By the way, I'm a model.
-What kind of model?

258
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,666
Cover model.

259
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
-Magazine covers?
-Crossword book.

260
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,333
-Crossword book?
-Do you know a crossword book?

261
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm the lady on the cover.

262
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:56,666
Now I see it. It's good sideways
and better going down.

263
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,291
Yes.

264
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,708
Ujang…

265
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:15,958
Shit!

266
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,958
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm fine. I'm just exhausted.

267
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,083
-One meatball soup. No bean sprouts.
-Noted.

268
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,916
I'll have the same.

269
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:52,875
Hi.

270
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,125
Are you sure, Prill?

271
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,333
What do you mean?

272
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,000
Why? It's just meatballs.

273
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,916
I mean about… sitting next to me.

274
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,666
Wouldn't Mandy be mad?

275
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,125
Mandy is not that bad, Afuk.

276
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,416
All right.

277
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,583
Thank you.

278
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,458
I'm starving.

279
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,666
Excuse me, Afuk. Can you move?

280
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,750
-Afuk, can you move a little bit?
-Hi!

281
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
-Sure.
-Yes!

282
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,416
Can I have this meatball soup?
I'm really hungry.

283
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,416
That's mine!

284
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,666
Prilly, we promised
to go on the Keto Diet.

285
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,625
This must be because of Afuk.

286
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
-You're a really bad influence.
-It's not…

287
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,750
Let's just eat this, okay?

288
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,041
Ujang, please make one for me.

289
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,250
-One for me.
-No tomato sauce.

290
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,375
Can I have some space?

291
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,541
Afuk, please be careful.

292
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,791
Check first whether there is enough space
before sitting.

293
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,125
Anyways, thank you.

294
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,000
Now my clothes are a mess.

295
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,833
Let's eat.

296
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,125
Afuk…

297
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,416
What is that green stuff on the meatball?

298
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,458
It's the new green tea meatball soup

299
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,666
that is getting very popular in Singapore.

300
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,125
Is there such a thing?

301
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,875
-That's your meatball.
-This one?

302
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,583
Thank you.

303
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,583
-This is Prilly's.
-That's mine.

304
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,541
Don't be like that.

305
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,208
Hilbram!

306
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:03,958
Hilbram, right?

307
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,791
How are you?

308
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,416
Sorry, I'm married. We can't shake hands.

309
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,250
What are you talking about?
You were a drunkard.

310
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,208
-What happened?
-But I'm not Hilbram anymore.

311
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,208
I'm Abu Umar.

312
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,000
Abu Umar. Why?

313
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,375
Hilbram got a heart attack…

314
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:35,833
when he was getting a massage
from masseur 228.

315
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,833
From that time,
Hilbram has been reborn as… Abu Umar.

316
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,000
Jeffri, right?

317
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,375
-Hey, how are you?
-Good. Thanks.

318
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,375
-Who are you?
-Budi.

319
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,083
I used to copy your work.

320
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,833
-Yes, I remember. How are you?
-I'm good.

321
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,500
-I couldn't recognize you.
-Yes.

322
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,750
Your hair used to be so thick
during class.

323
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,708
Your hair is still good.

324
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:12,250
Well, I'm blessed.
I think it's good genes.

325
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,250
-What are you up to now?
-Regular work.

326
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:21,458
-I work from nine to five.
-I see.

327
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,625
-But I have this.
-What?

328
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,541
I have that too. I have two of them.

329
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:31,291
This one is for work,
and this one is for fun.

330
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,500
No, I mean I own a YouTube channel.

331
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:39,916
Youtube? I use this one
for YouTube, Path, and Instagram.

332
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,083
I like the camera on this phone.
It's nice, right?

333
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,875
What do you do?

334
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:50,916
Well, I'm a housewife.
I take care of my husband and children.

335
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,708
Very good. That's very noble. Keep it up!

336
00:24:55,583 --> 00:25:00,250
But I also sell food on social media.

337
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,041
Oh, dear.

338
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,875
You shouldn't do that.

339
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,333
That's how problems arise in the family.

340
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,416
You should stay at home

341
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,833
and let your husband provide
for your family.

342
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,208
Hilbram.

343
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,458
-Hi, how are you?
-Sorry.

344
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:29,625
Congratulations, your wife won
the Marketer of the Year!

345
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,125
-That's good.
-Yes.

346
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,500
Your wife's hard work finally paid off.

347
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:40,375
She's lucky to have a husband
who takes care of the children.

348
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,583
What's wrong with him?

349
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,083
-Hi, Ju.
-Hi, Ning.

350
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,666
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

351
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,041
-It's been a while.
-Yes, when was the last time?

352
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,583
-More than three years, I think.
-Yes, I think so.

353
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,958
-Hold on, I have to take this.
-Sure Ju.

354
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,291
Hi, can I take a picture with you?

355
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,375
-Just one, please.
-I have to take this call.

356
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,333
Just a second.

357
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,791
Say, "Cheese!"

358
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,458
One more. Wait!

359
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:16,500
Rudy, if you still allow
the kids to watch Awkarin,

360
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,833
I will have your parental rights
terminated.

361
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,083
-What is wrong with Awkarin?
-Everything.

362
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:25,750
I don't want the kids to dress up
all sexy like her.

363
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:31,000
Come on. Awkarin is really cool!
Look at her figure.

364
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:34,208
She represents kids today.

365
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:46,208
What do you want?
This is only for invitations.

366
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,333
You haven't paid yet.

367
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:53,250
Here. You can go now.

368
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:54,875
This is only for alumni.

369
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,625
Marina,

370
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,833
what are you doing after this?

371
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:14,291
Shall we go out for dinner?

372
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,666
Let's eat each other.

373
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,333
I'm so dirty.

374
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,333
Every time I see your lips, I want to…

375
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,333
I even scare myself.

376
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,791
I have never seen a body like yours.

377
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:40,791
Your heart, liver, pancreas, intestines…

378
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,458
Why am I getting hungry now?

379
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,333
Marina,

380
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,875
you have something…

381
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:55,500
that I have never seen in any other women.

382
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,833
And that something is…

383
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,500
A penis!

384
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,208
It's "Marina"!

385
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:13,000
My name is Marina, not penis.

386
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:19,250
I currently work
at the National Land Agency.

387
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,625
This is my business card.

388
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,458
In case you need any help
extending house papers,

389
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:27,000
exchanging certificates,
or exchanging wives.

390
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,166
-What?
-What?

391
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,541
Exchanging what, you said?

392
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:35,083
Exchanging what?

393
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,291
-Exchange…
-Exchanging business cards.

394
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,000
-I'm Budi. You still remember?
-Yes.

395
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:44,500
Jeffri says he does not have
any business cards.

396
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,750
The office should give him one.

397
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,458
Juhana? Our celebrity!

398
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:55,208
How are you? "Ku, ku, neon, eh."

399
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:59,250
That's wrong.
It should be, Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

400
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,875
Get out of my way! Move aside!

401
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,750
-Calm down. What's wrong?
-Shit!

402
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,750
Hey, easy.

403
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:05,875
Shit. Asshole.

404
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,000
-What's wrong?
-Why?

405
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,166
Idiot!

406
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,083
-Relax.
-Yes, but what happens?

407
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,166
That beautiful girl, with the red dress.
I was after her.

408
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,500
-The one…
-The sexy one!

409
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:19,166
-I thought she was my only love.
-Who is she?

410
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,416
I don't know who she is.

411
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,166
-So?
-I found out, she has…

412
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:28,583
-What? Boxing gloves?
-A big fist?

413
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,333
What?

414
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,250
-She has…
-What?

415
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,375
A ring?

416
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,958
-A ring. She's old? Is that it?
-Menopause?

417
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,250
She… has a penis.

418
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,125
-What? A penis?
-What? A penis?

419
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,458
I just found out from Raina,

420
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:04,250
that the girl with the red dress
and big boobs is Mansur!

421
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,583
Mansur of Kagok Edan?

422
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,583
Exactly.
The one who liked to pull his nose hair.

423
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,208
Did you bring the video?

424
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,541
-I have it.
-The one we recorded last time?

425
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:18,833
Mansur…

426
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Hey, boy! Put this on.

427
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,750
I can't. I have to follow the rundown.

428
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,291
You've got some nerve.

429
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,125
You want me to mess up your face?

430
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,666
-Do you want that?
-No.

431
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,333
Make it flat?

432
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,708
Yes. I mean, no!

433
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,583
With some powder on your face?

434
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:43,250
-Why do you say that?
-I thought it was funny.

435
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,583
Put it on now!

436
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:52,208
Thank God my career has been picking up
in the past 20 years.

437
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:54,000
Twenty years, huh?

438
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:57,541
In the past 20 years,
have you ever thought of your old band?

439
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,750
Stop it.

440
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,166
It's fine, honey. I just want to know

441
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,791
if he realizes how he destroyed our dreams

442
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:09,250
just to fulfill his dream
of becoming a civil servant.

443
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,000
What are you trying to say?

444
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,250
What are you guys talking about?
I want in.

445
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:21,458
Let's give a big welcome
to our next band! Tabok Edan!

446
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:26,875
Jef, that's you!
I can't forget that thick hair.

447
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,500
That music. It's very annoying.

448
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,166
The guitar part was improvised. Great.

449
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,083
The sound of Satan.

450
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,875
It disturbs the purity of the soul.

451
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:56,583
And creates chaos in our hearts and mind.

452
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,833
My God.

453
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,875
Ju, you were awesome!

454
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,166
You guys are legendary.

455
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,583
In a negative sense!

456
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,000
I have to record this.

457
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:41,541
This is so good. Jef? Where are you going?

458
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,625
Piece of shit!

459
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,708
SAY "YES" TO ACHIEVEMENT!
SAY "NO" TO DRUGS!

460
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,708
Jef, cut it out. What's wrong with you?

461
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:12,083
That was 20 years ago.

462
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,958
Class of '97!

463
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,708
What do you think of Tepok Edan?

464
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,375
For our next performance,

465
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:30,541
I'm sure the song will bring
all of you back to your high school days.

466
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,583
Okay,

467
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:38,041
let's give a big applause
to Zhe Zhe Cheers!

468
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:58,083
If you were not egoistic,
maybe we would be rock stars by now!

469
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,500
Maybe we would have made many albums!

470
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,875
I wouldn't need to work
with my annoying boss!

471
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,625
I wouldn't have to go around
with my secondhand car.

472
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,958
Maybe I wouldn't have
to live in my small house.

473
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,833
Those are all hypothetical, Jef.

474
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,083
Your YouTube channel might get
a million subscribers.

475
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,500
Okay, you might win an award
for your movie!

476
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,583
Your hair might grow back!

477
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,833
You might get a wife soon!

478
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:24,208
You might grow up and move on
from all of this.

479
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,291
-Impossible!
-Impossible!

480
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,083
Bro, is pedophilia allowed in Indonesia?

481
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,875
If it is, I'm in.

482
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,583
Don't their parents…

483
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,333
get upset…

484
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,958
When… they dress up…

485
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:55,583
What's all this rubbish?
They think they're hot.

486
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,750
-Baby, look at me!
-What?

487
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,333
Why are you looking at them?

488
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,416
I'm sexier than them, right?

489
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,000
Yes, you are sexier than them.

490
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,166
I'm going home. I'm mad at you!

491
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,750
If you want to be a rock star, go ahead.

492
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,041
Just don't blame me
for Kagok Edan's failure.

493
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,833
See? You never had any faith in our band.

494
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:20,416
What band are you talking about.
Kagok Edan is no more.

495
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,375
-You wanna fight?
-Do you?

496
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,666
Cut it out!

497
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:24,791
Jef, let's go home.

498
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,541
Home? He will go back
to his glamorous celebrity life.

499
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:35,958
And us? We go back
to our normal dull life. Is that fair?

500
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,083
You're right.

501
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:43,000
Going back home with your wife,
meeting your adorable kids,

502
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,583
in your very small home.

503
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,666
It's not fair.

504
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,833
-Honey.
-Forget it.

505
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,916
I don't want to see your face
for the next 60 minutes.

506
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,375
Take care of this.

507
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,416
Take care of the purse!

508
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,083
It fits you!

509
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,625
Move!

510
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,208
Mandy, what's wrong with Intan?

511
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,583
Maybe she's improvising.

512
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,250
It's like breakdancing.

513
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:14,666
-It must be their new move. Breakdance.
-Fantastic!

514
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,125
Wow!

515
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,583
He gets a girl in no time.
The charm is still there.

516
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,375
That must be nice.

517
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,583
She's giving him a hicky.

518
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,458
There is also lap dancing.

519
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,666
How do you get your neck bitten by a girl?

520
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,916
I'm scared.

521
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:10,375
-They're ill, Raina.
-It's bad.

522
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,250
-What's wrong?
-Is this for real?

523
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,916
Hey, get up!

524
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:18,500
Is this for real?

525
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:19,750
Prilly!

526
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,250
-Prilly!
-What?

527
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,083
Mandy!

528
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,416
Hey, don't be naughty.

529
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,875
Prilly!

530
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,708
-Why are you pushing it?
-She's coming!

531
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,083
Hey, don't push me there!

532
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,583
-Don't push me!
-Why are you holding this back?

533
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,708
CLASS OF '97

534
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:54,958
Mansur…

535
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,250
-It's "Marina."
-Mansur!

536
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,458
I have already repented. I have repented.

537
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,375
Forgive me. This is a warning from God.
The end is nigh.

538
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:44,625
We are all ungrateful.
This is God's way of punishing us.

539
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,708
I have warned all of you. Nobody cares.
Nobody wants to listen.

540
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,458
You have to repent right away.

541
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,666
Oh God.

542
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:14,791
Not me. Please, I have children.
I have a wife.

543
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,583
Please, not me.

544
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:21,583
Him. Take him.
He's unemployed and has sinned.

545
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:24,083
Help the government reduce unemployment.

546
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:35,166
See? Even Satan knows
who has repented and who has sinned.

547
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,916
Help me!

548
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,416
KEEP IT CLEAN

549
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,583
Shit!

550
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,333
Aren't you the one who asked for a selfie?

551
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,625
Let me tell you… What's your name?

552
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:10,000
Why do kids today
have such difficult names?

553
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:11,583
Let me tell you.

554
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:15,083
There are some ethics you have to follow
when you ask for a picture.

555
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,083
Don't come closer. Don't worry.
I will let you take a picture.

556
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,750
I'm not that kind of actor
that only takes pictures during promos.

557
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:32,083
If someone else sees the both of us here,
it will become hot gossip.

558
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,583
All right?

559
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,166
What are you doing?

560
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:41,833
What's wrong? Don't be mad.

561
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,625
Hey, what's wrong with you?

562
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,208
What's wrong? Don't be mad.

563
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,833
Lulu, this girl!

564
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,666
What's wrong with her?

565
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,541
Lulu, hit her!

566
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,291
-No, I can't.
-Hit her!

567
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:39,791
Raina!

568
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:44,083
-It's good I saw you.
-Are you okay?

569
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:51,541
Go straight.

570
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,875
Go straight to the front!

571
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:54,625
Oh my God!

572
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,666
Come on, hurry up!

573
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,833
-Turn right.
-Oh my God!

574
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,125
-Oh God.
-Come on! Run faster!

575
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:12,666
-Shit.
-Budi! Hey!

576
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,000
Did you see my wife?

577
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,666
Your wife? I don't know.

578
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,333
Don't go out front.
They're eating everyone!

579
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,375
Let us just finish all of them then.

580
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,666
Don't go there. You'll get killed, Mansur.

581
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,583
"Marina."

582
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,500
You call me Mansur one more time,
you're dead!

583
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,000
-So? Where should we go through?
-I know, Uncle!

584
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,625
Aunty. Follow me!

585
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,750
We're going back? Are you serious?

586
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,125
Shit.

587
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:46,083
-Come on.
-Bring it on!

588
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,666
Mansur.

589
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,750
I'm sorry, I hit a girl.

590
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,291
What is this thing?

591
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,583
My hair?

592
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:14,208
I knew it! We're almost the same age.
Your hair can't be thicker than mine.

593
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:19,750
Let's leave this place.

594
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,500
It's locked.

595
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,541
Everything is locked.
How would they get a proper education?

596
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:53,541
-This one opens!
-Your stomach is too big.

597
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:02,041
-This door doesn't close.
-Let me hold it. Wait.

598
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:18,291
They're gone. It's good. We're safe.

599
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:19,625
I'm so tired.

600
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:26,375
-Your phone.
-Turn it off!

601
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:33,125
It's Dipa.

602
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:41,041
Dipa, help me! Dipa!

603
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,625
-Ju, I'm with Joko Anwar now.
-I don't want to die! Help!

604
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:48,666
Dipa, help me!
I still want to live. Help me!

605
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,750
Stop that!

606
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:54,583
I don't want to die.
I don't want to be eaten by my friends.

607
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:57,458
He's ready for casting now.
Joko, listen to this.

608
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,750
Jump. What?

609
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,875
Hello. What is this?

610
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:02,208
I mean, here.

611
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,458
Yes, hello.

612
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:07,916
Dipa, I still want to learn how to pray.

613
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Please, help me!

614
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:13,875
I promise if I live through this,
I will promote all my films always.

615
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,500
I will post on all the social media…

616
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,708
This is fantastic.

617
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,375
…unlike the other actors!

618
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:23,500
Amazing. And with a price less than Reza?

619
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,750
Yes. It's just a quarter of Reza's!

620
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,583
-Dwi?
-Dwi? Far below.

621
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,458
-Tora?
-Way below Tora.

622
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:34,250
Kabayan is you.

623
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,375
I'm a fan of Juhana now.

624
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:43,708
I don't want to be eaten by my friend.

625
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:49,125
Dipa, help me! Please!

626
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,208
I should have taken the MC job
instead of coming here.

627
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,458
Ju, start praying. Maybe it will help.

628
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,458
Hurry up, Ju, pray.

629
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:12,250
I can't do that
when I’m exhausted. Why don't you pray?

630
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,833
I also don't remember
my prayers when I panic!

631
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,250
Ku, ku, kunaon, eh?

632
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,875
You have a long life Ju.
Follow me. This way!

633
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,250
This way! There's no one here.

634
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,541
Faster, Mandy!

635
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,791
Mandy…

636
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:44,791
Please! Help me!

637
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,083
-Prilly!
-Latuconsina?

638
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,250
Afuk.

639
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,750
-This way.
-Faster!

640
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,125
Open the door!

641
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,666
Open the door!

642
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,166
Help!

643
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:43,666
Baby, I have to make sure
I still look good.

644
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,958
Where's my mirror? Where is it, Baby?

645
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,166
My mirror?

646
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,375
I don't know. You had it with you.

647
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,750
I still look very beautiful.

648
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:08,625
I should be at home with my kids.

649
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,625
Not here with this bimbo
who only thinks of her looks,

650
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
make-up, and mirror.

651
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,166
Baby, are you going to let her
talk like that to me?

652
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,916
Help me, Baby. I'm not in Bimbo.
They're old.

653
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:31,083
I didn't mean Bimbo the band.
You understand English, right?

654
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:35,875
Baby, help me!

655
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,125
Nining, please.

656
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,208
Just say sorry to her.

657
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:48,166
I'm not a kid, Rudi.

658
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:52,166
You're a kid when you act like this.

659
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:57,291
Who keeps getting tempted by new toys?
Is it me, or is it…

660
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,833
Rudi.

661
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:13,000
Hey you, beautiful.
I have to take care of you.

662
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:20,125
Your eyelashes.
Oh my God, they're amazing.

663
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:26,125
I can't let my fake lashes fall off.

664
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:32,333
I have to always look beautiful.

665
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,458
I'm so tired.

666
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,375
Excuse me.

667
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:09,041
Ju, look at them. They're everywhere.
What do they want?

668
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:14,375
What's wrong with them? They look dead,

669
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,000
yet they walk around.

670
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:20,958
They are neither human nor ghosts.

671
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,750
We really need to find a name for them,
but what?

672
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,708
Half-dead humans.

673
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:30,375
Not catchy enough. Too long.

674
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,625
Humans who neither want to die nor live.

675
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,458
It's too dramatic.

676
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:38,458
Or…

677
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,666
Too American.

678
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,958
I know. I think they're called…

679
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:50,666
Si… si…

680
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:52,125
Singles!

681
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,791
-Singles?
-Because nobody wants to be with them.

682
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,291
How do you know
nobody wants to be with them?

683
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:58,708
It seems so.

684
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,583
Maybe someone does.

685
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,375
Do you want to be with them?

686
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,875
-Well, they're not my type.
-So they are singles.

687
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:06,958
That's Jeffri!

688
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:14,291
Thank God he's safe.
And he still has my purse.

689
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,166
Shit.

690
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:18,916
Juhana.

691
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,875
What's wrong with his phone?

692
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,625
Ju, where is your phone?

693
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,375
I dropped it in the classroom
when I was panicking.

694
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,166
-What about you?
-I left my bag in the main hall.

695
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:39,791
I just brought… this.

696
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,000
-Mr. Erwan?
-There.

697
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:46,916
See? I have come out as the hero
in such a critical situation.

698
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,666
You're out of credit.

699
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,875
What kind of hero has no credit
on his phone.

700
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:53,791
Hero without credit.

701
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:57,875
Right, Baby?

702
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:05,166
Why is everyone so quiet?
Baby, what do you think?

703
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,833
Baby!

704
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:21,166
What's wrong with your face?

705
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,541
You should use your night cream.

706
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,500
Listen to me. Look at your face, Baby!

707
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,250
Hello, police headquarters.
Can I help you?

708
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:46,750
Hello, officer. I'm calling
from Zenith High School.

709
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,666
We are having a reunion…

710
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,541
when suddenly my friends died.

711
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,458
Then, those who died ate my other friends.

712
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,541
Officer, please send help.

713
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:59,291
Are you sure you want to involve
the police?

714
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:03,958
I'm sure, Officer. I can't involve
my father in law, right?

715
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,458
Don't you want to settle this
between yourselves?

716
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:10,000
We Indonesians always value friendship.

717
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:14,458
The only settlement for this
is with the grave.

718
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,208
What do you mean? They are all…

719
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:21,958
Dead. D.E.A.D.

720
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:24,000
Finito. Kaput.

721
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,583
I see. And they still bite other people?

722
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:28,958
Man, this is so difficult.

723
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:38,250
Help me, Officer!
They're going to rape me!

724
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,916
Be the rapist.

725
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,416
Come on.

726
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:49,291
Yes, I'm the rapist.

727
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,666
I'm going to rape you.

728
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,000
I'm going to open the… shoes.

729
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,625
Please send someone now. Please!

730
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,291
Hey, can I record the rape scene?

731
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:14,791
To make it more believable.

732
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,625
We're dead.

733
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:35,416
We're so dead.

734
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:38,833
Do you want to die that badly?

735
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:41,041
Then let's go out there and die together.

736
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,333
Let's do it!

737
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:55,375
Shit.

738
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
We're dead.

739
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:32,083
I'm just a regular housewife,
while my friends are successful.

740
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,583
Including you. A famous event organizer.

741
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,250
What are you talking about?

742
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:47,125
If I could choose,
I would rather not be an EO.

743
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:50,750
It's very tiring
and very difficult at times.

744
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:57,125
When you're busy at work,
who takes care of your children?

745
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:01,000
I don't have any kids.

746
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:10,791
My uterus is as dry as the Sahara desert.

747
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,041
That's the reason my husband left me.

748
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,750
I'm sorry, Raina.

749
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:22,750
It's all right.

750
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:29,791
I actually envy seeing you and Jeffri.

751
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:35,250
You both have everything
that I have always dreamed of.

752
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:42,833
You're blessed, Lulu.

753
00:58:58,833 --> 00:58:59,666
Afuk.

754
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:16,125
So, which one is it?

755
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:25,416
Both. I mean,
thank you for helping me and…

756
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:33,583
For not joining your band
since I joined the cheer squad.

757
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:35,333
Don't worry about it.

758
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:40,500
But honestly… I miss you.

759
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,416
I mean, I miss being in the band with you.

760
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:53,000
Okay. So, which one is true?

761
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:57,250
You miss me or you miss
being in the band with me?

762
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,083
Well, I think both.

763
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:13,125
I just feel that you have a lot of talent
and you should not waste it on cheering.

764
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,375
Okay, try to moving it now.

765
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,125
Don't put too much pressure.

766
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,416
It still hurts…

767
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:31,916
but it's much better.

768
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,625
That's good.

769
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:48,666
Please, tell me next time
you're going to do that.

770
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,958
-Now do it again.
-Stop it.

771
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,208
25 million for one breast?
That's expensive.

772
01:01:00,291 --> 01:01:03,458
I got a very special deal and I took it.

773
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:07,125
That's insane and very weird.

774
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,875
Wait, when you wanted to do the surgery,

775
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,500
who was your reference?

776
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:35,666
Look-alike, but her boobs…

777
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,666
are not…

778
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,000
that big.

779
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,000
I know. It's two cups difference.

780
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:51,458
Very good.
Why didn't you cut the thing below?

781
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,208
That's even more expensive.

782
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:57,041
I have to save for two years
to get that much money.

783
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:01,708
That much? Crazy. Just to cut that thing?

784
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,583
-Bud?
-Bud?

785
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:11,416
-Bud?
-Bud?

786
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,708
Bud! No!

787
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,041
No! Mar!

788
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:22,458
Mar, help me! Please, help!

789
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:24,125
Here, Jody!

790
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,833
-I can't hold that!
-Let me hold his hand.

791
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:48,458
I'm sorry, Bud.

792
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,875
Rest in peace, Bud.

793
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:55,416
Have a good life there, Bud.

794
01:02:56,125 --> 01:03:00,208
Please ask God for thick hair, okay?

795
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,791
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

796
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,166
Jeffri!

797
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,833
-What?
-This…

798
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:19,458
"Jeffri" here. Isn't that you?

799
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:21,791
Which one?

800
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,708
There is Lulu, Juhana, and Mansur too.

801
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:32,791
"Kagok Edan."

802
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,000
Isn't that the band
that was on the video screen before?

803
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:37,958
Yes.

804
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,166
I’m sorry.

805
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,791
If I knew the video
was going to cause problems,

806
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,250
I wouldn't have put it in.

807
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:48,500
That's okay. My friend said
that the band is gone.

808
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,083
-There's another one.
-Where?

809
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:01,416
-Did you write this one as well?
-Yep.

810
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:07,750
So, which one is it?
The band or the affair with Lulu?

811
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:11,166
The reason I made the band
was to get close to Lulu.

812
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:15,875
-And did you get her?
-I did. Inside and out.

813
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,458
She's my wife now.

814
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:26,125
That's so cute.
Even though the band is gone,

815
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:29,041
you still have your soul mate.

816
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,666
Ju.

817
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:50,375
Ladies, please get up.

818
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,416
Look at the monitor.

819
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,041
What's that? Look.

820
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:54,875
-Where?
-There.

821
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:56,666
It's the police.

822
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,083
Officer!

823
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:10,791
Hello Mar, take Jody and Budi to the lab.
Now. The police are here.

824
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:16,208
What happened to Budi?
All right, you and Jody come here.

825
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,833
Hurry up. We can get out
of here once it clears up.

826
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,250
-Jod.
-What?

827
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,916
-Now is the time for you to hold a weapon.
-True. I agree.

828
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,333
Jod!

829
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:37,750
This is perfect for a macho guy like me.
Give it to me.

830
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,875
-This is for me.
-What about me?

831
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,333
I thought it was a rape case.
Why is it so empty?

832
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:06,208
It might just be hoaks.

833
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:08,791
Hoax.

834
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:12,458
Hoaks. I have been taught
that it is hoaks since I was a kid.

835
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,291
Did they already have the word hoax
when you were a kid?

836
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:18,208
Of course not.
The word hoax only started now.

837
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:19,583
You just said, "hoax."

838
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,041
-Hoaks.
-Hoax.

839
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,375
-Hoaks.
-Hoax.

840
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:27,666
I don't care if it's hoaks or hoax.

841
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,000
This can create problems among our team.

842
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:33,875
Move forward!

843
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,166
Check everything first!

844
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:49,833
I see one victim there. Let's ask her.

845
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,000
You ask her. I'm shy with girls.

846
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,416
Are you serious? Hurry up.

847
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,333
-I'm nervous.
-Don't be. You do it.

848
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,291
You do it.

849
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,250
Just go and ask her.

850
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:03,958
Okay. We'll do it.

851
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,166
Miss, where are you going?

852
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,041
Yes, kill all of them.

853
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,833
It's a pity we haven't given them a name.

854
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,041
There's more of them!

855
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,833
I don't think they are human.

856
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,041
Shoot them!

857
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:23,958
Take that!

858
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:24,958
Finish them off!

859
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,000
Kill them all!

860
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,625
-Shoot them!
-Back up!

861
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,083
Shit!

862
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:42,250
Oh, God!

863
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,750
There goes our only chance.

864
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:51,708
-Jody.
-What?

865
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,958
-Your fart smells really bad.
-Just a little.

866
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,125
-Wait.
-What?

867
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:07,333
They can't see us.

868
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:47,500
I take back my word.
Your fart is a blessing.

869
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:49,958
They think we're garbage.

870
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,291
-Jod.
-It's our principal, Mr. Is.

871
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,458
Let me kill him.

872
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,833
Wait! Hold on, Sir.

873
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:03,000
He might be an annoying teacher,
but he's still our teacher.

874
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:05,125
Who we are today is all because of him.

875
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,375
Please wait, Sir.

876
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,250
Very stubborn. Don't kill him.

877
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,500
People like him should be preserved.

878
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,500
All right, Sir. Don't be naughty.

879
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,583
Just stay here.
Scratch the walls if you want.

880
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,333
-Thank you, Sir.
-Thank you for everything.

881
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,833
Look at that.

882
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:08,333
Not only the living hate our songs,
but the dead too.

883
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,833
Now I know it's really bad.

884
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:19,708
Shit. Just lost another lifeline.

885
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:37,458
-Why?
-Hold on. Don't make too much noise.

886
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,708
-I'm not making any noise.
-Quiet.

887
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,791
Hey, Jod.

888
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,625
Isn't that Hendrik?

889
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,833
-Hendri.
-From Class 1A?

890
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,750
Hendri who…

891
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:53,208
I'm not scared of this one.

892
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,875
-Hey.
-Nice hair.

893
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,541
Hey, beautiful.

894
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,083
-Come here.
-Let's go.

895
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,833
Who is the cute one?

896
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:06,375
What do you want?

897
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:15,375
It's time for you to…

898
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,041
Now it's my turn.

899
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:28,875
-I never thought I would use this.
-Take that!

900
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,041
Mar!

901
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,083
Jod!

902
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:44,041
Mar, they got me.

903
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:45,833
Your band members are all still here?

904
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,416
Why don't you guys perform?

905
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,041
That's not possible.

906
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:54,208
Two of us are here.
Jeffri and Mansur are outside.

907
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,708
And if we want to perform,
we have to go to the hall.

908
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:59,916
I don't want…
I don't want to be like them.

909
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,583
-I don't want to end like that.
-I know.

910
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:09,541
I'm sorry, Mar.
All this time I have hurt you.

911
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,791
If you do go through the surgery,

912
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:20,833
remember that to me you will always be
the one with the biggest balls.

913
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,083
You've always been the brave one.

914
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,125
I know.

915
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:43,125
Not now. There are too many of them, Ju.

916
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,583
They are talking to each other.

917
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,958
Talking?

918
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,208
Mar.

919
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,125
Jod.

920
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:55,208
-Mar, my hand really hurts.
-Easy, Jod.

921
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,166
-My body is shivering.
-It's okay.

922
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,041
Relax.

923
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:02,291
Kill me now, Mar.

924
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:05,250
I'm here, Jody.
Don’t worry about anything.

925
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,666
What are you doing, Sur?

926
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,458
-I'm Marina.
-What are you doing?

927
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:13,625
-Don't kiss me!
-Don't worry.

928
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:16,541
I don't want my last moments
to be like this.

929
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,458
-Jod.
-No way!

930
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:21,083
Jod! No!

931
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,875
Go to sleep, Jod.

932
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:31,958
Good bye, Denok.

933
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,708
-Who is Denok?
-My car.

934
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,625
Hurry up.

935
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:44,625
Look at that.

936
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:13,625
-Where is Jody?
-Jody…

937
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,041
-Jef.
-Lulu.

938
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:39,166
I'm sorry I yelled at you before.

939
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,666
I'm sorry too.

940
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:45,125
I have realized that you
and the children are my pillars.

941
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:47,875
Nothing can take that.

942
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:52,041
So sweet. So dramatic. So romantic.

943
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,791
Are you guys done?
We have to go to the hall.

944
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:58,958
-Hall?
-I'll explain later.

945
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,458
Let's go. Hurry up.

946
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:29,041
If they do anything, we fight them!

947
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,791
Mr. Erwan!

948
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,875
-There are so many of them.
-Are you scared, Ju?

949
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:39,583
If you're scared,
I will face all of them alone.

950
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,250
You guys go there.

951
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,125
Ju, remember.

952
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,250
Your next movie must be a big hit.

953
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,291
Come on. I'm not scared of you.
I will fight all of you alone!

954
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:52,250
Come on!

955
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:10,083
Ju, I'm tired. Let's rest.

956
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,875
Anyway, the hall is still far away.

957
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:18,166
And they're everywhere.

958
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:22,166
If I knew there would be a lot of running,
I would have worn my track suit.

959
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Let me do it.

960
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,875
Let me clear the way to the hall
for you all.

961
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,583
I will try to lure them to come to me.

962
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:38,916
Are you sure?

963
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:40,708
I…

964
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,458
have no one left.

965
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:50,791
No one to really worry if I'm gone.

966
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:56,333
But you…

967
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,625
Many people need you.

968
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:06,041
Jeffri, and the kids
who are waiting for you at home.

969
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,791
They all need you.

970
01:17:20,666 --> 01:17:23,416
Okay.

971
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,541
-Raina?
-Where are you going?

972
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,250
Good evening, Zenith!

973
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:59,208
Welcome to the reunion
for the class of '97!

974
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,250
I can't hear your voice!

975
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,708
What happened to your leg?

976
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:43,916
Please go to the doctor
and get it checked.

977
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:50,916
Class of '97! Come on, I can't hear you!

978
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,583
There is a surprise performance tonight!

979
01:19:54,750 --> 01:20:00,166
A really cool band will perform!
Don't you guys want to hear it?

980
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,291
I'm sure…

981
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:50,333
this band will remind you
of your high school days!

982
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:53,083
Do you know the name of the band?

983
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:05,375
This will be our performance for tonight
from our own class of '97.

984
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:07,583
Okay.

985
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,625
Let's give a warm welcome to…

986
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:16,541
Kapok Edan!

987
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:20,250
Let's call to the stage…

988
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,458
Kapok Edan!

989
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:35,166
Budi, Jody…

990
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:38,083
Mr. Iswadi.

991
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,291
And now Raina.

992
01:21:44,541 --> 01:21:48,500
I'm sorry, it's out of battery.

993
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:53,708
She's still alive.

994
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:02,791
Let's give a big applause to Kagok Edan!

995
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:08,625
They will destroy your eardrums!

996
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:20,250
Come on, all of you!

997
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,541
Jef!

998
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:32,458
Be careful.

999
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,583
I haven't used these sticks
for a long time.

1000
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,125
Ju, what's the title of the song?

1001
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,708
I want you to know that I want…
What is it?

1002
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:51,333
I want you to know that I want you.

1003
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:54,333
Why do you have to make
the title so long and difficult?

1004
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:56,875
We'll be all right.
We'll get out of here alive.

1005
01:22:58,333 --> 01:22:59,833
How do we play this? I forgot.

1006
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:02,916
You forgot the song that you wrote?

1007
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,125
I'm busy.
I don't have time to think about it.

1008
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,333
You must have a lot of spare time.

1009
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,500
Making videos for your YouTube channel.
Does anybody even watch it?

1010
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:12,541
Why are you saying that?

1011
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:15,041
Let me tell you, songs are art.

1012
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:18,041
Art is in our blood.
And our blood is our children.

1013
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,083
Children? I don't even have a wife.

1014
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,666
Then find one. Stop jerking off.

1015
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,250
I don't care. I like it!

1016
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,125
Let's just play. I'm sure we'll get it.

1017
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:30,000
-The chords are B-D-A.
-Okay.

1018
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,916
-Are you sure?
-C.

1019
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:36,583
Let's just play.

1020
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:38,791
Come on.

1021
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,625
Guys, they're coming!

1022
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:43,125
We're dead.

1023
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:52,833
They're coming.

1024
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,625
Why don't they die?

1025
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,958
It's not working, Ju.

1026
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,416
Something is not right.

1027
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,250
-Look at me.
-We're going to die!

1028
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:20,541
-How do you know?
-I just know!

1029
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,666
They will die. Trust me.

1030
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:25,333
-No. You don't know that.
-We'll find a way out.

1031
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:26,833
We will find a way out.

1032
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:29,458
Afuk, you don't know that.

1033
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,916
Ju, where is your guitar?

1034
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,666
I'll just use the guitar that's here.

1035
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,750
Ju, that guitar is damaged.

1036
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:41,125
It's a cheap guitar
and it has a bad pickup.

1037
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,541
Don't worry about that,
as long as it performs.

1038
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:45,916
I know what's missing.

1039
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,250
Ju, 20 years ago,

1040
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:52,833
you used a broken guitar
provided by the school.

1041
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:55,083
-The strings are made of…
-Cheap wires?

1042
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:57,583
That's it. Different strings
mean different sounds.

1043
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:01,166
You should use the same guitar
you used back then.

1044
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,250
That old guitar was from
the music department.

1045
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:06,708
Do you think it's still here?

1046
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,166
That was 20 years ago.

1047
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,000
-It is unlikely!
-Yes, it is.

1048
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:14,416
Hello. The guitar!

1049
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,958
Boy, the guitar I used 20 years ago
from the music department?

1050
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:21,541
It's there. I know where it is.

1051
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,708
-Let me get it.
-Hurry up.

1052
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,708
Afuk, are you going through the front?

1053
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:28,625
Don't worry. There is a back door here.

1054
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,500
All right, hurry up.

1055
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:37,250
What are you guys doing?
Stop fooling around.

1056
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,083
Stay away from me!

1057
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,458
Help!

1058
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:19,541
Why is he taking so long?

1059
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,708
I got it.

1060
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:29,916
Afuk!

1061
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:34,750
-They bit me.
-Please, Afuk.

1062
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,375
My hand hurts a lot.

1063
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:39,916
-It really hurts.
-Are you okay, Lulu?

1064
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:42,500
-I'm not sure.
-Did it bite you?

1065
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:43,416
I don't know.

1066
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,833
Are you okay, Afuk?

1067
01:27:46,416 --> 01:27:48,916
-Don't worry about me.
-You're gonna be okay.

1068
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,875
Please, tell the children
I really love them.

1069
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:55,833
Don't touch it. It hurts.

1070
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:00,333
-I have only one request.
-That hurts.

1071
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:02,791
Sur, are you crazy? What are you doing?

1072
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,708
Honey, that's just a sprain.
Stop being a drama queen.

1073
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:09,833
And next time you call me Mansur,
I'm going to kick you in the balls.

1074
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,250
Honey, will you fix it
if my balls are uneven?

1075
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,250
Afuk, how is he?

1076
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,708
-They got him.
-He'll be okay.

1077
01:28:22,958 --> 01:28:24,375
Should we just kill him?

1078
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,541
So the virus doesn't spread.

1079
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:29,791
Just kill me. I'm going to die either way.

1080
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,041
You're going to be fine. I know that.

1081
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,958
Prill…

1082
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,333
you have to know this.

1083
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:46,875
I would be happy to see you in the band
for the last time before I die.

1084
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:51,416
What do you mean?

1085
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,083
You're the only one
who can play the bass here.

1086
01:28:56,875 --> 01:29:00,625
Please, if you don't want to see me
die in vain,

1087
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:03,791
play the bass now.

1088
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,166
-You're not going to die.
-I…

1089
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,583
Tie me up now.

1090
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:19,458
Afuk, just when you got a date,
you have to die.

1091
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:20,750
Poor Afuk.

1092
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:24,416
I'm really sorry I have to do this.

1093
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,791
The chords.

1094
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,333
Hurry up. Come on.

1095
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:34,125
It's bad.

1096
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,875
They're almost in.

1097
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,125
Kou, kou, kounaon, eh?

1098
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,208
Die, you all! Die!

1099
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:17,916
Research conducted
by Professor Oto from Zigot lab

1100
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,041
proves that the guitar used by Kagok Edan

1101
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:26,208
emits new frequencies

1102
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:30,291
that can actually affect the human brain,
which had never been discovered.

1103
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:34,125
I told you my song is good.

1104
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:38,666
I'm sure there will be more research
saying that your song is terrible.

1105
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:40,291
You always envy me.

1106
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:46,208
Ju, I have a friend.

1107
01:32:46,291 --> 01:32:49,916
Her name is Cindy. She's beautiful. Look.

1108
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,291
Prill, what do you think?

1109
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:57,791
-She's all right.
-"All right"?

1110
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,041
Five out of ten.

1111
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,500
-She's not bad.
-She's beautiful.

1112
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,750
-I think Marina is more beautiful.
-Seriously? Thank you.

1113
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:07,208
-Not bad.
-You want to get to know her?

1114
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:09,833
Next month, she's getting
gender reassignment with me.

1115
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,875
Kids are out of the question then.

1116
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,708
Five out of ten.

1117
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:20,250
Five out of ten and I can't have kids.

1118
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:22,458
-She's pretty.
-Isn't she?

1119
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:23,833
You got an extra stick for free.

1120
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,833
By the way, Kagok Edan got an offer
for an album.

1121
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:34,541
-Really?
-They want your song as the single.

Let me reply to their text. Okay.

1124
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:48,500
Prilly!

01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,125
What now?

1126
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,375
Look. Look at it.

1127
01:33:52,458 --> 01:33:54,708
