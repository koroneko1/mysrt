What is this?

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,693
It's a project we campaign against violent first-year activity.

00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,000

And the content you produce is rubbish!

15

I found a solution.

16
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:42,241

You just want to sleep so much
that you might be late for uni.

34

One of the students in our uni
made a clip of them pranking people.

67
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:36,577
A fake first-year activity.

68

But one student fainted for real.

69
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,448

that once you graduate,
you'll take on the business right away.

00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,849
Of course.

171
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,072
Take care.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,548
You guys, I had a serious thought about it.

173
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,871
If this music video gets released,

174
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,498
we're going to be famous for sure!

175
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:58,000
Our handsomeness is going to help restore uni's reputation!

176
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:00,572
- You think so?
- I think so.

177
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:04,000
I want you to look in the mirror when you dance.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you see it, you might not want to say stuff like that.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And you're so good at it!?

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,349
You're as bad as a squid!

181
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to splash you with some hot sauce!

182
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,324
Still, I think our performance is better
than those student club members.

183
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,224
Their moves were so lame.

184
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sure we'll be the ones who get all the credits.

185
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:35,000
Am I going to have energy left until shooting day?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not tired at all.

187
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,324
As long as I get close to Bear, I'll never run out of energy.

188
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,776
No matter what, we must do better than those guys.

189
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:50,253
If we fall behind,

190
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,523
they're definitely going to say bad things about us.

191
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:57,598
Don't say it that way. Not all of them are bad.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why do you have to protect them?

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Nothing. I just think we're all in this together anyway.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,573
But you, don't you think you're fanboying them too much?

195
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,751
You can't blame me for that.

196
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,205
Whatever.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,502
I don't like him.

198
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,220
Not to mention that he lives next door to my new home.

199
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,780
I meet him everywhere, university or at home.

200
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,655
What a bad luck!

201
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:28,797
It's your bad luck, not mine.

202
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, everyone. Let's do it again.

203
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,871
5 6 7 go!

204
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,967
1 2 3 4 go. 5 6 7 8 go.

205
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,983
1 2 3 4 go. 5 6 7 8 go.

206
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,784
Now, switch to this move.

207
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,697
5 6 7 8 go. 1 2 3 4 go.

208
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:01,847
Ouch.

209
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,203
Kim, are you okay?

210
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,228
- It hurts.
- Let me see.

211
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,427
Let's take a seat properly.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think we should call it a day for now.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,677
Kimhan should go get rest.

214
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,000
Otherwise, it might get worse.

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm still okay.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,448
Kimhan, you don't have to be the center.

217
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:33,303
If your performance is good enough,
you'll have a lot of airtime anyway.

218
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,357
Just go get rest.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,979
Yes, professor.

220
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay, I think it's enough for today.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,473
You can go back home and rehearse.

222
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:47,622
And we'll see you again on the shooting day.

223
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:50,373
It's showtime!

224
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,930
Let's just go home.

225
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:00,904
Kim, are you okay?

226
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:02,651
I'm totally fine.

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,477
I feel much better now.

228
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,000
Can you go home on your own?

229
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,124
Sure.

230
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:12,124
If you're not feeling okay, you can just go home with Mek.

231
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,373
Enough! Let's go home.

232
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,551
Be careful.

233
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:23,118
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:25,730
You two going somewhere next?

235
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,880
We can just part ways right here.

236
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,257
I'm tired and want to go home.

237
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:31,780
Let's go home then.

238
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,353
Hey, wait.

239
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,701
You want to go home together?

240
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,627
Mind your own business!

241
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:12,000
You're injured.
You don't have to keep acting like you're okay.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,054
Just hop in.

243
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,000
You might stumble if you keep walking.

244
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,149
Running into you is bad enough!

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Are you going to come with me or not?

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Otherwise, I'll just go.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Where's the helmet?

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,527
I thought so.

249
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:32,353
What did you just say?

250
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,457
Are you going to take this or not?

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,249
You're too slow. I'll go now!

252
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,021
Hey!

253
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:44,921
My foot hurts, remember?

254
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,776
To be honest, I didn't want to help you.

255
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:07,000
But I'm afraid you might not recover in time before the shooting and it'll affect me too.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,398
Worry about yourself first, eh?
You already look funny enough when you stand still.

257
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:00,256
Thanks.

258
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:01,349
It's fine.

259
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:05,496
To be honest, I didn't want to help you.

260
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:07,756
But I'm afraid you might not recover in time before the shooting.

261
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:08,896
And it will affect me too.

262
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,896
Worry about yourself, will you?

263
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:12,762
Make sure you rehearse well enough.

264
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,590
You already look funny enough when you stand still.

265
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,292
You cripple!

266
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:23,469
We'll see who the real center is on the shooting day.

267
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,781
I shouldn't have taken him home.

268
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:44,216
Let's see who's talking about me today.

269
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:59,603
This one doesn't have it.

270
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,437
What about the last episode?

271
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,991
Is there any?

272
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:09,437
No one talks about me.

273
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:13,106
I was hilarious in this one.
Yet no one likes it?

274
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:17,576
It's okay. I'll be overly dramatic next time.

275
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:22,016
Wait, here it is!

276
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,705
The same one again. Krissada.

277
00:18:25,297 --> 00:18:26,896
I should give him a heart.

278
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,992
"I've gained so much energy from seeing you, Bear."

279
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:32,584
I can totally see how much effort you put in to make it fun.

280
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:33,896
Keep up, Bear!

281
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,723
This Krissada guy is so active on comments for me.

282
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,769
I wonder what he looks like.

283
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:45,896
I'll buy him a meal if I meet him.

284
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,536
In fact, make it two.

285
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:23,752
Enough you, guys.

286
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,616
How long are you going to keep walking in slow motion?

287
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,266
Sorry.

288
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,208
Don't screw it up.

289
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:36,496
That's quite a mouth you have.

290
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:38,687
We'll see.

291
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:53,603
You guys, I still can't dance good enough.

292
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:56,775
We may have to do multiple takes.

293
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:01,246
Just don't worry. You're with me, a dance expert.

294
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:02,737
You can trust me.

295
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,246
Don't embarrass ourselves in front of these guys.

296
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:09,432
On set, we must be on fire!

297
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,896
Say No SOTUS. Scene 10. Cut 1. Take 1.

298
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,342
Cut!

299
00:20:48,342 --> 00:20:50,896
Great job! That was a good take.

300
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,113
Excellent!

301
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:09,189
I don't think they can't dance.

302
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:10,734
Did you see how the director compliments them?

303
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:11,896
Damn.

304
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,576
But I think that was the sexiest move.

305
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,539
Wow.

306
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:27,083
Ever since we date,
I've never seen you in such great dance move.

307
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,419
I'm completely surprised.

308
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:35,202
Anyway, I think the buttons' off not because of the dance.

309
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,896
It's because you're fat!

310
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:42,656
Hey, don't tease me.

311
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:44,603
I just wanted to do my best.

312
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:47,896
Your best indeed.

313
00:21:57,896 --> 00:21:59,216
What are you doing?

314
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:02,896
Are you going to do it here?

315
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,030
What?

316
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,656
What are you thinking?

317
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:09,304
Just wear my shirt.

318
00:22:09,304 --> 00:22:10,736
And I'll fix yours.

319
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:18,743
You love teasing me!

320
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,633
Who did this?

321
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:29,457
Thank you so much.

322
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,896
Park!!!

323
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:37,106
What are you doing in here?

324
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,622
What's with you? I just want to compliment you.

325
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:42,660
That you did so great out there.

326
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,546
The move when you burst out your buttons.

327
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:45,896
It still lingers in my eyes.

328
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,776
I'm so proud of you.

329
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:51,896
This is not the time.

330
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:55,016
We should go out.

331
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,896
Perhaps I can teach you this move.

332
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,756
Okay, let's rehearse in front of the mirror first.

333
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:01,896
Just go out.

334
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:05,896
Wait.

335
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,246
Don't tell me...

336
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,425
Just go, go!

337
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:16,828
Just go already.

338
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,418
Okay now?

339
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,979
Are we filming?

340
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:26,144
Now I can get started?

341
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:28,851
Hello, everybody!

342
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:32,214
Today, I'm taking you to the behind-the-scene

343
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:34,896
for the Say No SOTUS music video.

344
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,004
It is a special project from our university.

345
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:42,896
We came up with this project so that our students and future students...

346
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,896
can be confident...

347
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:50,068
that our university doesn't support violence in any first-year activity.

348
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,176
Without further a do,

349
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:55,367
Let's take you all to see our main actors.

350
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,870
Follow me!

351
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,497
Is it good?

352
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,322
I need to cover the camera like this, no?

353
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,641
Mek, Kim, please come on set.

354
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:05,094
Okay.

355
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,896
Your dance move isn't so bad.

356
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,354
Of course.

357
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:21,355
I have many talents.

358
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,323
You have such high confidence!

359
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:28,896
Now, let's meet with the actors

360
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:31,240
who are so dedicated to this project.

361
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,896
Please introduce yourself.

362
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:35,775
Hello, I'm Kimhan.

363
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,355
I'm this year's president of student club.

364
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,896
Hello, I'm Mek from Thunderous Sky channel.

365
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,896
And you'll love me like a bang!

366
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:46,896
You've probably seen his face from that famous clip, right?

367
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:50,329
Yes, Mek is joining our project.

368
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:53,896
I'd like to take this opportunity to say that...

369
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,896
the clip people that went viral

370
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:59,233
was only a video made just for fun.

371
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,992
No one was actually harmed.

372
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,641
Is there anything you two want to talk to viewers?

373
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:05,896
Mek first.

374
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:07,361
Yes.

375
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,896
It was just a fake content.

376
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:12,622
It's a misunderstanding of people on the internet.

377
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:16,896
The only fake one is the video creator.

378
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:18,508
I'm sure you all can see now...

379
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:22,075
how our university has absolutely no SOTUS.

380
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:25,603
Is there anything else you want to say?

381
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:28,609
As a club president this year,

382
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,660
I want you all to join Say No SOTUS project with us.

383
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,896
I just hope that everyone...

384
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:53,896
This is the path to our superstardom.

385
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,816
Say No SOTUS! Say No SOTUS!

386
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,641
Should I go audition at 411?

387
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:28,343
As this year's student club president,

388
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:30,343
I'd like to ask you all...

389
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:32,343
to help support Say No SOTUS project.

390
00:26:58,059 --> 00:26:59,099
Wow.

391
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:01,221
This scene is so cliché.

392
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:05,059
You're okay, right?

393
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:08,568
Yes, I'm alright.

394
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,119
Cut!

395
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:34,750
Great job! The shooting is done for today!

396
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:40,343
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.

397
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:46,343
Hey, fart bag.

398
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:50,403
After this is all done, I hope not to see you again.

399
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,343
That would be good for me too.

400
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,543
I've never wanted to work with you anyway.

401
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,988
About that thing earlier...

402
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,285
Thanks.

403
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,343
So you can't say I owe you anything anymore.

404
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,017
You're welcome, brother.

405
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:29,663
But you know, we'll meet again at home anyway.

406
00:29:10,263 --> 00:29:12,242
We can have all the activities without SOTUS.

407
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,771
All activities can be done without SOTUS.

408
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:18,768
We're friends. We're fun. We're equal.

409
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:42,585
We're so handsome

410
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:43,350
slick

411
00:29:43,594 --> 00:29:45,343
and smooth like butter.

412
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,793
I feel strange somehow.

413
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,610
when people staring at us.

414
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,160
You're getting used to it soon.

415
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,343
This is the path to our superstardom.

416
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:06,468
Say No SOTUS. Say No SOTUS.

417
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,590
This gives me goose bumps.

418
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:23,056
I think it's not that bad.

419
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:26,465
Doing something like this once in a lifetime is fun.

420
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:30,343
Yeah, because once is more than enough.

421
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,405
It's so embarrassing.

422
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:35,465
I want to do something like this again.

423
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,976
It allows me to be in the same frame with Bear.

424
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:41,486
You do it alone next time then.

425
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,343
I'll pass.

426
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,663
I'm not sure if this is actually a great work or a real shame.

427
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:52,343
Say No SOTUS. Say No SOTUS.

428
00:30:59,037 --> 00:30:59,896
Ouch!

429
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,170
Here's Longa for you.

430
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:03,730
It's a sparkling longan juice.

431
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:04,608
Try it.

432
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,260
I was craving something refreshing just now.

433
00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:12,158
Baby, you always chooses the best for me.

434
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,058
I've seen you work so hard.

435
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:16,058
You need to add some vitamin to your body.

436
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,543
Thank you so much.

437
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:28,983
You're trying to boost more views for yourself, huh?

438
00:31:29,343 --> 00:31:31,343
I've never done such a thing before.

439
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:33,343
It's fun, though.

440
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,343
Didn't you enjoy it?

441
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,425
Sure I did.

442
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:41,343
Who would have thought I can see my boyfriend
ripped his shirt and burst his buttons off?

443
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:42,286
Pop!

444
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,139
You sure love to tease me.

445
00:31:46,098 --> 00:31:47,730
I'll wait and see when it happens to you.

446
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,078
Let's just keep watching the video.

447
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,772
Check this out. Who's that?

448
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:56,140
How's things with you lately?

449
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,578
Studying hard?

450
00:31:58,343 --> 00:32:02,628
Not at all. After I moved to this faculty,
it's much easier than when I was in Comm Arts.

451
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,750
Friends are great and assignment isn't so tough.

452
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,547
Wasting two years of my life is worth it.

453
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:12,791
If you need any help, just let me know.

454
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:17,710
Then, can you help me with something now?

455
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:22,322
I want to boost my energy.

456
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:33,507
And here.

457
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:36,932
And here.

458
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:37,799
And here.

459
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:38,890
Here.

460
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,584
Here.

461
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:42,640
Here. Here. Here. Here.

462
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:44,038
- Here. Here. Here.
- Is that enough yet?

463
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,425
I realize I am handsome.

464
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:59,588
But I never knew I was also a talented dancer.

465
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:01,667
I was thinking...

466
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,385
Maybe I should audition at 411.

467
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:10,588
What dance? I didn't know that.

468
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:14,016
The Say No SOTUS song.

469
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,241
I was so cool on that!

470
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,546
Say No SOTUS what?

471
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:24,016
I was actually excited about this clip.

472
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:29,506
You act like you hate him
but you actually like each other, do you?

473
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:30,671
Here!

474
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,507
Shit!

475
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,343
Say No SOTUS mv...

476
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:53,751
that we put a lot of effort into

477
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,265
have got...

478
00:33:55,673 --> 00:33:57,751
3,000 views.

479
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,223
Kimhan!

480
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,303
Mek!

481
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:11,690
Did you two realize what you have done!?

482
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:14,283
You!

483
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,343
And you!

484
00:34:16,343 --> 00:34:20,343
You two DID A GREAT JOB!

485
00:34:20,463 --> 00:34:25,943
You two are the new hope for our university!

486
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,343
How is that possible?

487
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:28,039
Yeah, how is that?

488
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:34,588
Don't you see we have only 4,000 subscribers
on the university channel?

489
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,732
But this incident makes us realize...

490
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:42,649
what people on the internet actually want.

491
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,587
That's why I decided...

492
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:55,343
You two must do BL content

493
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:58,118
to promote our university

494
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:03,483
and get more people to subscribe to our channel.

495
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:04,324
What!?

496
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:06,793
No more questions.

497
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:08,248
Isn't this a great opportunity?

498
00:35:08,343 --> 00:35:13,116
This is how we're going to build a new image for the university

499
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,098
so people will see that...

500
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:19,649
we are very open in terms of
gender and expression of love.

501
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:24,343
But what you are trying to do is fake content

502
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,583
instead of being really open.

503
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,813
That's right.

504
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,648
Besides, we all have other things to do.

505
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:33,476
Also...

506
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:36,729
Say No SOTUS is going well too, isn't it?

507
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:38,627
I guess...

508
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:43,976
I haven't told you that..

509
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:47,343
when this project ends

510
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,995
you will not be in suspension anymore.

511
00:35:54,463 --> 00:35:58,343
Well, let me just say this officially.

512
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:00,973
All six of you...

513
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:05,343
must help create content

514
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:09,783
with Mek and Kim as a BL couple

515
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:12,934
to promote our university.

516
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:17,688
and attract more people to subscribe to our university channel.

517
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:19,934
The target is 100,000 subscribers.

518
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:25,078
If you can't make it...

519
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,324
I'll probably have to...

520
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,424
remove you all from the positions in the student club.

521
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:36,404
And the three of you...

522
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:39,853
might not be able to graduate.

523
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:41,548
Goddamn!!!

524
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,628
Just calm down.

525
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:48,023
This is all because of you!

526
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:48,841
No, you!

527
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:58,783
If we refuse to do it, she won't let us graduate.

528
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,906
I guess I'll have to really do this BL content thing.

529
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:03,323
Don't touch me!

530
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:04,497
What is wrong with you?

531
00:37:29,387 --> 00:37:31,314
Bear, eat something.

532
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:38,954
Does this mean we have to abandon our fans and make fake BL content now?

533
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,387
No way! I can't accept it!

534
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,973
If we don't do it, the chancellor won't let us graduate.

535
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:52,187
She's basically forcing us.
How is this "saying no" to SOTUS?

536
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:56,198
That's why I want to know

537
00:37:56,473 --> 00:37:57,820
who "Nutsuda57" is.

538
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:00,808
That person who released your clip.

539
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:04,217
If I meet them, I'm gonna kick their ass!

540
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:07,318
I think...

541
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,887
they'll make you do it for just a little while.

542
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:12,387
You know...

543
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:14,707
Just to ride this wave a bit.

544
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:16,808
What about Thunderous Sky?

545
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:18,643
We should take a break on our channel.

546
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:21,570
Now we must help out each other on this.

547
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,625
Otherwise, we're all screwed.

548
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:37,347
Guys, how many IG followers did I have recently?

549
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,723
3,000 maybe.

550
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,918
Now it's 10k!

551
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,211
You're becoming famous now?

552
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:47,667
Let me check mine as well.

553
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,387
Why do I still have only 1,500?

554
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:52,691
Why can't I have more followers like you?

555
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,948
I guess I'll really have to do this BL content thing.

556
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:03,680
This might be the only way...

557
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,387
to gain more hailstone members

558
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:09,174
without having to create content on our channel.

559
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:13,795
Awesomeeee!

560
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,187
Brother, brother.

561
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:42,410
You're listening to Isaan song?

562
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:46,325
Shit!

563
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:54,747
Where are you going?

564
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,069
Just sit here first.

565
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,344
I'm a little embarrassed.

566
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,387
Okay.

567
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,497
What's your name?

568
00:40:07,497 --> 00:40:10,174
We've met several times but I didn't catch it.

569
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:11,735
My name is Bomb.

570
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:12,820
Bomb?

571
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,639
Did you get that name because you pooped your pants when you were a kid?

572
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,362
You can think like that if you want.

573
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:28,918
So...where are you headed? Home?

574
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:31,332
I'm going to work actually.

575
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:34,186
I work as a part-time waiter at a restaurant nearby.

576
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,453
That's awesome.

577
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,229
I want to return this to you.

578
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,387
Oh, that's okay.

579
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:55,710
Just keep it.

580
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,277
I have another one here.

581
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:02,186
It smells really good.

582
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:09,229
I gotta go now. See you later.

583
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,497
Bye-bye.

584
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:30,668
Your heart is beating so fast, Bomb.

585
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:00,451
What?

586
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:01,592
Baby...

587
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,448
Who did that to you?

588
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,418
You're crossing the line!

589
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:14,222
Just a little. It's no big deal.

590
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:15,690
By the way...

591
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:17,688
It's good that you get some cold water

592
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:19,907
so now you can calm down a bit.

593
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:24,856
You're playing like a child!

594
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:26,893
You calm down already?

595
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:29,948
Stay right there!

596
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:30,818
Don't go anywhere!

597
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:33,533
Oh, so you're coming to see your BL mate right at his place?

598
00:42:33,753 --> 00:42:35,587
Why are you in such a rush?

599
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:36,326
Yeah, I am!

600
00:42:36,326 --> 00:42:37,039
My, my!

601
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,435
Why are you in here?

602
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,387
I'll splash it.

603
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:41,038
Sure! Come! Do it.

604
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,483
I'll fight you!

605
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:43,149
Come at me.

606
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:44,387
Come on.

607
00:42:45,267 --> 00:42:46,279
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:47,353
Don't touch me!

609
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:48,821
What is wrong with you?

610
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,036
Stop playing like a child.
Give it to me!

611
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:04,313
How you like that, huh?

612
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:13,101
- Enough. I said enough!
- Come, come!

613
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:15,604
Come on!

614
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:18,526
Well, well well.

615
00:43:18,526 --> 00:43:20,369
I didn't know you woke up early to create content.

616
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:22,161
Here.

617
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,039
This is wonderful!

618
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:41,021
Hello, Kimhan.

619
00:43:41,131 --> 00:43:42,563
I already saw the clip.

620
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,387
You did a great job.

621
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:46,590
But next time...

622
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,855
Make sure you publish it on university channel, okay?

623
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:51,627
One more thing..

624
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:54,005
This is weekend.

625
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:55,669
You don't have to work this hard on content.

626
00:43:55,907 --> 00:43:59,147
I don't want to bother you in your personal time.

627
00:43:59,147 --> 00:43:59,647
But...

628
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,996
If you do want to spend time with Mek,

629
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,460
I won't forbid it.

630
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:10,545
Ugh! What the heck is this!?

631
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:16,925
[Nutsuda Ittipatchara]

632
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:19,887
I want to know who "Nutsuda57" is.

633
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:22,107
That person who released your clip.

634
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:23,618
They have such a great chemistry.

635
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:27,240
Should I create a fandom for them?

636
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:30,021
What should be the name of this fandom?

637
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:36,014
Can you suggest me a name?

638
00:44:37,197 --> 00:44:39,472
Besides acting as a BL couple,

639
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,003
you need to help sell this t-shirt as well.

640
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:44,149
If we can't sell this t-shirt, we're all screwed.

641
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:45,079
What the hell?

642
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:49,387
You love dancing that much?

643
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:52,808
I'd love to eat Kimhan's egg.

644
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,387
This is almost like a harassment content.

645
00:44:55,387 --> 00:44:57,387
People want to see something cute, don't you think?

646
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:02,867
Our brothers are going to win the popular BL couple award!

647
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,387
How long do we need to keep making this kind of content?

648
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:07,387
I'm definitely not going to leave our channel.

649
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:09,387
We just need to prioritize on this matter first.

650
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,387
Or maybe you're just enjoying this BL fame.
