2
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.839
What's going on, Mook?

3
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.199
I have to tell you something.

4
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.639
It's up to you to believe me or not.

5
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
I went to get my camera fixed.

6
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.839
Because I had dropped it.
I thought it wasn't working properly.

7
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.480
But the guy at the shop said
there was nothing wrong.

8
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.319
So I had some photos printed.

9
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.560
The thing is…

10
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.720
I got suspicious of Praewa when Kin died.

11
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.160
That's why I was following her
and taking photos of her.

12
00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.240
One time, I ran into her
in the ladies' room,

13
00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.040
and she was chanting something.

14
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.600
Here.

15
00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.879
Look at these, from the first photo,

16
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.759
there is a dark shadow
following her everywhere.

17
00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.800
It gets darker and darker.

18
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.160
Whose photos are these, Dan?

19
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.639
Why is there a dark shadow like Praewa's?

20
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.600
She's...

21
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.079
Praewa's adoptive mother.

22
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.519
It looks like they know how to perform

23
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.120
some kind of occult ritual.

24
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.720
If Praewa is really connected
to these people,

25
00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:34.160
that explains the deaths
of Kin, Ping, and Professor Pat.

26
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.639
Hey…

27
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.439
Are you saying that

28
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.160
Praewa…

29
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.480
used black magic to do that?

30
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.560
Just think about when Praewa
was attacked by Aya.

31
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.040
It's not surprising

32
00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.680
that Praewa would do this.

33
00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.600
It's revenge.

34
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.519
Nobody

35
00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:03.600
would believe this.

36
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.720
What we can do now

37
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.879
is to tell everyone to be careful.

38
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.160
You too, Khaimook.

41
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.120
Here.

42
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.720
Just a moment.

43
00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.079
Here.

44
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.879
-Okay, thank you.
-All good?

45
00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.079
Okay, thank you.

MIKE

48
00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:34.200
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE DAYS
TO PAY THE REST OF WHAT YOU OWE ME

49
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240
You want to be me, huh?

50
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.639
Even in the next life…

51
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.039
you could never be like me.

52
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.519
And it was Professor Pat

53
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600
who told Nat and Brave

54
00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.480
to tell everyone
that it was you in the clip.

55
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.039
Whatever you say, no one will believe you.

56
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.440
Find the woman in that clip,

57
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.879
because it's her…

58
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.879
who put black magic on you.

59
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.279
It's beautiful up here.

60
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.399
That's why…

61
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.840
you come here often.

62
00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:13.879
Please stop this, Praewa,

63
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.720
if you are the one
who's causing all of this.

64
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.240
What did I do?

65
00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.440
What do you know?

66
00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:45.320
I just want to warn you.

67
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.120
Before you do something more terrible.

68
00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.360
Something more terrible?

69
00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:06.120
You know what, Lilin?

70
00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:09.919
Before,

71
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.720
I asked them to stop as well.

72
00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.120
Do you know…

73
00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.840
what they did to me?

74
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.039
They treated me like an animal.

75
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.559
An animal that didn't deserve to live.

76
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.840
What a shame...

77
00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.720
that you weren't there.

78
00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:03.279
Otherwise,

79
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.480
maybe you could have
begged them not to hurt me.

80
00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:13.279
Like you are trying to do now.

81
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.360
There is a rumor going around

82
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.159
that people in the Cheer Club
use black magic on each other.

83
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.720
Yes, I heard that too.

84
00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:43.159
They must be jealous of each other.

85
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.840
Who would want to be around them, right?

86
00:14:51.679 --> 00:14:52.600
-Shit.
-Shit.

87
00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:11.600
Nat.

88
00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:15.279
I'm bringing you all of these

89
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.440
for your protection.

90
00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.159
Keep them.

91
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.320
Nat.

92
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:26.039
I have so many of them.

93
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.440
Just have a look first.

94
00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.519
Luang Pu Rod's money cowry.

95
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.039
Luang Por Uttama's beads.

96
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.000
And I also have this, this is the best,

97
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.159
Luang Pu Pring's candy.

98
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.519
You might not believe in them,

99
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.200
but just keep them in your bag.

100
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.639
Will you just leave me the hell alone?

101
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.039
Your ship is fucking dead.

102
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.799
I'm straight, I'm not gay.

103
00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.000
Hey, Dan.

104
00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.240
Hey, there.

105
00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:18.720
I heard you had a rough one with Nat.

106
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:19.839
How are you?

107
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.079
I feel numb.

108
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.160
If it had been someone else,

109
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.160
I would have fought back.

110
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.079
Come on now. I mean…

111
00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:38.599
Everybody is stressed out at the moment.

112
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.960
If you really love him

113
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.640
and admire him,

114
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.640
just keep at it.

115
00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.759
Don't expect anything in return.

116
00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.279
You are such a saint.

117
00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.400
Of course I am.

118
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.720
I want to give you a medal.

119
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.880
Don't worry.

120
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.880
Keep it up.

121
00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.799
Are we here?

122
00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:02.799
Yes, we are.

123
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.160
I fell asleep.

124
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.640
I should go.

125
00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:15.359
Okay.

126
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.319
Okay.

127
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.000
See you.

128
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.720
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes.

129
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:41.920
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

130
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.559
If you have magic,

131
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.680
then fight me.

132
00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:55.440
Fight me.

133
00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.480
Please stop, Praewa.

134
00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:12.759
Before you do something more terrible.

135
00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:48.920
Brave, do you think it's strange?

136
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.160
Things happened one after another,

137
00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:59.200
with Kin, Ping, and then Professor Pat.

138
00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:07.400
It may just be a coincidence.

139
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.799
Things like this

140
00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:13.519
can happen.

141
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:18.119
I don't know.

142
00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.559
I don't feel right.

143
00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:26.079
Don't think too much, Aya.

144
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.680
We haven't had sex in a while.

145
00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:43.200
No.

146
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.079
Brave.

147
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.680
Brave, I said no.

148
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.960
What's wrong with you?

149
00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.880
Why are you bothered by it?

150
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.559
Of course I'm bothered.

151
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.960
You don't understand.

152
00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.880
You didn't see what I saw.

153
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.799
And I'm not like you,

154
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.559
who still gets turned on
even when bad shit happens.

155
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.039
Hello.

156
00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:20.279
Did you book someone?

157
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.000
No.

158
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.119
-I see.
-It's my first time.

159
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.039
It's all right.

160
00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:26.680
I'll give you recommendations.

161
00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:27.720
Here.

162
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.519
This is Fah.

163
00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:34.440
She's petite and cute.

164
00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:36.319
She can give you a therapeutic massage.

165
00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:42.240
This is Melon.

166
00:26:42.319 --> 00:26:44.440
Pretty and talkative.

167
00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:46.680
Very strong.

168
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.119
This is our new girl, Som-O.

169
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.720
Her skin is fair and smooth.
She's very gentle.

170
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.839
She gives a gentle massage.

171
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.640
Tell me which one you want.

172
00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:07.319
SOM-O

173
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.240
Aren't you naughty!

174
00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:51.839
Your name is a fruit.

175
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.440
Just want to see how juicy you are.

176
00:27:59.039 --> 00:27:59.960
Hey.

177
00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:02.079
I knew it.

178
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160
I thought you looked familiar.

179
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.240
What prank are you trying to pull?

180
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.519
I'm not.

181
00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:13.279
You are handsome.

182
00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:15.640
And in terms of performance,

183
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.640
you're no slouch either.

184
00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.559
What performance?

185
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:23.400
Stop pretending.

186
00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:25.880
I recognize you.

187
00:28:27.079 --> 00:28:28.279
Pretending what?

188
00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:32.440
Wait a moment.

189
00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:44.640
Here.

190
00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.920
CHEERLEADER FROM A TOP UNIVERSITY
WITH A HOT GIRL

191
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.440
Shit.

192
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.200
Where did you get this?

193
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.119
Come on.

194
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.279
People in the VIP group shared them,
and they were passed around.

195
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:15.920
This one is the latest.

196
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.519
But there are more clips from before.

197
00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:21.440
I'm a fan.

198
00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:22.640
HOT VIP CLIPS

199
00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.440
You are hot.

200
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.920
-How are you, Lilin?
-Lin.

201
00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:44.920
I'm feeling better.

202
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.240
I just have a little headache now.

203
00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:51.200
What happened?

204
00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:54.519
Is it Praewa again?

205
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.079
First Professor Pat,

206
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.480
and now Lilin.

207
00:30:06.319 --> 00:30:09.839
Why is Praewa attacking people
that weren't involved?

208
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.039
Maybe…

209
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.799
Praewa wants
to hurt everyone in the Cheer Club.

210
00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:32.720
I should go check up on Nat.

211
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.359
I have a bad feeling.

212
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.559
Khaimook.

213
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.440
Khaimook.

214
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.559
Damn it.

215
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.240
KHAIMOOK

216
00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:26.960
Shit.

217
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.200
-Hello?
-Hi.

218
00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:47.319
Your relative is here,
waiting for you downstairs.

219
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.559
-My relative?
-Yes.

220
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.400
He says he's from out of town.

221
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.799
It's something urgent.

222
00:31:54.839 --> 00:31:56.079
Okay.

223
00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:32.240
Asshole, what the fuck?

224
00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:34.400
-What the fuck did you do?
-What did I do?

225
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.559
You didn't lose your phone.

226
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.799
-What are you talking about?
-So you lied...

227
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.799
and forgot about it, you bastard?

228
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.720
What are you talking about?

229
00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:42.759
I don't understand.

230
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.799
What did you do with my clips?

231
00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:49.720
What are you talking about?

232
00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:51.759
Explain this to me.

233
00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.480
I lost my phone.

234
00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:00.839
You know that.

235
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.039
I'm not stupid.

236
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.039
These clips were shared
before this thing with Praewa started.

237
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.480
So they were already leaked
before you lost your phone.

238
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.240
I trusted you.

239
00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:14.559
You were my best friend.

240
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.039
How could you do this to me?

241
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.640
How?

242
00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:25.200
Why did you do it?

243
00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:28.519
I'm asking why you did it!

244
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.519
Yes, it was me who shared your clips.

245
00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:40.720
I needed money.

246
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400
But it was you

247
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.680
who sent me those clips.

248
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.880
You needed money?

249
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.440
That's a fucking lame excuse.

250
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.400
Brave,

251
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.599
watch me.

252
00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:15.239
When I share this clip,

253
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.639
you'll be in deep shit.

254
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.119
Hey, I have a new clip.

255
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.400
Call it the sex tape of the year.

256
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.760
Stop talking.

257
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.199
Send it to me right away.

258
00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.280
If it's good, I'll give you good money.

259
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.920
I assure you it's good.

260
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.920
Because this is the full version
of the last clip

261
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.760
where everyone wants to know
who the girl is.

262
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.960
Hurry up and send it.

263
00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:48.480
If you send it now,
you get your money right away.

264
00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.400
Of course.

265
00:35:53.159 --> 00:35:55.119
AE

266
00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:58.760
I HAVE MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM

267
00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.559
Shit!

268
00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:45.159
Shit!

269
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.079
Shit!

270
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.599
Shit!

271
00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:08.039
What the fuck?

272
00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:52.239
Hi, Nat.

273
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.239
All the shit that happened,
you were the one behind it, weren't you?

274
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.159
Nat.

275
00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.559
Let me ask you this...

276
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.159
Do you really think all of this happened

277
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.480
because of me?

278
00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:22.119
I was minding my own business.

279
00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:26.079
Wasn't it you guys

280
00:38:27.679 --> 00:38:30.320
that did all that shit
and blamed it on me?

281
00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:36.320
I really want to know

282
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.559
how much money a good guy like you

283
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.840
has made off your friends.

284
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.280
What are you talking about?

285
00:38:58.239 --> 00:38:59.199
You know

286
00:39:01.199 --> 00:39:02.920
that girl in the clip isn't me.

287
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.639
I'll give you a chance

288
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.159
to tell me who that girl is.

289
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.760
Why are you asking me?

290
00:39:20.519 --> 00:39:22.039
I wasn't the one who banged her.

291
00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:23.719
If you want to know,

292
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.800
why don't you go ask Brave?

293
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.719
I don't know.

294
00:39:30.039 --> 00:39:32.159
Wasn't it this hand

295
00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:34.599
that shared that fucking clip?

296
00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:47.840
So you're also protecting
the girl in the clip.

297
00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:51.519
I really want to know

298
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.440
who that bitch is

299
00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:57.000
and why you would go to all the trouble

300
00:39:57.079 --> 00:39:59.039
of putting a death curse on me
to shut me up!

301
00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:01.440
What do you mean?

302
00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.679
Who put a death curse on you?

303
00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:06.159
I don't know.

304
00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:08.360
You should go after them, then.

305
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.559
Look at you.

306
00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:20.679
You keep saying that you don't know.

307
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.320
And if you don't know,

308
00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:27.679
then you are no use to me.

309
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.480
What should I do with you?

310
00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:34.079
If you hurt me,

311
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.800
you will never know the truth.

312
00:40:40.559 --> 00:40:42.199
Really?

313
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.679
Really, Nat?

314
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.679
Really?

315
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.239
Really?

316
00:40:47.119 --> 00:40:48.519
Really?

317
00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:51.559
Tell me.

318
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.960
Damn.

319
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.840
How did you do it?

320
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.920
I don't know.

321
00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:08.800
But it was pretty easy.

322
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.960
Wow.

323
00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:12.719
I salute you.

324
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.239
Grand master.

325
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.360
Give me a review.

326
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:17.199
How is this one?

327
00:41:19.719 --> 00:41:21.320
Ten for the body.

328
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.800
But as for the performance,

329
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.360
she's got a lot to learn.

330
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.320
Anyway, I want to give her another lesson.

331
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920
Damn.

332
00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:31.679
I have to give it to you this time.

333
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.880
Next time, it'll be my turn.

334
00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:37.199
Bring it on.

335
00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:40.639
I sent it to you.

336
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.960
IF IT'S NOT GOOD, I WON'T PAY

337
00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:26.679
Hey, man.

338
00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:29.199
I just sent it.

339
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.079
This is just a teaser.

340
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:32.679
I have the full clip.

341
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.800
Just send me the money first.

342
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.599
Okay?

343
00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:38.639
Okay.

344

Hello, pizza delivery.
