‎-Cake!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.940
‎No, Dad... Mr Dupain! Move aside!

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.660
‎Wow! My heart is just like
‎that yoyo-wrapped baby's wrist,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.180
‎taken prisoner by Milady forever!

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.900
‎-Aaah!
‎-Cake!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.340
‎Ah! Adrien's lips! Aaah!

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.820
‎Admit it. For a second there,
‎you almost fell for my poetic verse.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.540
‎I never fall for your poetry,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
‎but I do find your foolishness
‎incredibly powerful.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.100
‎Lucky charm!

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.820
‎Cake!

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.860
‎-Not cake!
‎-Your plastic doughnut

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.300
‎doesn't stand a chance against the best
‎macaroons in Paris. That baby has taste!

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.340
‎That's Marinette's bedroom!

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.540
‎Marinette! Marinette!

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.060
‎Cat Noir, grab this!

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.380
‎-Marinette!
‎-Cataclysm!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.820
‎-Marinette! Marinette!
‎-Miraculous Ladybug!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.860
‎Marinette? Marinette!

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.020
‎Marinette?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.540
‎-So, what was it this time?
‎-A late-night craving, huh, baby August?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.100
‎Oh, you're so cute!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.940
‎I'm a bit jealous.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.820
‎Don't be. Here, you can have him.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.300
‎Bye-bye, little guy.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620
‎I meant jealous of him!

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.820
‎Spots off!

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.700
‎-Tom?
‎-Marinette is not in her bedroom!

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.020
‎You miss her already, too?
‎I know how it feels.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.860
‎Gummy.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.580
‎Ah, of course! The pacifier!

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.380
‎Gummy!

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.340
‎Marinette?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.620
‎This isn't the first time

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.500
‎I've seen you right after
‎Ladybug's transformed back.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.820
‎Could you be... ?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.860
‎In love with you!

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.700
‎Marinette?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.820
‎-Cake!
‎-Well, I never! Whoa!

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.340
‎Oh! Well, perfect timing. I have to go
‎and bring him back to his mother!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.700
‎Wait! Why don't you come have
‎Sunday brunch with us tomorrow?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.580
‎I'll make macaroons!

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.460
‎How could I say no to that?
‎Well, see you tomorrow, then!

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.060
‎I just thought that she followed us
‎everywhere because she's a fan of Ladybug.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.940
‎But it turns out
‎that she's in love with me.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.260
‎Do you realise? It's the first time that
‎a girl's told me she's in love with me.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.180
‎Tell me about it. If only Ladybug
‎would confess her love to me like that.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.700
‎This is a total disaster!

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.180
‎-You shouldn't have lied, Marinette.
‎-But he was about to figure out

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.420
‎-that I'm Ladybug!
‎-Now everyone thinks

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.700
‎that you're in love with him!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.500
‎Our daughter's boyfriend
‎is coming for lunch!

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.660
‎Do you realise Marinette has a boyfriend?

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.380
‎And he's a superhero on top of that!

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.740
‎She'll be safe with him.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.660
‎Aren't you jumping the gun a little, Tom?

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.900
‎You're right. I can't be baking dessert

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.900
‎when I haven't even started
‎on the first course yet!

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.860
‎I know! I'm going to cook them
‎a delicious sweethearts' vol-au-vent!

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.460
‎Now, where are the candied oranges?

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.780
‎What I meant is that Cat Noir
‎hasn't said anything about<i>‎ his</i>‎ feelings.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.380
‎Come on, it's obvious
‎he's in love with Marinette!

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.260
‎Besides, who wouldn't love Marinette?
‎Everyone loves Marinette!

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.180
‎You finally got yourself a girlfriend.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.980
‎And not any girlfriend.
‎The daughter of the best baker in Paris!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.260
‎Marinette in love with Cat Noir?
‎I didn't think he was her type!

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.140
‎Before you know it, we'll be enjoying
‎some warm and crispy bread

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.940
‎to go with every piece of cheese.
‎Our life is about to change!

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.780
‎Stop it, Plagg.
‎You know I'm in love with Ladybug!

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.220
‎So? I don't see the problem in keeping
‎two pots simmering on the stove!

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.900
‎Especially when
‎there's actually only one pot.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.900
‎I have to be honest with Marinette.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.660
‎I'll go over for brunch,
‎but only to tell her the truth.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.140
‎Are you kidding? At least, please wait
‎until after the cheese platter is served!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.660
‎He's not coming.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.140
‎But if he does,
‎what are you going to say to him?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.860
‎I'm sure he's not coming!
‎He's in love with Ladybug!

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.500
‎He's not gonna come just for macaroons!

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.220
‎He's been rejected so many times
‎by Ladybug. Maybe he's changed his mind!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.340
‎Cat Noir, change his mind? Ha!
‎I seriously doubt it.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.820
‎No one's as stubborn
‎and one-track minded as him!

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.020
‎-Shouldn't we be at Marinette's already?
‎-Shh!

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.500
‎Adrien, you have 24 minutes
‎to finish your lunch

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.100
‎before it's time to review
‎your Chinese lesson.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.620
‎Is my father too busy
‎to have lunch with me again?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.740
‎Indeed. Your next meal with your father
‎is next Thursday,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.220
‎-between 7:30 am and 7:45 am.
‎-In that case,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.980
‎I'll have my lunch in my room
‎while studying Chinese.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.740
‎At least talking while I eat
‎will feel like I have some company!

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.340
‎Delicious bread, here we come!

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.420
‎I told you, we're not going for brunch.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.380
‎I'll only tell Marinette that she's
‎not the one I love. Then we'll leave.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.260
‎She's going to be so sad.
‎How could I make this easier on her?

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.660
‎You're right. Breaking her heart
‎with flowers will be<i>‎ much</i>‎ more romantic.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.220
‎I told you he won't come.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.780
‎Huh!

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.940
‎Looks like you underestimated
‎Cat Noir's love of macaroons!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.020
‎I don't believe it! What a glutton!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.180
‎Oh, no! What if this doofus has
‎actually fallen in love with me?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.860
‎For what, seconds?
‎Is that all his love for Ladybug is worth?

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.900
‎Just one tiny declaration of love
‎and that's it, poof! He changes his mind?

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.140
‎Uh, since you and Ladybug are the same
‎person, he didn't exactly change his mind.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.820
‎Oh, no! I definitely have to tell him
‎that I'm not really in love with him!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.700
‎Wait! I can't!
‎If I tell him that I don't love him,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.700
‎he won't understand
‎why I told him that I loved him!

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.420
‎I only told him so he wouldn't
‎figure out I'm Ladybug,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.260
‎but if he sees that I lied,
‎he'll also see I did all that

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.900
‎so he wouldn't guess that I'm Ladybug...
‎and he'll figure out that I'm Ladybug!

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.980
‎Marinette! Marinette!

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.540
‎Tikki, help me!

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.940
‎Voilà!

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.260
‎This is a nightmare!

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.660
‎Come on, sweetie. Let him in.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.540
‎Uh... hello, Marinette.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.860
‎-Uh... Hello, Cat Noir.
‎-Welcome to our home!

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.260
‎Tom, let him come up for some air, huh?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.740
‎Oops! Sorry! Ha, ha!

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.140
‎-Um... how are you?
‎-Uh, fine and you?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.220
‎Oh! He brought a pink rose for Marinette!
‎She loves pink!

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.220
‎You two already know each other so well!

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.700
‎Everyone loves pink!
‎It doesn't mean anything.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.220
‎And actually,
‎we don't know each other that well.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.660
‎He's right! It all happened so fast!

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.060
‎Love at first sight?
‎That's even more romantic!

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.700
‎Have a seat, kids.
‎I'll bring out the first course.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.140
‎ I have something to tell you!

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.300
<i>‎Voilà</i><i>‎! Sweethearts' vol-au-vent!</i>

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.060
‎For two, of course!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.860
‎Tell me, Cat Noir,
‎is being a superhero a steady profession?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.940
‎Tom!

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.060
‎-What?
‎-You're right, Dad!

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.900
‎It must be dangerous,
‎being a superhero's girlfriend!

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.580
‎-Maybe I should rethink this.
‎-Of course not, sweetie!

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.420
‎Cat Noir won't be a superhero
‎all his life!

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.060
‎Once he's defeated Hawk Moth, he won't
‎need to run on the roofs with a stick.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.980
‎I know!
‎He could work in the bakery with me!

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.180
‎-I could train you, young man!
‎-Uh...

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.740
‎Maybe Cat Noir
‎doesn't want to be a baker at all!

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.780
‎Ah! See? He'd love to!
‎Everyone loves bakers!

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.340
‎-Uh...
‎-The Dupain-Cat Noir bakery!

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.860
‎-Doesn't that sound purr-fect?
‎-Tom!

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.580
‎I can already see the little kittens
‎running around in the house.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.700
‎And pet hamsters! Do you like hamsters?
‎Because my daughter loves them!

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.700
‎What did you want to name
‎your future hamster again?

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.380
‎-This is a nightmare!
‎-Nightmare, right!

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.420
‎That's a funny name, isn't it?

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.860
‎I'm bringing the soufflé!

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.100
<i>‎Voilà</i><i>‎! Hmm?</i>

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.380
‎Tom, how about we let Cat Noir
‎tell us himself what he wants?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.220
‎Good idea. He seems like the kind of boy
‎who changes his mind rather quickly!

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.340
‎ Well, actually...
‎Mr Dupain, Mrs Dupain-Cheng, Marinette...

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.740
‎Here's the thing. You're really nice
‎and this meal is delicious,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.140
‎and the friendliest
‎I've had in a long time.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.660
‎Marinette, you're awesome
‎and I get that you have feelings for me.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.300
‎After all, I'm awesome in so many ways,
‎even I could fall in love with myself.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.060
‎Anyway, I'm afraid my heart
‎belongs to someone else.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.620
‎Even if she keeps rejecting me,
‎even if she loves somebody else,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.220
‎I'm in love with Ladybug.
‎I'm really sorry, Marinette.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.020
‎Oh, this is so...

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.620
‎so sad!

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.460
‎To think I spent all this time
‎following you everywhere

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.420
‎to tell you that I loved you, Cat Noir!
‎ I am so miserable!

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.140
‎No one will ever love me!
‎I'll end up all alone with my hamster,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.100
‎and its name will be Loneliness!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.220
<i>‎♪ La, la, la, la ♪</i>

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.980
‎Oh, this is such a relief, Tikki!
‎He's not in love with me!

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.500
‎Well, uh...
‎I don't want to bother you any longer.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.340
‎I'm really sorry.
‎Thanks for having me, anyway.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.620
‎Is there a more delicious recipe
‎than a father's heart

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.900
‎broken by his child's heartache?

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:08.460
‎Fly, my dreadful akuma,
‎an evil feast of darkness awaits you!

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.540
‎How can he not love Marinette?
‎Everyone loves Marinette!

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.060
‎One day, Marinette will meet another boy.
‎She'll love him with all her heart, and --

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.540
‎He'll break it too! Never again!

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.020
‎I won't let anyone
‎break my daughter's heart again!

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.940
‎Weredad, I am Hawk Moth.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.700
‎I'm giving you the power
‎to protect your daughter

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.220
‎from anything that brings her harm.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.900
‎-In return...
‎-I'll bring you some Cat Noir pâté!

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.700
‎That, and his and Ladybug's Miraculous
‎would be perfect.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.100
‎What is this? Tikki!

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.260
‎Marinette!

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.700
‎I messed up.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.500
‎I really messed up! Marinette!

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.460
‎Marinette!

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.540
‎-I'm so sorry! This is all my fault!
‎-Of course not, Cat Noir! It's Tom.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.940
‎No matter how many times I tell him,
‎he always takes things too far.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.820
‎I'll bring your husband back to his
‎senses and help Marinette, I promise!

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.540
‎-Shouldn't you wait for Ladybug?
‎-I trust her.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.060
‎-She always shows up at the right time.
‎-You really love her, huh?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.660
‎Yes. But, um, Marinette seems like
‎an awesome girl too, you know!

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.900
‎-Don't worry. I'll save her!
‎-I've faith in you. You're a good person.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.380
‎Never apologise for your feelings.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.180
‎Thank you, Mrs Dupain-Cheng.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.660
‎Good luck, Cat Noir!

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.060
‎Marinette!

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.300
‎Tikki!

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.620
‎Tikki!

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.260
‎Marinette!

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.860
‎-Marinette!
‎-Tikki? I'm here!

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.620
‎-Marinette, where are you?
‎-Tikki!

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.420
‎Marinette? Mr Dupain?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.460
‎How dare you come back
‎after what you've done?

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.820
‎Aaah!

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.220
‎I will always be here to save Marinette.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.460
‎She's safe from you! And all the boys
‎who want to break her heart!

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.020
‎I didn't mean to break her heart,
‎sir, I swear!

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.620
‎And I swear
‎that I'm about to crush your bones!

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.340
‎Where are you, Ladybug?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.020
‎I'm sorry, but... Aaah!
‎I can't let you do that!

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.700
‎-Why not?
‎-Aaah!

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.780
‎Because I have... Whoa!
‎..a damsel in distress to rescue!

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.620
‎I forbid you to rescue her!

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.740
‎You don't deserve to save her!

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.540
‎From now on,
‎no one else but I will protect her!

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.020
‎Are you planning to protect her
‎all her life?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.700
‎Exactly!
‎I'll keep her safe from sadness, hardship

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.500
‎and anything that could hurt her!

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.140
‎You can't protect her from
‎what hurts most! Know what that is?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.900
‎My great, big punches?

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.020
‎No, what hurts the most is solitude.
‎Believe me, I know all about it!

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.900
‎Nothing hurts more than isolation,
‎sitting alone in front of a cold meal!

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.140
‎Is that what you want for your daughter?
‎A lifetime of cold meals

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.420
‎in her prison of roses?

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.500
‎She will never be alone!
‎Someday a prince will come.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.740
‎A prince worthy of her,
‎daring enough to face me,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.020
‎who will brave the many dangers
‎and pick the magic rose for her!

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.180
‎He will be worthy
‎of taking her from my guard.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.300
‎-Tikki!
‎-This is a magic prison, Marinette.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.980
‎It looks like it's trying
‎to keep me from finding you!

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.860
‎There must be a way out of here!

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.860
‎Hmm.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.340
‎That rose...
‎it's the one Cat Noir gave me!

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.020
‎OK.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.900
‎I may not be her prince,
‎but I'm charming enough to free her!

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.060
‎I forbid you to do so!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.420
‎Marinette? Marinette?

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.220
‎I'm OK! I can do it!

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.780
‎Not being in love with her and losing
‎my stick won't keep me from saving her!

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.020
‎I'll never give up, never!

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.060
‎You're not worthy of my daughter!

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.740
‎The Miraculous! Grab his ring!

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.220
‎Gotcha!

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.540
‎Aaah!

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.220
‎What? What's going on? Aaah!

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.940
‎-Aaah!
‎-Marinette!

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.580
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.100
‎Gotcha!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.460
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.380
‎Milady!

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.540
‎-I'm coming!
‎-No! Take care of Marinette!

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.580
‎-She's around here!
‎-Don't worry!

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.540
‎I've already taken her to safety!

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.500
‎She's as wonderful as ever.
‎Who wouldn't be in love with Ladybug?

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.740
‎Oh! I...
‎She also has some flaws, you know!

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.020
‎Not all of us can land on our feet,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.700
‎so I guess we're gonna need
‎a little bit of luck.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.820
‎Lucky charm!

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.100
‎-Oh!
‎-Do your thing, Cat noir!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.900
‎Cataclysm!

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.940
‎-Hang on!
‎-Whoa!

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.220
‎-Tom!
‎-Honey!

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.340
‎Pound it, Milady!

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.020
‎Pound it, Cat Noir.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.060
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.740
‎-Marinette! Marinette!
‎-Marinette!

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.340
‎Wait! The Miraculous repaired everything,
‎so she must be safely back in her room!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.180
‎-Marinette!
‎-Marinette!

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.540
‎-Dad... Dad, I can't breathe!
‎-Oh! Sorry! I was so scared!

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.020
‎You were so heartbroken because of that...
‎Grr!

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.060
‎Dad, stop. Cat Noir has every right
‎to be in love with Ladybug.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.380
‎She's very lucky to have you.
‎And just because you and I aren't in love,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.900
‎-doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
‎-Really? Oh, phew!

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.700
‎I really didn't want to hurt you.
‎You seem like such an awesome person.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.820
‎Even though you're not a fan,
‎like I thought when I saw you on the roof!

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.220
‎What?
‎You just thought I was a fan of yours?

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.740
‎Well, yeah! That's what I was about to say
‎when you jumped on me.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.620
‎-"Could it be that she's a fan of mine?"
‎-You see, Tom?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.620
‎Your daughter can handle
‎her own disappointments.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.020
‎And even if he's not in love
‎with Marinette,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.580
‎Cat Noir proved himself
‎by saving her today.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.340
‎It's true. Your courage and tenacity
‎match those of the greatest pastry chefs!

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.780
‎Are you sure that you don't want to learn?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.820
‎If you bring fresh croissants
‎to Ladybug every day,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.260
‎she'll surely wind up
‎falling in love with you!

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.660
‎Dad!
