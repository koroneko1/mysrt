Tikki, I'm so confused!

00:33.700 --> 00:36.100
These riddles
Fu translated are too cryptic!

00:36.600 --> 00:38.370
Their meanings are hidden

00:38.470 --> 00:40.470
to protect the secret
of our magic powers.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.200
Yeah, but what good does it do

00:42.300 --> 00:44.940
if even the Guardian
can't figure them out?

00:45.040 --> 00:47.070
Fu had trouble
with the first ones.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.680
Remember, you were the one who
helped him with the Aqua Power.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.950
You're right!
I'm gonna figure this out!

00:53.050 --> 00:55.850

- What are you doing?

00:55.920 --> 00:59.750
<i> Paris is getting ready to</i>

01:01.490 --> 01:04.690
<i> This special report</i>

01:04.790 --> 01:07.760
- Adrien!
<i>- We were able to spend the day</i>

01:07.900 --> 01:09.100

01:09.270 --> 01:11.030

01:18.140 --> 01:19.410

01:20.240 --> 01:22.110

01:27.950 --> 01:31.950

- Without even a lunch break!

01:32.090 --> 01:33.720
Ridiculous!

01:34.460 --> 01:36.890
Finally, free at last!
Plagg, claws out!

01:36.990 --> 01:38.590
What? Oh, no!

01:41.700 --> 01:42.630
(Laughs)

01:43.970 --> 01:47.100
Woohoo! Ha, ha!

Hey, Bugaboo! Well, here I am,
your faithful companion,

01:57.880 --> 01:59.910
at our rendez-vous point.

01:59.980 --> 02:03.680
It's time for our daily patrol.
I hope you haven't forgotten?

<i> Hi! It's Ladybug.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

02:22.040 --> 02:24.940
Maybe it's because now,
since you're the Guardian,

02:25.010 --> 02:27.010
you've got
more important things to do,

02:27.110 --> 02:29.480
but no biggie!
I'm just the cat for this job!

02:29.580 --> 02:32.680
I'll start without you.
See you later! Let me know!

02:39.860 --> 02:42.960

Cat Noir! Cat Noir! Cat Noir!

02:43.090 --> 02:45.190

Cat Noir! Cat Noir!

So, Mr Banana,
life's peachy huh?

03:03.580 --> 03:05.150
Peachy. Banana. Get it?

03:06.350 --> 03:07.380
Forget it.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.020
So, Mister Ramier,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.050
it's been a while
since you were akumatized.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.850
Don't you miss being Mr Pigeon?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.690
You haven't been feeling
depressed, desperate or angry?

03:15.790 --> 03:18.860
Annoyed maybe?
Not even a little perturbed?

03:18.960 --> 03:22.300
Thank you for asking, Cat Noir,
but I am in the best of spirits.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.460
I guess I'm outta here, then.

03:24.730 --> 03:27.100
Say hello
to the lovely Ladybug for me.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.940
Sure thing. If I ever see her.

PLAGG:<i> No messages.</i>
<i> Don't forget my cheese!</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:37.410
A glass of milk as usual,
Mr Cat Noir?

03:39.150 --> 03:41.880
How is Miss Ladybug?
I haven't seen her for a while.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.990
It's been
a little quiet recently.

03:45.790 --> 03:50.060
That purse was my life, Sabrina,
and you have gone and lost it!

03:50.160 --> 03:52.530
You are forbidden
to speak to me ever again!

03:52.600 --> 03:55.360
- But Chloé...
- Shh! No talking! Zip it!

03:55.430 --> 03:57.130
- But --
- Shh! Zip it!

03:57.230 --> 03:59.930
And don't even look at me
either! Hands over your eyes.

04:00.170 --> 04:01.170
Oh!

04:02.100 --> 04:03.970
Something tells me an akuma
is going to show up.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.380
Oh, my purse! You dingbat! You
could've said I was wearing it!

04:10.450 --> 04:12.080
I wasn't allowed
to speak to you!

04:12.180 --> 04:14.820
And you still aren't! Shh!

04:16.590 --> 04:17.320

Hi again, Bugaboo.
Guess who this is.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.870
Give up?
It's the guy you stood up!

04:33.940 --> 04:35.740
Never let yourself be weak,
Mother!

04:36.770 --> 04:39.610
- I know that lesson well.
- And never be... ?

04:39.740 --> 04:41.110
Taken by surprise!

04:41.240 --> 04:42.780
Don't apply this to fencing.

04:42.910 --> 04:44.480
You'll never be
as good as Adrien.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.180
Adrien? Don't worry, Mother.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.480
I've got everything I need
to succeed with him.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.450
Patrol's over, Bugaboo.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.320
Claws in!

05:02.600 --> 05:04.330
So, your favourite cheese
is missing

05:04.430 --> 05:07.270
and it's as if the others
don't exist? Try another type.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.270
You might be surprised
how much you like it.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.170

05:35.600 --> 05:36.860

Yes, Father.

05:44.810 --> 05:48.380
Kagami? Adrien? Your fencing
class doesn't start for an hour.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.340
And Mr d'Argencourt
isn't here yet.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.410
Oh! Really? I was sure I wrote
down the correct hour this time.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.980
I'm sorry, but you can't --

05:57.050 --> 05:59.350
Stay at school without
adult supervision? No problem.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
We'll come back for the class
in an hour.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.590
What are you up to this time?

06:06.630 --> 06:08.460
The Arts and Crafts room?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.360
What are you planning
to do in here?

06:10.500 --> 06:14.500
I've never told this to anyone,
but... I love to draw.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.240
I always have.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.070
Drawings never lie.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.240
The poses people make always
reflect their personality.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.740
But she won't let me do it.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.580
According to her,
I'm not good enough.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.050
You're super talented, Kagami!

06:29.180 --> 06:31.450
- You really think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:31.550 --> 06:34.190
Pose for me.
I want to sketch you.

06:34.790 --> 06:38.230
- How do you want me to pose?
- However makes you comfortable.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.890
I admire Toulouse-Lautrec.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.560
I'd like to draw you
like the characters he painted.

06:42.700 --> 06:46.870
He often signed with a monogram
like many Japanese artists did.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.040
This isn't right. It's not you.

06:50.270 --> 06:52.410
- Can I see it?
- Try a different pose.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.240
It should be easy to sketch you,
'cause you're handsome.

06:55.510 --> 06:58.310
But I want to capture
the real you inside.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
No. Still not good.
Change again.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.850
These are all modelling poses.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.590
Try something
that's more natural, more you.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.730
What about "Miaow"?

07:13.700 --> 07:16.360
Uh, I mean, now? Heh, heh.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.130
No. You're not at all natural.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.100
Yes, I am. I promise.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.500
- This is me.
- No.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.100
That's you
when you're being silly.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.070
And what if when I'm
being silly, I'm really me?

07:33.080 --> 07:35.950
There. This is really you.

07:36.290 --> 07:41.520
- Do you really think?
- Yes, you're... perfect.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.360
(Phones ring)

07:46.660 --> 07:49.360
Now it's really time
for our fencing class.

07:55.970 --> 07:59.070
En garde! Prêts!

07:59.640 --> 08:00.670
Allez!

08:07.820 --> 08:10.520
- Touché.
- En garde!

08:15.020 --> 08:18.230
Uh... Sorry. I forgot something
back in the locker room!

08:28.870 --> 08:31.340
<i> Just like always,</i>
<i>it's time for our daily patrol.</i>

08:31.410 --> 08:33.310

<i> -</i> Bugaboo!

08:34.510 --> 08:36.140
Cat Noir?

08:38.050 --> 08:39.150
Aaah!

08:40.480 --> 08:41.880
Huh?

08:42.750 --> 08:44.580
Will you quit
your practical jokes?

08:44.690 --> 08:47.690
- I could've really hurt you!
- What really hurts me

08:47.920 --> 08:49.590
is when you make me
patrol by myself.

08:49.690 --> 08:52.660
(Sighs) I even missed
your little angry pout!

08:52.930 --> 08:55.860
Sorry, Kittycat. I'm a bit
over my head at the moment.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.200
I bet!
Guardian of the Miraculous.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.400
Big name, big responsibility!

09:00.470 --> 09:02.570
I promise to not forget
our patrols again.

09:07.940 --> 09:09.110
Woohoo!

09:12.780 --> 09:13.780
Kagami!

09:22.190 --> 09:25.630
I gotta get going.
My father is probably worried!

09:31.230 --> 09:32.470
(Phone buzzes)

09:34.470 --> 09:36.170
Bye, guys.

09:46.950 --> 09:50.150
Uh, forgot some things in
my classroom! Call you later!

09:51.850 --> 09:53.550
Tatsu, let's go!

09:55.260 --> 09:56.220
Whee!

09:57.730 --> 10:00.730
- Yeah!
- (Cheering)

10:01.730 --> 10:04.630
I got it all on video, dude!
You guys were awesome.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.500
I wasn't, Nino.
I messed up the intro.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.800
We can go over it again
if you want, Adrien.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.070
- Yeah, let's play it again!
- Adrien! It's time!

10:12.940 --> 10:14.840
- Five more minutes?
- Nnn-nnn.

10:16.010 --> 10:19.210
Well, I'll be better next time.
I promise. See you, guys.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.700
Our cars aren't here yet.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.700
That's too bad. We could have
played the song again!

10:41.840 --> 10:44.170
But this way we have
a little time together.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.710
We'll have plenty of time
together at the birthday.

10:47.810 --> 10:50.740
Together
just the two of us, I mean.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.010
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.020
I have a feeling
we're a lot alike.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.250
Do you feel the same way?
Do you also... ?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.090
Sorry, I thought I saw a wasp!

11:05.190 --> 11:07.930
- Do you love me, too?
- Excuse me?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.130
Adrien, what's going on?

11:10.900 --> 11:13.430
I forgot something on the barge,
when my bag fell.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.470
Don't wait up for me! Let's meet
up at Prince Ali's birthday!

11:20.980 --> 11:23.480
Tatsu,
take me to the City Hall.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.720
I hope we can still
celebrate Ali's birthday.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.350
Fancy parties always have
the best cheese boards!

11:32.420 --> 11:35.990
Later. But right now Ladybug
needs me. Plagg, claws out!

11:38.360 --> 11:41.360
<i> Hawk Moth's merged his power</i>
<i> with the Peacock's.</i>

11:41.630 --> 11:44.060
<i> He created a supervillain</i>
<i> and a Sentimonster.</i>

11:44.170 --> 11:45.800
<i> I need you out here!</i>

11:46.700 --> 11:49.440
Now you must tell the truth to
anyone who asks you a question.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.810
I'll do the honours.
Who are you, Ladybug?

11:52.370 --> 11:55.510
- am...
- A super swimmer!

12:01.950 --> 12:04.920
Dear Prince Ali,
on behalf of the city of Paris,

12:05.020 --> 12:07.290
we all wish you
a very happy birthday!

12:08.290 --> 12:10.060
Didn't I arrange with Mr Agreste

12:10.130 --> 12:12.130
that his son
would accompany you here?

12:12.230 --> 12:13.490
Oh, um, he's here, Mother.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.430
A journalist is interviewing him
outside.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.200
I'll go and find him.

12:26.340 --> 12:30.510
Woohoo! Milady, it's been a
while since I had that much fun!

12:30.810 --> 12:33.210
(Laughs) If battling
a supervillain with three eyes

12:33.320 --> 12:35.820
and a giant monster-buddy
is your idea of fun,

12:35.920 --> 12:37.650
What are your other days like?

12:37.750 --> 12:40.320
A baddie, a Sentimonster
<i> and</i> Shadow Moth?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.490
It's even more exciting
with his new name.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.160
He can change his name as often
as he likes, he'll never win.

12:46.930 --> 12:49.230
You can count on me
and my jokes, Bugaboo!

12:49.330 --> 12:51.430
Well,
you don't have to overdo it!

12:52.070 --> 12:54.530
Truth is, I only ever have
this much fun with you.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.900
Catch you later! Whee!

12:59.810 --> 13:01.170
Claws in.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.950
Kagami? I hope I didn't
keep you waiting too long.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.280
And I hope you found
what you were looking for.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.050
- Huh?
- Back at the barge?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.860
Uh, on the barge, right.
Yeah. I found it, thank you!

13:16.420 --> 13:18.160
- What was it?
- Oh, you know.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.330
Just that thing, that lucky
charm that Marinette gave me.

13:21.460 --> 13:25.500
Ah, no, did I lose it? Again?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
You mean this one?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.840
You know, I lied too.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.170
I lied to my mother
so we could see each other.

13:34.540 --> 13:37.480
I even lied to her when I said
you came here with me tonight.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.410
I lied at every fencing lesson

13:39.510 --> 13:41.880
so we could spend
more time together. You see?

13:41.980 --> 13:43.380
We're both liars.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.850
Except, I lie
'cause I want to be with you.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.960
You lie because
you don't want to be with me.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.390
Kagami!

13:56.000 --> 13:57.230
I'll go in first.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.340
One simple lie
and trust crumbles to nothing.

14:07.410 --> 14:11.380
And what if, in the end,
everything is just a lie?

14:12.080 --> 14:17.220
Fly away, my evil akuma
and plague that deceived heart.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.070
Lies, I am Shadow Moth.

14:33.130 --> 14:36.740
I bestow on you the power
to rid the world of liars.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.570
All I ask in return are Ladybug
and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.580
- Do I have your word?
- Trust me.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.310
No more lies will be allowed
in my new world, Shadow Moth!

14:54.190 --> 14:55.990
No!

14:59.090 --> 15:01.460
This is all my fault.
I've gotta save Kagami.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.260
Plagg, claws out.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.780
♪ O p you're one year ,

15:24.220 --> 15:28.150
♪ To us you're still
a real rock 'n' roller ♪

15:28.620 --> 15:31.760
(Applause)

15:31.860 --> 15:33.790
In the name of the law...
What is that?

15:33.930 --> 15:37.630
I am Lies! Have you ever
told a lie, Agent Roger?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.300
Of course not!
Policemen never lie!

15:40.400 --> 15:42.500
You are a liar!

15:42.670 --> 15:44.200
Help!

15:47.480 --> 15:50.410
And you, Mother,
have you lied as well?

15:50.910 --> 15:53.450
Kagami, I will not allow this!

16:04.430 --> 16:06.960
Kaga...
Lies, stop this right now!

16:07.530 --> 16:09.860
Oh, look,
let's see if this new candidate

16:09.970 --> 16:11.800
can pass my lie-detector test.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.870
I'm not lying when I say
I'll free you from Shadow Moth.

16:14.970 --> 16:17.170
And I'm gonna help you, yeah!

16:17.270 --> 16:20.010
- Get away, Jagged.
- I'm not afraid! I'm an artist!

16:20.110 --> 16:22.310
I'm always keeping it real
with my fans!

16:22.410 --> 16:25.450
That's not true!
You lie about your age!

16:25.810 --> 16:27.510
Hey, this is not rock 'n' roll!

16:27.650 --> 16:30.080
A world without lies will have
no need for super-heroes,

16:30.190 --> 16:31.550
Cat Noir.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.090
- Cata --
- No. If you touch the sphere,

16:39.190 --> 16:41.290
- you'll freeze!
- Not if I've told the truth!

16:41.560 --> 16:43.900
- Yeah, but is that the case?
- Hardly!

16:45.230 --> 16:47.530
- How about you?
- Of course not, Kitty.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.840
We're supposed to lie. If only
to keep our identities a secret.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.110
If we touch that thing, there'll
be no one left to save Paris!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.280
OK... so what do we do?

16:56.780 --> 16:58.240
Lucky charm!

17:06.390 --> 17:08.520
Can't wait to see
what you do with a drone!

17:08.590 --> 17:12.390
OK, we can't go inside, but
I doubt this machine ever lied.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.730
Which means... Keep her busy,
while I send this spy inside.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.070
- We'll stay in touch.
- Your wish is my command,

17:20.200 --> 17:21.830
and that's no lie.

17:22.340 --> 17:26.310
Yoohoo! My name isn't Cat Noir!
I'm not a superhero!

17:26.840 --> 17:29.940
I hate Ladybug
and I think that Shadow Moth

17:30.250 --> 17:33.210
should have been called
Peacock Moth! Way funnier!

17:33.280 --> 17:37.920
I forgot. My favourite dish is
cauliflower with béchamel sauce!

17:38.590 --> 17:42.360
Lies, Catch that deceiving cat,
and seize his Miraculous!

17:42.420 --> 17:44.120
You have my word, Shadow Moth.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.730
Liars will always
have to pay in the end.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.630
I know
what the akumatized item is.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.440
Great, so break it!

17:56.570 --> 17:58.170
How, when I can't touch it?

17:58.440 --> 18:00.310
You're right,
only someone who's never lied

18:00.410 --> 18:03.180
could do it!
But that doesn't exist!

18:08.120 --> 18:10.250
Yes, it does, Cat Noir!
It does exist!

18:10.650 --> 18:12.990
Fang, Jagged's crocodile!
He's never lied!

18:13.120 --> 18:14.790
He's an animal.
He wouldn't know how!

18:14.890 --> 18:16.520
You're right!

18:29.240 --> 18:30.300
It's working!

18:40.750 --> 18:42.120
(Woman screaming)

18:48.860 --> 18:51.860
But if Lies sees him coming,
we're toast!

18:52.160 --> 18:53.790
There are only two liars
left in Paris

18:53.900 --> 18:55.860
and I know
how to catch her attention.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.230
No way! Don't do it!
What if I fail?

18:58.330 --> 19:00.470
You know what? I trust you.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.700
Cat Noir, no!
You're completely crazy!

19:03.870 --> 19:05.640
Crazy about you, Milady.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.040
No, just plain crazy.
Reckless.

19:13.980 --> 19:17.280
The moment of truth is near!
Grab Cat Noir's Miraculous,

19:17.350 --> 19:18.920
then it'll be Ladybug's turn!

19:20.960 --> 19:22.920
Hurry up!

19:33.500 --> 19:35.170
Aaah!

19:47.450 --> 19:49.680
No!

19:49.920 --> 19:52.350
No more evildoing for you,
little akuma!

19:55.560 --> 19:57.920
Time to de-evilise!

20:02.000 --> 20:02.760
Gotcha!

20:04.170 --> 20:05.930
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.270
Miraculous Ladybug!

20:11.610 --> 20:12.940
Yeah!

20:16.680 --> 20:18.710
Gah! Aaah!

20:20.080 --> 20:22.850
Seriously! You've got to stop
doing this to me!

20:22.920 --> 20:25.550
Yeah! But I can't resist
this little pout of yours

20:25.620 --> 20:27.790
- when you bring me back!
- Hmm.

20:28.690 --> 20:29.960
- Pound it!
- Pound it!

20:31.430 --> 20:32.490
Claws in!

20:34.430 --> 20:36.430
(Sighs) Ladybug...

20:36.560 --> 20:39.270
Oh, how romantic! I get it.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.440
Even if I do love every cheese,
I always come back

20:42.570 --> 20:44.940
to my favourite, camembert.

20:48.240 --> 20:51.010
En garde! Prêts!

20:51.910 --> 20:53.280
Allez!

21:01.260 --> 21:02.590
Ouch!

21:03.790 --> 21:07.190
Stop it! This is a fencing class
here, not a joust!

21:07.300 --> 21:08.790
Fall out!

21:11.630 --> 21:14.600
I'm really sorry I hurt you,
Kagami. You know,

21:14.670 --> 21:18.500
all those wonderful times we had
together... they weren't lies.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.770
I know.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.310
I know
that you're hiding something,

21:22.410 --> 21:25.140
but I also know that there is
sincerity in you, too.

21:25.310 --> 21:27.510
So... can we still be friends?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.320
How can you trust someone
who's lied to you?

21:33.390 --> 21:37.220
When I'm ready to see you again,
I'll let you know.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.930
You know the difference between
us and the rest of the world?

21:48.470 --> 21:50.700
We can't be completely honest
with each other.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.840
We keep secrets,
and sometimes we have to lie...

21:55.080 --> 22:04.180
BOTH:
But we always trust each other.
