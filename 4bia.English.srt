00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,875
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, PINN.
I'LL BITCHSLAP YOU.

00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,583

DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?

00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,000
NO, BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE.

JUST LYING DOWN. I'M SO LONELY.

27
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,791
DO YOU HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS FOR MSN?

28
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:41,291
I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER.
I HAVE A REALLY SMALL SPACE.

29
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,708
PITY. IF YOU GET BORED WITH TEXTING,
I'LL MISS OUT ON TALKING TO YOU.

30
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,833
I CAN TALK TO YOU ALL NIGHT.
YOU WON'T BORE ME. YOU?

31
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:14,541
ME TOO. I'VE BEEN SHUT IN.
HAVEN'T TALKED TO ANYONE FOR SO LONG.

32
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,833
ME NEITHER. I'VE BEEN ALONE
FOR 100 DAYS NOW.

33
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,666
ARE YOU ILL?

34
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,041
WORST OF LUCK. MY TAXI FLIPPED OVER,
ALMOST KILLING ME.

35
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,791
I'VE BEEN IN A CAST FOR OVER THREE
MONTHS NOW.

36
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,375
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT SILVER LININGS
AFTER A STORM?

37
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,375
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

38
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,750
NO, I'M NOT SLEEPY YET.

39
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,083
CAN I ASK FOR A PHOTO?

40
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,708
LET'S EXCHANGE. MY PHOTO FOR YOURS. DEAL?

41
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,625
DEAL. YOURS FIRST.

42
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,375
I'M PROBABLY NOT AS PRETTY AS YOU'D HOPED.

43
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,791
PROBABLY NOT AS HOT AS YOU EXPECTED.

44
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,541
NO CHEATING. THAT'S THE PHOTO I SENT.

45
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,166
LOOK CLOSER. I'M IN THE PHOTO WITH YOU.

00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,666
I WENT TO A 100TH DAY MEMORIAL SERVICE.

50
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,625
THE DECEASED KILLED HIMSELF.

51
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,708
THEY PUT THEIR SON'S CELL PHONE IN
HIS COFFIN

52
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
IN CASE HE EVER GETS LONELY

53
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,291
OR WANTS TO COMMUNICATE.

54
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,250
I'VE BEEN ALONE FOR 100 DAYS NOW.

55
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,583
ARE YOU ILL?

56

WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF?

57
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,916
DON'T TURN OFF THE PHONE,
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

58
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,625
I'LL BE PASSING BY WHERE YOU LIVE.
CAN I COME AND SEE YOU?

59
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,083
NO, MY BOYFRIEND WON'T LIKE THAT.

60
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,666
YOU'RE ALONE. I'M WATCHING YOU.

61
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,666
I'M OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

62
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,041
I'M HEADING UPSTAIRS.

63
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,375
I'M IN YOUR ROOM NOW.

64
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,666
AO: LET'S JUST SPLIT UP.
I'M SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

65
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,083
Hey, Undertaker.

66
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:50,750
Aren't you going to say hi, huh?

67
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,708
Diew, I said it before,
just give me this once.

68
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,000
Hurry up.

69
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:04,875
Come on.

70
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,250
Let's go.

71
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,458
-Let's go.
-Start the car.

72
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,833
-Ngid, get the fuck over here.
-Not so fast.

73
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,833
You've gone too far.

74
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,541
Huh? What did you say?

75
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,375
Don't you think what you did was too much?

76
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,875
What was too much? What do you mean?

77
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,750
What you did--

78
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,250
Please...

79
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,541
don't hurt me.

80
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,500
I...

81
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,958
I have to go...

82
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,250
I have to go see my dad at the hospital.

83
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,791
See your fucking dad?

84
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:35,291
You think you're so fucking cool
now that you got us expelled?

85
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,375
I really didn't know.

86
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,625
I...

87
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:44,791
I just wanted my notebook back.

88
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:46,791
Fucking prick.

89
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,416
You got the guts to make excuses?

90
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,416
Opening people's bags without permission,
that's stealing.

91
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,041
You wanted your notebook,

92
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,083
you could've just taken it.

93
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,500
You didn't have to go to the teacher

94
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,875
because you saw the fucking weed.

95
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,666
But I really didn't know...

96
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,625
there was a teacher behind me.

97
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,708
Oh, yeah, right.

98
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,083
You didn't fucking know.

99
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:16,708
Enough. Please. Enough.

100
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,416
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

101
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,333
I think it's best

102
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,041
you go drop out tomorrow.

103
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,083
And don't ever show up

104
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,916
with your rotten face again.

105
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,208
Do you understand?

106
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,916
Hey, Undertaker.

107
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,916
You're fucking trash.

108
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,041
Do you know what they do with trash?

109
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,333
Undertaker.

110
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,833
They either bury it or burn it.
But the likes of you,

111
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,333
should just be burned.

112
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,916
Hey.

113
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,625
Disappear.

114
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,708
Transfer schools if you like.

115
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,208
If you don't want to be burned alive,

116
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,083
don't ever show your face again.

117
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,541
Do you hear me?

118
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,625
Hey.

119
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,791
Get up. Take a look at your bike.

120
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:40,625
What a shame.

121
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,875
There goes your bike. Go and get it.

122
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,791
How about we just let him fall for real?

123
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,625
Dude, he could actually fucking fall.

124
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,333
If he does, he'll be mashed to shit.

125
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,708
Hey.

126
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,541
Shit.

127
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:11,708
Fuck, that was close.

128
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,208
Fuck.

129
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:18,666
TIT FOR TAT

130
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,875
Don't hold your breath,
because I have the nine.

131
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,083
I'm on fire.

132
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,000
My hand sucks.

133
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,250
You want my shirt, too?

134
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,375
-Your shirt?
-Just take it.

135
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:36,375
Keep your shirt on. Calm down.

136
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,583
Did you mark the cards?

137
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,208
If I didn't, I wouldn't have won.

138
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,416
Hey, what the fuck's this?

139
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,291
Oh, that's the Joker.

140
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,500
I forgot to take it out. Sorry.

141
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,625
Diew.

142
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,083
If anything happens to Ngid,

143
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:58,750
I hope your dad can save our asses.

144
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,250
Hell, Pink.

145
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,041
Watch your fucking mouth.

146
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,041
I think he's just fine.

147
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,958
He's probably dropped out by now.

148
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,916
You guys, too.

149
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,958
Go easy on the weed.

150
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,916
My dad already chewed me out.

151
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:20,208
If Ngid didn't find it,
we wouldn't be in such a hot mess.

152
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,500
It'd be great if he fucking died.

153
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,041
Speaking of him,

154
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:27,541
I saw his bike parked here yesterday.

155
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,041
Yesterday afternoon,
I was just going home...

156
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,375
...and his bike was here.

157
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,125
But I didn't see where he was.

158
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,291
Fucking shit.

159
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,875
What's your fucking problem, Undertaker?

160
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,583
You want to fucking go?

161
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,666
You didn't have enough last time, huh?

162
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,833
Enough.

163
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,416
He could actually die.

164
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,375
Stay out of this, Pink.

165
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,375
Scum like you...

166
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,625
should all just die.

167
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,208
Yo, don't get up.

168
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,916
Yo.

169
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,750
What the fuck are you laughing at?

170
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:03,583
-No.
-Yo.

171
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,458
Not me. No. Get out!

172
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,708
Fuck, get out!

173
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:16,041
Not me. Fuck, not me!

174
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,000
-What?
-What happened?

175
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:33,083
It's a person!

176
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,291
-Diew, what do we do?
-What should we do?

177
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,541
-Diew, what do we do.
-Diew.

178
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,291
-Diew.
-Get out of here. Come on, go.

179
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,583
Let's go, hurry up.

180
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,458
Leave the stuff. Just run. Go.

181
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,666
Get in your class.

182
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,666
What the fuck do we do?

183
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,166
-Go.
-We have to get to the hospital.

184
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,083
-Start the car.
-Which one is the closest?

185
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,750
-There's a clinic under my flat.
-Yo.

186
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,083
That one's the closest.

187
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,916
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

188
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,916
Yo.

189
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,416
-This one?
-Yo.

190
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,083
-This one?
-No, the next street.

191
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,333
-Here, turn here.
-Yo.

192
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,416
Okay.

193
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,833
No. Yo.

194
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,916
Yo.

195
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,916
Yo.

196
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,958
-She's dead.
-Toot, get down. Quick.

197
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,541
-Yo.
-Get out of the car.

198
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,708
Yo!

199
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:20,333
What do I even tell her parents?

200
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,750
I think we should go to the police.

201
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,916
There's a fucking body down there.

202
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,000
That body was your friend.

203
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,458
-What the fuck...
-If it gets...

204
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,083
What the fuck just happened?

205
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,791
I think something's not right.

206
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,125
Did you see Yoghurt's face
when she read the book?

207
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,666
And then...

208
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,541
Ngid's shock just before he fell down.

209
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,500
I have something to tell you...

210
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,750
I saw...

211
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,625
I saw...

212
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,916
What did you see?

213
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:25,166
I saw him doing it.

214
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,916
What did he do?

215
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,583
What if someone sees us?

216
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,333
Good, spice things up.

217
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,666
What if it's a teacher?

218
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,125
Good, that's even more exciting.

219
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,791
Hey, whose voice is that? Listen.

220
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,708
You can keep listening.

221
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,041
Stop. Listen.

222
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,291
Who's chanting what in here?

223
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,291
Let's just stop, Ball.
I'm not in the mood anymore.

224
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,291
Who the fuck?

225
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:32,666
Whoever looks you in the eye,

226
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,416
take them all.

227
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,333
Don't tell me that...

228
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,958
Ngid is into black magic?

229
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:45,125
Could it be that
he was trying to get back at us?

230
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,500
His father's an undertaker.

231
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,958
So it's not that far-fetched.

232
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Maybe it was...

233
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,958
It was what, Ace?

234
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,791
A death sigil.

235
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:08,625
You take a picture of someone
who dies with their eyes open,

236
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,041
and perform a cursing ritual.

237
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,166
Whoever looks the dead in the eye is...

238
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,458
doomed to die on the spot.

239
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,833
I remember there was something
written on it, like...

240
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,250
What the fuck is this?

241
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,500
"I see you now", or something.

242
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,916
"I see you now"?

243
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,791
What the fuck are you looking at?

244
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:36,541
Fuck.

245
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,458
Shit!

246
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,916
Watch out.

247
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,375
I didn't mean to.

248
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,333
I'm sorry.

249
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,291
So this is what you call
being burned alive.

250
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,416
All right.

251
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,916
I mean, what you told us, I find it...

252
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,583
hard to believe.

253
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,000
Okay?

254
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,750
You're saying your friends died

255
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,416
because of this book?

256
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,250
Anyway, my men
called your parents for you.

257
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,958
They should be here soon.

258
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,416
You just sit tight in here.

259
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,041
Don't go anywhere.

260
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,708
Okay? We'll be right back.

261
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,333
Oh.

262
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,833
And...

263
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,500
do you want something to eat?

264
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,291
Hey.

265
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,500
Pink.

266
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,916
Look up here.

267
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,958
We're a gang, aren't we?

268
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,958
Right.

269
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,416
We're friends, aren't we, Pink?

270
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,458
Pink, we're waiting for you.

271
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:46,208
Don't leave us, Pink.

272
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,708
Hold out your hand, Pink.

273
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:50,750
Come with us.

274
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,416
Don't you like me anymore?

275
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,208
It's your turn now.

276
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,375
No.

277
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,250
I have nothing to do with this.

278
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,458
A death sigil.

279
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:13,166
You take a picture of someone who dies
with their eyes open, and perform a curse.

280
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,208
I've never done anything to you.

281
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,666
I had no part in it.

282
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,416
No.

283
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,291
You just stood there and watched.

284
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,291
And right now,

285
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,291
this is what I want you to see.

286
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,250
No.

287
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,708
Look at it.

288
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:42,583
I won't look.

289
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,916
I never did anything to you.

290
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,208
I had nothing to do with it.

291
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,458
You'll never get out unscathed!

292
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,083
Just look!

293
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,625
You'll die anyway!

294
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,583
Die here and end it all!

295
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:05,958
Look!

296
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:07,833
Look!

297
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:10,291
Look!

298
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,083
Look!

299
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,000
Calling all units,

300
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,375
an officer was shot in the toilet.

301
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,833
We need immediate backup.

302
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,958
Stop him, get in front of him, now.

303
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,333
Careful, he's armed.

304
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,541
Young lady, stay in here, don't be...

305
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,041
You don't have to worry about me.

306
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:45,708
He can't touch me now.

307
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:55,708
You can never take me.

308
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,708
I SEE YOU NOW

309
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Hey, are you guys asleep?

310
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,375
What the fuck is it now?

311
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,833
Have you heard the story about

312
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,291
why you shouldn't sleep outside

313
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,625
when you're staying in the woods?

314
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:29,416
Why?

315
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,500
Tia told me a story once.

316
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:33,291
He went into the woods,

317
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,583
and fell asleep outside.

318
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,833
Late that night,

319
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,958
he heard footsteps, like someone
was walking towards them.

320
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,708
Crunch.

321
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,291
Crunch.

322
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:49,041
Crunch.

323
00:50:50,041 --> 00:50:52,666
Then he felt there was someone
scratching his leg.

324
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:56,708
So he jolted up.

325
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,708
What he saw was...

326
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,041
a woman.

327
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:04,541
A female ghost?

328
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,708
Sitting at his feet.

329
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,041
Was she pretty?

330
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,666
She was, but more in a way that...

331
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:11,416
Fuck, no.

332
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,833
I haven't finished.

333
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,041
Don't drag me off topic.

334
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,291
I don't know.

335
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,500
He told me only that

336
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,708
it was a woman with long hair

337
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,458
covering her face,

338
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,875
and she was pale.

339
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,833
-Sitting at his feet.
-And...

340
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,333
what did he do next?

341
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,500
Well, what could he have done?

342
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:36,208
He squeezed his eyes shut
and waited until dawn.

343
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,791
When the sun came up,

344
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,416
he went and asked a ranger nearby.

345
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:42,750
He said that,

346
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,083
there was a woman

347
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,041
who drowned in the area.

348
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,708
Shit.

349
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
And the spot Tia slept at,

350
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,708
is the same spot you are
right at now, Shin. Right here.

351
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,583
-Tough luck, man.
-It's giving me goosebumps.

352
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:02,000
Don't pull that prank.
We're in the middle of the woods.

353
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:04,458
-Let's just go to bed.
-Hey, wait a minute.

354
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,416
Aren't you ever curious

355
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,416
why it's always a ghost of a woman

356
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,083
-with long hair, covering her face?
-Yeah.

357
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:14,250
I've seen it in countless movies,
it's all the same.

358
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,916
-Have you seen Shutter?
-Asshole.

359
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:19,083
I haven't seen it.
Don't fucking talk about it.

360
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,625
You've never seen Shutter?

361
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,916
Come here.

362
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:26,166
The ghost was sitting
on the protagonist's shoulders.

363
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,916
Fuck. Are you fucking nuts?

364
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,541
-Really. That's why his neck hurt--
-Enough.

365
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,791
I don't think ghosts are real.

366
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,625
Back in the day,

367
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,458
I used to take people out rafting here.

368
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:38,541
I'd stay in the woods by myself,

369
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,958
and I've never seen any ghosts.

370
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,041
Right.

371
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:43,166
-You're just paranoid, Shin.
-Idiot.

372
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,833
I don't know if they're real,

373
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,416
I just know I'm scared.

374
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,416
Oh, well.

375
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,791
Say, what if...

376
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,958
anyone amongst the four of us

377
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,916
ends up dead because of it?

378
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,875
Would you be scared?

379
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,208
I'm not scared of any of you dying.

380
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:06,791
I'm more scared of myself dying.

381
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,166
Fucking prick.

382
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,375
But seriously,

383
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,458
I think...

384
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,708
amongst the four of us,

385
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,583
if turdbag Shin died,

386
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,083
he'd make a frightening ghost.

387
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:22,750
Why is that?

388
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,416
Just look at his face.

389
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,041
He isn't even dead,
yet I'm already spooked.

390
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:32,791
Yeah, right, you fucking Prince Charming.

391
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,166
Why are you getting up?

392
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,666
-Yeah.
-Ter. Phueak.

393
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,333
Move over. I'm getting in the middle.

394
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,875
What's wrong with you?

395
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,541
Are you that much of a pussy?

396
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,333
-If you're not, just sleep outside.
-I'm not.

397
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:48,875
I'm... too lazy to move.

398
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,416
Ter.

399
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,458
Ter.

400
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,833
You're not scared,
so switch places with me.

401
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:57,583
I mean I wouldn't be scared of you guys,

402
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,291
but I'm scared of ghosts in general.

403
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:03,333
-Just let me sleep in the middle. Please.
-What is wrong with you?

404
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,333
-Shoo. Dam it.
-Hey, hey, come on.

405
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,708
Stop fucking arguing.

406
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,916
Let's just go to bed. I'm so tired.

407
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,166
-See? He's tired. Just get to bed.
-Yeah.

408
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,666
And If I die,

409
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,416
I'm going to come back
and haunt the one in the middle first.

410
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,583
Well, well.

411
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:18,541
So may it be.

412
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,166
I hope you die, as you wish.

413
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,500
Did you even brush your teeth
before bed? You smell bad already.

414
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,375
IN THE MIDDLE

415
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,958
Just keep heading in this direction.

416
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:48,125
By the time we reach
the camping spot, it'll be evening.

417
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:50,125
Shin.

418
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,000
Why do you even have to read the compass?

419
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,458
The river just flows in one direction.

420
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,041
Yeah, were you expecting us
to make a turn somewhere?

421
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:58,333
Well...

422
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,208
I don't want it to go to waste.

423
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,583
Well, there's no need. Pocket it.

424
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,833
Hey, Phueak.

425
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:11,541
You too, asshole. Why are you shouting?

426
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:14,750
I'm Jack Dawson. Haven't you seen Titanic?

427
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,208
He stands at the bow of the ship.

428
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,375
Well--

429
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,583
Phueak, son of a bitch.

430
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:22,166
You want the boat to sink or what?

431
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:24,291
No. I just want to be Jack.

432
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,083
Hey, Shin.

433
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:28,666
Don't tell me you didn't know
that the Titanic sank.

434
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,625
Well, I haven't seen it.

435
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,250
You haven't seen Titanic?

436
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,958
You know, at the end,
Rose was on Jack's shoulders?

437
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,500
Shutter ripped that off.

438
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:40,583
-For real?
-For real.

439
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,708
Titanic did that like a decade before.

440
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,166
Well, fuck.

441
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,625
Sodding Thai movies.

442
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:49,083
Man, don't you have movie rentals
where you live?

443
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:57,708
Look.

444
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,166
It's party time!

445
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,708
Here we go.

446
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,291
Let's hit it harder!

447
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,333
Shin, help with the paddling!

448
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,416
Let's go!

449
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:33,833
Hey, Phueak.

450
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:34,791
Phueak, don't get up!

451
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,583
Phueak, don't get up. Get down.
You'll flip us over!

452
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,833
Phueak!

453
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,041
Phueak, don't stand!

454
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,458
Phueak, get down! Phueak!

455
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,291
Ter.

456
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,250
Help me!

457
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,208
Shin.

458
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,083
Phueak!

459
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,416
Shin, Phueak, are you all right?

460
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,583
I'm okay, you?

461
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,125
Where's Ter?

462
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,583
Fuck, you're right.

463
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,583
-Ter!
-Ter!

464
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,041
Ter, you bastard!

465
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:46,958
Ter!

466
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,041
Ter!

467
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,041
-Shit, and he can't swim that well.
-Damn it.

468
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,541
Where is he?

469
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:54,208
-Ter.
-There.

470
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:59,958
-Fucking hell. Ter!
-Ter!

471
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:02,166
-Ter!
-Ter!

472
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,583
-Help!
-There's Ter!

473
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,041
Ter!

474
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,583
Ter!

475
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:12,833
Aey, quick!

476
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Help!

477
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:16,708
Ter.

478
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,708
-Help.
-Ter, hang on.

479
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:25,708
Help me.

480
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:26,916
Ter.

481
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:29,041
-Ter, don't pull me!
-Help.

482
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,416
-Help.
-Hey.

483
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,833
Don't pull me.

484
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,208
Help!

485
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,958
-Help!
-Ter!

486
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:37,833
Aey, watch out!

487
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,041
Shit.

488
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,333
Fuck, no.

489
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:42,916
Where are they?

490
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,041
Aey!

491
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:45,583
Ter!

492
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:48,333
Aey!

493
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,500
Shit! Where are you?

494
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,541
Aey!

495
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,958
Ter!

496
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:56,833
Hey, Ter.

497
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,333
Careful.

498
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,916
It's all right. You're okay now. Sit down.

499
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,208
How are you?

500
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,625
Are you okay?

501
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:11,083
Where's Aey?

502
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,166
-Aey.
-Damn it.

503
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,250
Aey!

504
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,083
-Where's that bastard?
-Aey!

505
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,250
Aey!

506
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,250
Aey!

507
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,541
Aey!

508
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,875
Aey, where are you?

509
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:23,791
Aey!

510
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,375
Aey!

511
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,791
Aey?

512
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,208
Fucking shit. Aey!

513
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,291
-Aey!
-Aey.

514
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:34,791
Aey!

515
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:36,958
Aey!

516
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,125
Aey!

517
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:41,958
Aey!

518
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,708
Where are you?

519
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,458
Hey, Aey!

520
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,333
Do you think he'll be all right?

521
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:03,708
I think he'll be fine.

522
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:06,708
Don't overthink it.

523
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,666
You're the one overthinking.

524
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:10,750
Why are you fucking crying?

525
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,916
Aey isn't fucking dead yet.

526
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,583
When you know he's dead, then you can cry.

527
01:00:16,666 --> 01:00:18,916
But we've been looking everywhere.

528
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,708
Let's not mull over it too much.

529
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,166
We'll be out of the woods tomorrow, right?

530
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,041
We can get the rangers
to come look for him again.

531
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,583
Let's just call it a night.

532
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:31,708
Trust me.

533
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,833
We've got a long way to go tomorrow.

534
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:35,958
I'm going to bed.

535
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,291
Ter.

536
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:47,833
Let's call it a night.

537
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,208
Hey.

538
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,208
What's wrong with you now, Ter?

539
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:16,708
Why aren't you sleeping in the same spot?

540
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,416
What spot are you talking about?

541
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:27,083
Well, I slept next to Aey last night.

542
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,583
So I should get to sleep on the end.

543
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:33,041
Hell, just sleep wherever is convenient.
It's fucking late.

544
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,625
Ter.

545
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:36,208
Don't tell me that

546
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:39,083
you're thinking
of what he said last night.

547
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:45,208
What the fuck did he say?

548
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,708
About that...

549
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,416
if he dies,

550
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,208
he's coming back
to haunt the one in the middle.

551
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:57,375
Dead, my ass.

552
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,333
Aey isn't fucking dead yet.

553
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,083
Stop talking nonsense.

554
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,583
We'll find him tomorrow. Let's go to bed.

555
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,083
If you're not scared,

556
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,458
then move over to the middle.

557
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,375
Shit.

558
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,083
Shin, man.

559
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,416
Your feet fucking stink.

560
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,583
No, they don't.

561
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:45,000
It's right up my nostrils.

562
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,416
Keep your fucking feet out of my face.

563
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,083
Why are you even smelling it then?

564
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:49,125
Hey, shh.

565
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:53,375
Do you hear something?

566
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,375
What?

567
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,500
What is that sound?

568
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:06,750
It sounds like...

569
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,291
someone's walking towards us.

570
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:20,666
Who's that?

571
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,041
Aey, is that you?

572
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,333
Aey.

573
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:29,958
Aey.

574
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,416
What the fuck?

575
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,166
Aey.

576
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,833
-Fuck, man.
-Shit.

577
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,666
Tough fucker, we thought you were dead.

578
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,458
Hey, Aey, how are you feeling?

579
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,916
Shin.

580
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,083
-Get him a towel, dry him up.
-Okay.

581
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,500
Are you okay, man?

582
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,041
Are you hurt anywhere?

583
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,333
Hey, and...

584
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,833
how did you make it back?

585
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,208
I'm cold.

586
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,666
Dry him up. There.

587
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,000
And go change your clothes.
You'll get sick.

588
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:12,541
We were looking for you.

589
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,333
It's good that you're back.

590
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,666
Damn, there's not a scratch on you, huh?

591
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,666
Fuck, that's awesome.

592
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:25,666
You're so damn lucky.

593
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:09,833
Hey, where are you going?

594
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,375
I'm going for a smoke.

595
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,375
Yeah, I'm coming along.

596
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,041
Hey.

597
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:26,416
Where's your smoke?

598
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,125
Come on.

599
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:31,833
Stingy douchebag.

600
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,625
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

601
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,708
-What's strange?
-Shit.

602
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,750
Keep it down.

603
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,750
-What?
-I mean about Aey.

604
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,208
What about him?

605
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:01,916
What kind of fucking person

606
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,625
can go under water for minutes on end
and come out just fine?

607
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,166
What?

608
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,458
And isn't it good that he's fine?

609
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:11,166
Don't jinx it, come on.

610
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,541
Aey.

611
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:29,458
Are you all right?

612
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,541
Aey?

613
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,916
Are you okay?

614
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Aey.

615
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:03,375
Aey.

616
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,416
Aey.

617
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,541
Aey.

618
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,250
What's wrong?

619
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:22,541
You?

620
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,458
What are you doing out here?
You don't even smoke.

621
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,666
Well, I'm going to start smoking today.

622
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:32,875
Take it easy.

623
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:33,916
Man.

624
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,291
Starting your rebellious phase
at this age?

625
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:39,458
Ter.

626
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,625
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

627
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,791
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

628
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,041
Phueak.

629
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,791
What if Aey is already dead?

630
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,208
Dead, my fucking ass.

631
01:07:54,583 --> 01:07:56,166
Then who's that in the tent?

632
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:57,708
Fuck, man.

633
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:59,666
Haven't you seen The Sixth Sense?

634
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:00,833
What of it?

635
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,541
The guy doesn't know that he's dead.

636
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,583
Really?

637
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,583
You son of a bitch.

638
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,708
Why did you have to tell me that?
I haven't seen it.

639
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:10,791
You had it coming.

640
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:11,791
My turn, bitch.

641
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,333
Maybe Aey is back for you, Ter.

642
01:08:20,916 --> 01:08:22,541
You're the one who caused him to drown.

643
01:08:22,625 --> 01:08:23,541
Fuck you.

644
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,083
Watch your fucking mouth.

645
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,041
I think he's back because you...

646
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:34,083
jinxed him to die.

647
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:35,375
What?

648
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,041
Didn't you say he isn't dead?

649
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,291
I'm just joking.

650
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:43,541
Shitheads.

651
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,875
Seriously, you think he's actually dead?

652
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:53,791
I don't know.

653
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:55,583
Maybe I'm just paranoid.

654
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:58,208
Yeah. I'd say you're paranoid.

655
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,375
Fine. I'll go take a piss.

656
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:05,125
And do it far away from the tent.

657
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:07,958
It's enough that I have to put up with
Shin's fucking feet.

658
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,041
Wait for me.

659
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,250
Hey, Ter.

660
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:29,916
Take Aey with you.

661
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,541
You're...

662
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:32,666
sweating a hell of a lot.

663
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,166
Are you okay?

664
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:45,958
Are you feeling warmer?

665
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,291
Yeah.

666
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,250
It's good that you're okay.

667
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,875
Fuck.

668
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:07,958
A snake.

669
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:15,583
I'm so fucked. I'm fucked.

670
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,416
What's wrong with you, Ter? What is it?

671
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,416
Aey is dead.

672
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,750
-Huh?
-What?

673
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,791
Aey is fucking dead.

674
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,916
-What are you talking about?
-Shit.

675
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,208
Here he comes.
He's walking right towards us.

676
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,250
Shit.

677
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:35,708
What's wrong, Ter?

678
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,125
Aey is fucking dead.

679
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,625
I just saw his body.

680
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,250
Are you playing a joke on us?

681
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,916
-It's not funny.
-Yeah.

682
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,291
Joke, my fucking foot.

683
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,583
I just saw his body floating in the river.

684
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,666
No way.

685
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:54,666
-Shit.
-Shit.

686
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:56,541
Ter, don't let it go, man.

687
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:59,250
-Man, what is wrong with you?
-But it's Aey.

688
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:00,666
-Hell, man.
-It's Aey.

689
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,125
Phueak, don't...

690
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:04,208
-Don't prank him like that.
-Phueak.

691
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,791
-It's Aey, Phueak.
-It's cold outside. Bullshit.

692
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,666
Shit, why didn't you stop me?
Fucking hell.

693
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,333
Is this a good idea?

694
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,083
I mean, he's our friend, after all.

695
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,333
But he's dead, dude.

696
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,750
I don't count ghosts as friends.

697
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,291
Aey.

698
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,625
Leave us alone.

699
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,958
You're dead, do you hear me?

700
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:36,916
Aey.

701
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,625
Is he gone?

702
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,541
Phueak, you go and check.

703
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,041
But why me?

704
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:48,166
Yeah, you go, Phueak.

705
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:50,833
Fuck.

706
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,291
I think he's gone.

707
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,791
Shit.

708
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,416
Where are they?

709
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:07,958
Hey.

710
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:10,291
Is Aey gone?

711
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:17,958
Maybe.

712
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,791
Fuck me.

713
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,250
How are we going to get down there?

714
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:28,500
Shit.

715
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,166
How did you get up here?

716
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:37,041
No.

717
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,791
No, this way.

718
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:55,458
Fuck, where are they?

719
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:11,958
Shit.

720
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,375
Who's there?

721
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:20,083
Fucker, tell me who you are?

722
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,458
Hey, it's me.

723
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,208
Phueak.

724
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,000
Shit, fuck you.

725
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,250
You scared me.

726
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,583
What are you afraid of?

727
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,208
Use your eyes, man.

728
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:30,583
Here.

729
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,916
Fuck me.

730
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,916
You should've given them to me
in the first place.

731
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:39,000
Fuck.

732
01:15:42,708 --> 01:15:43,708
Fuck.

733
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:28,333
Ter, mate.

734
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:29,916
Shin. Phueak.

735
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:42,708
Come on, quick.

736
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,875
-Shit.
-Shit.

737
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:49,416
It's Aey's body.

738
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,916
Fuck, man.

739
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,291
What do we do?

740
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,333
I think we should go.

741
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:58,875
Then tomorrow,

742
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:00,875
we'll get the rangers to recover the body.

743
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:05,125
You're not taking him with us, are you?

744
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,166
Let's go.

745
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,541
Fuck, Aey, I'm sorry.

746
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,208
Wait.

747
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,041
What the fuck is it now?

748
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:19,708
Let's just get out of here.

749
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,291
-Aey.
-Shit.

750
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:25,666
Why are you calling him?

751
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,666
-Aey.
-No.

752
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:33,041
-Why are you calling him?
-So he can come and see his body.

753
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,791
I want him to know he's dead.

754
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,375
So he'll leave us alone.

755
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:41,166
Aey.

756
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,333
Aey.

757
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,125
Come out, man.

758
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,250
Shit.

759
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,625
Aey, you're dead, man.

760
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:02,416
Now leave us alone.

761
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,125
Here's your body.

762
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,833
Look at it.

763
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,291
Shit.

764
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,458
Ter.

765
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,875
Ter.

766
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,625
Look at it.

767
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,208
Shit!

768
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:36,250
So are we ghosts or humans?

769
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:40,708
-Phueak.
-Shit.

770
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,666
Fuck.

771
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,791
This is like The Others twist ending shit.

772
01:18:54,750 --> 01:18:55,833
Fuck you.

773
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:58,125
You spoiled the ending again.

774
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,083
Why do you even fucking care?

775
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,416
We're all fucking dead!

776
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,083
I tried to tell you.

777
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,583
But you kept being pussies.

778
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,791
So I had to let you see for yourself.

779
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,041
Fuck.

780
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:18,291
A snake.

781
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,666
So?

782
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:47,208
Am I still your friend?

783
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,416
You are.

784
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:11,416
-Yes?
-Hello? Pim?

785
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,958
You just woke up? Can we talk?
Are you with your boyfriend?

786
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,166
No, I can talk, Miss.

787
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:20,708
And when are you going to introduce us
to your billionaire boyfriend?

788
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:24,791
You've been keeping him to yourself
and you just fell off the radar.

789
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:26,666
Can I help you with something?

790
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:28,500
Well, Pim,

791
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:31,708
there's a special flight tomorrow.

792
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,666
They want the same cabin crew on it.

793
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:36,208
Do you remember Prince Albert

794
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:39,416
and that Princess who booked the whole
plane for their honeymoon this year?

795
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:41,833
They're coming back,

796
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:43,791
landing in Phuket, like before.

797
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:45,916
I remember.

798
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:54,958
LAST FRIGHT

799
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,833
Yeah, I'm baffled, too.

800
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,916
I don't know why they asked
for the same crew

801
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:12,500
when only the Princess is coming.

802
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:15,458
But there's a rumor that she got beat up.

803
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:18,083
She's about to get dumped.

804
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:21,125
The Prince has a mistress.

805
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:23,458
Really? But...

806
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:27,291
I have a schedule conflict tomorrow.
Can you find someone else?

807
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,458
No, Pim, it's the higher-ups' request.

808
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:32,166
We really can't change that now.

809
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,375
You're the only one
who has flown with her.

810
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:37,166
I just called Tui up a moment ago.

811
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,166
All right, Miss.

812
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,291
Understood.

813
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:53,541
Oh. And where's Tui, Miss?
Why isn't she here yet?

814
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:56,125
Well, Pim, it looks like you'll have to
fly solo now.

815
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:57,833
What? Why is that?

816
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:01,791
Well, Ter, Tui's brother drowned in
Chiang Mai last night.

817
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:04,416
I really can't find someone
to replace her.

818
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,583
-Is that so?
-Yes.

819
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,916
Aren't you a fucking lot to handle?

820
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,291
Your Highness.

821
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:08,833
Captain.

822
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:11,416
We're about to land,
would you like anything?

823
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,666
I'm good, thank you.

824
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:14,791
All right.

825
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:12,458
PHUKET AIRPORT 22 HOURS LATER

826
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,583
Last night, Princess Sophia
of the Republic of Vanistan

827
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:21,791
died in Phuket

828
01:33:21,875 --> 01:33:23,875
at 9 p.m. local time

829
01:33:23,958 --> 01:33:25,875
in her hotel room.

830
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:29,083
She was 34 years old.

831
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:33,083
As of now, the doctors have yet
to determine the cause of death.

832
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:38,250
The Bureau of the Royal Household has
requested for her body to be transported

833
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:40,833
back to her country within 15 hours.

834
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:44,083
A special flight will be arranged
accordingly by Golden Star Airline.

835
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:14,875
Miss Pim.

836
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:18,250
They've asked us to transport
her body back within 15 hours.

837
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:21,791
We can't transport her
under the plane in cargo...

838
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:23,541
as she's royalty.

839
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:27,833
So we have to arrange a seat for her
on the plane, just as on her way here.

840
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:30,416
Miss Pim.

841
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,208
You're responsible for the body.

842
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,375
Those without authorization

843
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,958
cannot get on board.

844
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:38,333
Yes, Captain.

845
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,958
You're aware that after this flight,

846
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,333
you'll be interrogated, right?

847
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:45,000
I am.

848
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,958
-Captain.
-What is it, Miss Pim?

849
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:14,375
Can you please come out here?

850
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,333
What's going on?

851
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:18,916
Uh.

852
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:20,708
Well...

853
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,083
Miss Pim, just state your business.

854
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:28,333
Nothing, Captain.

855
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:30,208
All right, Miss Pim,

856
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:32,208
we're in a storm zone.

857
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:35,916
I'm sorry.

858
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,083
Your meal, Captain.

859
01:39:21,666 --> 01:39:22,916
Thank you.

860
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:49,708
-What is it now, Miss Pim?
-Captain.

861
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,333
What the hell are you playing now?

862
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,208
Where did you put her body?

863
01:41:53,541 --> 01:41:55,041
What the heck are you talking about?

864
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,875
You've already violated
a lot of our regulations.

865
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:58,291
Pull yourself together.

866
01:41:58,458 --> 01:42:01,416
Where did you put the Princess's body?

867
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,791
If you keep talking nonsense,

868
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,583
-I'm not going to pick up anymore.
-Captain.

869
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:06,958
Captain.

870
01:45:57,333 --> 01:45:58,583
Captain.

871
01:45:58,666 --> 01:46:00,791
Land the plane now.
Do you hear me? Captain?

872
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:04,166
I told you to land it. Captain.

873
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,666
Open it.

874
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:08,166
I'm telling you to open it now.

875
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:09,791
Open the door now. Open.

876
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,166
Open it now.

877
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:24,166
-Pim.
-Let me go. Let go.

878
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:29,083
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell?

879
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:30,958
Take a look at the bitch's body yourself!

880
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,458
That's enough! I don't want to hear
any more of this nonsense!

881
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:35,916
Let me go. Let go.

882
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:38,625
Let me go!

883
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:39,875
Let go!

884
01:46:39,958 --> 01:46:42,375
I'm not going. Let me go now!

885
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:43,458
Let me go!

886
01:46:44,916 --> 01:46:47,083
Pim, you're going to be interrogated!

887
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,833
Captain, please let me go.

888
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:08,416
I've had enough. I'm scared.
Please let me go. I'm so scared.

889
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,833
I won't do it anymore!

890
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:20,541
No. I'm scared!

891
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:27,041
I won't touch him ever again.

892
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:28,791
Please let me go.

893
01:49:47,833 --> 01:49:49,916
