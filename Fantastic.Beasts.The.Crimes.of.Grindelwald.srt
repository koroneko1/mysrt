188

There's a story in my family

that a phoenix will come
to any Dumbledore in desperate need.

190

And that it took flight when he died,
never to return.

192
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,831
With all due respect, Professor,
I don't believe for a minute

193
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,999
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

194
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,352
So why did you send me to New York?

195
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,780
Because I knew Grindelwald
would try to catch Credence.

196
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,199
He had a vision, you see,
many years ago.

197
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,992
In which an Obscurial killed
the man he fears above all others.

You.

199
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,706
I thought you might deprive Grindelwald
of his weapon,

200
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,759
not by killing Credence,
but by saving him.

201
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,931
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

202
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,476
Trying to trace his real family.

203
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,808
I take it you've heard the rumors
about who he really is.

204
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,974
No.

205
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,661
The pure-bloods think he's the last
of an important French line.

206
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,949
A baby whom everyone thought lost.

207
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,742
Not Leta's brother?

208
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,078
That's what they're whispering.

209
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,707
And pure-blood or not, I know this.

210
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,921
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

211
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,671
as a dark twin, an only friend.

212
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,683
If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

213
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,014
he might yet be saved.

214
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,517
Wherever Credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger,

215
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,478
or a danger to others.

216
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,020
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

217
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,569
And I rather hope
you might be the one to find him.

218
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,114
What's that?

219

acquaintance of mine.

220

A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.

221
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,132
Safe house?
Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

222

One hopes you won't, but should things
at some point go terribly wrong,
