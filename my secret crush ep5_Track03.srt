Park, you saw Mek? What's wrong with him?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Jealous, I guess.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,559
You have anyone you like?

8
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,400
I only know that he's one of my fans.

9
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,273
Is there anything wrong?

10
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:28,285
It's nothing. I guess I'm just tired.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,280
He said he's okay. Stop bugging him.

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,234
You wouldn't know anything.
You're too busy enjoying that BL fame.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,050
If I ask you to make BL content with me,

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,422
you wouldn't mind, would you?

15
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:51,403
Tim.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,571
If we can't get in to the same university,

17
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,337
do you think we'll still be close like this?

18
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,000
What makes you think that way?

19
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:06,766
We can do it surely.

20
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:09,585
Even if we can't,

21
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:13,727
we'll still be close friends like we always have been.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,273
But somehow I think...

23
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:24,818
I don't want us to be the same.

24
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:31,000
Can we be more than that?

25
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:34,533
More than that?

26
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:39,636
How?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,092
I like you.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,754
- Mai.
- You don't have to answer me anything.

29
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,000
I just wanted to tell you that.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I don't know if we have to go
separate ways in the future or not.

31
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:11,637
I am sorry.

32
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,779
Don't make your face like that.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,585
You don't need to feel guilty about it.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like I said, I just wanted to tell you.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Perhaps it's because of changing weather.

36
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,234
I may get sentimental because of it.

37
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,040
Mai.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,492
Honestly...

39
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,311
I want us to stay like this forever.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,403
You do understand, right?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,701
That boyfriends can break up.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But you and me can't stop being friends.

43
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,078
I'd rather be a selfish one here.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because I want you to be with me like this forever.

45

Welcome back to Fame Hunger!

58
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,934
And the topic we're going to discuss today
is none other than...

59
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:00,000
#TimKim

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,753
Let's have a look on how this hashtag went viral.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,882
#TimKim started from a new BL couple

62
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:11,467
from the same famous university.

63
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:14,280
This couple has become a new talk of the town.

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,000
They are Tim and Kimhan.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,200
This hashtag is the hottest topic online right now.

66
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:26,000
Apparently, the fans of Mek-Kim, which is the original BL couple,

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
have been calling out the university's chancellor about this abrupt change of ship

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
from Mek-Kim to Tim-Kim.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,520
They demand an answer from the chancellor!

70
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:42,000
This circumstance has sparked a war between two fandoms.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's check out some of the online comments.

72
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,000
The original one is, hands down, better.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,234
The fake ones that come after never last long.

74
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,688
Ouch!

75
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,432
They might come after but they come with a bang!

76
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,455
Nothing to be afraid of. Love you, Tim!

77
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,779
Later the chancellor responded that

78
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,365
when it comes to BL,

79
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,611
one doesn't have to stick to a single ship forever.

80
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:08,000
The ship can change depending on chemistry and suitability of the content.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She also asked the fans to chill out

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and think of the boys' BL role
simply as their duty and responsibility.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,531
Wow. What a harsh comment from the chancellor.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,208
I think I talked too much already.

85
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:30,697
Well, if there's any progress,
I'm going to keep you drama-hungry people updated for sure!

86
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:32,571
For today, we must say goodbye now.

87
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:33,694
Nom, nom, nom, nom...

88
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,726
Doesn't this means you got dismissed?

89
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,196
What should we do?

90
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:39,681
I don't know.

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
Can't think of anything.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,585
How come it turned out like this?

93
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:44,453
You can't just sit here being clueless!

94
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:46,052
You have to do something

95
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,680
now that the other guy is going in full force.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
I'm afraid your Mek-Kim fandom is going to break soon.

97
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,450
And I can tell you...

98
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,702
that perhaps

99
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,702
you might get your heart broken too!

100
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:55,820
No way.

101
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,000
I never fancy Kimhan!

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,467
I told you it's all just an act.

103

how much you get flustered around him.

104

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,988
I think so.

What was it that you were going to say?

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,611
I just wanted to tell you to eat a lot.

this is how you do it.

You're going a bit too far.

Why don't you order some more and take it home then?

Can I really do that?

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,754
I was kidding!

Such a bummer.

00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,234
Come on.

170
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,156
I think...

171
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,640
You should have a talk with Mek and tell him what you feel.

172
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:48,234
You two are good friends. You can talk.

173
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,560
It's no big deal.

174
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,584
It's because it's no big deal.

175
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,037
That's why Mek wouldn't care.

176
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,922
You shouldn't think for yourself that way.

177
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,663
If you two don't resolve this soon,

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,389
when are we fans going to get new uploads from you?

179
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,415
I can't promise that,

180
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,404
but I'll try my best.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,234
Did you finally find that fan of yours?

182
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,415
The one you said you liked.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,925
Not yet.

184
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,664
I searched for him everywhere
but still couldn't find him.

185
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:22,285
I think I only find myself with you lately.

186
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,493
We bump into each other all the time.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think the reason why we meet often,

188
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,182
is perhaps because we're looking for each other.

189
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,120
Maybe that's the reason why I'm always on your sight.

190
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:38,000
Where did you get such wise word from?

191
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:39,741
So sentimental!

192
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,000
Have you finished?

193
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,311
I'll pay now.

194
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,585
Yes, I'm done.

195
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,000
Check, please.

196
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:52,856
10 bowls of noodles.

197
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,760
It's 370 baht.

198
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you have enough money?

199
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:07,611
Can I do bank transfer here?

200
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:10,120
No, we accept cash only.

201
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,880
Bomb, can you lend me some cash?

202
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,153
How come?

203
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,000
You said you were going to pay for me?

204
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,360
You even convinced me to eat a lot.

205
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,207
Three hundred and seventy.

206
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,520
Okay, done.

207
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:35,000
Bomb, give me your bank account number.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,313
I'll transfer your money back.

209
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,000
I said I'll pay so I'll pay.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm a man of his word.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well...

212
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,000
PromptPay okay?

213
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,000
097 884 2643

214
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,269
Once you're done with the transaction,

215
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,040
you may also call me with this number.

216
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,204
Are you for real?

217
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,273
Okay.

218
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,196
Your name is...

219
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,411
Kritsada Bhakdi.

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,830
Hey, it's him again!

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,917
Kritsada.

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,559
I should give him a heart.

223
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,116
I got a lot of motivation from watching you, Bear.

224
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:19,000
It's clear to me that you worked so hard to make this fun.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Keep it up!

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,467
This Kritsada guy always mentions me in his comments.

227
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,351
Bear.

228
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:29,675
Are you trying to memorize my number or what?

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,585
You still haven't transferred the money.

230
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:36,909
About what you said that we met often

231
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,415
because we might be looking for each other...

232
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:42,000
It's true, isn't it?

233
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:44,000
Come again?

234
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,000
You are that fan.

235
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,896
The one I was looking for.

236
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,000
Finally, we meet.

237
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,883
Kritsada Bhakdi.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,840
Hello!

239
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,547
Oh hey! Thanks, pal.

240
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:40,000
Bomb!

241
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,000
What's wrong with you?

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You look like you're sick or something.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,130
I'm okay. I'm perfectly fine.

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,026
Am I really okay, right?

245
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, I'm okay.

246
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,507
Here's the thing.

247
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:57,793
I have some huge thing to consult with you guys real quick.

248
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,352
- What is it?
- What is it?

249
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:07,000
It happened yesterday after I finished my job.

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
I had a meal at a popular noodle place called Thong's.

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,455
I was starving so I ordered one dry noodle.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
And when I started to eat it, I felt that...

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
if I also had a soup, it'd be even better.

254
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:25,000
All this fuss just to make us listen to how you eat noodles?

255
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:26,398
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,640
I'm just excited.

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,545
The thing is, yesterday at the noodle shop...

258
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,441
I met Bear and he wanted to pay for me.

259
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:35,040
But then he didn't have cash.

260
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,597
So I paid for him and he'd transfer the money back.

261
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,000
And then came the climax.

262
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,778
He saw my full name.

263
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,000
What's wrong with your full name?

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,715
Did you register your name with some weird stuff?

265
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:50,870
Can you just tell us the whole story?

266
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,922
Stop beating around the bush.

267
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,455
The truth is...

268
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,570
Before that I ran into Bear once.

269
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,880
And he told me he had a thing for one of his fans.

270
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,320
and that he was looking for him.

271
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,000
So when he saw my name,

272
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,559
he told me...

273
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,286
I was that fan he'd been looking for!

274
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:12,520
- That's it?
- That's it?

275
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,026
Don't you guys get excited for me?

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I was the fan whom he liked and was looking for!

277
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,000
It's good, isn't it?

278
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,520
You like him and he likes you back.

279
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:28,519
What exactly is your concern
that you want to talk us about?

280
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:30,507
I'm afraid he'll be disappointed...

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that the person he liked and looked for is me.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,682
Look,

283
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,739
He was searching everywhere for this person.

284
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,467
So no matter who that person is,

285
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,155
he'd surely be happy when he finds them.

286
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:41,469
Exactly.

287
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,000
Try not to think ahead.

288
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,571
Just wait and see.

289
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:04,156
[When you finish your class, wait in front
of the building, I'll pick you up.]

290
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:07,234
Kimhan.

291
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:08,999
Hello.

292
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,000
Tim, what are you doing here?

293
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,000
I'd like to ask you to have a meal with me.

294
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,325
A meal?

295
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,000
When we shot the uniform mix & match content,

296
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,560
You owe me a meal, remember?

297
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,182
I don't think I can make it today, again.

298
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,415
I have some stuff to do with Mek.

299
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:42,856
Next time, I promise I'll go with you.

300
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:44,000
That's a pity.

301
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:46,000
But it's okay.

302
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,400
Next time, you can't deny me again.

303
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,507
Sure.

304
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:51,649
Well...

305
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,649
I gotta go now.

306
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,525
See ya.

307
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,999
If you're afraid of falling off, make sure you hold me tight, alright?

308
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,640
What's wrong with you?

309
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,400
Where are we going?

310
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,440
You'll find out soon.

311
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,415
Making content with Tim...

312
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,285
will never be as fun as making it with me.

313
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,531
So you're saying...

314
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:37,040
You want to keep doing this BL couple thing with me?

315
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,167
You picked me up in front of the building

316
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,040
just to do this?

317
00:18:55,337 --> 00:18:56,149
What's wrong with it?

318
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,903
I'm afraid you'd already forget
what you've done with your former BL partner.

319
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,891
I see you bring a lot of stuff here.

320
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,343
Nothing much actually.

321
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,743
I know you're so busy.

322
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:15,661
so I want just you to come sit here and relax.

323
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,743
I prepared these lunch boxes so you can relax for real.

324
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,303
Sounds like a great idea.

325
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:23,952
And we don't need to go far.

326
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:32,870
I have a lot of work to do.

327
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:35,870
My head is spinning.

328
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,983
Because of your newfound BL couple fame?

329
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,743
Yeah, it is.

330
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,446
The chancellor told me...

331
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,023
she had a lot of plans for it.

332
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:47,383
Like planting trees.

333
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:48,622
Going on a camp.

334
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,891
And for this coming week,
we're set to make a cake content.

335
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,216
With these many contents,

336
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:56,443
I'm sure she plans to have them posted until next year.

337
00:19:58,613 --> 00:19:59,663
I suppose that's her plan.

338
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,191
It's fun anyway.

339
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:07,626
Believe me,

340
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:09,657
Making content with Tim

341
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,743
will never be as fun as making it with me.

342
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,404
Why?

343
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,466
So you're saying...

344
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,934
you want to keep doing this BL couple thing with me?

345
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:19,743
No!

346
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:29,849
Kim.

347
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:33,455
Mek!

348
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,807
You caught me off guard.

349
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,595
Candid shots like this are cute.

350
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:41,340
I want a reshoot.

351
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:42,904
Let me see that.

352
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:43,874
I won't let you.

353
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:44,599
Mek!

354
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,082
Mek!

355
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,922
Guys,

356
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,292
I have a new pranking idea!

357
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:58,623
What?

358
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:01,103
So you're coming back to make prank content on our channel?

359
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:01,916
Hell yeah!

360
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,998
Yes!

361
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,998
The old Mek is back, people!!

362
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:08,693
Yes.

363
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:10,443
This time we will do a prank on Tim.

364
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,743
What!?

365
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:15,276
Why him?

366
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:17,276
If I can do a prank on Tim
and tarnish his image,

367
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,743
all his fans will return to me like before,
don't you think?

368
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:20,783
Don't you want to do it?

369
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,107
You've become so obsessed with BL fame!

370
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:24,604
In the end...

371
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,228
you're doing it all for yourself!

372
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,743
I won't do it.

373
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:28,836
What now?

374
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:30,295
I'm back to make content with you
and now you won't do it?

375
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,542
You also hated it when I let our channel fade.

376
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,463
Park, are you in this with me?

377
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,743
Stop hesitating.

378
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:40,913
Park is not going to be in this with you

379
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,383
because you're hungry for BL fame.

380
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:47,743
Park, do you agree with him?

381
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:51,023
We both are sick of waiting for you.

382
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,655
If you want to enjoy BL fame that much,

383
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,040
Fine! Do it!

384
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,507
Also, screw the suspension threat!

385
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:58,743
I don't care anymore!

386
00:21:58,743 --> 00:21:59,561
Now...

387
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,455
You can get out of my room.

388
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:11,743
You said it yourself!

389
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,040
Don't regret it later then!

390
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:15,043
Mek.

391
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,212
Yeah!

392
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,295
I'll only regret it when it's snowing in Thailand!

393
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:21,446
Mek, wait!

394
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,913
Don't you think you were being too harsh?

395
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:41,779
Park...

396
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,549
I am sorry.

397
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:47,543
Mek doesn't love us anymore.

398
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:58,623
Can't believe you acted all tough earlier.

399
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:01,613
And said all that snow in Thailand stuff.

400
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:06,103
I'm sure now Mek hasn't even reached the ground floor yet.

401
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:07,583
But you're already crying this hard?

402
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:13,743
Just wait and see.

403
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:16,510
I'm gonna outbest those BL contents!

404
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,488
And I'm gonna win prizes.

405
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:21,983
Lots of clients are going to flock in and pay me in crypto!

406
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:38,903
Mek.

407
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:41,340
Can you help me with something?

408
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:42,704
What is it?

409
00:23:57,743 --> 00:23:58,407
Mek.

410
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:00,937
What happened? You look upset.

411
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,955
Bear was being silly.

412
00:24:03,955 --> 00:24:05,661
I asked him to film a content and he made a fuss about it.

413
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:07,788
He even said he'll run a channel on his own.

414
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,382
Why didn't you guys just talk it through?

415
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,404
Did you ask him why or what happened to him?

416
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,489
Typical Bear.
He felt neglected.

417
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:17,895
He'll call me when he feels better.

418
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:18,826
Don't mind him.

419
00:24:19,743 --> 00:24:21,943
About the cake content you're shooting,

420
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:22,858
I'll shoot it for you.

421
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,358
Bear and Park won't come.

422
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,407
About you being at odds with Bear...

423
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:35,089
You should talk to him.

424
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,085
Don't let this fight continue.

425
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:40,555
Understood?

426
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:49,382
Yes, sir, understood.

427
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,743
So what do you want me to help with?

428
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,085
Here.

429
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,125
I'm preparing myself for that cake content with Tim.

430
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,743
I need a guinea pig for testing.

431
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:01,663
So I'm a guinea pig?

432
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,471
Nah.

433
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,485
I don't think a guinea pig can be this cute.

434
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:07,527
I'm scared!

435
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,743
Giant guinea pig!

436
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,276
Go away!

437
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:14,299
This is good, actually.

438
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:16,357
Because I'll get to eat something for free.

439
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,318
Alright.

440
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:34,958
Here. So you don't have to keep flipping your hair.

441
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:54,743
Never knew you had a cute rubber band.

442
00:25:55,528 --> 00:25:57,083
It is as cute as the owner.

443
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,637
My sister Dao got it for me.

444
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,998
So, what exactly do you want me to help with?

445
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,382
I'm so ready now.

446
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,463
Well...

447
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:19,361
Hang on for a sec.

448
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,708
Hello, Tim.

449
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:26,722
What are you doing?

450
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:28,742
I was practicing baking cake.

451
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:31,082
I didn't know a pro like you still needs practice.

452
00:26:32,188 --> 00:26:33,743
I'm afraid I'll make mistakes at the shoot.

453
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,807
As expected, you're always cautious.

454
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,401
I suppose Mai already sent you the list of my food allergies.

455
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:41,446
Have you got it?

456
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:43,788
Yes, I got it.

457
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:47,279
My apologies if it's a little too much.

458
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:49,425
It's totally fine.

459
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:50,738
I'll see you later.

460
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:51,789
See you later.

461
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,019
You can start with that.

462
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,332
Like this?

463
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:09,255
Are you sure?

464
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,064
Or like this?

465
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,903
What's the difference?

466
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,319
You wanted him as your BL partner so much

467
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:17,743
that you asked your auntie to arrange that?

468
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:22,040
#MekKim is going well now actually.

469
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:23,870
If I change that,

470
00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:25,743
won't people come cursing at me?

471
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:27,064
I don't believe so, auntie.

472
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,743
A BL couple isn't a real couple.

473
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:30,935
And more importantly...

474
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:32,592
Have you seen this?

475
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,463
[They come after but they come with a bang!
I'm rooting for TimKim!]

476
00:27:42,552 --> 00:27:44,743
You obviously pull the strings for personal gain.

477
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:45,423
Why?

478
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,827
Are you jealous?

479
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:48,463
Jealous my ass.

480
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:51,417
I just find it funny seeing you trying so hard.

481
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:52,788
You know me.

482
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:54,485
When I want something,

483
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:57,213
I gotta get it.

484
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:58,981
Up to you, Mr. Tim.

485
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:00,935
I'll root for you then.

486
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,295
Can you grab butter from the fridge?

487
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,113
What is this?

488
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,122
The smell is so strong!

489
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:44,422
That's shrimp paste from Shrimp Paste Goddess,

490
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:45,703
not butter.

491
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,743
Do you know that her magic is very strong?

492
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:52,823
One time my dad smelled it and he threw up
right here in the kitchen.

493
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:55,743
Is that so?

494
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:57,064
Yeah!

495
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:59,149
That thing is highly dangerous!

496
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:01,467
Never smell it if you don't have the stomach for it.

497
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:04,040
See that? The butter is right next to it.

498
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:24,658
It's time Tim finally got the taste of Shrimp Paste Goddess' magic.

499
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:34,234
Are you stressed?

500
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:34,876
Brace yourself.

501
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,913
Something fun is coming up to shake your stress away.

502
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:40,503
Who's that?

503
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,467
Is this your first time having a meet-up like this?

504
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,795
Yes, it's my first time.

505
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:16,777
Are you scared?

506
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:18,632
Just a little.

507
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:20,650
Don't be afraid.

508
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,704
Anyway, if you like it, let's meet again next time.

509
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:26,057
Sure.

510
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:29,214
Park!

511
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:32,977
You think I'm a fool?

512
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:34,723
Park!

513
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:39,803
I'll go home now. Bye.

514
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:40,977
Go home safe.

515
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:46,977
Bear?

516
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,504
What are you doing here?

517
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:51,050
Actually, I was waiting for you, Bomb.

518
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:11,105
So you had a fight with Mek?

519
00:31:13,141 --> 00:31:15,650
And you told him you're going to do your own channel?

520
00:31:17,431 --> 00:31:17,977
Mm.

521
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:19,977
But you still have no idea what to do?

522
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:21,304
Mm.

523
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,632
Why don't you just keep doing the same thing then?

524
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:26,032
So your long-time fans will come and follow you again.

525
00:31:26,977 --> 00:31:27,523
No!

526
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,977
I hate to admit this...

527
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:33,497
but if I keep making prank content like I used to,

528
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:36,032
I'll never be able to beat BL content.

529
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:42,722
How about you do something you're good at
or interested in?

530
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:45,068
Alright, I know.

531
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,540
I'm just not sure where to start.

532
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,414
Besides...

533
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:51,504
If I change to the way I want

534
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:53,850
and it ends up getting a poor response

535
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,213
then what do I do?

536
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:00,613
It'll be an epic fail.

537
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:06,977
You don't have to worry about having no one to watch.

538
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:09,704
At least you have one fan who will definitely watch it.

539
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:10,686
Who?

540
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:12,641
Me.

541
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:14,650
Kritsada Bhakdi.

542
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,704
Your die-hard fan.

543
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,687
Can I ask you one thing?

544
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:22,977
When you said I was the one you were looking for,

545
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,687
how did you feel when you finally found me?

546
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:27,650
I felt great!

547
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:30,268
I finally met the person who always supports me.

548
00:32:31,977 --> 00:32:32,977
You know what...

549
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:36,449
Not many people mentioned me in their comments.

550
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:40,926
But one of the people who did was you, Bomb.

551
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:45,231
I feel very lucky.

552
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,050
Are you home now?

553
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:06,649
What was I thinking!?

554
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:13,504
Are you asleep?

555
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,759
No, no!

556
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:33,487
Who is that?

557
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:02,422
Park!

558
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:03,886
Why are you crying?

559
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:09,268
Bear,

560
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,976
Can I stay with you for a while?

561
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:14,275
Park, what happened?

562
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,377
Don't ask me for now.

563
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,395
When I feel better

564
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:27,686
I'll go back.

565
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,541
Please don't cry.

566
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,977
In three, two, one.

567
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,977
Hello!

568
00:34:47,977 --> 00:34:50,737
Now you're with us, TimKim!

569
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:54,177
This is our first video together, our debut one.

570
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:55,609
Since this is our first video,

571
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,377
do you have any special plan for me?

572
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:00,559
I'm going to make a cake for you.

573
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:05,322
I just can't wait to eat it.

574
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:09,737
Let's see what kind of cake Kim is making for me.

575
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:10,413
Let's go!

576
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:11,578
Let's go!

577
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,217
Cut!

578
00:35:19,977 --> 00:35:21,977
How was it, Mr. Cameraman?

579
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:22,977
Stop it.

580
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,068
I never wanted to do this.

581
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:28,377
If you don't want to do this,

582
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,650
just go reconcile with Bear.

583
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:31,537
I know.

584
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:32,977
I'm waiting for the right time.

585
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:36,894
By the way...

586
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,977
Are you sure you know how to film?

587
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,723
Did you make me look good?

588
00:35:40,977 --> 00:35:42,432
Do not insult me.

589
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,977
Don't forget that I study film.

590
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,850
I was just kidding!

591
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,166
Please concentrate on your work then.

592
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:15,250
Here, let me help!

593
00:36:15,737 --> 00:36:17,813
For chocolate cream, use this one.

594
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,977
The other one, Kim said it's unusable.

595
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,195
Okay.

596
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,170
By the way, Mek...

597
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,577
Park are not joining us today?

598
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,577
He's probably with Bear right now.

599
00:36:30,977 --> 00:36:32,432
Don't worry about them.

600
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:33,850
They're a lot of work.

601
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:41,935
Bomb...

602
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:43,617
What's wrong?

603
00:36:43,617 --> 00:36:45,231
Why do you look gloomy today?

604
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,290
With Beat absent, you suddenly have no energy to work?

605
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,523
No, it's not that.

606
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,669
I have something else to think about.

607
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,486
You guys already finished arranging?

608
00:36:55,941 --> 00:36:56,887
Let's continue, shall we?

609
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,617
Bomb, are you stressed?

610
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:03,795
Brace yourself.

611
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:05,977
Something fun is coming up to shake your stress away.

612
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,273
What was that?

613
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:17,977
Here it is, homemade chocolate cake by Kimhan.

614
00:37:17,977 --> 00:37:20,217
It looks very yummy.

615
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,977
Only on the outside.

616
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:24,631
Now, here comes the moment I've been waiting for...

617
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:27,195
It's time to finally taste it!

618
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,090
May the force of Shrimp Paste Goddess be with him!

619
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,093
Show us your magic.

620
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:38,878
Bring it on!

621
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:50,959
It's so delicious!

622
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:54,159
Really?

623
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,977
You're such a great chef.

624
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:01,814
I almost forgot...

625
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:05,417
Let's tell the audience about your recipe.

626
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:08,668
For today, I made a chocolate cake

627
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:10,977
and decorated it with orange slices to add a sense of refreshment.

628
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:13,395
For the cake texture, I opted for fudge...

629
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:14,505
Tim!

630
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:16,949
Tim!

631
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:18,377
What happened?

632
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,068
Anyone, call an ambulance!

633
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:35,992
I suppose...

634
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,817
this kind of bad habit cannot be fixed.

635
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,431
I just don't want anyone to be around you.

636
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:15,446
Mai!

637
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,186
I think I already told you

638
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,420
everything he's allergic to.

639
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:22,929
If anything happens to him,

640
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:24,459
it's all your fault.

641
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,673
I was really cautious.

642
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,333
How come it turned out like this?

643
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:41,831
What did I do wrong?

644
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:53,142
Why does my cake have a taste of shrimp paste?

645
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,673
I'm sure I brought the right ingredient.

646
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:57,187
Mek brought a new one to us.

647
00:39:57,997 --> 00:40:00,094
He said you told him the other one was unusable.

648
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:13,431
I think I found the cause.

649
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,256
[Foods Tim are allergic to:]

650
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,382
[Shrimp, shrimp paste]

651
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:20,106
Kim, please listen to me.

652
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,013
I am sorry.

653
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:24,746
That was not at all my intention.

654
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:25,677
Not your intention?

655
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:28,334
Are you saying you stumbled

656
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:29,654
and accidentally spilled shrimp paste into it?

657
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,443
It wasn't like that.

658
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:32,365
Well...

659
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:35,673
I never wanted to make him go to hospital.

660
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,786
I didn't know that he is allergic to shrimp paste.

661
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,580
All I wanted was a shot of him throwing up.

662
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:44,819
Are you saying that what you did

663
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,095
was for the sake of making prank content again?

664
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:51,746
I suppose

665
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:54,669
this kind of bad habit cannot be fixed.

666
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:57,207
I just don't want anyone to be around you.

667
00:40:58,997 --> 00:40:59,961
Are you crazy?

668
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,673
Don't be a coward and make me your excuse.

669
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,219
It's not relevant.

670
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:09,649
In the end...

671
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:12,479
all you do is make rubbish content.

672
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:16,188
And you know what...

673
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,026
That makes you rubbish too.

674
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:25,705
And if anything happens to Tim,

675
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:28,993
you must be responsible for it.

676
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:32,750
Mm.

677
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:35,879
Again, I am so sorry.

678
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:40,434
You can think of me whatever way you want.

679
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:43,867
No matter what excuse I make,

680
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:46,880
it doesn't change the fact that I'm the guilty one.

681
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:20,673
You can't bear to throw that away?

682
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:22,430
Or you think what you said was too harsh?

683
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:30,673
If you think you were too cruel
and want to apologize,

684
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,799
you should go talk to him.

685
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:34,155
You guys fought so loud I could hear it.

686
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:37,041
I didn't do anything wrong.

687
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,110
It was all Mek's fault so he deserved it.

688
00:42:41,398 --> 00:42:43,883
Deserved to be called a rubbish person?

689
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:47,686
Up to you then.

690
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:50,025
He already apologized.

691
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:51,673
But you still called him that.

692
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:59,300
You're all grown-ups.
Why is it so hard for you to understand things?

693
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,087
Mek!

694
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,426
Mek!

695
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:45,204
Dao!

696
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,191
Q, Kimhan, why are you guys here?

697
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,544
I really want you to know, Kim,

698
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,673
that it wasn't my intention to let that happen.

699
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:49,159
Now I realize that I should stop pranking people

700
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:50,738
just because...

701
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:54,155
Does this means we are close?

702
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:56,640
Can a BL couple turn into a real couple?
