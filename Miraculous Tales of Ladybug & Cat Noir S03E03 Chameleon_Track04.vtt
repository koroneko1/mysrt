<i>‎But there's something about me</i>

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.100

‎Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.180
‎Oh! Huh?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.700
‎How did you pull this off?
‎You're the best!

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.900
‎I can't believe you got everyone to swap
‎seats, so I could sit next to Adrien!

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.980
‎But it might not be the best idea.
‎I might not pay attention in class.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.620
‎And if I fail, Adrien and I would
‎never have our own house, the three kids,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.100
‎-the hamster named--
‎-Whoa, girl! What are you talking about?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.820
‎You're not next to Adrien.
‎Your seat's over there.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.020
‎-At the back? Why? What's going on?
‎-Well, since she's got a hearing issue,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.260
‎there's no way she could sit at the back.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.380
‎-So she needed a place up in the front!
‎-To make it work, Ivan sat next to Mylène,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.940
‎Nath sat next to Alix, and she came up
‎with the idea of moving Nino here.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.420
‎-So we get to spend more time together!
‎-Who is this "she"?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.100
‎Good morning!
‎I'm sure you've all heard by now,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.980
‎but Lila's home from her trip
‎and she is back in school with us again!

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.100
‎-Hi, everyone!
‎-Hi, Lila!

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.580
‎Oh, a seat in the front row!
‎You all remembered my hearing issue!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.380
‎You're such sweethearts, all of you!
‎Mwah, mwah!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.300
‎-You have a hearing problem, Lila?
‎-Yes, I suffer from tinnitus,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.500
‎a constant ringing in my left ear.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.940
‎The sound of an aeroplane engine
‎burst my eardrum on the runway

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.260
‎-when I was saving Jagged's kitten.
‎-Isn't Jagged Stone's pet a crocodile?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.700
‎Now it is, yes. But he had a kitten
‎until he found out he was allergic to it.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.060
‎The best part is, since you're
‎such an excellent student, Adrien,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.780
‎you'll be able to help me catch up
‎on all the schoolwork I missed.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.740
‎-Would you do that for me?
‎-Sure, Lila.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.780
‎Miss Bustier?
‎Why do I have to sit in the back now?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.540
‎Do you have any trouble hearing or seeing,
‎Marinette?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.780
‎-Uh...
‎-My eyesight and hearing are good.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.060
‎I'll sit in the back and you two
‎can sit up front. I don't mind.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.660
‎-No!
‎-No!

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.300
‎My return is causing so much trouble!

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.980
‎I should've stayed
‎on the other side of the world.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.740
‎If Marinette has an issue too,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.060
‎then I should be the one
‎to go and sit in the back.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.700
‎It's OK!

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.060
‎I don't actually have any trouble
‎seeing or hearing, I mean...

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.860
‎Good. So there's no problem, then!

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.260
‎You sit here, Lila.
‎Adrien, stay where you are

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.700
‎and, Marinette, you sit in the back row.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.420
‎Ah, high school! The arena of teenage
‎angst, where emotions are so intense.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.300
‎A perfect stadium for my dear akumas.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.620
‎Being separated from your friends,
‎becoming isolated...

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.980
‎just what devastating anger is made of.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.020
‎Fly away and evilise
‎this angry high-school girl!

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.660
‎Open your books to page 23.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.500
‎Strange. I feel the fury dying down.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.300
‎But the wheels are in motion.
‎It's only a matter of time.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.540
‎Be patient now, my akuma.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.380
‎-That's for you, Lila!
‎-Thank you. You're so sweet!

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.820
‎-Here's your appetiser!
‎-And main course!

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.020
‎-I'll fetch your dessert!
‎-I'm sorry I can't carry my own tray.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.380
‎It's almost impossible
‎with this sprained wrist.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.780
‎-Sorry!
‎-Lila's totally lying.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.700
‎She made up her tinnitus
‎so she could sit next to Adrien.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.060
‎-And her sprained wrist's bogus, too.
‎-I don't get it, Marinette.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.940
‎-You barely know Lila. Why all the hate?
‎-Fine. I'll tell you everything.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.180
‎Remember when she first came to school
‎right after the summer?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.460
‎She was only here for one day,
‎then she left on that trip.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.340
‎Everyone was captivated by her.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.060
‎Something just felt off to me,
‎so I... followed her!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.220
‎-What?
‎-Not only did Ladybug save my life,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.900
‎-we've become very close friends!
‎-She lies with every breath.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.500
‎Wait. You eavesdropped on Lila
‎and Adrien? That's not cool!

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.700
‎A good reporter verifies her sources.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.020
‎Can you prove
‎she doesn't actually know Ladybug?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.260
‎Well, I... um... I...
‎I... I... OK! You want proof she's lying?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.740
‎Hey, Lila! You forgot your napkin!

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.620
‎Ha, ha! See that? It's obvious
‎she doesn't have a sprained wrist!

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.220
‎Uh... Ow!

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.580
‎Once, in India, I witnessed someone
‎getting their eye gouged out

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.140
‎by a corner of a napkin.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.580
‎If I hadn't caught it,
‎this napkin could have injured Max.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.180
‎-Oh!
‎-I didn't have a choice. Ow!

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.820
‎Lila, you saved my eye!
‎You sacrificed yourself for me!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.740
‎Why wouldn't I, Max?
‎Ouch! You're my friend.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.740
‎-We'll take you to the nurse's office.
‎-Proud of yourself?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.340
‎Lila's in pain even more now,
‎all because of you!

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.460
‎No, don't blame Marinette.
‎She was trying to give me a napkin.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.780
‎Right, Marinette?

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.180
‎Grr!

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.860
‎-Marinette! Oh! Are you crying?
‎-No, I'm not!

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.140
‎I can sense that you don't like me,
‎but I don't understand why.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.100
‎We barely know each other.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.300
<i>‎Miss show-off here</i>
<i>‎was trying to impress you.</i>

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.260
‎Don't tell me it's because of this
‎new seating arrangement in class?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.020
‎It is! Of course! You're jealous
‎because I'm sitting next to Adrien.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.340
‎Because you would have given anything
‎to sit there yourself!

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.380
‎You know what?
‎It's really not worth fighting over a boy!

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.780
‎You and I could be friends.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.780
‎And, who knows, I might even be able
‎to help you with Adrien.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.260
‎You and I will only be friends
‎the day you stop lying, Lila.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.380
‎I can't prove it, but I know for a fact
‎you don't have tinnitus,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.900
‎that your wrist is just fine,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.020
‎that you don't know Prince Ali
‎and have never been to Atchoo,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.780
‎and despite what you got Alya
‎to write on her Ladyblog,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.580
‎Ladybug has never saved your life!

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.140
‎I only tell people what they want to hear.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.460
‎-It's called lying!
‎-There's nothing you can do about it.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.420
‎People can't resist
‎when they hear what they like to hear.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.420
‎If you don't want to be my friend, fine!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.100
‎But soon you won't have
‎any friends left at all.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.980
‎And trust me, I'll make sure
‎you never get close to Adrien

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.100
‎in class or anywhere!
‎You seem less dumb than the others,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.060
‎so I'll give you one last chance.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.820
‎You are either with me or against me.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.820
‎You don't have to answer right away.
‎I'll give you till the end of class today.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.820
‎I thought Chloé was evil,
‎but Lila really takes the whole cake!

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.260
‎She's like a supervillain
‎without a costume!

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.380
‎You mustn't let her get to you.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.340
‎If I don't manage to expose her lies,
‎she'll ruin my life!

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.620
‎She'll turn my friends against me,
‎including Adrien!

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.340
‎Yes! I can feel it.
‎The anger's about to emerge!

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.540
‎-Marinette, look out!
‎-Aaah! An akuma!

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.540
‎Hey, Lila.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.620
‎Adrien! We must figure out when you'll
‎help me catch up on all the schoolwork.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.460
‎I also heard you play piano!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.220
‎My uncle's the great pianist
‎Petrochk Borrotchek.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.900
‎He wanted to teach me,
‎but I had to stop because of arthritis.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.180
‎But when my wrist gets better,
‎I'd love for you to give me some lessons.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.580
‎Lila, I'm perfectly happy
‎being friends with you.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.940
‎And I'll gladly help you with schoolwork.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.900
‎But please don't lie to me
‎like you did last time.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.980
‎Oh!

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.220
<i>‎So, I'm guessing you're not</i>
<i>‎a descendant of a superhero either?</i>

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.340
<i>‎-She's more like a superliar!</i>
‎-Ladybug's the liar!

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.820
‎I'm not judging you, Lila,
‎but you'll turn everyone against you.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.140
‎If something's bothering you, I can help.
‎But you need to be honest with me.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.740
‎Are you trying to be a superhero,
‎lecturing me just like Ladybug did?

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.540
‎Well, thanks, but no thanks! Ugh!

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.620
‎I'm still here
‎if you need help with your schoolwork.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.820
‎You can resist it!
‎Hawk Moth's power only affects people

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.780
‎who think there's no solution to their
‎problems! You<i>‎ always</i>‎ find a solution!

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.820
‎You're right!

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.220
‎You won't get me! I'm proud!
‎I'm confident! I'm Marinette!

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.900
‎What's happened?
‎The anger has disappeared!

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.380
‎But I can feel something new arising.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.140
‎I can't stand those super-goody-two-shoes.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.900
‎Yes! Here's my chance!

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.820
‎We can't let this akuma run loose.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.260
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.180
‎Ha!

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.580
‎Come here, akuma!

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.460
‎Hawk Moth, I am Lila. I know you want
‎to destroy Ladybug. And so do I.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.900
‎Yes, I remember you.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.860
‎Give me supervillain powers and I'll
‎get you her and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.940
‎With pleasure. I have some new powers
‎for you, Chameleon!

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.140
‎Gotta find another way!

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.740
‎-Hey!
‎-Adrien!

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.500
‎I wanted to apologise.
‎I've thought about it and you're right.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.260
‎I want us to be friends,
‎so I'll never tell another lie.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.420
‎Will you make peace with me? Mwah!

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.620
‎Oops! I lied.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.540
‎Adrien? Adrien!

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.700
‎Nino! I have something to tell you.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.100
‎You don't deserve my friendship
‎or your girlfriend... or your cap!

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.780
‎-Hey!
‎-Ha, ha! You should see your faces!

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.140
‎Don't miss my performance
‎at the Eiffel Tower.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.660
‎You're gonna love it.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.660
‎What? Not Adrien!

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.820
‎Hey! No, no!

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.420
‎Hey!

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.500
‎Thank you, Ladybug!

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.900
‎My balloon! Mommy!

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.900
‎Thank you. Ha, ha!

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.300
‎Oh, no! He's gonna fall!

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.580
‎♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.780
‎-Whoa!
‎-Argh!

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.620
‎This is so easy.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.380
‎As soon as someone needs saving,
‎that stupid Ladybug shows up!

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.580
‎-♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪
‎-Adrien!

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.220
‎Aaah! Help me! I'm losing my balance!
‎I'm going to fall!

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.620
‎Aaah!

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.220
‎Yeah! Woohoo!

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.380
‎My Princess Charming!
‎You saved my life! Mwah!

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.820
‎-You are not Adrien!
‎-You're right, I'm Chameleon!

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.580
‎You're getting better at this,
‎which is a good thing!

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.820
‎It'll make this fight
‎all the more interesting!

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.980
‎I know where your akuma is, Chameleon!
‎Time to de-evili...

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.660
‎But the akuma!

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.100
‎Argh!

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.660
‎If this is an enchanted sleep,
‎what could wake him up?

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.820
‎Oh, no! Not an enchanted kiss, please!

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.500
‎Nobody will ever know.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.820
‎Plagg! What happened?
‎And what are you doing?

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.420
‎Oh, me? Nothing. I... Your friend Lila
‎put you to sleep with an evil kiss.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.340
‎-Be more careful picking your friends!
‎-Lila must have been re-akumatised!

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.260
‎Quick! Plagg, claws out!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.660
‎Quentin! Quentin!

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.220
‎Ladybug!
‎I saw the supervillain running away!

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.740
‎Huh? Thanks! Don't stay here, OK?
‎It's dangerous!

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.060
‎Come out of there, Chameleon!

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.900
‎My Quentin! You found him, Ladybug!

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.540
‎Found him?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.940
‎Ladybug! Look out!

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.940
‎It's down to the two of us, Ladybug.
‎Cataclysm!

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.860
‎I'm gonna find out who you really are,
‎Chameleon!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.860
‎I'll find out who you are first,
‎don't you worry!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.260
‎Too bad Cat Noir's power
‎is gonna destroy you! Mwah, mwah, mwah!

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.700
‎If you manage to touch me! Ha!

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.380
‎-Get me his Miraculous now!
‎-No. I wanna get hers first!

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.580
‎-Nowhere to run now, Ladybug!
‎-I don't intend to!

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.100
‎Lucky charm!

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.100
‎-A T-shirt?
‎-Ha, ha, ha!

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.780
‎That's your plan to defeat me, Ladybug?
‎Make me dress like you?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:08.060
‎On second thoughts, such horrible fashion
‎might actually do me in! Ha!

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.140
‎Failed again!

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.860
‎Cataclysm!

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:30.220
‎Good job, Chameleon! Become Ladybug,
‎then, once you've put her to sleep,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.620
‎you can simply give me her Miraculous!

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.260
‎Aaah!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.820
‎Ladybug!

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.980
‎We should be friends, not anemones!

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.780
‎Wow, you certainly got
‎that supervillain to clam up!

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.580
‎But we're not out of the woods.
‎Where's the object?

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:21.380
‎I think I might have an idea.
‎Waiter, ahem, if you wouldn't mind?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.540
‎Yes, Ladybug. At your service.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.860
‎-Mademoiselle.
‎-Thank you!

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.380
‎We're about to find out
‎what you really look like!

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.340
‎You'll see. It's an old acquaintance.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.860
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.620
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.580
‎Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.180
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.940
‎Don't worry,
‎you look good even without your cap.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.940
‎Hey!

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.580
‎-Lila?
‎-Ladybug?

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.060
‎At least now you can say
‎I saved your life, for real.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.740
‎Truth?

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:24.260
‎Thanks, Ladybug.
‎I'd be honoured to call you my friend.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.380
‎Yeah, I'm happy to hear that.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.460
‎Hey, some advice? You don't have to lie
‎and pretend to be something you're not.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.820
‎People will like you
‎just for being yourself!

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.820
‎-You have my word, Ladybug!
‎-Bug out!

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.940
‎Bye!

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.380
‎I sense a talent like no other
‎in this young Lila.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.860
‎I'm sure that her feelings about Ladybug
‎will serve my purposes well in the end,

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.500
‎one way or another.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.860
‎Of course she saved my life!

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.580
‎She'll always rescue her best friend.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.380
‎Didn't tinnitus give you vertigo
‎up the Eiffel Tower?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.020
‎Oh, no! Ladybug knows me so well

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.820
‎that she brought me an earplug
‎to stick in my right ear.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.700
‎Right ear? Did she say "right ear"?

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.860
‎This morning, she said that ringing was
‎in her left ear! I've got her this time!

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.540
‎-Are you gonna tell everyone?
‎-Course I am! Lila is--

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.540
‎A liar. Yes, I know.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.060
‎But will exposing her
‎really make things better?

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.460
‎If you humiliate her,
‎she'll just be hurt more.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.660
‎Making a bad guy suffer
‎has never turned them into a good guy.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.140
‎Ladybug and I are like two peas in a pod!

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.820
‎So we just stand by and let her lie?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.620
‎As long as we both know the truth,
‎does it really matter?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.780
‎You're right.
‎Maybe it's not such a big deal.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.660
‎-Good afternoon, everyone!
‎-Good afternoon, Miss Bustier!

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.060
‎Good for you for taking the high road,
‎Marinette.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.980
‎Hey! It's pretty cool back here!

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.700
‎-Lila.
‎-Here.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.660
‎-Adrien.
‎-Present!

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.620
‎-Max.
‎-Present.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.700
<i>‎Stay focused now, Marinette.</i>
<i>‎Don't get distracted.</i>

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.340
<i>‎Or you'll flunk school,</i>
<i>‎then how will you and Adrien</i>

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.860
<i>‎get that house,</i>
<i>‎have kids and the hamster named--</i>

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.300
‎Marinette! Miss Bustier has called
‎your name three times already!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.460
‎Oh!

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.380
‎Looks like you have trouble hearing,
‎after all.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.980
‎Why not come sit up here in the front,
‎next to Lila?

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.460
‎Miss Bustier! This is incredible!

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.500
‎My tinnitus! I don't feel it any more!
‎It's gone! It's a miracle!

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.980
‎It must be Ladybug's doing!
‎I can sit in the back now.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.700
‎Excuse me.
‎Can I go and sit next to Marinette?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.220
‎Nino and I can't stop chatting it up!

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.500
‎You didn't think I'd let my BFF
‎sit all by herself, did you?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.020
‎Excuse me, Miss Bustier.
‎Can I move too, please?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.660
‎I'd like to sit next to Nino again.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.220
‎Sorry, Lila. He's my best friend!

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.340
‎-Can I have my old seat back too, please?
‎-Can I go back to where I was?

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.460
‎Yeah, me too!

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.900
‎Catch you later, Marinette! Bye!

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.980
‎I see you've made your decision,
‎Marinette.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.620
‎From now on, you and I are at war.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.380
‎You will lose your friends
‎and wind up all alone.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.900
‎And Adrien will soon be mine.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.140
‎We'll see about that, Lila. We'll see.
