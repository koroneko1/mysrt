1
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,333
The satellite video connection
is up and running.

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,750
Champak to Snow Lotus,
confirm the first piglet's location.

3
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,583
The first target is confirmed, over.

4
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,000
Anaxagorea to Snow Lotus, confirm
the second piglet's location, over.

5
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,666
The second target is confirmed, over.

6
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,041
Hello, sir.

7
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,708
This is Chaisit,

8
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,416
the friend that I told you about.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,083
What are you looking at?

10
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,375
Copy, over.

11
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,625
Gosh, that looks so tasty.

12
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,958
It's really delicious.

13
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,250
I think we should move.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,958
Please come in.

15
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,041
The three piglets
are on the chopping board.

16
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,125
Please sit down.

17
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,791
They'll turn into sausages soon enough.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,625
Data is correct, over.

19
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,208
Who told you to come in?

20
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,458
The lady, sir.

21
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,125
Wait.

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,625
We were just helping them.
We don't know anything.

23
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,250
That's right.

24
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,666
Stop talking. Who sent you?

25
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,958
Hey!

26
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,916
We're screwed.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Call for backup now!

28
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,375
Why the hell did you park like this?

29
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,125
How would we be able to get out?

30
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,833
Stop!

31
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,500
Start driving!

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,875
Don't follow me. Don't follow.

33
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,208
Get her in the car.

34
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,125
Where the hell is backup?

35
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,333
Go!

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,083
Three people infiltrated the Minister's
Songkran party to assassinate him,

37
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,041
but failed to do so.

38
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,500
They were killed by the security team
of the businessmen

39
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,583
who were guests there.

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,625
The incident happened while the Minister
was talking to the guests privately.

41
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,875
The police assume that this shooting

42
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,208
may have been motivated

43
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,875
in objection to the coalition
of businessmen from many industries

44
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,208
to pressure the government

45
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,500
to legalize casinos in Thailand.

46
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,500
However...

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,666
I saw the news on TV.

48
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,125
It sucks.

49
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,583
Come on.

50
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,500
So you don't have
anywhere else to go, right, Waew?

51
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,666
No, madam.

52
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,916
I just got fired from Mr. Jira's house.

53
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,250
But I didn't do anything wrong.

54
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,333
They accused me of flirting
with the gentleman.

55
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,083
As if!

56
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,583
He's old and bald.

57
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,208
I'm being honest.

58
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,875
I was on my way to see my sister

59
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,791
but then I got hit by your car.

60
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,666
Sir said that you're in need of a maid,

61
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,166
so will you please hire me?

62
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,166
Please, madam. Please?

63
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,208
Let her help around the house.

64
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,375
It's good karma too.

65
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,416
All right then.

66
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,041
But no hanky-panky, okay?

67
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,625
You don't trust me.

68
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,125
Do you want me to swear on it?

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,958
Let's go!

70
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,791
I'm sending you...

71
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,666
some money, Mom.

72
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,541
LIST OF CASUALTIES

73
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,166
What? Really?

74
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,208
How could you do this kind of work?

75
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,541
Then who got it?

76
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,583
Sopon?

77
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,416
Three years and that's all you got?

78
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,625
These assholes!

79
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,750
Jeez, sir.

80
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,166
Lean on me.

81
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,333
Get up.

82
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,125
Wait, I parked to pee.

83
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,458
Forgot to zip my pants.

84
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,666
Jeez, sir,

85
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,166
just don't say anything.

86
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,291
-Kwan.
-Kwan.

87
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,541
-Nice to see you at an event.
-Nice to see you at an event.

88
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,125
Our maid has a sister who works here.

89
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,083
Oh, I see.

90
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,333
She begged me to come

91
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,666
so she could tag along.

92
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,708
My, my, Prasert, you look tired.

93
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,291
You've been married for a couple of years

94
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,791
and I see that you're still not bored
of your wife.

95
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,208
That's not it.

96
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,541
Prasert's been working very hard recently.

97
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,333
Where did you get your facelift?

98
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,791
-Tell your doctor to
-Please excuse me.

99
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,291
-tighten the stitches.
-See you later.

100
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,125
By the way, Jim,

101
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:25,208
my, my, why do you look so good
these days?

102
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,208
What meds are you taking, Jim?

103
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,333
A hottie.

104
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,541
Don't tell me,
Mrs. Ti is treating you well.

105
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,041
No, it's not the wife.

106
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

107
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,291
It's the husband.

108
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,833
-A guy?
-What?

109
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,833
The thing is I found a pair of panties

110
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,666
in one of the pockets in sir's pants.

111
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,958
And no matter how I looked
it definitely wasn't madam's.

112
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,875
So I asked sir

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,916
and that did it!

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,833
Now whenever he gets a peek of purple,

115
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:02,166
he slaps money in my hands.

116
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,458
-That's great.
-Brilliant!

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,708
-Amazing.
-Super.

118
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,833
But when I was at Mr. Jira's house,
he took care of me too.

119
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,375
Amazing.

120
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,166
-I bet she saw it.
-Yeah.

121
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,250
Mrs. Mayuree thought
that Waew was flirting with her man.

122
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,500
That's why she got fired.

123
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,916
Right.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,333
Why are you bragging?

125
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,708
But the latest secret that I found out

126
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,625
-is surely going to make me some money.
-What is it?

127
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,625
What?

128
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,875
Well, ever since I've gone to work
for Mrs. Kwan,

129
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,416
I've never seen her use a pad.

130
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,958
-Does she use coconut spathe?
-Yeah.

131
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,166
No.

132
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,291
Can I buy this?

133
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,541
Do you want some too?

134
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,416
There are no pads in the house.

135
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,625
She never buys it!

136
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,291
I'm thinking that Mrs. Kwan...

137
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,250
is old!

138
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,583
-But she's so pretty.
-And young.

139
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,125
-What are you saying?
-Hey!

140
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,750
-She's still young.
-What we see must be a doctor's work.

141
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,708
Can a doctor do everything
from head to toe?

142
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,500
I bet she got surgery all over.

143
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,625
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

144
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,791
Only old people don't use pads.

145
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,375
-Like my mother.
-Right.

146
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,875
And you.

147
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,375
Hey, you.

148
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,500
-Hey.
-She doesn't use them anymore?

149
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,583
Wait...

150
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,916
What's wrong? You've been quiet.

151
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,416
Do you have a headache?

152
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,541
I'll get you some medicine.

153
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,416
Oh, my god!

154
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,541
What's the matter?

155
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,375
Damn it, I made a hole.
Who covered it over?

156
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,250
Waew.

157
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,083
Waew.

158
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,125
Yeah, what's...

159
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,875
Why did you bite me?

160
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,125
Prasert!

161
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,125
Wait, Kwan, listen to me!

162
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,375
Sir, do you really want me?

163
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,208
No matter what happens to you,

164
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,375
I'll take full responsibility.

165
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,666
What about madam?

166
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,958
Don't worry about Kwan.

167
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,833
Waew,

168
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,125
you're the only one...

169
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,333
Don't listen to him, Waew.

170
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,750
All men say this.

171
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,958
I've been eavesdropping long enough.

172
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,833
You said you'll take responsibility, huh?

173
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,708
It's not like that, Jim.

174
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,416
We didn't sleep together.

175
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,500
What? He didn't take advantage of you?

176
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,583
-No.
-Gosh!

177
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,916
Then why did you tell me to come and help?

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,125
You said there was a problem.

179
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,083
Next time, you can ask me first
before you hit me.

180
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,000
Sorry.

181
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,750
Tell me, which dog did this to you?

182
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
The one at home.

183
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,375
I fed it too much
and that made it ferocious.

184
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,750
Do you know what my work is?

185
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
I'm the head of
a special investigations unit

186
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,750
that reports directly
to the Prime Minister.

187
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,708
I investigate and collect evidence
of corruption

188
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,333
by high profile politicians.

189
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,875
Even from those who
the Anti-Money Laundering Office

190
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,833
and the police can't get their hands into.

191
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,625
Even the Prime Minister's wife
doesn't know that my unit exists.

192
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,375
And I want you

193
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,791
to become my spies.

194
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,916
-He wants us to spy!
-He wants us to spy!

195
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,416
What made you think that we can do it?

196
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,958
Because you're observant,

197
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
in other words, nosy.

198
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,375
Don't smile.

199
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:21,958
I'll tell you something.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,458
Bosses place a lot of trust
in their maids.

201
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,208
They let them come and go anywhere.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,916
And that is the advantage that you have

203
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,791
over other kinds of spies.

204
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,375
In the past,

205
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,625
I've only had professional spies
disguise themselves as helpers,

206
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,541
but they always got caught.

207
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,250
And then what happened?

208
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,125
They all got butchered.

209
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh, my gosh!

210
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,875
Then I'll be going now.

211
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,916
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

212
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,375
Wait.

213
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,833
You know full well

214
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,250
why your parents are working
in rented rice paddies.

215
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,083
You know what's the problem.

216
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,208
Come back here.

217
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,125
I'm telling you, with this job,

218
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,125
not only do you get to do a service
for your country,

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,875
but you'll also get paid well.

220
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,166
How much?

221
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,333
Don't you go back on your words, sir.

222
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:38,750
I won't.

223
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,916
I want you two to go work in this house

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,083
which belongs to this man, Sopon.

225
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,166
He runs a food trading company,

226
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,750
which has many branches
in other countries.

227
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,958
He's close to a lot
of government officials.

228
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,416
His wife, Emma, is British.

229
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,916
They have one daughter,

230
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,958
Paula.

231
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,208
This is Chaisit,

232
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,333
Sopon's best friend since childhood.

233
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,458
Chaisit owns a dozen of brothels
and illegal casinos.

234
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,458
He and Sopon have opened
a construction company

235
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,083
and conspired to launder concession money
from the government.

236
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,083
Right now, they are trying to legalize
their casino business.

237
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:30,083
Using Sopon's relationships
with ministers,

238
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,750
they're bribing politicians
with huge sums of money

239
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,083
so they can open their casinos freely.

240
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,708
The easiest place for you to infiltrate

241
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,333
is Sopon's house.

242
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,416
Let's go to Imperial World Samrong,
they have a lot of stuff.

243
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,291
We will get rid of the old maids

244
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,000
and have you two replace them.

245
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,625
Get in.

246
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,291
STRAY DOGS SQUAD

247
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,041
A vacation?

248
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,375
Around the world?

249
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,833
Hey!

250
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,916
You have to attach listening devices
on all their phones

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,291
to gather evidence
of bribe money payments.

252
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,041
We have to prevent this evil plan

253
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,916
from ever getting off the ground.

254
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,208
Otherwise,

255
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,958
-normal people
-I'm done.

256
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,958
will suffer the same fate
that happened to your family.

257
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,166
Morning meals are called...

258
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,291
You two have to earn the trust
of Sopon's family,

259
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,208
and then you have to wait for an order
from the messenger.

260
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,125
Why do we need a middleman?

261
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,791
Just talk to me
and give the middleman's money to us.

262
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,083
No.

263
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,708
We're all screwed if somebody ever sees me
in contact with you.

264
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,208
She saw us.

265
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,375
What do we do?

266
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,125
We have to kill her.

267
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,166
Don't you think you watch too much TV?

268
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,583
Who's going to be the messenger?

269
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,833
Don't worry.

270
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,916
Somebody will contact you.

271
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,083
The new maids are here, madam.

272
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,291
Waew and Jim, right?

273
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,833
I guess you already know your duties.

274
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,291
Call me madam.

275
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,916
Ma Dumb.

276
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,541
Why is she named Ma Dumb?

277
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,625
Ma Dumb.

278
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,500
Don't name your kid that.

279
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,458
Ma Dumb.

280
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,541
-Lady, who names their kid Ma Dumb?
-I would be so embarrassed.

281
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,333
-If it were me...
-Quiet.

282
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,250
Call me Mrs. Emma then.

283
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,041
Here, you have to get along
with other people.

284
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,166
Take this.

285
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,583
This is the maid's handbook
for this house.

286
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,541
It has the list of things you must
and must not do,

287
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,791
as well as punishments.

288
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,166
Jim, please take these two to their rooms

289
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,041
and show them around the house.

290
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,833
Yes, madam.

291
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,708
One thing you need to understand

292
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,666
is that I'm the head maid here,

293
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,208
so you have to call me boss, understand?

294
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,833
Why? You're a servant too.

295
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,250
She's a bad seed, boss.

296
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,333
Should I slap her?

297
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,750
Stop, Pookie.

298
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,458
Don't stoop down to their level.

299
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,916
Listen up, fatty,

300
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,958
just do as I say.

301
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,458
And one more thing.

302
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,833
If you want to stay here,
you'll have to learn how to speak

303
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,500
the central dialect or English.

304
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,291
Such backcountry girls.

305
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,875
You're backcountry too!

306
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,875
Why, you, you act all high and mighty,
speaking English.

307
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,458
You've forgotten your roots!

308
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,500
-You're a hypocrite!
-Jim.

309
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,458
-What?
-Stop.

310
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,750
Over her dead body.

311
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,916
-I'll hit you!
-We'll lose our money this way.

312
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,333
Stand up straight.

313
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,791
-Pick it up.
-Come on.

314
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,291
Go.

315
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,500
That's enough.

316
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,041
Thai TVs are always breaking down.

317
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,708
It needs a thumping.

318
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,041
Hey.

319
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,083
You don't have to thump it.

320
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,916
The TV's not broken.

321
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,833
That's called a censorship.

322
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,708
What's a censorship?

323
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,791
They don't want kids
to copy those behaviors,

324
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,041
so they made them fuzzy.

325
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,166
Jeez, but I can see
that he's holding a cigarette.

326
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,583
He's puffing away.

327
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,791
Anyone would know he's smoking,

328
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,958
what's the purpose of censoring it?

329
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,750
What now?

330
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,875
You can see he's got a gun to his head.

331
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,083
He's about to die.

332
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,458
The censorship just makes it fuzzy
and harder to see.

333
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,791
If they're so scared,
shouldn't they just put it off the air?

334
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,666
Thai people are stupid.

335
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,791
Then why did you come to Thailand,
you Karen girl?

336
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,791
Hey, tell me,

337
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,166
what was your name before Cat?

338
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,958
Maew.

339
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,666
But I've changed it. It's Cat now.

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,458
Cat McIntosh, okay? Not English.

341
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,791
And where are you from?

342
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,583
What?

343
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,083
Me?

344
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,583
I'm from Chiang Rai.
My home's in Chiang Khong.

345
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,458
This house is nice, huh?

346
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,958
International.

347
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,083
Pookie.

348
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:02,750
Everyone, according to Mrs. Emma's book
you have to be in bed by 10:00 p.m.

349
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,875
That's the rule
for both newbies and oldies.

350
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,333
Go to bed.

351
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,125
Go on.

352
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,291
She's a bad seed, boss.

353
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,833
I know.

354
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,375
Eat up.

355
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,958
Provincial and stupid.

356
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,625
-Stop. It's my job.
-She called me.

357
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,750
Oh, no!

358
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,583
What are you two doing?

359
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,958
I didn't mean to.

360
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,291
You called me so I brought you your tea,

361
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,208
but this fatty played a trick on me.

362
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,458
I didn't mean to do it.

363
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,875
You called me by my name, so I came.

364
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,791
I didn't want you to say I'm goofing off.

365
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,875
Oh, dear. I have two Jims.

366
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,500
How about this?

367
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,291
Put something at the beginning
of our names.

368
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,708
I'm big, so call me Big Jim.

369
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,875
She's dark-skinned, so call her Black Jim.

370
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,250
How about that?

371
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,541
That's fine.

372
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,083
Big Jim and Black Jim.

373
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,291
Mrs. Emma,

374
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,708
do you know what jim means in Thai?

375
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,875
If people found out, how could I--

376
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,833
Don't be picky, Black Jim.

377
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,458
House rule number one, line one,

378
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,958
"Don't talk back to madam."

379
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,708
Yes, madam.

380
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,083
Seven baht. Two for seven baht.

381
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,750
Well, how about this?

382
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,750
Can't you do two for five baht, Kob?

383
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,125
My name's not Kob.

384
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,166
No? You look so much like the actress.

385
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,041
To be honest,
I thought you were filming or something.

386
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:11,625
But when I look closely,
you're even prettier than Kob.

387
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,833
Right.

388
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,750
-You can have two for five baht.
-Thank you.

389
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,875
-The one here before
-Hey!

390
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,083
-was ugly and rude.
-Pay up.

391
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,333
How much?

392
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,875
Five baht.

393
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,583
I'll throw this eggplant in here, too.

394
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,583
Wow, you're pretty and kind.

395
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,125
And I'll take five limes too.

396
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,125
Black Jim, come pay for the limes.

397
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,208
Black Jim!

398
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,958
Come here and pay for the limes!

399
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,291
Black Jim.

400
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,375
Her name's Black Jim?

401
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,375
Black Jim!

402
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,416
Black Jim!

403
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,666
-Come here!
-Give this to her.

404
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,916
No, no.

405
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,916
Yours is black too, huh?

406
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,250
Please, come again.

407
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,250
Would you like some dumplings and buns?

408
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,041
The messenger will ask you
if you'd like dumplings and buns.

409
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,750
You should reply...

410
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,916
I'll take three dumplings and two buns.

411
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,041
That'll be 98 baht.

412
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,000
It's 98 baht.

413
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,458
Okay?

414
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,083
It's 98 baht.

415
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,625
Three dumplings and two buns.

416
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,875
Twenty.

417
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,500
Here you go.

418
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,833
Oh, Samorn.

419
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,916
Hey!

420
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,541
Did you move here?

421
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,750
How great.

422
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,833
I'll take two of the usual,
two pieces of chicken,

423
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,583
a bag of noodles, and three bags of rice.

424
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:12,916
Here, I'll help.

425
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,166
Hey!

426
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,791
Don't act like we're friends.

427
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,208
Do I know you?

428
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,083
It's me, Waew. Don't you remember me?

429
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,458
I lived with Mrs. Kwan

430
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,083
in the house with the white roof
in front of the temple.

431
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,291
It's only been two months
since I last saw you

432
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:30,500
and you've already forgotten me?

433
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,583
-Waew.
-Waew.

434
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,833
-Waew.
-Waew.

435
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:35,958
-Waew, Waew.
-Waew, Waew.

436
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,000
What Waew? I don't know you.

437
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,625
Just standstill.

438
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,916
Would you like some dumplings and buns?

439
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,625
I'll take three dumplings and two buns.

440
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,666
-Waew, Waew.
-Waew, Waew.

441
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,583
Bye now.

442
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,958
Wait, don't you want your food, Waew?

443
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,750
No, maybe another day.

444
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,875
Jeez.

445
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:21,791
What now?

446
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,166
Did you buy the wrong stuff again?

447
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,416
No, this is the real deal.

448
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,416
"Hello, Waew and Jim.

449
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,541
It's been two months now.

450
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,833
You should have
completely gained their trust by now.

451
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,916
Therefore, your first task

452
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,458
is to put the listening devices
in Sopon's,

453
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,125
Chaisit's, and the minister's phones."

454
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,041
Amazing!

455
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,875
Fatty, you're goofing off in there.

456
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,416
I know what you're doing.

457
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,625
Come out right now.

458
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,958
Is my face so much like your mother's

459
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,583
that you have to see me all the time,

460
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,791
you lump of coal?

461
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,833
I'm going to tell madam.

462
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,583
She's a bad seed, boss.

463
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,708
Very bad.

464
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:13,750
Just watch it.

465
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,166
Crazy.

466
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,208
"If everything goes as planned,
you will receive further instructions.

467
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,708
Good luck.

468
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:24,208
P.S. This paper
will self-destruct immediately."

469
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,166
God!

470
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,333
Oh, my!

471
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:29,458
Get off, you're heavy.

472
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,750
Get off.

473
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,125
I was startled.

474
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,625
Boo!

475
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,875
Stop playing around.

476
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:46,166
I told you not to turn it on
until we've put on our masks.

477
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,041
Waew, this is a new color.

478
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,500
I guess Mrs. Emma just bought it.

479
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,166
Come try it.

480
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,708
I'm already pretty,

481
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,916
I don't need to smear it on like you.

482
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,291
Move, damn it!

483
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,791
What do we do?

484
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,125
Hey.

485
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,125
Hello?

486
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,333
Sir.

487
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,416
-Waew?
-We got caught.

488
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,625
Don't speak yet.

489
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:35,041
These two threatened
to tell Mr. Sopon about us if...

490
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,416
Hey!

491
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,333
Stop mumbling and just give me the phone.

492
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,500
Jeez.

493
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:46,958
Here's the thing, sir.

494
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,625
Everything is still top secret,

495
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,250
but we have to let these two
in on the plan too.

496
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,083
Also, we have to give the Karen girl
Thai nationality.

497
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,375
Yes.

498
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,833
-Get a lot of donors.
-My, Emma,

499
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:13,166
-you're as beautiful as ever.
-I got to go, bye.

500
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,708
Can you take care of the top of my hair?

501
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,375
Mrs. Emma, don't say I'm sucking up,

502
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,916
but out of all the pretty ladies here
you're number one.

503
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,916
And you didn't need a doctor either.

504
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,375
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

505
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,416
How many songs will you sing tonight?

506
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,708
Oh, Kwan, I'm not very good at singing.

507
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,416
It's a million baht per song.

508
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,458
The European Alumni Association

509
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,458
is very thankful to all the viewers
who have donated

510
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,750
to help the women and children
in Thai society.

511
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,875
Let's take a little break

512
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,833
then we'll be back
with more wonderful songs

513
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:52,583
from the Minister and Madam Soitip.

514
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,875
-My periwinkle man
-I'm sorry, madam,

515
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,875
but this slap is for the country.

516
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,041
We're screwed! Where's Madam Soitip?

517
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,583
EUROPEAN ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

518
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,625
Hey.

519
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,541
Prasert,

520
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,583
the singer on the stage with the minister
looks so familiar.

521
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,000
I think I've seen her before.

522
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,458
-Do you recognize her?
-Jeez, she's so far away. Let's go.

523
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,541
I can only see her mouth.
Who knows who she is?

524
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,500
Hey.

525
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,625
Oh, no. I've never seen this model before.

526
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,083
I'll break it for sure.

527
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,500
Hurry up. I need to put it back on him.

528
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,041
I've never seen this model before.

529
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,583
Jeez, fatty.

530
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,041
I've never seen this model before either.

531
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,208
See?

532
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,583
Can't open it.

533
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,458
Don't go anywhere.

534
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,750
It's almost our turn.
I'm just going to the toilet.

535
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,958
You sound so good.

536
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:50,333
Oh, Kwan, why did you come
into the men's room?

537
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,125
Out of tissue? I'll bring you some.

538
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,916
Just be quiet.

539
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,208
It's so smelly in here, why did you come?

540
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,416
Where did it go?

541
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,291
Here's my number.

542
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,666
Don't forget to call me.

543
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:44,291
Oh, here it is.

544
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,083
Down.

545
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,375
Where are you going?

546
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,750
-Stop right now!
-Going to your dad's funeral!

547
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,416
These two are clean.

548
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,791
APPROVED

549
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,541
OPERATION M.A.I.D.

550
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,375
Why did you kick me out?

551
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,000
The elevator was full. Someone had to go.

552
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:26,958
Close it.

553
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,666
Hey!

554
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,458
It's probably just like hitting lizards.

555
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,958
Hey. Are you all right?

556
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,250
Serves him right.

557
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,875
Hello? What's up?

558
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,166
The sexiness didn't work.

559
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,291
Jeez, I've got goosebumps
just talking about it.

560
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,083
That woman is hot but she's so clumsy.

561
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,416
Yeah.

562
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,875
She almost hit my head with a golf ball.

563
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,125
Yeah.

564
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,750
I'm shaken up too.

565
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,333
Yeah.

566
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,458
She's really clumsy.

567
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,916
One guy's already knocked out.

568
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,458
So what's up with you?

569
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,750
I'll come back soon.
You should greet them first.

570
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,875
What?

571
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,416
I don't know what time I'll get there
or if there's traffic.

572
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,500
Yeah.

573
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,333
Calm down.

574
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm coming.

575
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,833
What now?

576
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,083
Yes.

577
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,208
Where are you now?

578
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,833
How many?

579
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,625
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you working?

580
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,041
You're one to talk, fatty.

581
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,291
I'm telling Mom.

582
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:05,708
You stick.

583
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,333
I'm older than you.
You can't hit me like that.

584
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,375
So, isn't Chaisit here yet?

585
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,541
Oh, you.

586
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,833
Why is the traffic so bad?

587
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,333
I'm getting off here.

588
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,041
Thanks a lot.

589
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,916
-Number three.
-Number three, 20 baht.

590
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,333
The money.

591
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,416
Hey, park here!

592
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,458
Park here!

593
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,791
Madam, excuse me.

594
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,541
For your own safety,
please don't stand near the yellow line.

595
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,083
You're talking to me?

596
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,041
Yes.

597
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,125
I can't go there?

598
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,375
No.

599
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,166
Where are you from?

600
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,041
-Oh, Khon Kaen.
-I'm from Ubon Ratchathani.

601
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,000
-Big Jim, come on.
-You're cute.

602
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,083
Big Jim.

603
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,958
Can I have your number?

604
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:50,250
It always gets full with me.

605
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,166
Jeez.

606
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
What the hell?

607
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,291
I never get to go.

608
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:58,958
Damn it.

609
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,541
NANCY BROTHEL

610
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,208
Hey, wait.

611
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,541
Where are you going?

612
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,500
Go.

613
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:14,791
Are you new here?

614
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,583
Go through the back door, newbie.

615
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:17,541
Go.

616
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,625
Go on.

617
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,250
Guys,

618
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,958
I'm at Nancy Brothel.
I'm about to go inside.

619
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,791
Yeah.

620
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,541
Go on.

621
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,500
Right, newbie.

622
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,208
You're here? Come on, he's waiting.

623
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,333
Sir, the new girl is here.

624
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,333
Where are you going?

625
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,833
He's waiting.

626
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,291
Have fun, sir.

627
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,500
Come on.

628
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,833
Come sit next to me.

629
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,625
Did you know

630
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:20,708
that I immediately fell for you

631
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,875
the moment when I first saw you?

632
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,125
Understand?

633
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,291
Come.

634
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,000
Come on.

635
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,666
You're a player.

636
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,625
I was the same.

637
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,833
When I saw you,

638
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,666
I felt hot all over.

639
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:49,125
Why stop and think?

640
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,916
Drink up.

641
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,791
You old fart!

642
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,500
Save your strength for breathing.

643
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:13,291
Waew, we're here to help!

644
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,291
Goofing off and leaving work
violates house rule number 23.

645
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:48,083
Using your masters' things
violates house rule number 33.

646
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,166
The combined punishment

647
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,875
is dismissal.

648
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:09,291
Mrs. Emma, can I please have the chance
to explain?

649
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,333
I went outside

650
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,083
with the good intention

651
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:17,208
to protect your honor.

652
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,458
Tell me what happened.

653
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,791
It all started with me getting a telegram
to go to a cousin's funeral.

654
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:31,083
That's why I rushed out
without asking you first.

655
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:34,416
And the servants from the house
in the next alley are distant relatives.

656
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,750
They've said disdainful things
about you before.

657
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:41,375
They said you're a nouveau riche,

658
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,875
rich just on the outside,

659
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,666
but you're stingy.

660
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,541
I figured they would be at the funeral,

661
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,416
so I wanted to give them proof.

662
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,916
I showed them your fancy clothes.

663
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,625
You know, when they saw your outfits,

664
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:02,500
they all complimented you.

665
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,208
Really?

666
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,958
Yes, absolutely.

667
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,208
Right, then.

668
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,166
I forgive you.

669
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,000
I won't fire you.

670
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:16,916
But I'll be deducting 50 percent

671
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,625
from your pay for a month.

672
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,625
Would you like some dumplings and buns?

673
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:28,916
Hey?

674
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,708
Where's my bun bag?

675
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,958
Would you like some dumplings and buns?

676
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,583
Tell me the password.

677
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,083
Why do I need to say it again?

678
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:42,250
You already know who I am.

679
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,125
Keep it quiet

680
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,750
or people will realize that we're spies.

681
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,916
It's not like we're conspicuous
or anything.

682
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,583
Besides, what if you're someone else
in disguise?

683
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,375
Jeez.

684
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:59,083
So, would you like
some dumplings and buns?

685
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,208
I'll take three dumplings and two buns.

686
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,958
-Waew, Waew.
-Waew, Waew.

687
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,416
"You've messed up again.

688
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,958
The data has been moved
to Chaisit's casino.

689
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,041
You need to download it.

690
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,750
The casino has a very tight security,

691
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,541
so I've sent you some tools.

692
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:28,708
You have pepper spray
to spray in people's eyes.

693
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:31,791
And this is a 20,000-volt taser

694
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,541
to knock people out like fish.

695
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,083
Be safe."

696
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,791
Ae, have you seen Waew? Please go get her.

697
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:58,166
Oh, Waew's doing the laundry.
Why do you want her?

698
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,458
Mary's brought some old books
for me to donate.

699
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,833
I want someone to put them away.

700
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,916
I'll do it.

701
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:16,083
I can never help myself
whenever I see those poor orphans.

702
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,750
I simply had to give them
a hundred thousand baht.

703
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,250
Hello.

704
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,666
Do you remember me?

705
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,541
I'm Emma's daughter.

706
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,458
-We met at the...
-The...

707
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:28,416
The European Alumni Association.

708
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:34,791
They didn't invite me.

709
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,041
But I didn't really want to go anyway.

710
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,041
No wonder we didn't raise a lot of money.

711
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,583
Oh, the elevator's here.

712
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:44,541
Please, after you.

713
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,958
-Please.
-Let's go play some crap.

714
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:00,666
It always gets full with me.

715
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,416
Get Big Jim and Cat.

716
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:08,791
I want them to plant this tree
that Wipa brought.

717
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,041
Big Jim and Cat

718
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,791
are cleaning the bathroom.

719
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,458
I'll do it.

720
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,458
Jim,

721
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:26,875
keep a lookout.

722
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:29,250
I'll go download the files.

723
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,541
Do you have money?

724
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,500
What?

725
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:35,625
Well, if I just walk around,
I might get caught.

726
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,125
Do you have any money?

727
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:42,041
Damn it!

728
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,333
Thirty red. Believe me, I'm psychic.

729
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,625
Right.

730
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,250
Red.

731
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,041
Red, red.

732
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,166
Red, red.

733
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:12,500
Here,

734
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,750
I'll give you 2,000.

735
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,833
What's the next one? Tell me.

736
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,166
Oh, my psychic powers
only work once a day.

737
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,166
Just quit and go home.

738
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,541
Jeez, go away. I'll play by myself.

739
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:25,541
Oh, my.

740
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:26,708
Sorry.

741
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:33,250
Excuse me, but does your mother want
a weird daughter-in-law?

742
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,041
-Hey, Willy.
-Hello.

743
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,583
You look tired.

744
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,208
-Stuck in prison for a while this time?
-Yes.

745
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,041
-There were a lot of witnesses.
-Jim.

746
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,416
-Create a distraction.
-Everyone

747
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,208
-were too scared to help.
-Jim.

748
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,291
That fatty.

749
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,166
Sopon's already sent the list of names.

750
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,333
Yeah.

751
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,750
Okay.

752
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,708
Willy, come downstairs with me.
Something's up.

753
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:44,416
Oh, just a friend. A friend.

754
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,083
Yes, I love you. I'll hurry back.

755
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,500
Disgusting!

756
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:48,666
Old hag.

757
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,666
"Turn the computer on."

758
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:30,750
It's on.

759
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,291
"Press enter."

760
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,166
How is "enter" spelled?

761
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,333
Which of the two is it?

762
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,958
How come they're pointed there?

763
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,458
This is weird.

764
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:55,208
-Hey.
-What?

765
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,666
-That's in front of my room.
-Here too.

766
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,791
What the hell?

767
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,500
-What?
-Hey!

768
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,708
Hey!

769
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,083
Where are you going?

770
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:08,208
Shit, it's all out!

771
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,958
You're done for!

772
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,500
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

773
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,583
Catch a tiger by the toe.

774
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,500
If...

775
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,416
My god!

776
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,916
Take this!

777
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,666
And this!

778
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,833
Run!

779
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,375
Hurry up and go!

780
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,291
Come on.

781
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,708
We're out of time!

782
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,000
-What?
-Jim.

783
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,000
-What?
-Go.

784
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,708
Another round, please? I'm feeling lucky.

785
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:41,708
Look at my money.

786
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,541
-I'm rich.
-Jim.

787
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:46,833
Come here.

788
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,583
Free money!

789
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,333
Hey! What are you doing?

790
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:00,583
-Hey!
-Let go!

791
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,041
Cut them off at the elevator, go!

792
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,875
There's nobody here, boss.

793
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,500
We can't find them.

794
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,500
They've disappeared.
They're quick like monkeys.

795
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,625
Hurry up and follow them!

796
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:28,958
I'm trying to find...

797
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:44,583
Damn, they're quick.

798
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,291
Hold on tight, guys!

799
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,833
I can't do it. Hurry up, Cat.

800
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:07,750
Jim.

801
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:10,166
Hurry up.

802
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,416
Make it quick, Cat.

803
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,500
-We're done for.
-Shut up.

804
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:19,541
Go, go.

805
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,458
Come on, fatty.

806
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,708
Don't let go.

807
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,375
Hide!

808
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,958
Where did they go?

809
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,041
VACANCIES

810
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,166
You violated the rules again.

811
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,958
Disappearing from work.

812
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,083
Stealing clothes.

813
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,791
The only punishment is dismissal.

814
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:21,625
You don't have to fire me. I'm quitting.

815
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,916
I don't want to stay either.

816
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,208
Come on, guys.

817
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,750
And the salary...

818
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,458
-Come on, fatty.
-What?

819
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,666
Are you sure you want to quit?

820
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,541
Gosh, it was just getting good.

821
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:04,208
But I'll quit if you're all quitting.

822
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:07,041
Where can I find weirdos like you again?

823
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:51,750
BANGKOK - UBON RATCHATHANI

824
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:29,041
-Pull.
-Who's stealing my mangoes?

825
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,875
The house was huge.

826
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:20,125
Ma Dumb. I almost peed myself.

827
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,750
That hurts.

828
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:36,416
You'll take my skin off.

829
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,791
-Sixty-nine.
-Wrong again.

830
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,250
Cut it like this.

831
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,208
Maybe I'll get to be a star.

832
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:44,458
Jeez.

833
00:57:46,916 --> 00:57:48,125
Jump!

834
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,375
Here I go!

835
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,833
Number three.

836
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,125
Oh, here you are.

837
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,375
I was in town
and got these letters for you.

838
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,750
Take them.

839
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,916
How cool, you got letters from abroad too.

840
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,750
Thank you so much.

841
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:14,916
Yeah.

842
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:16,708
Letters for us, Jim.

843
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:22,833
"Hello, Waew and Jim.

844
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,166
When we separated,
I tried to continue working in Bangkok."

845
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,000
But it was more or less, the same story.

846
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:35,708
The men of the houses I worked in
were all the same.

847
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,416
"I got so mad that I decided to go home."

848
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,083
Come here. Don't go!

849
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,125
Don't take her! Give her back!

850
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:49,958
But the conditions at home
haven't gotten any better.

851
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:53,000
I miss you two a lot.

852
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,208
These days,

853
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,708
I haven't been able to make a living,

854
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,791
because there are bombings every day.

855
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,708
"I still think Thailand is better
than how it is here."

856
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:20,041
I'm so sick of news about people dying
from fleeing gambling debts.

857
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:23,541
And now the government wants
to open legal casinos?

858
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:24,458
Think about it.

859
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,250
Mahasuk,

860
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:29,750
and to think we only have
illegal ones now.

861
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,291
Jim, Waew,

862
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,458
you know Jaew, Som's kid,

863
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:38,458
stole her mother's motorbike
to get money for gambling.

864
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:42,583
Just think about what would happen
if they legalized casinos.

865
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,250
Think about how messed up
society will become.

866
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,416
Right.

867
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,291
Casinos.

868
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,375
I'm going to say no.

869
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,541
Same here.

870
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:53,916
Hey.

871
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,291
What is this doing here?

872
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,291
Bye, Mom.

873
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,250
Okay.

874
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:02,291
-No.
-Take care of yourself.

875
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,875
I'm going to make a living, Mom.

876
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,750
Can't you stay?

877
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:08,250
Take care.

878
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,083
-Mom. Mom!
-I'll miss you too.

879
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,250
-Take care of your sister.
-The car's leaving, Mom.

880
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,166
Hurry up, Jim.

881
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,125
Jim.

882
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:18,416
Wait for me!

883
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:19,666
Bye, Mom.

884
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,750
Be careful.

885
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,083
Wait for me!

886
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,458
SIAM HOTEL

887
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,458
Fancy a night out?

888
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,375
-How much?
-It's 1,500 baht.

889
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,833
Oh, but you're so kind-hearted.

890
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,291
There's no use worrying about it.

891
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:41,000
Why, you whore.

892
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,958
Oh, no. I didn't mean you.

893
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,541
No, not you.

894
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,916
I just saw my old maid.

895
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,333
She used to flirt with Prasert.

896
01:00:51,416 --> 01:00:53,875
Now she's reduced to selling herself.

897
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,041
Prasert, you dog.

898
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,125
Thank you, girls,
for coming back to help your country.

899
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,208
I can do anything
as long as I get to be a Thai citizen.

900
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:14,041
As of now,

901
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:17,500
Sopon is in hiding at a hotel
in Chiang Mai.

902
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,250
And Chaisit hasn't shown his face

903
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,666
because he knows he's being watched
by the police.

904
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,875
But next week, there will be
a Songkran event in Chiang Mai.

905
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,541
I'm certain that the minister

906
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:34,041
will be campaigning there.

907
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,166
I'm sure the three of them will meet.

908
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:37,958
This time,

909
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:41,000
-we have information from...
-That's real Burmese silver.

910
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,833
Pretty, right? You like it?

911
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,583
What is wrong with all of you?

912
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,541
Listen up, this is important.

913
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,166
This is your chance.

914
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:53,166
You can't mess up again, understand?

915
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:59,708
This time, can I have guns and bombs
to protect myself?

916
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:04,208
And an M16, an RPG, and a stinger too!

917
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,791
Hey.

918
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,041
-Oh, no!
-They're all on the floor.

919
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,208
Come in.

920
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,291
We're going shopping.

921
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,458
Are you sure you don't want to come?

922
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,541
Prakob, order some food for me.

923
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,541
Yes, sir.

924
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,458
Yes, right away, sir.

925
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,375
Mr. Sopon wants chicken macaroni.

926
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:53,625
Do your best.

927
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:58,083
I'll definitely do my best for Mr. Sopon.

928
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,583
These westerners are so handsome, boss.

929
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,333
-I'm laughing for the heck of it.
-Yes.

930
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:10,708
Hey!

931
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,666
Pookie.

932
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:16,916
My, my, Pookie, look at what we have here.

933
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:21,541
Fatty, what are you doing here?

934
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,083
This is a five-star hotel.

935
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,833
What's a country bumpkin
like you doing here?

936
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:29,125
Jeez, Black Jim,
do you live in a hole or something?

937
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,083
Is that why you're so stupid?

938
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,666
Don't you see I'm wearing
the hotel's uniform?

939
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,291
How am I supposed to know?

940
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,708
For a servant like you to be walking here,
I bet you used trickery to get in.

941
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,625
She doesn't know her place.

942
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:42,875
Don't know my place?

943
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,250
You standstill.

944
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,041
Wait, calm down, calm down now.

945
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,833
Look, the guests here
are all gentle people.

946
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,375
-Still a coward.
-Is that so?

947
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,583
-Mr. Chaisit is here.
-What?

948
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:08,500
Damn it.

949
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,958
Don't worry, madam.
I won't get Sopon into trouble.

950
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,375
You need to have power as well as money.

951
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:24,041
That's how you get richer.

952
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:27,083
Chai, didn't I tell you to come
at 10:00 p.m.?

953
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,958
Otherwise, the minister might not allow us
to meet him.

954
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:31,708
What's wrong?

955
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:33,958
Can't I come to say hi to my friends?

956
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,333
Stop talking. Let's go to my room.

957
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,666
Oh, my.

958
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,166
Your room?

959
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,166
Madam might misunderstand.

960
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,458
Please excuse me, madam.

961
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:46,625
Come on, Willy.

962
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,250
Waew, they're going to the room.

963
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,333
Don't let them, fatty. Buy me some time.

964
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,541
-I still haven't found the hole.
-What?

965
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,875
-You're still looking for the hole?
-You haven't found it?

966
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,750
Holes are always low.

967
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:22,625
I found it.

968
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:23,833
Thanks, Cat.

969
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,625
I still need to download the files.

970
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,791
Delay them.

971
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:53,666
Oh, this isn't it.

972
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:57,750
LIST OF PAYMENT MAKERS

973
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,416
What the hell is going on?

974
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,041
Hurry up.

975
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,208
Are you trying to screw me over, computer?

976
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:14,791
Damn it.

977
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:16,291
Who's playing with the elevator?

978
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:44,875
Jeez, which prankster pressed
all the elevator buttons?

979
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:48,250
Hurry up.

980
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,041
Please come in.

981
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,250
Sit down.

982
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,791
This is a nice room.

983
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,458
Wait.

984
01:07:01,166 --> 01:07:02,541
Bring me more tissues.

985
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,083
Yes.

986
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,625
Sir, are you on a vacation?

987
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,708
I own this place.

988
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,583
You.

989
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,291
Then I quit.

990
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,875
Don't move.

991
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:38,416
And what's this, huh?

992
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:39,916
What is this?

993
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,500
Answer me!

994
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:44,125
FINANCIAL INFORMATION

995
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:46,166
What did you do to my computer?

996
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,333
That's proof of what you did!

997
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:51,833
What proof?

998
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,666
Willy, slap some sense into her.

999
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,416
Allow me...

1000
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,750
to arrest you for money laundering,

1001
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,500
bribing government officials,

1002
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,375
and trying to open casinos.

1003
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:16,291
What the hell are you talking about?

1004
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,500
-I don't understand!
-Let's talk first!

1005
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,208
-I'm getting a lawyer!
-Just watch!

1006
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,458
You've got it coming to you!

1007
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,041
You've done a service for your country.

1008
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,833
Great job.

1009
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,333
CHIANG MAI NEW YEAR FESTIVAL

1010
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:45,458
Hello.

1011
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,750
Please do me a favor.

1012
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,375
Remember to help your minister.

1013
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:53,041
Hey, what's going on?

1014
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,875
What is this? What's happening?

1015
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,958
Let me go! Who sent you? Let go!

1016
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,166
-Who are they?
-What's happening?

1017
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:08,916
They're like NGOs.

1018
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,708
Jim!

1019
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:12,541
-Waew, Waew!
-Jim!

1020
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:23,625
Hey!

1021
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,541
Stay still.

1022
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,791
Come here! Come here, damn it!

1023
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,083
Don't follow me.

1024
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,250
Or your boss dies!

1025
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,333
Don't follow!

1026
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:39,875
Right.

1027
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:42,166
Go.

1028
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,916
Go.

1029
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,500
Don't follow me.

1030
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,875
Keep watch until I say otherwise.

1031
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:49,958
Shut up!

1032
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,958
Keep walking.

1033
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:54,333
Go sit over there.

1034
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,291
You've messed with the wrong people.

1035
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,416
Laundering? Bribes? Casinos?
What the hell?

1036
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,625
Hey, not so rough.

1037
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,375
Waew,

1038
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,250
the information you were talking about,
I just saw it today.

1039
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,375
Do you think I'm stupid?

1040
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,458
Sir told me

1041
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:14,958
that you and that man

1042
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,958
bribed the minister
to let you open casinos.

1043
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,541
What bribe?

1044
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,916
Chaisit is my friend.

1045
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:26,083
He sold his business to me
to can become a full-time politician.

1046
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,875
That's why I took him
to meet the minister.

1047
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,500
Don't lie, Mr. Sopon.

1048
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,125
I saw it with my own eyes.

1049
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,208
I downloaded everything myself.

1050
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,250
-Liar!
-You're a liar!

1051
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,166
-Liar!
-You're a liar, baby!

1052
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,500
Your voices are driving me nuts.

1053
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,958
There's no information.

1054
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:49,750
I just used these maids
to plant the files in your computer.

1055
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,750
I never had anything to do with you.

1056
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,166
But you did with my wife!

1057
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,458
You competed in a bid
with my wife's company.

1058
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:58,833
What the hell for?

1059
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:00,500
That's what you get

1060
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,416
for messing with a wife-lover like me.

1061
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,166
You used me.

1062
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:14,208
Then, the casinos...

1063
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,541
There's no casino.

1064
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,416
I made it all up.

1065
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,416
These two should have been born
as buffalos

1066
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,125
or maybe a tractor.

1067
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,791
You put me in hot water
and you're still laughing?

1068
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,541
Willy, take care of them.

1069
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:43,500
Too bad you had a snake, bastard.

1070
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:47,541
What should we do with them?

1071
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:51,958
These four would have been shot dead
by Sopon and Chaisit

1072
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:56,625
because they were angry
that these girls spied for me.

1073
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,666
You, you really are evil.

1074
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,708
Hey! You say that I'm bad,

1075
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:04,916
but I rid the country of bad people.

1076
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,208
Yeah?

1077
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,208
These two didn't deserve to die

1078
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,791
but without them,

1079
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,833
my wife will have it easy.

1080
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,333
Why did you hurt me?

1081
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,041
-You stupid girl.
-What an idiot.

1082
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,208
Hey!

1083
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:29,916
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1084
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,166
Hurry!

1085
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,041
Don't run!

1086
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:03,750
Hey!

1087
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,833
Go!

1088
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,333
Help!

1089
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,625
Don't. He's my spy.

1090
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,166
The four suspects have escaped.

1091
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,291
Follow them!

1092
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:25,625
I always get smelly things.

1093
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,375
This way.

1094
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,166
Stop!

1095
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:09,208
Very delicious.

1096
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,458
Out of the way!

1097
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,083
Stop!

1098
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:36,583
Stop!

1099
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:37,666
Hands up!

1100
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,208
Where's the flash drive?

1101
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,041
Where? Where?

1102
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:09,208
Don't worry, the patient will be okay.

1103
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:11,041
You can't go with the ambulance.

1104
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,916
Miss Paula, calm down.

1105
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,416
It's all right, madam.

1106
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,375
-What's going on?
-Where is the flash drive?

1107
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:20,500
Give it to me now.

1108
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,458
Hurry! Do you want to die?

1109
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,416
-Die!
-Don't!

1110
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,208
Jeez!

1111
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,791
Why did you shoot?

1112
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:36,666
-I was just threatening them.
-Fatty.

1113
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,666
Fatty.

1114
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,125
-Big Jim.
-Why did you save me, fatty?

1115
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,250
Fatty!

1116
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,958
No!

1117
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,416
Fatty!

1118
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,958
I didn't try to save you.

1119
01:15:56,083 --> 01:15:58,083
I was trying to get out of the way.

1120
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,583
Why did you block me?

1121
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:01,958
It hurts.

1122
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,291
It hurts, Waew.

1123
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,375
It hurts.

1124
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:09,833
You got hit in the butt.

1125
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:11,833
It hurts.

1126
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:13,166
Waew, it hurts.

1127
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,625
You just got grazed. Stop whining.

1128
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,583
You'll die next time.

1129
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,833
Who has the flash drive?

1130
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:21,666
Give it to me now.

1131
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,250
He's the bad guy.

1132
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,458
He's the bad guy.

1133
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,916
The bad guy.

1134
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,875
This is too much.

1135
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:31,375
Fatty.

1136
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,833
People are panicking. Shut them up.

1137
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:41,333
Are you okay?

1138
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,291
-It hurts.
-Get up.

1139
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,041
Take this!

1140
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,416
Why did you shoot my dad?

1141
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,750
-You're a little bitch. Go!
-Let go!

1142
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,250
You hag, you'll die too!

1143
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,125
Don't follow me!

1144
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,750
Help Paula. Please, help Paula.

1145
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,625
Come here!

1146
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,958
Hurry!

1147
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,666
Go!

1148
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:38,416
Go!

1149
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,583
Hey!

1150
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,916
-Let me go!
-Hurry up!

1151
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:58,583
Shit, my car got destroyed.

1152
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:09,958
Prasert, get in the car.

1153
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:11,500
Hurry up.

1154
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:12,875
Get up.

1155
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:21,583
OUI RESTAURANT

1156
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:22,958
-Waew!
-Waew!

1157
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:24,916
Big Jim!

1158
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,791
Waew!

1159
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,791
I think we'll have to go abroad
for a while, Kwan.

1160
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,250
I'm staying here.

1161
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:47,833
What do you mean?

1162
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,333
I need to prepare a funeral

1163
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,791
since my husband died in the line of duty.

1164
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:06,291
At first, I thought you would be able
to take care of Sopon

1165
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,791
and we would be happy together.

1166
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,416
But you did this!

1167
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,416
Don't you like nice girls?

1168
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,333
Is that why you messed around
with a lowlife like her?

1169
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:23,041
Women love hard and hate hard.

1170
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,208
And you.

1171
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,541
You're so meddlesome.

1172
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:30,833
You old hag.

1173
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,500
You heartless, menopausal bitch.

1174
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,000
You killed your husband.

1175
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:37,083
You've got a mouth on you.

1176
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:39,916
Let me tell you something.

1177
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:41,625
I'm...

1178
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,500
a man.

1179
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,583
Hey!

1180
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:52,583
Get back!

1181
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,625
Hey.

1182
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,333
-Hey.
-What?

1183
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,916
Hey, what did you shoot me for?

1184
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,375
Why did you fuck my husband?

1185
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,791
Hey!

1186
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,458
You bitch.

1187
01:21:03,916 --> 01:21:05,083
Bitch!

1188
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:18,875
Miss Paula.

1189
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:29,125
Waew, I'm here!

1190
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,583
Fatty!

1191
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,708
-Waew!
-Fatty, hurry!

1192
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,833
Miss Paula, hold on to me tight.

1193
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,666
No, I'm scared.

1194
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,583
Trust me. I've been doing this
since I was a girl.

1195
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:44,416
Waew, just jump, I got you!

1196
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,208
Waew!

1197
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,291
Waew!

1198
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:49,750
Come here!

1199
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,791
Jump! I'll catch you!

1200
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,166
One, two, three!

1201
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:16,541
Hurry, call an ambulance.

1202
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:17,875
Quickly. There's been an accident.

1203
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,625
-I'm so glad.
-Miss Paula.

1204
01:22:19,708 --> 01:22:21,458
Waew!

1205
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,416
Hey!

1206
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,750
-Hey!
-What?

1207
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,375
You're dead!

1208
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:02,625
Mom, our tale is even more exciting
than the movies.

1209
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:06,208
From being used
and almost not making it out alive,

1210
01:23:06,333 --> 01:23:08,333
everything turned out well.

1211
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:13,083
Madam was so grateful to us
for saving Miss Paula's life,

1212
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:17,583
so she opened a maid training school
and let us run it

1213
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:22,333
to elevate it to the ISO standard
or something.

1214
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:23,916
Cat, please explain.

1215
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,791
We teach how to pronounce
English words correctly.

1216
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,083
-Madam.
-Ma Dumb.

1217
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,041
-Ma Dumb.
-Ma Dumb.

1218
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:30,458
-Breakfast.
-Breakfadsa.

1219
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:32,250
-Breakfadsa.
-Breakfadsa.

1220
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:33,708
-Download.
-Dowlode.

1221
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:35,541
-Secret.
-Top chickret.

1222
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:36,916
-Top chickret.
-Top chickret.

1223
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:40,666
-Takra.
-Bucket.

1224
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,916
-Kalamung.
-Bowl.

1225
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,666
-Tee kud suam.
-Brush.

1226
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:45,916
-Mai kwad.
-Broom.

1227
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,625
-Tee dood suam.
-Dood suam.

1228
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:51,208
We teach how to effectively kick
the gentlemen in the balls.

1229
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:52,625
One...

1230
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,416
Three, go!

1231
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:56,666
One.

1232
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,958
We teach the proper way to use elevators.

1233
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,166
Remember, you have to be the first
to get inside like this.

1234
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,125
Try it.

1235
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:11,875
Ready?

1236
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:20,083
How was it?

1237
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:21,166
Did it hurt?

1238
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,291
I've been there before.

1239
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:24,833
Just like that.

1240
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:26,875
And most importantly,

1241
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,208
we teach them how to extract secrets
to get money from the gentlemen.

1242
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,041
What's this?

1243
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:34,583
-A girl's number.
-A girl's number.

1244
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,666
A girl's number, how much?

1245
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,083
-It's 1,500 baht.
-It's 1,500 baht.

1246
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,083
That's right.

1247
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,625
And this,

1248
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,000
a pair of panties, how much?

1249
01:24:44,791 --> 01:24:46,791
-It's 1,900 baht.
-It's 1,900 baht.

1250
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,791
Yuck, it's used.

1251
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:51,458
You can get 100 more for that.

1252
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:54,791
But if you find money...

1253
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:58,750
keep it!

1254
01:24:58,833 --> 01:24:59,750
Next month,

1255
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:02,916
I'll send you the last bit of money
so you can get our rice field back.

1256
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:05,125
I miss you and Dad very much.

1257
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:07,125
P.S.

1258
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:08,958
Don't worry about Jim.

1259
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:13,125
She still gets to work out her tongue
with Black Jim every day.

1260
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,458
Fatty, will you hurry up?

1261
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:19,375
Oh, I couldn't possibly walk faster
because it's so dark in here.

1262
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,208
How can it not be dark?

1263
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:25,750
You're blocking the light
in this whole room.

1264
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:27,875
Wow, Black Jim,

1265
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,958
when you talk,
can you open your mouth wider?

1266
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,375
I can't see your teeth.

1267
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:33,208
I thought I was speaking to air.

1268
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,041
I show my teeth all the time,

1269
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:41,375
but you'll never be able to see them
since your fat is in the way.

1270
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:42,791
It's not fat.

1271
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:46,375
Don't you know there's an eclipse in here?

1272
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,250
Jeez!

1273
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:55,041
I wonder how many eclipses it would take
to swallow you up whole.

1274
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:05,583
Anyway, guys like it black.

1275
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:09,791
You're dead!

1276
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:16,916
