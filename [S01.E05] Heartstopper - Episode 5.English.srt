No, no.

311
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,039
She just asked me out
and I was so surprised,

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,759
and all our mates were watching
and expecting me to say "yes"

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,519
and I was such an idiot,
I just blurted out "yes"

314
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,919
because I didn't know how to say "no"

without embarrassing her
and confusing all our mates.

I'm so sorry.

you always tell me not to say?

Yeah, but…

with Imogen, I'm gonna…
