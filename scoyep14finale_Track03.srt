Come come come

465
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,482
- The colour of your shirt is so pale
- Oh, seriously?

466
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,965
- Yeah, I think so
- Too pale, right?
- A little maybe. Come here

467
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,431
How much coconut water will these 2 need?

468
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:17,509
- Go easy with her, okay? She’s a headstrong one
- Understood

469
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,453
Talk calmly and be as cool as ice when you talk

470
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:23,208
- Be as cool as the coconut water you had the day before
- Oh. Haha

471
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,480
So you don’t snap so easily

472
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,090
Please tell mum to go easy on me

473
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,537
Go easy on them

474
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:29,541
Right. Come here

475
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:33,882
Don’t be a hot-tempered woman. Don’t make scary faces. You’re scaring your man

476
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,286
- If there’s anything that upsets you, sort it out between yourselves calmly
- Yes

477
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,033
Come on

478
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:43,515
- There there
- Thank you

479
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:47,426
- Good luck. Good luck, kids
- Best of luck to all of you. Good luck

480
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:50,282
Ah, let me give you a hug first

481
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:54,248
Oh, there there

482
00:33:54,407 --> 00:34:00,652
Come here, my child
- Let’s hug

483
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:03,787
Jao, I’ll put your stuff away for you

484
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:04,686
Okay

485
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:06,808
There. Done

486
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:08,023
- Jao, wait up
- Hurry
- Come here

487
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,116
Huff. Okay

488
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,027
Was that everything?

489
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:17,433
- There’s one more
- Hand it to me, Jao

490
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:22,170
- Som, do you need a hand?
- No, it’s fine

491

492
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,639
Hm?

493
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:32,805
What is it, Jao?

494
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,044
Did you see them, Sky?

495
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:37,670
See what?

496
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,765
Toh and Nuea, of course

497
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,681
It’s so nice

498
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:49,022
that Nuea is accepted by Toh’s parents, isn’t it?

499
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:51,374
Were you cheering for them on the side?

500
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:56,915
No, I wasn’t

501
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:02,333
I’m just…happy

502
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:07,578
that Toh’s family now welcomes Nuea

503
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:13,616
- Jao
- Hm?

504
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:15,109
Are you free this Saturday?

505
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:16,993
Saturday…

506
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:20,893
Um! Yes, I am. What is it, Sky?

507
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,653
Let’s go meet my mum

508
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:27,807
Huh!?

509
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:31,453
Jao

Hey, let’s go

511
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:34,378
Quick

512

- Right
- Come quick
- Jao, hurry

513
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:40,730
- Hurry up
- Right, hurry
- Come. Let’s hurry back to Bangkok so we can see my mum

514
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:42,378
- Get in
- Sky!

515
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:45,526
- Hurry
- Come on now
- Get in

516

00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:56,031
Hm?

518
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,389
Where are you taking me?

519
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,774
I’m taking you to all the places where my memories lie

520
00:36:15,692 --> 00:36:18,714
I used to play hide and seek with my friends here when I was young. I still remember

[Sky, the handsome]

522
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:11,133
You’ve remained the same all this time, Sky

- Sky, the handsome
- Sky, the handsome

524

What handsome

525
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:22,912
Tell me where I’m not handsome, hm?

526
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:28,245
Just you wait. Just you wait

527
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:31,072
What’s up? You’ve finally come, huh

528
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:36,463
Yeah. This is my lover, Kaojao

529
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:41,633
These are my friends since elementary school – Attaphon and Wichean

530
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,600
Hey, that’s my dad’s name. You shithead

531
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,682
Hello

532
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,857
My name is Win. And this is Pol. We’ve been friends with Sky since elementary school

533
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:51,067
Then, he moved to a different school for secondary school. He followed a girl there

534
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,488
I moved because the basketball team was popular, damn it

535
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:58,952
Jao, you must be careful. Don’t trust his words too much

536
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,803
He’s been a player since he was young and tiny

537
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,380
Ouch!

538
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:06,889
Are you a player?

539
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:11,807
But but but but…ever since he has a lover, he hardly comes out these days when we ask him to come drink with us

540
00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:16,983
Why are you smiling?

541
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:19,307
Don’t let me catch you

542
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:20,904
Catch me on what?

543
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:22,957
Being a player!

544
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:30,377
Anyway…whenever you want to hang out or have a meal

545
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,201
you can take Sky with you. I’m not stopping him

546
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,266
You give me the permission

547
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,449
- but I no longer want to go
- Eh?

548
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,946
I want to be with my lover more

549
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,810
Oohhhh. Lover, he says

550

- Sky
- Hm?

Sky

552
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,226
Erm…what’s the plan for today?

553
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:55,001
Shsh

554
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:02,841
Don’t ask just yet. Just hop in first. We have quite a few places to go today

555
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:10,153
Hey, I gotta head out first

556

Yeah, go ahead

- Yeah

- See ya
- Yeah, sure
- Yeah yeah
