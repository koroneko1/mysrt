1
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
Have you heard of miracles before?

2
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
Sometimes,

3
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,880
a miracle can happen in the late morning

4
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,280
of an ordinary day.

5
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,160
It happened yesterday.

6
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,880
I'm going to tell you

7
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,560
what happened between me

8
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,480
and Nut.

9
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
JULY 23

10
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,080
This comet only comes around

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,240
once in 6,800 years.

12
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
Many people, including me, tried to look up in the sky,

13
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
but we couldn't see it.

14
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
It was too cloudy.

15
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,560
This footage was taken in Mae Rim District, Chiang Mai, at 8.30 p.m.

16
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
before it rained last night.

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,120
-It's a very clear image. -Yes, it is.

18
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,040
This image was captured by Princess Sirindhorn AstroPark in Chiang Mai.

19
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,440
At least, we can witness the comet via an image.

20
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,800
You can clearly see its dust tail and gas tail.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,320
I'm leaving now, Tofu.

22
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm leaving now, Mom.

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,160
Nut, don't forget your lunchbox.

24
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Thank you.

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,560
A miracle happened to me.

26
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,920
Since you might not get it,

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,720
let me go back to where it began.

28
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,040
As you can guess,

29
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm actually a teddy bear.

30
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,080
10 YEARS AGO

31
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,440
I don't know how I woke up.

32
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,200
But the only thing I can remember

33
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,640
is Nut's face.

34
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
Nut became my master

35
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
the moment I woke up.

36
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,080
Whenever I spend time with Nut,

37
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,360
he hugs me.

38
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
He always puts me by his side.

39
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
We're moving house.

40
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,880
After Nut graduated, he took me to a new house with him.

41
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,400
I was a little sad that I couldn't be on his bed anymore.

42
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,640
But I've made a lot of new friends here.

43
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,960
My time with Nut went by…

44
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
Well…

45
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,680
quite happily, I guess.

46
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,320
Things were fine until yesterday

47
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,840
when something strange happened to me.

48
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,920
I suddenly turned into a human.

49
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Stop right there, thief.

50
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
Stop.

51
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
Hey.

52
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,320
You might ask why Nut is chasing after me.

53
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
It's because…

54
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Stop.

55
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Where was I with our story?

56
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
Give me a second.

57
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
I need to rest a second.

58
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,880
Hey!

59
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
FOR SALE

60
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,680
How can I help you?

61
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
That boy just now.

62
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
He stole something from me.

63
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,360
I see. I'll find him for you.

64
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,440
Boy.

65
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,120
Hey. Stop.

66
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
Boy, stop.

67
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
Stop. Where are you going?

68
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
Hey.

69
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,920
Stop right there.

70
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,280
He keeps chasing me.

71
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,400
I bet Nut sent him to find me.

72
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
You're not going anywhere.

73
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
Where's Nut?

74
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
Come this way.

75
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
You're handsome. It's a shame you are a thief.

76
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,760
Go away.

77
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't come back again.

78
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,760
You can't run from me.

79
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,360
Come here.

80
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
Run while you still can.

81
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,760
I've seen people in movies do this.

82
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,280
Nut and I used to watch movies.

83
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Nice try.

84
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,400
But I forgot

85
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,960
that Nut is a screenwriter.

86
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,960
Nut.

87
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Don't send me to the police.

88
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
It hurts so badly.

89
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
It hurts so much more

90
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,120
than being attacked by Kuenchai.

91
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
You should be glad I brought him to the hospital.

92
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Can you bring Tofu home

93
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,200
once he gets discharged?

94
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
How can we bring him home? We don't know who he is.

95
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,920
He's a good guy. He can keep me company at home.

96
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,160
She is Nut's mother.

97
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,200
He can keep me company.

98
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,640
She has always been kind to me.

99
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
There was this one time.

100
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
I remember it vividly.

101
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Kuenchai.

102
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,840
This dog is my number one enemy.

103
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,840
I don't know what I ever did to him.

104
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,040
He hates me so much.

105
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He always finds chances to attack me

106
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,960
but Nut has saved my life every time.

107
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,680
Then Nut's mother

108
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,920
would fix me up.

109
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,440
But someone as kind as her

110
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,640
once put me in a hellish tunnel that I hated very much.

111
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,640
It was dark and wet.

112
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,320
And it kept spinning and made me dizzy.

113
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
Still,

114
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,840
she's a very kind person.

115
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,280
Seriously?

116
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,600
You fell from the sky?

117
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Yesterday,

118
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
she was the one who saved me.

119
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
I…

120
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm a human now.

121
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
THE LITTLE PRINCE

122
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,680
Little Prince?

123
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
These are Nut's clothes.

124
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,240
They should fit you.

125
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Put them on. Then come out and see me.

126
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Thank you.

127
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,600
What happened to the teddy bear?

128
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,960
How did he turn into a human?

129
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,720
Is Heaven punishing you for something?

130
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,480
You need to pull yourself together.

131
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
There is a solution to every problem.

132
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,920
Oh, no.

133
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,640
Oh, my goodness.

134
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,360
-Oh, my… -Oh, my…

135
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
Oh.

136
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,360
Wow.

137
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
I've only seen Nut's.

138
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I never thought I would get one myself.

139
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,720
Little Prince, are you done?

140
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
Almost.

141
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,880
Stop barking, Kuenchai. Here's your food.

142
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
Is it itchy, Little Prince?

143
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,360
Were you bitten by ants?

144
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
No.

145
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm just not used to it yet.

146
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,120
I've never worn proper clothes before.

147
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,320
All I had was a bandana.

148
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,320
I don't know why she's calling me

149
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Little Prince.

150
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
But she can call me whatever she wants.

151
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,200
By the way, what were you doing on the balcony?

152
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,560
Tell me.

153
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
You were naked too.

154
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Well…

155
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,800
I…

156
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,920
Were you caught having an affair

157
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
with someone?

158
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,280
Is that why you were running for your life?

159
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,640
No.

160
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,240
I just…

161
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,400
I…

162
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,320
Nut…

163
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,640
Are you Nut's friend?

164
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm sorry then.

165
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,640
I watch a lot of dramas.

166
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
Don't mind me.

167
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,520
What's your name?

168
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
Well…

169
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,600
What should I say?

170
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,600
If I say my name is Tofu,

171
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
will it raise her suspicion?

172
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
Your skin is very fair.

173
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,640
It's super soft too.

174
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,720
You remind me of Nut's teddy bear.

175
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,200
The teddy bear's name is Tofu.

176
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,680
You can call me Tofu then.

177
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
I…

178
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,240
I…

179
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I mean

180
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,560
it's up to you

181
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,560
what you want to call me.

182
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,160
JULY 24

183
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
That was what happened

184
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,920
when his mother saved me yesterday.

185
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
Why do you care about him?

186
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,920
We don't know him.

187
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
We can't bring him home.

188
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
But I want him to live with us.

189
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Nut.

190
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,920
Are you okay?

191
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,560
Are you hurt anywhere?

192
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,600
This is Nut's best friend,

193
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,800
Gen.

194
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
-I'm fine. -He is Nut's colleague.

195
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,760
Ma'am.

196
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,040
Hello.

197
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Pribpree.

198
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,080
You got here even before me?

199
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,840
I don't know this woman.

200
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
But since Gen knows her, she's probably Nut's colleague too.

201
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
Didn't I just assign you a task?

202
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,160
Why are you here?

203
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Are you here to flirt?

204
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,880
I didn't just get here.

205
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,160
I was at the scene of the accident.

206
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I…

207
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,520
I…

208
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
I hit him with my car.

209
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,400
I…

210
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,760
It wasn't you.

211
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
I hit him.

212
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,760
But…

213
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,800
-I hit him. -It was me.

214
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,880
You should get your brain checked.

215
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,720
Your crazy brain is making up an imaginary accident.

216
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,160
It's not imaginary. I really hit him.

217
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,880
Nut is a gentleman. He's taking the blame for me.

218
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,400
Him? Nut would never do such a thing for you.

219
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Is this your plan to get close

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
to Nut?

221
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,040
Are you crazy?

222
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,360
I might be obsessed with Nut,

223
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,880
but this is a life-and-death situation.

224
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,520
Whatever.

225
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,280
At least, you have a conscience.

226
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,320
Still, I should take responsibility for this too.

227
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
I scared him and that's how Nut's car hit him.

228
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,360
Prib, you just won't leave Nut alone, will you?

229
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,560
Look.

230
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,760
Little Prince, how are you feeling?

231
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,040
Who are you?

232
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
Tell me.

233
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm…

234
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm…

235
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,040
I don't know who I am.

236
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
I don't remember.

237
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
I don't know how I got here.

238
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
Did the accident affect his memory?

239
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,760
I didn't hit him hard. I just grazed him.

240
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,240
The doctor said he was fine.

241
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,240
His brain X-ray came out normal too.

242
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,880
Come home with me when you're better. I'll cook you something delicious.

243
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Who are you?

244
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,720
Tell me what you want.

245
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,960
-Tell me. -Nut, don't hurt him.

246
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,240
-Tell me. -You're hurting him.

247
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
Will you please calm down?

248
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm sure he's not lying.

249
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,920
He might have lost his memory during the accident.

250
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,080
Mom.

251
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,080
The doctor said he was fine.

252
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,160
Why don't you believe that?

253
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,760
Do you want to be responsible for him?

254
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Gen.

255
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,040
Keep an eye on him.

256
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,280
-I'm going to talk to the doctor. -Nut.

257
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
Nut.

258
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,320
What am I going to do

259
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,880
if Nut doesn't believe me?

260
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,280
The accident

261
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,960
may have caused a severe concussion,

262
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,720
causing his brain to shut down.

263
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,560
However, it will heal on its own.

264
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,960
I'll need to monitor him for another day or two.

265
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,920
What if he doesn't get better?

266
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
If he still doesn't remember,

267
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,120
I will send him to get another brain X-ray.

268
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
If his brain X-ray

269
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,120
doesn't show any physical abnormalities,

270
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,040
he may be suffering from trauma.

271
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,640
I will need to discuss his case with a psychiatrist.

272
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,400
All right.

273
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
What did the doctor say?

274
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,960
He has to stay here for a few days.

275
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,960
They want to monitor him.

276
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,320
See?

277
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,920
Tofu wasn't lying about losing his memory.

278
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,560
He's not a bad guy.

279
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,960
When you came home drunk last night,

280
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,760
he carried you to bed upstairs.

281
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,560
Oh, right. I totally forgot about last night.

282
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Let's go back again to yesterday.

283
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,280
Yesterday,

284
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
lots of things happened.

285
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,760
Ever since I somehow became a human,

286
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,560
I've been trying to transform back into a teddy bear.

287
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,920
But it's harder than it seems.

288
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,520
How about we use voodoo, Tofu?

289
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,920
Tofu.

290
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,760
How about you go back where it began?

291
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,800
Yes.

292
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,080
Nut will freak out seeing me like this.

293
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,720
And he might

294
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,040
abandon me.

295
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,640
I have to transform back into a teddy bear,

296
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
so I can be with Nut forever.

297
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm scared.

298
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,400
I have to tell Nut the truth.

299
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
Nut is back.

300
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
-We've arrived. -Great.

301
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,680
Be careful.

302
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,960
Why is someone bringing him home?

303
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,760
-Sir, have we arrived? -Yes.

304
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,760
It's okay.

305
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,560
You can leave. I'm fine.

306
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,200
Who's that?

307
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,320
Honey.

308
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,960
It's like his mother said.

309
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,640
Nut.

310
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,960
Nut got drunk.

311
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,040
The man who sent him home

312
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,960
was a driver he called from his phone.

313
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,680
It's so convenient being a human.

314
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,280
But because he came home drunk,

315
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,200
I couldn't tell him the truth.

316
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,120
Honey.

317
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Are you hot?

318
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,800
Yes.

319
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,760
It's so warm.

320
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,680
And that

321
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
was the end of yesterday.

322
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,480
But the story of Nut and I

323
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
didn't end there.

324
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,000
Neung.

325
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,800
I don't know who that is.

326
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,760
Why don't I know anyone now that I'm a human?

327
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,960
Wait.

328
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
You're not Neung.

329
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
Who are you?

330
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,400
I got so wasted last night.

331
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I brought him home without knowing.

332
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
What did you say?

333
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
Nothing.

334
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,040
-I've got great taste in men. -What?

335
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,880
Go home.

336
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,680
I'll walk you out.

337
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,880
Go.

338
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,520
I don't want to leave.

339
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,240
You have to go.

340
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,840
Go.

341
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,760
Go. Get up.

342
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,040
Leave before my mom wakes up.

343
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,160
Get up.

344
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,120
Go.

345
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,680
Where are your clothes?

346
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
Just take mine.

347
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,560
Turn around.

348
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,080
Here.

349
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,440
I'm going to take a shower.

350
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,200
What should we do? Does he really have to leave?

351
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,280
All we can do is pray.

352
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,080
Hurry up.

353
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,040
Keep it down.

354
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,200
Nut.

355
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,520
Keep it down. You'll wake my mom up.

356
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Nut.

357
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,800
What do you want?

358
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,320
Kuenchai.

359
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,480
Be quiet. Come on.

360
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Where are you taking Little Prince at this hour?

361
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,920
Little Prince?

362
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
I'm talking about Tofu.

363
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
Do you know this guy?

364
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Isn't he your friend?

365
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,000
He fell from your balcony yesterday morning.

366
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,719
He isn't my friend. I don't know him.

367
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,360
-Who are you? -Nut.

368
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,040
-What do you want from us? -Calm down.

369
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,080
-Tell me. -Calm down.

370
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,679
Are you deaf? Say something.

371
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
You won't talk, will you?

372
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,480
-Nut. -Come with me.

373
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,080
-Nut, leave Tofu alone. -Come with me.

374
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,360
Nut, calm down.

375
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,679
Walk.

376
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,000
-Get in. -Nut.

377
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,639
-Get in. -Nut, Tofu isn't a thief.

378
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,159
Mom, get out of my way.

379
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,480
If he isn't your friend, your dad must have sent him to keep me company.

380
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,400
Will you stop talking about Dad?

381
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,320
Dad didn't send him. He's a thief.

382
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,760
He broke into our house.

383
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm taking him to the police.

384
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,640
No, Nut.

385
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,520
Nut, don't take Tofu away from me. Nut.

386
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
Nut.

387
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,520
Get out.

388
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
I said, get out.

389
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,680
You're not moving, right?

390
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
Hey.

391
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm sorry, Nut.

392
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,560
You brat.

393
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
Do you want to do this the hard way?

394
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,280
That's the whole story.

395
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,200
That's why Nut was chasing after me.

396
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,440
He brought me to the police station.

397
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
But in the end,

398
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,320
he had to take me to the hospital instead.

399
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,240
Is that all it takes for you to think of him as a good person?

400
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,160
He could be fooling you.

401
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,960
No.

402
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm not.

403
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,080
I believe him.

404
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,440
Once the doctor discharges him,

405
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
please take him home.

406
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,880
You hit him.

407
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
You must take responsibility.

408
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,080
Let me take responsibility too.

409
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,000
Stop.

410
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,480
I took responsibility

411
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,800
by bringing him here.

412
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,600
If he doesn't have any relatives,

413
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
the doctor said we should take him to the welfare center.

414
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,880
How can you be so heartless?

415
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
Bringing Tofu home won't cause us any trouble.

416
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,360
I'll help take care of him.

417
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,360
Just worry about yourself.

418
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,800
Nut.

419
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,040
Calm down.

420
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm trying.

421
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,960
But can't you see that she wants to bring

422
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,640
a stranger into our house?

423
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,120
There is an elderly person and a dog in my house.

424
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,520
What if something happens?

425
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,520
You need to calm down though.

426
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,840
Why are you worrying about me now?

427
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,840
You're rarely home anyway.

428
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm fine on my own.

429
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,400
Can you not cause me any trouble then?

430
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Whether I'm home or not,

431
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,480
you cause me trouble anyway.

432
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,480
I hate staying home

433
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,200
because we can never get along.

434
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,720
Little Prince, come home with me.

435
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Come home with me.

436
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,400
-Nut. -I said no. Why won't you listen?

437
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Nut.

438
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,880
Will you stop acting this way?

439
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,920
It's exhausting.

440
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
Please listen to me for once.

441
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Nut.

442
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,720
Don't be so harsh on her.

443
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,240
Stay out of it.

444
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,040
You're the reason she's like this.

445
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,800
Nut.

446
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,280
Let's talk it out.

447
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
Mom.

448
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,600
-Listen to me. -No.

449
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
-Let's go home. -No.

450
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,120
-I'm not listening. -Leave him.

451
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
-I'm not listening. -Please.

452
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
-Let's go. -I won't listen.

453
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,400
Mom, please.

454
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,400
-Leave him here. -No, I want to stay here with Tofu.

455
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,680
Stop acting this way. I'm begging you.

456
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,640
I'm begging you.

457
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,680
Will you please stop fighting?

458
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,440
Please do something.

459
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,600
What do you want me to do?

460
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,120
What's the matter?

461
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,960
Tofu got injured trying to help me.

462
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,360
And you told me to leave him at the hospital.

463
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,720
I'm not going to leave him to die there.

464
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,640
I don't care. I'm going back there to see Tofu tomorrow.

465
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,200
Before you worry about him,

466
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,840
worry about yourself first.

467
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,400
I'm fine.

468
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
You saw how he helped me.

469
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,040
This conversation is over.

470
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Get some rest.

471
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,960
Is anyone here?

472
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,440
Can anyone hear me?

473
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,320
People get rid of things

474
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,360
they don't need anymore.

475
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,920
But can they just get rid of other people they don't need?

476
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,520
Nut.

477
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,600
You're not going to leave me here, are you?

478
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,280
JULY 25

479
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,880
-Who's that? -Who's that?

480
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,160
How is it any of your business?

481
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Gosh.

482
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,120
Hello.

483
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,400
Hello.

484
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,960
The weather is nice today.

485
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,680
-Yes. -Right?

486
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Leave them alone.

487
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,520
Hey, come here.

488
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,920
Is your name Tofu?

489
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,760
I don't remember.

490
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
But that's what your mother calls me.

491
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,520
He reminds me of your teddy bear.

492
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,520
You don't mind, do you?

493
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,120
It's just a name.

494
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,960
I don't care about that.

495
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,240
I'll let you stay here.

496
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,040
Temporarily though.

497
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,680
-Nut. -That's the best I can do.

498
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,320
He can't stay here forever.

499
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,480
As soon as his memory comes back, he's packing his bag.

500
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,840
All right.

501
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,560
While you are here,

502
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,400
your job is to take care of the house,

503
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,880
clean the house, and keep my mother company.

504
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,680
Okay.

505
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I'll do as you say.

506
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,320
Good.

507
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,320
And don't worry.

508
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,560
I'll help you get your memory back.

509
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,160
Because I want to know

510
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,480
who you are too.

511
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,040
-I'll see you later, Mom. -Nut.

512
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,800
Wait, Nut.

513
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,720
Don't…

514
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,080
Don't forget your lunchbox. I've warmed it up for you.

515
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
Sure, as for the tie-in,

516
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,480
I've taken care of it.

517
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,320
Which type of product is it?

518
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,960
Nut.

519
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,440
Okay.

520
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,600
Nut.

521
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,000
-I'm talking. Okay. -Nut.

522
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,480
This is amazing.

523
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,440
I like it.
I do.

524
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,040
-Thank you, Juea. -It doesn't make sense to me though.

525
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,800
I don't get it.

526
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,800
Screw it.

527
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,680
I won't fix it anymore. Give it to the staff.

528
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,400
They're almost done filming.

529
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,200
-Okay. -Let's talk about the next project later.

530
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,720
-Do you mean it? -Hold on.

531
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,440
Jaew, got the coffee yet?

532
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,640
Make it quick.

533
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Gosh.

534
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,120
You have to come up with a new idea.

535
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,720
Actually, I already have something in mind.

536
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,760
Nut.

537
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,520
Stop sulking already.

538
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,960
It's not that Juea doesn't like the idea.

539
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,280
It's a good idea.

540
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,400
It's just new for the company.

541
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,640
They find it risky.

542
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,800
I said, stop sulking already.

543
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,800
You just need to work on it a bit.

544
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,960
Juea trusts you.

545
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,920
I trust you too.

546
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,760
You can do it.

547
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,320
I know that.

548
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,400
I'm not going to give up.

549
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,800
A chance like this doesn't come often.

550
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,200
I'll do my best.

551
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,000
-That's what I'm talking about. -Nut.

552
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,800
Nut.

553
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,320
Prib.

554
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,520
Did you put GPS on Nut?

555
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,280
You keep running into him.

556
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,720
Come here.

557
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,840
It's destiny that brings us together.

558
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,520
-How silly. -Hey.

559
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,480
Spit it out.

560
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,880
What brings you here?

561
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,560
-Let's go to the new… -No.

562
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,880
We are in this mess because you invited me out to drink.

563
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,280
You drank the whiskey yourself. How can you blame me for it?

564
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Do you think I didn't know you were trying to get me drunk?

565
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,080
Come here.

566
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,200
You're an idiot.

567
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,440
Nut.

568
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,440
So, are you really going to let Tofu stay at your place?

569
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,200
It's only for my mom.

570
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,520
I don't fully trust him.

571
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,760
I'm not sure what he's up to.

572
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,560
It was part of my plan.

573
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,200
Was the whole thing an act?

574
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
No, it wasn't.

575
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,280
During my fight with Nut,

576
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,000
I planned to faint,

577
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,480
so our argument would end.

578
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,360
But somehow, I couldn't move my legs and fell down.

579
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,600
You must keep it a secret.

580
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,000
Let's make it a little secret between us.

581
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,400
Okay.

582
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,280
See?

583
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,800
I told you.

584
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,960
Even a kind person like her has a dark side too.

585
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,320
Once I'm done cleaning Nut's room, I'll clean the guest room for you.

586
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,960
It's next to this one.

587
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,240
It's okay.

588
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,320
I can sleep with Nut.

589
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,600
We've shared a room before.

590
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,520
I see.

591
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,240
Are you talking about

592
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,920
the day Nut came home drunk?

593
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,440
Yes.

594
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,320
Make yourself at home then.

595
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,720
I'll cook you some food.

596
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,840
-Do you need help? -It's okay.

597
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,280
I've got my husband to help me.

598
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,520
I'm back, everyone.

599
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,480
Finally, the teddy bear is back.

600
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,120
Welcome home, Tofu.

601
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
Thank you.

602
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,360
I forgot to introduce you to my friends.

603
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,640
Have you got a few minutes?

604
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,200
I will introduce you. Let's start with the first one.

605
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,400
Mr. Notebook.

606
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,160
10 YEARS AGO

607
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,240
OR DON'T WEAK GUYS

608
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,720
DESERVE TO BE BORN?

609
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:36,880
4 YEARS AGO

610
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,800
I don't care if you're still here or not.

611
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,800
But let me ask you one thing.

612
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,920
What's your plan?

613
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,560
This is Ms. Bolster.

614
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,920
She doesn't seem to like me.

615
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,080
She's always mean to me.

616
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,840
It's okay, Tofu. I know you are doing your best.

617
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,480
This is Ms. Blanket.

618
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
She is kind and loving.

619
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,200
She reminds me

620
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,280
of Nut's hugs.

621
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,320
She's right.

622
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,560
Don't lose hope.

623
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,120
Think of every problem as a reward in your life.

624
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,760
It will teach you how to be more mature.

625
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,440
This is Mr. Desk.

626
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,600
He's the life coach of this house.

627
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,160
But what I'm going through right now

628
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,120
is beyond any life coach's help.

629
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,000
What should I do?

630
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,360
I don't want to be a human.

631
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,160
I'm afraid Nut will kick me out of the house.

632
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
I don't know

633
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,360
if this is a good idea or not.

634
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,040
I almost forgot to introduce her.

635
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,000
This is Ms. Chair, our shy girl.

636
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,120
She's so shy

637
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,760
that Mr. Desk has to cheer her up all the time.

638
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,560
But since you have no other choice,

639
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,320
would you like

640
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,040
to give it a try?

641
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,040
Sure.

642
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,280
At this point, I'm willing to try anything.

643
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,040
What should I do?

644
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,560
Here is what you do.

645
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,280
I got the peas.

646
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,520
Peel them and put them in this bowl.

647
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,960
As you can see,

648
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,880
Ms. Chair told me to do nothing.

649
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,240
That's right.

650
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,160
I have to do nothing.

651
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,400
In order to stay with Nut,

652
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,640
I just have to pretend to be human.

653
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,120
That's not how you do it.

654
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,240
This is how you do it.

655
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,120
Squeeze it and remove the sides.

656
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440
How are we supposed to eat that?

657
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,280
Yes.

658
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,560
Remove both sides.

659
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,040
That's okay.

661
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,960
Get a mop to clean it up or we might slip on it.

662
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,720
Try this.

663
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,800
-It's good. -Do you like it?

664
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,040
Kuenchai.

665
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,480
Kuenchai!

666
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,760
Kuenchai, stop!

667
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Go away.

668
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,600
Kuenchai!

669
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,720
Kuenchai, no!

670
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,480
Kuenchai, no!

671
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,480
What's wrong with you? Stop.

672
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,520
Here you go.

673
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,840
Wow.

674
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,240
You're giving me your lunchbox.

675
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,640
He gives everyone his lunchbox.

676
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,560
There's nothing special about it.

677
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,440
Gen, it took me three months to get one from him.

678
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,440
I've been here for three months already.

679
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,160
This is the first one he has given me.

680
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,560
You aren't special to him after all.

681
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,080
Let me tell you something.

682
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,400
I was the first to get one.

683
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,200
I might be the last person to get one.

684
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,760
-Prib. -Prib.

685
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,440
Hey, my mother isn't dying.

686
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,800
She can make a lot more.

687
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,360
Wait.

688
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,920
Why do you give the food your mom cooks for you

689
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,320
to other people?

690
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
You talk too much. Give it back.

691
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,840
You know,

692
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,400
I can't wait to try my mother-in-law…

693
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,040
your mother's cooking.

694
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
You are crazy.

695
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,120
I'm eating with Gen. I've asked the housekeeper to order food for us.

696
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,000
What is it, Mom?

697
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,040
I'll be right there.

698
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,760
-I have to go. -Nut.

699
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,080
-Where are you going? -Tofu has caused a problem.

700
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,600
Nut.

701
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,880
-Kuenchai. -Nut.

702
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,800
Stop.

703
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,880
What happened?

704
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,240
I don't know.

705
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,200
I was helping your mom cook

706
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,720
and Kuenchai chased after me.

707
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,440
Why would he chase after you?

708
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,040
Are you sure you're not lying?

709
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,640
Why would Tofu lie to you?

710
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,880
Mom.

711
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,720
Kuenchai is a peaceful dog.

712
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,680
He never chases anyone

713
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,520
unless someone frightens him.

714
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,440
They understand each other.

715
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
Tofu.

716
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,760
I…

717
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,280
I didn't start it.

718
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,560
You can ask your mom.

719
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,720
He's right.

720
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,880
Kuenchai suddenly started barking at Tofu. He wouldn't listen to me too.

721
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,520
What got him riled up?

722
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,080
I don't know.

723
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,560
Tofu.

724
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,600
I'm asking you for the last time.

725
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,840
Are you sure you weren't snooping around the house?

726
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,960
Do you really think he's a thief?

727
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,120
Gosh, Nut.

728
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,880
This is a big misunderstanding.

729
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,920
I don't want to steal anything.

730
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,120
I'm just pretending like what Ms. Chair told me.

731
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,720
But this dog

732
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,200
almost ruined my plan.

733
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,240
Tofu and Kuenchai are not used to each other yet.

734
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,600
They'll learn to get along.

735
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,680
I will

736
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,800
punish Kuenchai

737
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,360
by not feeding him a meal

738
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,160
and locking him away in his crate.

739
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,720
Come with me.

740
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,280
Come.

741
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,360
Stop worrying so much.

742
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,720
Tofu can't take care of himself.

743
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,640
How could he steal anything?

744
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,160
I agree.

745
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,200
He looks too innocent.

746
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,800
The only thing he could steal is my heart.

747
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,760
They're the ones to watch out for.

748
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,920
What's your plan then?

749
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,000
Take him to the police?

750
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,120
That's not a good idea.

751
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,880
You might make things worse again.

752
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,360
The accident may have caused a severe concussion,

753
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,480
causing his brain to shut down.

754
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,000
However, it will heal on its own.

755
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,600
Let's wait until his memory is back.

756
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,760
If you don't trust him that much,

757
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,680
just install cameras around the house.

758
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,800
Yes, that's a good idea.

759
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,560
Nut, come back.

760
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,920
I was being sarcastic.

761
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,200
Are you going upstairs? I can…

762
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,640
Stay here.

763
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,600
Your job is to clean up the house.

764
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,120
Seriously?

765
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,720
Yes.

766
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,600
Is he ruining my life

767
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,160
or am I ruining my own life?

768
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,680
I'll help you clean up.

769
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,280
Nut.

770
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:34,920
Mom.

771
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,840
Have you seen Tofu?

772
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,440
He's behind you.

773
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,760
I'm not talking about him.

774
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,160
I'm talking about Tofu, my teddy bear.

775
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,680
Have you seen him?

776
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,400
I went to clean your room today as usual,

777
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,120
but he wasn't there.

778
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,960
If you didn't take it, who did?

779
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,560
Kuenchai.

780
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,120
Did you take Tofu to the trash again?

781
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,320
Did you?

782
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,640
Did you?

783
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,080
Damn it.

784
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,520
Nut.

785
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,880
-Nut. -Where are you going, Nut?

786
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,080
Wait, Nut. Slow down.

787
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,200
Where are you going?

788
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,600
What are you looking for?

789
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,880
A teddy bear.

790
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,080
It's white and a little over one meter tall.

791
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,320
Have you seen it?

792
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,360
No.

793
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,000
But a garbage truck just came to collect the trash ten minutes ago.

794
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,560
Shit.

795
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,160
Stop, Nut. Where are you going?

796
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,640
-I need to follow the trucks. -Do you know where they went?

797
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,040
-Yes. -How many trucks?

798
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,400
Two, one runs in front and one behind the village.

799
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,520
They come Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

800
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,840
That's really informative.

801
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,600
You go out the front and I'll go out the back. Split up.

802
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,600
-I'm going with you. -You're coming with me.

803
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,720
Look at them go.

804
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,560
What's wrong with them?

805
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,960
I'm going to shoot now.

806
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
Shoot.

807
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,280
-What a perfect shot. -Great shot.

808
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,560
Nut.

809
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,440
Nut.

810
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,880
-What is it? -Nut, it's no use.

811
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,360
The truck is long gone.

812
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,880
We won't be able to find the teddy bear.

813
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,400
Don't come if you are too tired.

814
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,160
There it is.

815
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,560
Mister.

816
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,840
-Mister. -Nut.

817
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
I'm tired.

818
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,720
I can't breathe anymore.

819
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,680
Me too.

820
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,960
Why didn't we call a cab or take the car?

821
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,080
No one's using the car.

822
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,480
We obviously didn't think of it.

823
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,560
We have no choice but to keep going.

824
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,400
Are you not going to help Nut?

825
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,360
Imagine what a hero you would be

826
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,720
if you found the teddy bear.

827
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,720
As soon as I mention a man, she's off.

828
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,960
Stop the truck.

829
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,520
Mister.

830
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,840
Nut.

831
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,840
-Nut. -Mister.

832
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,040
Mister.

833
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,600
Mister.

834
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,840
Gen, I see the garbage truck.

835
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,280
I see it.

836
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,560
Stop. Wait.

837
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,880
Wait.

838
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,760
Wait.

839
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,920
-Shit. -Gen.

840
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,440
Gen, are you okay?

841
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,120
Do you have any broken bones?

842
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,400
Is the biker hurt?

843
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,520
-Let me check on him. -My glasses.

844
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,720
Where are my glasses?

845
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,920
Hey, are you okay?

846
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
He's handsome.

847
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,960
I mean,

848
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,120
are you okay?

849
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,760
I'm fine.

850
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,160
-It's nothing. -Oh, no.

851
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,680
You're bleeding. Do you want to go to a hospital?

852
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,560
I'm really fine.

853
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,040
You spilled all your drinks.

854
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,520
I can buy new ones. I'm just glad to be alive.

855
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,200
By the way,

856
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,080
is your boyfriend all right?

857
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,160
He seems old.

858
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,560
Old, my butt.

859
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,960
I'm only 27 years old.

860
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,360
And she isn't my girlfriend.

861
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,240
He looks younger than 18 years old though.

862
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,040
You are old compared to him.

863
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,520
If you're shouting at me, you must be fine.

864
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,160
I'm sorry for being careless.

865
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,840
Let me call my insurance.

866
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,360
We don't have time for that.

867
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,920
That's right.

868
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,680
How about this?

869
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,800
Save his number.

870
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,360
-Call him to sort out the damage later. -Sir, please stop.

871
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,360
Go straight.

872
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,120
Get on.

873
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,760
Gen, wait for me.

874
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,120
Nut.

875
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,880
Mister, have you seen a teddy bear?

876
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,160
Hold on.

877
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,080
There's one in the truck about this size. I don't know whose it is.

878
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,440
It's mine.

879
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,000
-Can I have it back? -You have to get it yourself.

880
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,560
Nut.

881
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,480
Where is it?

882
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,520
I saw it somewhere over there.

883
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Nut.

884
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,240
This isn't mine.

885
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,880
Never mind then.

886
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,560
Stop.

887
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,560
Nut.

888
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,440
Did you just search a garbage truck?

889
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,640
Tofu, get him down.

890
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,040
It's okay.

891
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,120
Let's go.

892
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,400
Nut.

893
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,680
Did you not find it?

894
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,200
We're sorry.

895
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,880
We couldn't catch the other truck.

896
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,440
Some brat almost hit me

897
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,160
with his bike.

898
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,600
Does the teddy bear mean so much to you?

899
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,560
It was a gift from someone special.

900
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,160
Maybe Kuenchai didn't take him to the trash.

901
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,399
We will help you look for it at home.

902
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:46,920
We will find it.

903
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,960
There are no thieves in this area.

904
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,680
-It can't just disappear. Am I right? -Yes.

905
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,479
I wish I could go back to being his favorite toy.

906
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,600
But I'm a human now.

907
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,960
I'm no longer something he holds dear.

908
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,240
Did you find the teddy bear?

909
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,279
No.

910
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,279
I'm going to take a shower

911
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,640
then head back to work.

912
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,320
Why do you look like that?

913
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,680
Did something happen?

914
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,160
We had a small accident.

915
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,160
Here's your medicine.

916
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,240
Thank you.

917
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,720
This sucks.

918
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,720
We're wasting time by being here.

919
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,360
It's all that brat's fault.

920
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,560
Are you mad at him for hurting you

921
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,560
or calling you old?

922
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,520
-Are you with him? -I didn't run.

923
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,480
I was the one who hit him.

924
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,800
That uncle looked fine though.

925
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:37,200
He gave me his number, but it's okay.

926
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,000
The insurance company will cover it.

927
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,600
You don't have to come.

928
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,680
It's just a scratch. It's not deadly.

929
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,880
Once I get my salary, I'll treat you to a meal.

930
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,320
Mr. Aneung Tanakul, please collect your medicine.

931
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,040
I have to go, Dad.

932
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,840
I need to get back to work after I pay the bill.

933
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,360
Mister.

934
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,840
Are you seeing a doctor?

935
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,240
What I do is my business.

936
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,360
Stay out of it.

937
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,720
And that

938
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,920
is your compensation.

939
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,520
It's okay.

940
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,160
I can pay for it myself.

941
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,520
Don't be arrogant.

942
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,440
Young people like you need money for things

943
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,160
and money to send to your family.

944
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,520
Just take it.

945
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,600
-Wait. -Listen.

946
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:41,280
It's his way of apologizing for causing the accident.

947
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,000
It's just how he talks.

948
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,440
I hope you get better soon.

949
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,720
-Wait. -Mister.

950
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,880
Your medicine.

951
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,200
Everyone has lost something before.

952
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,520
Nut has lost stuff many times.

953
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,280
He found some of it,

954
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,000
but not all.

955
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,240
But he has never been this way before.

956
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,760
I never thought

957
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,440
that me turning into a human

958
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,200
would cause Nut this much pain.

959
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,080
I don't want to cause him pain,

960
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,640
but there's nothing I can do.

961
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,560
Until now,

962
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,320
I still don't know how the miracle happened.

963
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,840
But that morning,

964
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,720
I remember

965
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,840
something strange happening to me.

966
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,680
After Nut left for work,

967
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,880
my friends and I woke up as usual.

968
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,160
That morning,

969
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,160
something weird happened.

970
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,480
Suddenly, I felt this electricity running through me.

971
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,880
I've never been electrocuted before.

972
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,280
But I imagine that the feeling must be similar to getting defibrillated

973
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,640
by doctors in movies.

974
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,120
The moment I got defibrillated, I started to hear a heartbeat.

975
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,520
I almost thought it was my heartbeat.

976
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,000
But then I saw Kuenchai.

977
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,920
Kuenchai is here.

978
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,360
Run now.

979
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,200
Put your legs up, Tofu.

980
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,240
I wish it was just a dream

981
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,480
or my imagination,

982
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,800
but it really happened.

983
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
-Tofu. -Kuenchai.

984
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,680
-Go away. -Run from Kuenchai.

985
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,800
-Tofu, come this way. -Be careful.

986
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,640
-Get on it, Tofu. Hurry. -Be careful.

987
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,600
You have to get on it, Tofu.

988
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,200
-Now, Tofu. Get on. -Step on me.

989
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,480
Kuenchai, go away.

990
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,160
-Bad dog. Don't do this. -Go away.

991
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,760
-Don't touch me. -Tofu, be careful.

992
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,640
Tofu.

993
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,200
-Tofu, be careful. -Kuenchai.

994
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,320
He's biting me.

995
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,520
-Stop it. -Tofu.

996
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,960
Go now, Tofu.

997
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,360
I really felt my heart beating.

998
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,520
Some might find it unfortunate.

999
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,760
But to me,

1000
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,360
it was a miracle.

1001
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,360
#SAVEFORESTWO

1002
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,160
Didn't he go?

1003
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,840
Hello.

1004
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,040
Yes, I'm his friend.

1005
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,840
What? What did you say?

1006
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,800
Tarn is at the hospital?

1007
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,040
I'M TAKING TODAY OFF, GEN

1008
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,920
OKAY

1009
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,440
Are you still watching footage of Tofu?

1010
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:53,960
I'm not watching him.

1011
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,520
I need to find out where my stuff went.

1012
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,000
Wait.

1013
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:05,920
Look at him.

1014
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,640
I can't believe he was naked in your house.

1015
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,520
His skin is so fair.

1016
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,640
This is why I don't trust him.

1017
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,360
People don't walk naked into someone's house.

1018
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,320
Wait.

1019
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,800
Not only was he naked,

1020
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,840
but he was also talking to himself.

1021
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,240
Was he talking to a ghost?

1022
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,640
Seriously?

1023
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,720
How superstitious are you?

1024
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,560
Is it possible that he had lost his memory before the accident?

1025
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,960
I don't know.

1026
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,840
But I'm sure he's at my house for a reason.

1027
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,040
He was up to something.

1028
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,440
You think he was naked and stole a teddy bear?

1029
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,640
What kind of person would steal a teddy bear

1030
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,320
while naked?

1031
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,480
Hey.

1032
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,280
The footage doesn't show your teddy bear

1033
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,840
falling off the balcony with him.

1034
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,160
Why don't you just ask him

1035
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,360
about the teddy bear?

1036
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,120
I wouldn't be looking at footage

1037
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,600
if he had an answer for me.

1038
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,280
You're right.

1039
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,520
Come on. I'll help you look.

1040
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,480
The truth is

1041
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,000
he looks familiar to me.

1042
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,600
Like I've seen him somewhere.

1043
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,440
ADD FRIEND

1044
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,760
Hey.

1045
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,720
Hey, are you okay?

1046
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,120
Hey.

1047
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,360
Hey.

1048
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,320
Nut.

1049
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,800
Neung.

1050
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,000
Nut.

1051
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,840
Why didn't you knock?

1052
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,200
I have to knock first?

1053
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,320
What are you looking at?

1054
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,800
I'm looking at you.

1055
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,640
Stop it.

1056
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,120
Why are you here?

1057
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,080
I'm here to sleep.

1058
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,720
Wait, Tofu.

1059
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,080
Tofu, come here.

1060
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,520
Nut.

1061
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,840
Who said you could stay here?

1062
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,920
I've slept here before.

1063
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,920
When?

1064
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,960
I…

1065
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,600
Well…

1066
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,880
I slept here on the day I carried you upstairs.

1067
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,800
I was here all night.

1068
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,360
You even said you were hot.

1069
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,560
So I took off your…

1070
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,480
Stop it.

1071
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,800
Don't say another word.

1072
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,560
I don't care what happened,

1073
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,520
but you can't sleep here tonight.

1074
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,800
-Get out. -Nut.

1075
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,160
-Nut. -Get up.

1076
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,160
-Nut. -Get up.

1077
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,680
-Tofu, get up. -I'm sleeping.

1078
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,040
Will you leave willingly or do I need to beat you up first?

1079
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,520
-Nut. -Get out.

1080
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,360
-Go. -Nut, but…

1081
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,080
This is your room.

1082
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,720
Stay away from mine.

1083
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,280
Nut.

1084
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,600
Get inside.

1085
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,320
Hello.

1086
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,720
Is anyone here?

1087
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,760
My name is Tofu.

1088
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,760
Hello, Ms. Fox.

1089
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,800
Do I have to sleep here alone tonight?

1090
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:37,160
NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED…

1091
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,160
Hey.

1092
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,200
Hey, are you okay?

1093
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,560
WHETHER IT ENDED WITH A SMILE

1094
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:16,800
OR TEARS…

1095
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,880
SOME MEMORIES

1096
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:26,040
CANNOT ERASE YOUR FEELINGS

1097
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,760
Hey, don't sit on me

1098
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,520
or I have to remain stiff just for you.

1099
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,960
What are you complaining about? Justice is nothing but discourse.

1100
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,960
Calm down, Honey.

1101
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,440
You shouldn't fight.

1102
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,160
Tofu is stressed out right now.

1103
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,040
A monk once said

1104
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,280
"smart people

1105
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,840
turn misfortune into opportunities

1106
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,720
while careless people turn opportunities into misfortune."

1107
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,560
Sathu to that.

1108
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,040
I forgot to introduce you.

1109
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,960
These are my new friends downstairs.

1110
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,280
First, there's Ms. Sofa.

1111
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,320
She's a true fashionista.

1112
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,000
She often uses English words,

1113
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,400
but somehow, we all seem to understand her.

1114
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,920
And that is Mr. Right Slipper.

1115
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,760
He's a hot-headed

1116
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,800
and progressive guy who is fully devoted to idealism.

1117
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,120
Ms. Sofa doesn't seem to like him much.

1118
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,640
They argue about everything.

1119
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,720
His girlfriend, Ms. Left Slipper,

1120
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,480
always has to calm things down.

1121
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,200
And that

1122
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,000
is Mr. Rocking Chair.

1123
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,520
Nut's mom falls asleep on him waiting for Nut every night.

1124
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,200
And that's her phone.

1125
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,760
She always leaves her phone downstairs.

1126
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,480
I got to know everyone

1127
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,640
on the day I fell off the balcony.

1128
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,120
Fine, since Tofu is so stressed out right now,

1129
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,280
I'll let him sit on me.

1130
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,160
Sit down, Beary.

1131
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,000
It's okay.

1132
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,880
I can just sit here.

1133
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,240
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1134
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,240
But I have no one to turn to.

1135
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,320
How can I help you?

1136
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,120
Now that I'm a human,

1137
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,160
I can talk to Nut,

1138
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,000
touch his hands,

1139
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,280
and even hug him.

1140
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,360
-Wow. -Oh, my god.

1141
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,960
-They can hold hands. -How exciting.

1142
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,600
-They can hug too. -Oh, my…

1143
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,320
-Oh, my goodness. -It's just a hug.

1144
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,800
-I'm so happy for you. -It's not a big deal.

1145
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,520
But…

1146
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,520
I can't go inside his room.

1147
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,840
It sucks being a human.

1148
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,160
Should I find a way to turn back?

1149
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,240
A lowly toy like you is full of nonsense.

1150
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,000
How can you turn back into a bear

1151
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,400
when you don't even know how you became a human?

1152
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,800
What woke us up then?

1153
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,040
When we woke up, we were already in this average human's house.

1154
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,960
Did we wake up

1155
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,240
because we were brought into the house?

1156
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,920
Not every piece of furniture is awake though,

1157
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,600
Teddy.

1158
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,120
You are right.

1159
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,240
No furniture in the guest room

1160
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,480
is awake at all.

1161
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,400
Something must have woken us up.

1162
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,200
Something important.

1163
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,720
Does the teddy bear mean so much to you?

1164
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,760
It was a gift from someone special.

1165
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,920
Neung.

1166
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,440
Neung.

1167
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,200
Neung.

1168
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:22,760
-Who's that? -Neung?

1169
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,800
-Neung. -Who's "Neung".

1170
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,160
-Who's that? -Who is he?

1171
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,400
-Neung? -Who are you talking about?

1172
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,720
Nut has mentioned Neung's name twice.

1173
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,280
If the fact that being brought inside the house didn't wake us up,

1174
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,200
the reason could be about two people.

1175
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,440
Maybe I have something to do with this Neung guy.

1176
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,720
Neung?

1177
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,360
-Who is he? -Neung?

1178
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,200
-Who is he? -I want to know.

1179
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,680
-What's the answer. -Who is he?

1180
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,040
-Analyzing again. -How are you related to him?

1181
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,080
-I don't understand. -Who's Neung?

1182
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,880
What the…

1183
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,080
Nut.

1184
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,240
Why aren't you dressed?

1185
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,160
Clothes make me itch.

1186
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,240
I don't care. You have to keep them on.

1187
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,680
You're not dressed either.

1188
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,240
How did you come inside? Didn't I lock the door?

1189
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,080
You locked the door,

1190
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,040
but not the balcony.

1191
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,480
You try too hard.

1192
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,000
I do. Humans should be ambitious.

1193
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,440
I'm insulting you right now.

1194
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,960
You aren't allowed to come in here through any entrance.

1195
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,200
I'll count to three.

1196
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,320
-But Nut… -One.

1197
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,280
-Two. -Nut.

1198
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,160
-You didn't count until three. -I can't wait that long.

1199
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,480
Shall I kick you again?

1200
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,520
One.

1201
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,920
-I'm leaving. -Two.

1202
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:19,880
Nut.

1203
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,680
Can I leave through the door?

1204
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,040
-One. -Nut.

1205
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,160
Two.

1206
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,000
He may have told me off,

1207
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,160
but I got to sleep with Nut last night.

1208
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,640
I wonder if Na knows how far

1209
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,480
her son and the caretaker have gone.

1210
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,840
Please stop your madness!

1211
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,720
I'm embarrassed!

1212
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,480
If you want to stay in this house,

1213
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,120
-I don't-- -I'll take good care of you and your mom.

1214
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,680
You'll leave once your memory is back.

1215
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,160
You might not even remember me then,

1216
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,000
since I'm not that important.

1217
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,800
Do you think high school love is all pure?

1218
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,560
I'm sure you've read my synopsis.

1219
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,160
Don't get on my nerves, Biker Boy.

1220
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,400
-Myself and-- -Nut.

1221
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,160
Neung!

1222
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:25,200
