4
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,411
Come on. We’re almost there.

5
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,617
Have you ever wished to climb the Himalayas

6
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,420
only to share the breathtaking view with someone?

7
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:43,663
Are we close, Uncle?

8
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:45,144
We’re nearly there.

9
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:53,614
Sorry, my car broke down. So we need to walk.

10
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,671
We’re almost there.

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,000
You said that 20 minutes ago.

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,130
(That was what I wanted to do.)

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,846
(But without knowing it, the one next to me was gone.)

14
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:05,973
Where are my friends?

15
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,014
Right here.

16
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,720
Why are they crowing?

17
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,646
This hill is freaking steep.

18
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,125
Why is your dad doing this to us?

19
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,940
I think we should head back.

20
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:20,254
You still want to walk?

21
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,298
You out of your mind?

22
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,402
It’d be dark until we get down there.

23
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:25,865
What if there’s a bear?

24
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,840
There’s no bear on this mountain.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,319
There’s no bear here. There’re only pigs.

26
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:32,377
What kind of pig?

27
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:33,672
Those that give us Kurobuta?

28
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:34,762
Wild boars.

29
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:37,420
They attacked the villagers the other day, spilling out their guts.

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,163
Shit!

31
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:41,389
Fah, call your dad.

32
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,445
Tell him to send someone to take us home.

33
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:46,624
If I could really do that, we wouldn’t be here, would we?

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,153
Come on. Let’s go.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,283
Help me up.

36
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,290
Come on.

37
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,149
Hey! Slowly.

38
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:01,395
After that, any mountains were the same to me.

39
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,162
Without someone walking alongside me,

40
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:06,541
I didn’t see the point of climbing mountains anymore.

41
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:11,760
Big bro, where are you from?

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,419
You are so handsome.

43
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,457
Come here. Look!

44
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,053
Mister, are you an actor?

45
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,194
Children, don’t bother him.

46
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,372
Back off a little.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,591
But then I realized that maybe…

48
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:41,308
we climb a mountain just to meet someone waiting for us up there.

49
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,368
Come on, children.

50
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,432
Let’s get back inside.

51
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:09,988
Fah.

52
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,138
What are you dreaming about?

53
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:12,991
Keep walking.

54
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,493
People from Bangkok might find it hard to live here.

55
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,790
We don’t have electricity.

56
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:23,753
We only have solar power that barely works.

57
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,127
The phone reception is very poor as well.

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,255
Poor phone reception?

59
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:28,949
Yes.

60
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,500
That’s another necessity of life.

61
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:37,107
Then what do you have up here?

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,180
This.

63
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,723
Do you want some?

64
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,170
Very tempting but

65
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,466
no thanks.

66
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,099
Uncle,

67
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,683
we traveled all the way to Chiang Mai's hilltop

68
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,306
in the hopes of finding a nice BBQ and a great view.

69
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,800
What do you even have here?

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,686
Karaoke?

71
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:55,566
And Bingsoo?

72
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,059
Bingsoo, seriously?

73
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,151
Let’s just go.

74
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,000
He’s done with you two.

75
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:01,949
Uncle.

76
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:09,937
What are we doing here?

77
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,280
This is Dr. Fah’s accommodation.

78
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:15,120
You two share a house.

79
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,927
What?

80
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:19,200
Why does he get a private house?

81
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,544
Right.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,040
Tell me how much he paid you.

83
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:26,129
I’ll give you more.

84
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,062
Uncle, can we have another private house?

85
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,147
You guys

86
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,862
stop bothering him.

87
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,471
I happen to be so handsome.

88
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,134
That’s why I get a VIP house.

89
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,720
Wait a minute.

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,797
That’s your reason? Handsome?

91
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,878
Being handsome gets you a house?

92
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:42,738
I’m a doctor. That’s why.

93
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:43,933
That’s all.

94
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,441
So?

95
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,405
What about us?

96
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,157
No.

97
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:50,963
I meant I’m a doctor. I need to work and rest.

98
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:51,849
What?

99
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:52,789
And I don’t need to rest?

100
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:53,914
I don’t need to work?

101
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:56,021
You two can share a house.

102
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,568
I don’t want to share a house with him. He snores.

103
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,635
- You snore too.
- You’re louder.

104
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:03,022
Let’s go, Uncle.

105
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,153
No one has lived in this house for a long time.

106
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:13,088
You need to clean it a bit.

107
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,000
Wow! VIP indeed.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
The house that comes with cobwebs.

109
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:21,952
Awesome!

110
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,655
A luxurious house in the heart of the mountains.

111
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:26,888
You wake up to a sea of mist and the unpaved road.

112
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:27,797
Wow!

113
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,826
A great location you can’t find anywhere.

114
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,125
Good luck. You’ll love it here.

115
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,413
I didn’t think it’d be this bad.

116
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,443
Uncle, where is our house?

117
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,450
That way.

118
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,565
Please give us a nice one.

119
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,353
Sure.

120
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
Hold on.

121
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,281
Keep me company.

122
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,634
Wasn’t it you who wanted to be alone?

123
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:47,711
The VIP man.

124
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,711
Help me clean up, at least.

125
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:53,605
I won’t dare step into a doctor’s house.

126
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:54,789
We don’t want to bother.

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,749
You have it all to yourself. It’s a house for one.

128
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:57,989
See you.

129
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,167
Hang in there, man.

130
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,582
Clean up nicely, VIP man.

131
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,255
So many yantra amulets.

132
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:22,083
Why are there so many yantra amulets?

133
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:47,960
Children.

134
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,920
Guys, I’m here.

135
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:52,750
Wanna play games?

136
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,496
Let’s go.

137
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:59,920
Wee-ah, it’s my turn. You sweep the floor.

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,688
Two more games.

139
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,360
Teacher Prince is coming.

140
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:14,800
Shh!

141
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,043
Where are the children?

142
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,356
So you speak the central dialect too?

143
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,400
I asked you where the children were.

144
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:26,354
Children?

145
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,119
What children?

146
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,760
It’s just me here.

147
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,816
Tell me why you’re skipping class.

148
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:44,567
This man threatened to hit us if we didn’t help him clean up.

149
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,341
What?

150
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,964
Who threatened you?

151
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:51,080
We will talk again in school.

152
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:54,630
I’ll see you guys there in one minute.

153
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:56,405
Go.

154
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,720
As for you,

155
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,679
did you really threaten them?

156
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,478
I didn’t.

157
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,851
I just asked them to help me clean up in exchange for some mobile games.

158
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,640
Didn’t you know they had class?

159
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,102
How would I know that?

160
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,669
I just got here.

161
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,298
Next time, stay clear of my students.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,433
You’re a volunteer doctor, you should know…

163
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:36,318
Hey!

164
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,280
It’s rude not to give eye contact during a conversation.

165
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:44,444
But on your head,

166
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,680
there’s a spider.

167
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,133
Come on.

168
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:29,571
If you’re scared, why didn’t you say anything?

169
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:30,960
Why acted cool?

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,830
None of your business.

171
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,447
Don't mess with my students again.

172
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,000
I’m warning you.

173
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,570
Time for me to go.

174
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,981
You got all the essential medicines?

175
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:00,658
I do.

176
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,589
And the food in the fridge,

177
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,842
do you have enough?

178
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,202
I do.

179
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,539
Hold on.

180
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,848
I should be the one checking on you.

181
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,893
Make sure you have everything. You’re about to hit the road.

182
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,641
Well, I’m worried about you.

183
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,280
Don’t worry about me.

184
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:23,258
I have Khabkluen to take care of me here.

185
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:28,123
I’m worried because you’re with him.

186
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,595
While I’m away,

187
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,639
take good care of my brother.

188
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:39,200
Don’t do anything bad to him.

189
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:43,084
What do you consider bad?

190
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:46,160
You know what I mean.

191
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,400
Is holding hands allowed?

192
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,760
It is.

193
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,720
And kissing on the cheek?

194
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:00,978
Twice a day is fine.

195
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:08,978
I’ve reached my quota.

196
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,640
Kissing on the lips?

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,217
Kiss my foot!

198
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:17,040
I’m being nice to you and now you want to cross me?

199
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:18,955
I’m kidding.

200
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:21,664
I promise to take very good care of Dao.

201
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:23,076
I will do anything bad.

202
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:28,520
I will not do anything bad.

203
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:30,626
Okay.

204
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,000
Don’t worry about me. Worry about yourself.

205
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:36,595
Take good care of yourself while you’re there.

206
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:41,368
Consider it your personal time.

207
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,190
Yeah.

208
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,240
Take care.

209
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Have a safe trip, Fah.

210
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:03,543
Dao,

211
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,360
can I go beyond my quota?

212
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,019
No.

213
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,010
Why not?

214
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:15,978
You’ve met all your quota for today.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,171
But…

216
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,440
I haven’t.

217
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:28,421
Come on.

218
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:30,560
There’s still some quota left.

219
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:36,965
Hey.

220
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:38,931
What are you daydreaming about?

221
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,937
Thinking of girls in Bangkok?

222
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,000
Like I have any.

223
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,966
I haven’t yelled at you for ditching me yet.

224
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,835
We didn’t ditch you.

225
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,059
We just went with the flow.

226
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,325
Yeah. Whatever.

227
00:13:50,508 --> 00:13:52,747
I’m done with your excuses.

228
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I’m hungry. Let’s find something to eat.

229
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,175
Perfect timing.

230
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,571
The village chief invited us for dinner at his house.

231
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,481
Let’s go.

232
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,640
I told you to wash your face.

233
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,544
You’re just 25 and already a doctor?
[VILLAGE CHIEF OFFICE]

234
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,302
He’s a genius.

235
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,280
He got a high school equivalency certificate at 16.

236
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,843
Took a test for med school after that.

237
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:16,562
And he got accepted.

238
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:18,052
You’re great.

239
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,720
I bet many hospitals fight over you.

240
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,279
Fight over him?

241
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:25,243
All he does is drink in a bar.

242
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:26,308
Stop talking already.

243
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,036
You may call him a bad doctor.

244
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,111
Hello.

245
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:32,773
Hi.

246
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:33,680
Have a seat.

247
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:34,925
Sit here.

248
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:40,506
Your son?

249
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,673
No, he’s not.

250
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,769
This is Teacher Prince, the other volunteer teacher here.

251
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,313
I invited him over since you all need to work together.

252
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,020
So you’re a volunteer teacher?

253
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,100
I’m a volunteer teacher too.

254
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,578
My name is Mesa. Nice to meet you.

255
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,509
Of course. I’m Prince.

256
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,256
Mesa, a person’s name, not a month (April).

257
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,339
I’m JJ.

258
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,598
A Maintenance Officer.

259
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,789
What a nice title.

260
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
All you will do is fix houses and paint.

261
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:15,594
Asshole.

262
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,583
Sorry.

263
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:20,560
And this foul-mouthed man is Kuafah.

264
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,083
He’s a …

265
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,353
A burden, isn’t he?

266
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,429
You two have met?

267
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:32,610
We met while I was cleaning up the house.

268
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:34,093
Never mind.

269
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,521
Long story.

270
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,297
Let’s eat.

271
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,635
All right. We should eat now.

272
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,554
Make yourself at home.

273
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:42,813
Can you please pass me those plates?

274
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:46,581
Let me help.

275
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,220
I’m helping.

276
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:54,000
Please enjoy. Eat as much as you want.

277
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,482
Mom made extra food for the guests.

278
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,528
Put them right here.

279
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,423
This is Yayah, my daughter.

280
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:42,250
Wow.

281
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,670
How pretty.

282
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,198
Are all northern girls this pretty?

283
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,121
I’m flattered.

284
00:16:58,593 --> 00:16:59,471
Doctor,

285
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:01,995
you don’t like the food?

286
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:06,155
I do but…

287
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,393
The food here is quite spicy.

288
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,877
Spicy food isn’t my thing.

289
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,000
My friend is a picky eater.

290
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,151
One thing he isn’t picky about is girls.

291
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:17,760
Shut up.

292
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,615
Make yourself at home.

293
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,734
I’m going to use the restroom.

294
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:32,144
She’s so pretty.

295
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,120
Tell her, not me.

296
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:45,313
Is it true that you’re not picky about girls?

297
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,847
True or not…

298
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:54,211
depends on who is asking.

299
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,745
What if Yayah is asking?

300
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,072
Will I get the chance?

301
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,017
Yayah.

302
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,876
Come on. I’m kidding.

303
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:09,549
Don’t tell my dad, Teacher Prince.

304
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:13,497
Would you excuse me?

305
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,147
What’s so funny?

306
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:19,221
She’s faster than wifi.

307
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,558
You again!

308
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,650
As always.

309
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,400
Get home safe.

310
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,724
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

311
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,356
Village Chief,

312
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:49,440
this batch of volunteers is weird somehow.

313
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,395
How weird?

314
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,605
They don’t seem voluntary.

315
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,469
As if they’re forced to be here.

316
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,141
I don’t want to say much but

317
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,163
since you’ve mentioned it, I’ll tell you the truth.

318
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:14,000
Those three are sent to do their community service.

319
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,817
Community service?

320
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:16,742
Yes.

321
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:20,423
I heard they’re high society people.

322
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:22,662
They must have driven when drunk.

323
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:25,716
That’s why they’re doing the community service here.

324
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,696
Can they be trusted then?

325
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:33,940
That’s my concern too.

326
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,171
But I couldn't do anything.

327
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,218
The order was quite hard to turn down.

328
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,600
I’ll keep an eye on them for you.

329
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:51,236
If they do anything distrustful, I’ll chase them away.

330
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:52,657
Of course.

331
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,469
Is Dr. Fah here?

332
00:19:56,469 --> 00:19:58,285
Shit! We’re late.

333
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,848
- Wait.
- Hey!

334
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:01,527
This is it.

335
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:05,080
This is a shelf for generic drugs.

336
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,573
Watch out!

337
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,274
Hey, Fah.

338
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,139
We just departed.

339
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,508
You miss us already?

340
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:47,658
Mesa,

341
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:49,763
can I borrow your phone?

342
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,718
Phone?

343
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,446
Why borrowing me? You have one.

344
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:55,221
I have no reception.

345
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,507
I saw you got reception at some places.

346
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:59,783
Yes, some places.

347
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,113
But not here.

348
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,409
I walked around the village.

349
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:04,864
No reception anywhere.

350
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,464
What?

351
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,024
They don’t even get phone reception here.

352
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:10,968
Is there any decent thing here at all?

353
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,390
Exactly.

354
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,562
The weather is freezing.

355
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,174
The food is spicy.

356
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,759
And lots of mosquitoes at night.

357
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,459
Mesa.

358
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:24,996
Yeah?

359
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,325
Don’t you have anything to complain about?

360
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,076
No.

361
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:31,699
I adjust easily.

362
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,880
Adjust easily?

363
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:34,930
Yeah?

364
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:36,826
What are you chewing?

365
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:39,102
Don’t tell me…

366
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,887
- Give it here.
- Mesa!

367
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,522
Whoa!

368
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:45,454
Mesa!

369
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,477
I knew it.

370
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:50,118
I saw you got your backpack full.

371
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,575
Easily adjust, my ass!

372
00:21:53,872 --> 00:21:56,152
Hey. Don’t.

373
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:00,919
Now that we saw them.

374
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:02,900
You’ve got snacks.

375
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:04,446
Good.

376
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,160
Because I’ve brought…

377
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,476
some alcohol too.

378
00:22:11,476 --> 00:22:12,241
What?

379
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,468
Let’s drink and enjoy the snacks.

380
00:22:16,157 --> 00:22:17,445
Let’s do it.

381
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,375
Let’s start.

382
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:23,785
Hi. I’m Prince.

383
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:25,505
Is Dr. Fah here?

384
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,720
I need to take him to the health center.

385
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:32,801
Is anybody here?

386
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,668
Shit! It’s late.

387
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:36,139
Hey! Teacher Prince is here.

388
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:38,452
Hey, wake up.

389
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:39,289
Dang!

390
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,160
He can’t see us like this.

391
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,649
Let’s move. What are you hanging around for?

392
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:44,742
Wait.

393
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:46,386
Hey.

394
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,326
Hi.

395
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,149
What are you doing here?

396
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,580
What time do you think it is?

397
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:00,986
I have no idea.

398
00:23:01,072 --> 00:23:01,921
You tell me.

399
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:03,553
There’s no clock here.

400
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,885
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

401
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,486
Can you wait till I get changed first?

402
00:23:17,555 --> 00:23:18,908
Next time, get up earlier.

403
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,817
I was nice enough to let you stop by your house.

404
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:23,049
Hurry up. I have a class to get to.

405
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:23,695
Wait.

406
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:25,970
Hold this.

407
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:28,358
Come on.

408
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:30,816
This too.

409
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:43,017
It smells like alcohol.

410
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,321
I’m sorry.

411
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:47,009
My friends spilled the drink on me.

412
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,906
Please hold on to that for now.

413
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:02,167
Don’t you have anything better to do than being my navigator?

414
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,458
As someone who lived here first,

415
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,649
I should guide a noob like you around.

416
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:09,562
Walk faster.

417
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,153
I must get to class on time.

418
00:24:13,213 --> 00:24:14,868
How old does he think he is?

419
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,049
Acting like he’s been here for 10 years.

420
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,010
I heard that.

421
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,963
Hurry!

422
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:20,440
Yes, sir.

423
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:27,649
HEALTH CENTER

424
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:30,822
It’s here.

425
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:45,973
That’s the check-up spot.

426
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,529
Anything else you need,

427
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:50,334
you can find them inside.

428
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,135
This is a shelf for generic drugs.

429
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:05,190
These cupboards are miscellaneous storage.

430
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,271
Hey, watch out!

431
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,709
That was close.

432
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:45,386
Who on earth stored things like that?

433
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:46,902
I guess…

434
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,747
the previous volunteer doctors.

435
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:51,616
They weren’t careful enough.

436
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:57,375
You do better then.

437
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,630
MEDICAL STORAGE ROOM

438
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,036
So that’s it.

439
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,434
Most of the supplies you need are here.

440
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:18,549
If you need anything else,

441
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,532
inform the village chief.

442
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:27,736
Why are you staring at me?

443
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,489
You said I didn’t give eye contact yesterday.

444
00:26:32,532 --> 00:26:33,734
I am now.

445
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,183
If we’re all set here, I’ll head to the school now.

446
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:53,545
Thank you.

447
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,445
These medicines have expired.

448
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:19,358
This is no good.

449
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,482
Nothing here can be used.

450
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:25,966
Is this a health center or a haunted house?

451
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,889
Doctor, I need help!

452
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:29,546
Doctor!

453
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,890
I carried heavy items.

454
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,921
My arms are sore.

455
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,413
I have a stomachache.

456
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:35,482
Stomachache!

457
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:36,120
Here.

458
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,841
I think I have food poisoning.

459
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:41,025
Let’s get you checked up.

460
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,555
Are you mad?

461
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:46,076
What is this? What are you playing at?

462
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:46,923
Why?

463
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:48,289
Wasn’t it smooth?

464
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,786
Our acting was great.

465
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,835
I told you your plan wouldn’t work.

466
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:53,652
Honestly,

467
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:55,489
we’re slacking off.

468
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,827
Slacking off?

469
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:57,522
Yeah.

470
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,769
They made us work so hard.

471
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:04,889
I was told to dig a water well, fix the roof, and mow the lawn.

472
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:10,529
And me, I was a tiger back in Bangkok.

473
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,209
Now I feel like I’m a puppy.

474
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,845
Those children picked on me.

475
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:15,911
They’re monkeys.

476
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,607
I have no idea how Teacher Prince can get them to behave.

477
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,598
It’s good you got work to do.

478
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:22,819
Look at me.

479
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:24,565
No one has come here.

480
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:26,529
It’s been eight hours now.

481
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,520
Ever since we started working up until now,

482
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:32,689
it’s only been three hours, man.

483
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,530
Three hours?

484
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,758
I felt like it was forever.

485
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,078
That’s right.

486
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:43,544
Time goes by slowly when we are tortured.

487
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,174
I miss Facebook

488
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,009
Instagram.

489
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:48,158
I miss my bed.

490
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,249
I miss everything.

491
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:52,510
- Dr. Fah.
- Yes.

492
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,124
I’m going down to the city.

493
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:55,151
Do you need anything?

494
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,174
Sure.

495
00:28:56,174 --> 00:28:58,558
May I go with you? I will go buy some food.

496
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:00,409
Hey!

497
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:01,271
Who is going to take charge here?

498
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:05,418
The thing is Dr. Fah is in charge here.

499
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:07,769
And he has two dear friends.

500
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,529
That’s you two!

501
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,294
Clean it up nicely for me.

502
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,022
Beloved friends.

503
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:14,381
He loves us all of a sudden.

504
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,901
All of a sudden!

505
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:21,618
Doctor,

506
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:23,729
she fell and got a scratch on her knee.

507
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:24,815
So I…

508
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,127
Sompor, can you wait here?

509
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:36,185
Yes.

510
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:43,813
Mister.

511
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:45,371
Hey.

512
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:47,593
Are you okay?

513
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:54,254
Where is Dr. Kuafah?

514
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:56,372
Kuafah?

515
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:58,254
He…

516
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,015
went…

517
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:01,701
Went where?

518
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,273
He had an errand to run nearby.

519
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:04,918
He’ll be back soon.

520
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:06,568
Just wait for a little more.

521
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:07,462
Sure.

522
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:10,249
Why is Kuafah taking so long to get food?

523
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:12,718
Will he bring us snacks too?

524
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,631
So an errand he’s running

525
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:23,018
is buying food?

526
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,166
Maybe something else too.

527
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,169
Everyone, I’m back.

528
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:42,979
We have both rubbing alcohol and alcoholic beverages.

529
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:45,523
If you came up here just to change a place to drink,

530
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:46,765
you better go back.

531
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,655
My friend isn’t here just to change a place to drink as you said.

532
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,196
He had other reasons.

533
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,584
Does it hurt, good girl?

534
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,871
Everyone, I’m back.

535
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:22,804
We have both rubbing alcohol and alcoholic beverages.

536
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:26,708
Wow!

537
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,140
Don’t get so excited.

538
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:32,277
Hey.

539
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:39,877
She’s got a scratch?

540
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:40,847
Let me see.

541
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:42,042
Don’t.

542
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:43,846
I took care of it.

543
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:46,667
Hey,

544
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:48,277
I can explain.

545
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:49,983
I went down there to…

546
00:31:52,396 --> 00:31:54,984
If you came up here just to change a place to drink,

547
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:56,617
you better go back.

548
00:31:57,335 --> 00:32:00,341
You should at least respect the uniform you’re wearing.

549
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:08,267
I get it.

550
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:09,815
I’m leaving.

551
00:32:15,312 --> 00:32:16,969
Should we go too?

552
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:20,135
Are you waiting for him to splash the alcohol in your face?

553
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:20,718
Leave now.

554
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:33,093
Get home safe, everyone.

555
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,596
Thank you, Teacher.

556
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:55,540
Teacher Prince.

557
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,901
How is the girl with the scratched knee doing?

558
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:02,468
She’s a lot better now.

559
00:33:03,643 --> 00:33:04,583
Actually,

560
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:06,304
you’re older than me.

561
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,973
Don’t need to address me so politely.

562
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,364
What should I call you then?

563
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:17,060
Teacher…

564
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:20,361
I see that you don’t call Kuafah Phi either.

565
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:23,380
So I wasn’t sure how to talk to you.

566
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:28,210
‘Phi’ is only for those I respect.

567
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,492
I’m sorry about him.

568
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:35,812
I know this might not help

569
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,304
but he’s being like that because he’s heartbroken.

570
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,436
That’s why he acts like a jerk sometimes.

571
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,745
He wasn’t like this before.

572
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:48,305
How was he then?

573
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:55,285
He used to be a workaholic.

574
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,739
So hard-working.

575
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,018
But because all he did was work,

576
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,223
he got dumped without warning by his girlfriend of 7 years.

577
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:13,752
After his heartbreak recovery, he was back again.

578
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:16,340
He pretended to forget his past.

579
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,964
He became a drinker, a player who wasn’t serious with anyone just to torture himself.

580
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:24,362
At one point, I thought he had moved on.

581
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,991
He even insisted on going to his ex’s wedding.

582
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:30,659
You know how it turned out?

583
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:31,467
Bad.

584
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,702
JJ and I drank with him a lot.

585
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:40,700
Without knowing it, we were in a car he was driving.

586
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,442
We would have got to the condo safely

587
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,540
if that car hadn’t cut him off.

588
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,717
Kuafah’s car hit the side of the road.

589
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:57,792
Luckily, no one was injured.

590
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:00,021
The police had him tested for alcohol.

591
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,780
As punishment, the court ordered that we all do community service.

592
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:08,622
Actually, his dad could help soften the sentence.

593
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:11,018
But he wanted to teach him a lesson.

594
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,555
And that’s why we are here.

595
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,319
It’s true we’re here because we did something bad.

596
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:24,061
But my friend isn’t here just to change a place to drink as you said.

597
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:27,753
He went out because he had other reasons.

598
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,997
Does it hurt, good girl?

599
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:46,526
- No. It doesn’t hurt at all.
- Actually, he didn’t go out to buy drinks.

600
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,133
He went to buy more medicines and supplies for the health center.

601
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,364
I’m going to apply a plaster now.

602
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:56,122
I got you a piggy plaster here. You like it?

603
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,191
Really?

604
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,041
Supplies at the health center are too old.

605
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:02,244
Some medicines have expired.

606
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:09,540
Dr. Fah is sorry for coming back so late.

607
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,219
Will you forgive me?

608
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:12,428
I will.

609
00:36:13,028 --> 00:36:14,522
But he also came back with liquor.

610
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,277
That’s why it looked quite bad.

611
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:33,779
Hi,

612
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:35,042
Teacher.

613
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,856
Can I borrow your phone?

614
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,178
I will try to call home.

615
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:49,178
In case they can find me a new volunteer location.

616
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,081
Your dad said if you couldn’t handle it,

617
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:54,703
you could come back to Bangkok.

618
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,057
So…

619
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:57,823
When are you leaving?

620
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,347
Tomorrow morning.

621
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,121
Did you talk to Prince last night?

622
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:02,433
Why?

623
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,580
Follow us and you’ll see.

624
00:37:04,037 --> 00:37:04,911
What is happening here?

625
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:36,674
So…

626
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:40,752
Do you

627
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:42,717
have anything to say?

628
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,588
Your bag.

629
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:53,905
A prince crown bag.

630
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:55,868
Did you make it yourself?

631
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,382
The children made it for me in art class.

632
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,365
I taught them what Prince meant.

633
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,707
And they made me this.

634
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:07,894
Cute.

635
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:09,176
Right?

636
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,136
I fell for it the moment I saw it.

637
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:12,715
I meant you.

638
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:17,228
You must be very cute in their eyes. That’s why they made it for you.

639
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,171
What are you saying?

640
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:23,933
Here. Take it.

641
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:30,827
A dinner box.

642
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:35,378
I made it.

643
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,786
It might not be as good as the food in Bangkok.

644
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:40,315
But it’s not spicy. I think you can handle it.

645
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,258
Thank you.

646
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,671
Such a nice farewell dinner.

647
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:53,042
So…

648
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,595
When are you leaving?

649
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,196
Tomorrow morning.

650
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,334
Don’t need to shoo me away now.

651
00:39:04,595 --> 00:39:06,172
I won’t bother you for long.

652
00:39:09,455 --> 00:39:10,251
Well then.

653
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:15,429
May I get inside?

654
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:26,044
Thank you.

655
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:41,840
Mesa, can I borrow your phone?

656
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,584
When will you leave my phone alone?

657
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:49,394
I told you there’s no phone reception.

658
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:50,718
Why do you still want it?

659
00:39:50,718 --> 00:39:51,636
Whatever.

660
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,241
I will try to call home.

661
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:55,315
In case they can find me a new volunteer location.

662
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,732
What?

663
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,276
I told Teacher Prince you went to the city to buy medicines.

664
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:09,966
He hasn’t forgiven you?

665
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:12,475
I guess he has.

666
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:14,137
But what am I supposed to do?

667
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:20,235
You want me to tell him, “Oh! I changed my mind.”

668
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:21,397
“I’m not leaving anymore.”

669
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:22,254
Like that?

670
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,377
That isn’t cool.

671
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:24,497
Cool?

672
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:25,828
When did you say you’re leaving?

673
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:26,972
Tomorrow morning.

674
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:29,965
Wait a minute.

675
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,170
Tomorrow morning?

676
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,763
Yeah.

677
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,595
We haven’t even done unpacking yet,

678
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:35,835
Mr. cool guy!

679
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:39,895
What? You want to leave right after you just came?

680
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,554
Stop complaining.

681
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:43,252
Don’t you want to get out of here asap?

682
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,861
Give me your phone.

683
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,084
I’ll try to call home.

684
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,614
Here.

685
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:48,428
Take it.

686
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,372
Good luck with the reception.

687
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,812
Is this one yours?

688
00:40:54,023 --> 00:40:55,720
Yes. I just told you to grab it.

689
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,429
Come on, reception.

690
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,681
Give me something here.

691
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:28,368
Hello, Dao.

692
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:29,467
It’s me, Fah.

693
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,452
I borrowed Mesa’s phone.

694
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:34,934
I thought you forgot about your brother.

695
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,297
(Sorry.)

696
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:38,372
There’s no phone signal up here.

697
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,485
I had to walk all over the mountain to get a signal.

698
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:44,595
How are you doing anyway?

699
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:46,955
(Not so good.)

700
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,046
That’s why I called.

701
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,016
I’ve got a favor to ask.

702
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:55,939
Can you find me a new volunteer location?

703
00:41:55,939 --> 00:41:56,994
Somewhere not here.

704
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:00,722
I knew you’d call asking for this.

705
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:01,609
Actually,

706
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:06,337
your dad said if you couldn’t handle it,

707
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,844
you could come back for the community service in Bangkok.

708
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,925
Seriously?

709
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:10,406
What service?

710
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:13,412
Cleaning the city intersections. Want that?

711
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:16,108
No.

712
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:19,239
Is there anything medical-related?

713
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,248
No?

714
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:25,409
Dao, I gotta go.

715
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:27,210
I guess I’m being too loud.

716
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,875
People might come yelling at me.

717
00:42:29,595 --> 00:42:31,426
I’ll call you again when I go to Chiang Mai downtown.

718
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:32,472
Talk to you later.

719
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:50,665
What?

720
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,633
You two haven’t packed?

721
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:54,451
Fah.

722
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,186
Did you talk to Prince last night?

723
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,854
No. Why?

724
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,676
Follow us and you’ll see.

725
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,795
Move. Why just standing there?

726
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,105
What is happening here?

727
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,688
Teacher Prince and the kids have been cleaning since dawn.

728
00:43:33,385 --> 00:43:35,533
Did you tell him we’re not leaving?

729
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:42,434
It’s dusty here.

730
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:44,750
So I wanted to help you clean it up.

731
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:47,171
Right. We’re doing our best.

732
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:48,304
Do you like it, Dr. Fah?

733
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:50,819
Uh…

734
00:43:51,908 --> 00:43:53,422
The kids are helping here.

735
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:54,359
Don't you like that?

736
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:58,895
I do.

737
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:00,244
Of course.

738
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:01,675
Thank you.

739
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:08,863
Dr. Fah, my plaster is about to come off.

740
00:44:09,155 --> 00:44:12,444
Because you’re helping me clean?

741
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:13,144
Yes.

742
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:17,363
Then I'll apply you a new one.

743
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:18,210
Okay.

744
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,115
Do you like a kitty plaster?

745
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,235
I do.

746
00:44:30,328 --> 00:44:31,926
From what I see,

747
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,985
we don’t need to hurry home anymore.

748
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,670
I see something too.

749
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,211
Okay.

750
00:44:39,317 --> 00:44:41,035
Let me apply a new plaster for you.

751
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,296
See what?

752
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,285
I see we’ll be here for a long time.

753
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,392
Okay.

754
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:51,544
And we’re done.

755
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,674
Thank you, Dr. Fah.

756
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:09,239
I won’t tell the village chief about the other day.

757
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:12,652
But if you do something terrible again,

758
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:14,859
you won’t get away with it.

759
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:21,233
Keep a close eye on my then, Teacher.

760
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:25,743
Please take care of me.

761
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:41,630
Everything about love, in my viewpoint, is chaotic.

763

Hey!

764
00:46:05,787 --> 00:46:06,958
How did you get in here?

765
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,783
Don’t you have to conduct medical check-ups today?

766
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:10,541
I’m feeling hot.

767
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:12,219
If you don’t believe me, feel it.

768
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:13,252
I like Teacher Prince.

769
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:15,401
Can you spy on him and see if he’s dating someone?

770
00:46:16,182 --> 00:46:17,057
Shit!

771
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:18,182
I just stepped on pigshit.

772
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:20,890
Are you nuts? Why does it have to be me?

773
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:21,522
Wait.

774
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:22,626
What are you doing?

775
00:46:22,715 --> 00:46:25,096
Other people get generic check-ups.

776
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:27,514
But you get a special checkup.
