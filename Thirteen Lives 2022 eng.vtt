The Thai government's been
given a list of rescue divers.

17:01.730 --> 17:02.981
We're on the list.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.607
[video game music playing]

17:05.400 --> 17:06.401

-Matthew.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.158
Okay, okay.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.701
Vern mapped it
a couple of years ago.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.869
[Rick] Yeah, yeah.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.121
Got it. Up north.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.581
That's the one. Yeah.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.332
It's just a tourist cave.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.835
It looks easy, but Vern said
when it's flooded,

17:23.918 --> 17:25.128
-it's impossible.
-[chuckles]

17:25.211 --> 17:26.755
-Impossible for Vern.
-Yeah.

17:26.838 --> 17:27.964

-[Annabel] Get your stuff

17:28.047 --> 17:29.090
-together, all right?
-[Matthew] Okay.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.592
[John] Well, they've got teams

17:30.675 --> 17:31.926
climbing all over
the mountain.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.303
They're drilling holes
and searching--

17:33.386 --> 17:34.429
Holes?

17:34.512 --> 17:36.639
-Rick, one second.
-Drilling holes?

17:36.723 --> 17:37.932
They don't need us, John.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.518
-Where's it this time, Dad?
-Thailand.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.603
You got everything?

17:41.686 --> 17:44.147
-Yep.
-Yeah? Give us a hug.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.774
-All right. See you later.
-Come along, Matthew.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.525
[Matthew] See ya.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.444
Thanks, Annabel. I'll let you
know if I have to go.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.653
-Okay.
-Sorry.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.989
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, son.

[door closes]

17:58.745 --> 18:01.456
Rick, look, if you don't wanna
do it, I'll just call Jason.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.000
Just call Jason
if you'd rather go with Jason.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.627
[sighs] I didn't say
I'd rather go with Jason.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.170
I would rather go with you.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.254
Just to confirm,

18:08.338 --> 18:09.923
no one's actually asked
for us yet?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.424
No, Vern just gave them
our names

18:11.508 --> 18:12.592
and, you know,
we should be ready

18:12.675 --> 18:15.136
in case they do ask for us.
Maybe start packing

18:15.220 --> 18:16.387
if you think you're coming.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.889

[indistinct chatter]

18:56.469 --> 18:57.512

19:02.350 --> 19:05.603
are working around the clock
to pump water from the cave.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.106
Due to worsening conditions
inside the cave,

all rescue dive efforts
have been put on hold.

Hey, guys, I'm sorry,

19:16.364 --> 19:17.949
but we will have to walk
from here.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.953
Got any custard creams left?

19:22.996 --> 19:24.205
Just one, okay?

19:24.289 --> 19:25.123
Yeah.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.760
Thanks.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.845
Did you take
two custard creams?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.221
No.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.764
[chuckling] Yes, you did.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.766
You took two at once.
You're like a child.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.894
-I'm like a child?
-Okay, guys.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.354
It's the building on the left,
next to the laundry.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.856
I will get the tanks
and meet you there.

We do what we came to do.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.554
Go in that cave.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.932
[John] Seriously, I mean,

20:24.015 --> 20:25.767
I don't care
about the custard creams,

20:25.850 --> 20:28.353
but it's like I tell my son,
I care about trust.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.896

as they laid their line.

do not go in the cave again

Sir?

all that about?

29:58.631 --> 30:00.841
Well, in theory,
the governor's in charge,

30:00.925 --> 30:03.177
but Captain Arnont's
the Navy chief on the ground

30:03.260 --> 30:05.262
and he doesn't take orders
from civilians.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.681
Plus, the rumor is,
the governor's been sacked.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.266
This was supposed to have been
his last week here,

30:09.350 --> 30:11.060

to stay on.

they need a fall guy.

[Saman chuckles]

31:34.893 --> 31:37.062
I got bored of watching you
on the news.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.607
Hey team, this is Saman.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.484
Saman's one of us.
He served under me for ten years.

Can I talk with you please?

31:59.043 --> 31:59.877
Sir,

32:00.961 --> 32:02.463
my boy is in the cave

32:03.339 --> 32:05.633
and now it's flooding.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.676
I don't know if my son
is alive or dead.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.679
All I ask from you, sir,

32:12.348 --> 32:15.517
is to bring me his body.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.190

32:33.661 --> 32:34.828
This is Captain Olivia Taft.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.080
Governor.

32:36.163 --> 32:38.207
[Charlie] We're the nearest
Special Operations Squad.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.459
But we have medics,
comms, logistics experts.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.835
We'll do whatever we can
to help.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.504
Thank you.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.464
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.549
[Narongsak] Thank you.
Everyone!

32:47.633 --> 32:48.926
We're going to
get started now.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.680
So, we think that the boys
were heading for here.

32:52.763 --> 32:53.889
They call it Pattaya Beach.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.143
With the high water level
and the low visibility,

32:59.228 --> 33:01.188
and the difficulty
of the cave itself,

33:03.023 --> 33:06.193
our divers were not able
to reach them.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.904
So, now, the question is,

33:10.572 --> 33:11.740
when do we go back in?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.451
And who is going in?

33:14.535 --> 33:16.078
[murmuring]

33:16.161 --> 33:20.124
We need the rain to stop,
and let the pumps do the work.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.834
And then, we go in.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.044
We can go in now.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.129
[John] Yeah. No offense,

33:25.212 --> 33:27.256
but you're trained
to dive in open water,

33:27.339 --> 33:28.841
not confined spaces.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.468
Rick and I
have been diving in caves

33:31.552 --> 33:33.178
just like this
for 30 years now.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.555
It takes
a certain kind of mindset

33:34.638 --> 33:36.890
for the deep cave diving.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.976
Breathing techniques,
special ways of moving.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.310
It's just different.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.648
I'm responsible for my men.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.526
As for anyone else,

33:47.609 --> 33:49.111
that's for the governor
to decide.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.335
No one will go in for now.

34:05.419 --> 34:06.628
We'll wait for the rain
to stop.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.255
-Thank you.
-[indistinct chatter]

34:20.058 --> 34:20.934

for every sinkhole.

34:29.651 --> 34:33.030
Seems like he just showed up
on his own, sir.

34:33.113 --> 34:35.407
The men working with him
are local villagers.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.702
I don't believe we've met.

34:39.912 --> 34:40.871

34:44.583 --> 34:46.877
I live in Illinois
but I'm from Bangkok.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.004
I was in Bangkok
when I heard the news.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.048
I rounded up some volunteers
and here we are.

34:53.050 --> 34:54.051
[in English]
I am the governor.

34:54.134 --> 34:54.968
[in Thai]

34:55.052 --> 34:57.012
Tell me how you can help.

34:58.514 --> 34:59.890
Of course.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.060
There's a network
of mountain streams

35:03.143 --> 35:07.105
carrying water through all the fissures
and cracks into the cave.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.316
That's what's creating
the strong currents.

35:09.399 --> 35:13.821
If we find a way to divert these streams,
the water level will drop.

35:13.904 --> 35:16.740
I thought that's why we're pumping water
out of the cave below.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.992
No, sir.
Those pumps are useless.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.954
The cave is at the bottom,
water will keep running in from above.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.705
Can you stop that?

35:24.748 --> 35:25.958
We are trying.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.336
But there's a price to pay.

You've all been in the cave.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.852
You know how the water comes
in from the mountain above.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.604
Now we want to
divert the water

35:47.688 --> 35:48.981
down the side of the mountain,

35:49.857 --> 35:51.358
away from the cave,

[villagers discussing

36:02.578 --> 36:03.912
We will lose our crop?

36:05.539 --> 36:06.582
Yes.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.001
This will save the boys?

36:11.086 --> 36:13.297
Honestly,
I can't promise anything.

36:14.298 --> 36:15.841
Um...

36:15.924 --> 36:18.552

a chance.

With this much-needed break

37:08.810 --> 37:09.686
in the monsoon rains,

37:09.770 --> 37:11.897
consensus among
the many volunteers here

37:11.980 --> 37:13.357
is that the search
for the boys

37:13.440 --> 37:16.109
and their coach
may soon resume.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.402
The frustration
for the families, though,

37:17.486 --> 37:19.947
is that nobody seems to know
when that might be,

37:20.030 --> 37:22.449
or indeed,
how it will take place.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.785

this huge cave system,

as to whether the boys
can still be rescued.

in there.

into the cave

46:09.517 --> 46:11.478
And our coach help us.

46:11.561 --> 46:12.395
Coach.

46:12.479 --> 46:14.105
[in Thai]

46:14.189 --> 46:16.065
I offer my most sincere apologies
for leading the boys into danger.

46:16.149 --> 46:17.442
[boys speaking]

46:17.525 --> 46:20.570
It's not true! Coach helped us!
We love our coach! He's the best!

46:20.653 --> 46:25.241
[in English] It is because
of our coach we stay strong.

46:25.325 --> 46:27.911

-[John] You pray?

-Yes, yes.
-I bet you do. All right.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.589
[Arm] How...
How did you find us?

46:46.721 --> 46:47.722
[Prem in English] We dig.

46:51.392 --> 46:52.227
We dig.

46:58.066 --> 46:59.400
This is to get out?

47:04.864 --> 47:05.782
Good work.

47:09.202 --> 47:10.328
[Arm] Uh...

47:10.411 --> 47:13.248
We hear a sound in the cave.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.542
We are very scared.

47:15.625 --> 47:16.501
[John] No need
to be scared now.

47:16.584 --> 47:19.087
It's just water.
It's just the cave.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.089
I hear it too, it's just...
[imitates ticking]

47:21.172 --> 47:22.173

47:23.841 --> 47:25.343

47:27.470 --> 47:28.429

52:16.384 --> 52:17.635
[Olivia] Just head back in.

52:17.718 --> 52:19.887
Come on, guys, let's just give
'em some space, okay?

52:19.971 --> 52:20.930
Thank you. Been a long day.

52:21.013 --> 52:22.306
Can you please comment

-[Bas] Thank you.
-Okay.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.274
Thank you so much.
You found them.

52:31.357 --> 52:33.025
[door opens]

52:33.109 --> 52:35.111
The news guys
can be a pain in the butt.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.446
You just gotta
handle them right.

52:37.530 --> 52:39.323
What do you want me
to tell them?

52:39.407 --> 52:41.701
"We found the boys.
Now let's all watch 'em die."

52:41.784 --> 52:43.911
Okay, Rick, take it easy.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.663
I'm just telling it
like it is.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.999
All this water pumping,

52:48.082 --> 52:50.668

praying to shrines,

52:50.751 --> 52:52.253
it's bullshit!

52:52.336 --> 52:53.254
I'm not having it.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.674
The Thai SEALs
are going in tomorrow.

52:56.757 --> 52:58.676
Those boys
are never coming out.

53:00.553 --> 53:01.387
[John sighs]

53:02.096 --> 53:02.972
Never.

53:07.935 --> 53:10.646
Our most experienced divers
are going to--

53:10.730 --> 53:14.692
No, sir.
It's not about your divers.

53:14.775 --> 53:17.361
We brought a man out
on our first dive,

53:17.445 --> 53:18.487
and he completely panicked.

53:18.571 --> 53:19.530
Almost drowned.

53:21.991 --> 53:24.660
And that was
a very short swim.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.580
You try and dive those kids
the whole way,

53:27.663 --> 53:29.916
all you'll be bringing out
is dead bodies!

what I didn't want.

54:02.490 --> 54:05.159
[John] Well,
you knew we'd find them.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.535
I didn't expect
to find them alive.

Well, it's done now.

56:00.816 --> 56:04.487
We are standing by at the basecamp
of the rescue mission.

56:04.570 --> 56:07.323
Rescuers are attempting to find
alternative ways to reach the cave.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.742
Experts believe the boys
will never survive

56:09.825 --> 56:12.328
three months of monsoon rains
and flooding.

56:15.956 --> 56:19.126
Still using the same Scubapro regulator
from my time.

56:19.210 --> 56:20.086
[affirms]

56:26.300 --> 56:28.260
[in English]
On your first dive,

56:28.344 --> 56:30.262
you made it to the T-junction?

56:30.346 --> 56:31.514
I did, yeah.

56:33.557 --> 56:36.268
Do you want a briefing
on the rest of the way?

56:37.770 --> 56:39.730
Yeah, please. Come in.

56:44.819 --> 56:46.362
[Rick] You made it here.

56:47.321 --> 56:50.741
You have
a 250-meter dive here,

56:50.825 --> 56:52.243
with a narrow rift,

56:52.326 --> 56:55.371
barely shoulder-wide,
to Chamber 7.

56:55.454 --> 56:57.081
Then you have to de-kit

56:57.164 --> 57:00.584
and carry your gear
over a long rock shelf

57:00.668 --> 57:02.128
to get to Pattaya Beach.

57:02.211 --> 57:03.337
Then comes a tough dive.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.675
It's a long, shallow tunnel,

57:07.758 --> 57:11.971
bit more twisty than this,
350 meters.

57:12.054 --> 57:15.099
No visibility. Pulling against
very strong currents.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.892
No headroom at all.

57:16.976 --> 57:19.687
And there's undercuts
on all the bends.

57:19.770 --> 57:21.147
They're very, very dangerous.

57:21.230 --> 57:24.483
So, you must always keep
to the wider side of the line,

57:24.567 --> 57:26.694
or you'll get trapped.

57:26.777 --> 57:29.238
At the end of that,
you'll reach the boys.

57:30.573 --> 57:33.284
[John] And it's
a very physical dive.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.202
So, try and save
two-thirds of your air

57:35.286 --> 57:36.370
going in,
so you can make it back.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.955
We will get there.

57:38.038 --> 57:38.873
We'll reach the boys today.

57:38.956 --> 57:39.874
[John] Yeah.

your men are tough,

than we planned on.

Now you see why the Minister
left me in charge.

1:02:05.347 --> 1:02:08.267
Now the Navy SEALs
have reached the boys.

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:11.770
They will support the boys,

1:02:11.854 --> 1:02:15.065

How can I help?

Can I speak
with the Governor please?

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:51.143
The Governor is busy.
I can help you.

1:02:52.978 --> 1:02:56.607
Our families are Shan.
We don't have ID cards.

1:02:56.690 --> 1:02:58.275
Will they still help our boys?

Is everything okay?

Well, she's afraid
her boy won't be rescued.

Don't worry, your son will be rescued
from the cave with all the others.

1:03:12.539 --> 1:03:15.501
You should be proud of your son.
He's been very patient.

1:03:16.877 --> 1:03:18.003

It's been twelve days already.

be patient?

Whoa. What are you thinking?

1:04:12.432 --> 1:04:14.601

-So tell me.

We've got nothing.

1:04:22.192 --> 1:04:23.151
We call Harry.

Don't know if he'd do it.

I... I don't know the man,

1:04:55.392 --> 1:04:56.685
but, I mean...

1:04:58.270 --> 1:05:00.856
I bet he'd come if he thought
it was just to lend a hand.

1:05:05.277 --> 1:05:06.111
[Rick] Hmm.

1:05:07.195 --> 1:05:09.197
He might buy that.

1:05:09.281 --> 1:05:10.282
He's a good diver.

1:05:10.824 --> 1:05:11.742
Yeah.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:15.621
We could use
a couple more divers

1:05:15.704 --> 1:05:17.497
who can handle
rescue work anyway.

1:05:17.581 --> 1:05:19.833
I was thinking Jason.
You know?

If he's not too pissed off

1:05:21.168 --> 1:05:22.419

Chris will be up to it?

Jason says he's strong.

1:05:34.723 --> 1:05:36.767
Of course, he's never done
a rescue like this.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:38.935

then it can't be done.

[reporter in English]
The recent death

1:16:36.592 --> 1:16:39.220
of Thai Navy SEAL Saman Gunan
is reminding everyone

1:16:39.304 --> 1:16:40.680
of just
how incredibly dangerous

1:16:40.763 --> 1:16:42.849
and challenging it is
in the caves.

1:16:42.932 --> 1:16:44.475
This was a trained Navy diver.

1:16:44.559 --> 1:16:45.852
[in Thai]
As for Saman's funeral,

1:16:45.935 --> 1:16:47.603
the government will arrange
a funeral with full honors.

1:16:47.687 --> 1:16:49.355
[reporter in English] How
much more difficult will it be

1:16:49.439 --> 1:16:50.940
for the 12 children
and their coach?

1:16:51.024 --> 1:16:52.817
Rescuers are now
attempting to source

1:16:52.900 --> 1:16:56.112
diving equipment and wet suits
for the smallest of the boys.

1:16:56.195 --> 1:16:59.282
With no alternate entrances
and oxygen running low,

1:16:59.365 --> 1:17:02.702
diving them out still appears
to be the best option.

1:17:02.785 --> 1:17:04.746
The entire nation
is anxiously waiting

1:17:04.829 --> 1:17:06.414
for what will happen next.

1:17:13.171 --> 1:17:14.422
[Harry] Call me back. Yeah.

1:17:16.341 --> 1:17:18.343
There will be
no more Navy divers

1:17:18.426 --> 1:17:22.013
going beyond Chamber 3
until further notice.

1:17:36.235 --> 1:17:37.695

1:17:37.779 --> 1:17:39.238
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

1:17:47.622 --> 1:17:48.873
[line ringing]

1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:56.381
Hey, Matthew. It's Dad.

1:17:56.464 --> 1:17:58.466
[Matthew] Dad!
Are you coming home?

1:18:00.218 --> 1:18:02.553
Uh, not for a few days yet.

1:18:02.637 --> 1:18:04.806
We heard someone died
out there.

1:18:04.889 --> 1:18:06.808
Yeah, yeah,
one of the Thai divers.

1:18:06.891 --> 1:18:09.727
A fellow named Saman.
He was...

1:18:09.811 --> 1:18:13.231
He was just
helping out, and...

1:18:13.314 --> 1:18:15.441
Yeah, yeah, it's sad.

1:18:16.609 --> 1:18:19.028
Do you think
you'll get the boys out?

1:18:19.112 --> 1:18:20.279
We will if we can.

1:18:21.531 --> 1:18:24.158
We're just trying
to figure it out.

1:18:24.242 --> 1:18:27.620
I mean, it's complicated,

1:18:27.703 --> 1:18:29.664
but we're trying...
We're trying to figure it out now.

1:18:31.457 --> 1:18:35.128
Uh, anyway,
how are things with you?

1:18:35.211 --> 1:18:36.546
You doin' okay?

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.090
[indistinct chatter]

1:18:40.258 --> 1:18:41.634
Do you want one?

1:18:41.717 --> 1:18:43.719
Uh, no.

1:18:43.803 --> 1:18:47.014
I just found out my dad's been
taken to a hospital.

1:18:47.098 --> 1:18:48.599
So, they're just running
a few tests.

1:18:48.683 --> 1:18:50.309
His heart's never been
very good.

1:18:51.644 --> 1:18:53.479
Sorry to hear about that.

1:18:53.563 --> 1:18:55.273
He's pretty tough.

1:18:56.232 --> 1:18:57.692
He's made it to 88.

1:18:59.193 --> 1:19:01.320
-[chuckles softly]
-Um, listen.

1:19:05.241 --> 1:19:06.742
If we had the right backup,

1:19:08.077 --> 1:19:10.329
maybe, just maybe

1:19:10.413 --> 1:19:13.416
one or two or three,
if we're lucky,

1:19:13.499 --> 1:19:15.501
of those kids
might just make it through.

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:20.256
But you're talking about
a five-hour dive.

1:19:20.339 --> 1:19:21.799
-Right.
-That means that

1:19:21.883 --> 1:19:24.927
they're gonna have to have
top-up shots along the way.

1:19:25.011 --> 1:19:26.846
And then you got
the saliva problem.

1:19:26.929 --> 1:19:28.264
Even if the masks hold,

1:19:28.347 --> 1:19:29.390
there's a very good chance

1:19:29.474 --> 1:19:30.600
they're gonna choke,
all right?

1:19:30.683 --> 1:19:32.351
The whole thing is insane.

1:19:32.435 --> 1:19:34.061
I don't even know
why I'm saying it.

1:19:34.145 --> 1:19:35.771
'Cause a man's already died.

1:19:37.982 --> 1:19:39.650
-Yeah.
-And those kids don't have much time left.

1:19:41.277 --> 1:19:42.278
Harry.

1:19:42.945 --> 1:19:44.322
We do nothing,

1:19:44.405 --> 1:19:45.573
we'll be bringin' 'em
out dead for sure.

1:19:47.825 --> 1:19:49.494
But if they die
while we're bringin' 'em out,

1:19:50.536 --> 1:19:51.954
at least we will have tried.

1:19:55.917 --> 1:19:56.792
[Harry scoffs]

1:20:07.386 --> 1:20:08.346
Sedated?

1:20:09.514 --> 1:20:10.640
How sedated?

1:20:14.352 --> 1:20:17.188
Fully. Fully unconscious.

1:20:17.271 --> 1:20:19.232
It's the only way
we can dive them out.

1:20:19.315 --> 1:20:20.483
[Rick] Mmm.

1:20:20.566 --> 1:20:22.151
They have to be inert.

1:20:22.235 --> 1:20:23.694
Completely still.

1:20:23.778 --> 1:20:26.405
We'll take them out
like packages.

1:20:28.574 --> 1:20:31.035
And you are an anesthetist?

1:20:31.827 --> 1:20:33.621
Yes. Yes, I am.

1:20:34.956 --> 1:20:35.790
Preeya.

1:20:35.873 --> 1:20:36.707
[in Thai]

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:37.917
Don't write this down.

1:20:39.418 --> 1:20:41.379
[in English]
How safe is this procedure?

1:20:46.634 --> 1:20:48.261
[scoffing]

1:20:48.344 --> 1:20:51.180
I just can't answer that.

1:20:51.264 --> 1:20:52.640
Because I've never
done it before.

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:56.644
As far as I know,
nobody ever has.

1:20:59.564 --> 1:21:00.565
In...

1:21:02.108 --> 1:21:04.610
In theory, it could work.

1:21:06.070 --> 1:21:11.450
But we're talking about
administering anesthetics

1:21:11.534 --> 1:21:15.246
under conditions where we just
can't monitor the effect.

1:21:16.914 --> 1:21:19.834
So, too much

1:21:19.917 --> 1:21:21.961
and respiration
can just shut down.

1:21:23.254 --> 1:21:25.715
And too little and, uh...
[blows]

1:21:27.842 --> 1:21:29.677
If they wake up under water,

1:21:31.846 --> 1:21:33.389
they can drown.

1:21:35.516 --> 1:21:36.642
[clears throat]

1:21:38.269 --> 1:21:41.606
So, you are expecting,
uh, casualties?

1:21:42.315 --> 1:21:44.859
Yes. I expect casualties.

1:22:26.901 --> 1:22:28.694
[in English]
May you be successful.

1:22:37.662 --> 1:22:40.581
No one must know about the...

1:22:41.874 --> 1:22:43.334
the method you propose.

1:22:44.752 --> 1:22:46.587

1:22:49.674 --> 1:22:50.675
Do your best.

1:22:52.218 --> 1:22:53.344
And if we fail,

1:22:55.012 --> 1:22:57.765
the failure is mine alone.

1:23:02.937 --> 1:23:03.771

1:23:13.239 --> 1:23:16.951
Your volunteering
and effort is critical.

1:23:17.034 --> 1:23:20.663
The faster the waterways can be diverted
before the monsoons return,

1:23:20.746 --> 1:23:23.165
the more time
we can buy for the boys.

1:23:23.249 --> 1:23:26.127
They're telling us
the dams are helping.

1:23:26.210 --> 1:23:28.713
It makes it possible for the
divers to reach the boys.

1:23:28.796 --> 1:23:30.923
But if we don't build enough,

1:23:31.006 --> 1:23:34.301
when the monsoons arrive,
the boys will drown.

1:23:38.597 --> 1:23:40.307

they're all being sent away.

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:08.252

[John] Here. For good luck.

1:24:46.665 --> 1:24:47.958
Don't believe in luck.

Just take it, take it.
She's watching, come on.

1:24:59.887 --> 1:25:03.182
All right.
We'll be having to give them

1:25:03.265 --> 1:25:06.268
repeat hits of ketamine
along the way.

1:25:07.645 --> 1:25:08.521
We're givin' 'em ket?

1:25:09.230 --> 1:25:10.189
Yeah.

1:25:10.272 --> 1:25:13.901
Now, the injection goes
through the wet suit,

1:25:13.984 --> 1:25:16.237
into the thigh muscle here
or here.

1:25:17.446 --> 1:25:20.366
Each dose should last
about 30 minutes.

1:25:20.449 --> 1:25:23.244
Keep a little bit of, see,
space on the needle there.

1:25:23.327 --> 1:25:24.995
Push in and out.

1:25:25.079 --> 1:25:26.580
It's quite simple.

1:25:26.664 --> 1:25:28.374
But when they start waking,

1:25:28.457 --> 1:25:31.418
you guys are gonna have to
top 'em up immediately. Yeah?

for the thirteen boys.

or unintentionally,

wait for us here.

When the first boy
gets through the long dive,

1:28:14.873 --> 1:28:16.417
I swim to you and report.

'Cause if it's not
working out,

[in English]
Don't let the boys watch.

1:58:35.734 --> 1:58:37.277
Come on down, Prem.
Let's get you outta here.

1:58:37.361 --> 1:58:38.278
[in Thai]

1:58:38.362 --> 1:58:40.531
Are we the last to go?

1:58:40.614 --> 1:58:41.990
[Coach Ek] Mmm.

1:58:42.074 --> 1:58:43.242
[Harry in English]
Chris is diving you out.

1:58:43.325 --> 1:58:44.993
You know, Chris, see,

1:58:45.077 --> 1:58:48.372
he's the number one rescue
diver in the whole world.

1:58:48.455 --> 1:58:49.623
That's me.

1:58:49.706 --> 1:58:51.625
All right. Prem, you know
the drill. You've seen this.

1:58:51.708 --> 1:58:53.293
Do you wanna look up? Ready?

1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:01.426
All right. Yep.

1:59:01.510 --> 1:59:02.719
Off you go.

[instructing in Thai]

1:59:18.735 --> 1:59:20.362
[in English]
All right. One more to go.

1:59:21.864 --> 1:59:23.782
Your choice. Up or down?

1:59:23.866 --> 1:59:25.951
Up.

1:59:26.034 --> 1:59:28.036
There you go.
That was pretty painless.

1:59:29.705 --> 1:59:32.082
We're gonna get you home.
Maybe for dinner.

1:59:32.916 --> 1:59:33.917
Hmm?

1:59:36.670 --> 1:59:37.671
Hmm.

1:59:45.429 --> 1:59:46.638
[Jason] It's the best
we can do.

1:59:46.722 --> 1:59:48.765
If I pull it too tight,
it'll collapse the seal.

1:59:48.849 --> 1:59:50.434
[Harry]
It's still a little loose.

1:59:50.517 --> 1:59:52.269
We don't have time.
The water is rising.

1:59:52.352 --> 1:59:53.937
If he doesn't come out now,
he doesn't come out.

1:59:56.440 --> 1:59:57.691
I'll keep it from bumping.

1:59:57.774 --> 1:59:58.942
I can hold it if I have to.

2:00:03.113 --> 2:00:04.156
It's your call.

2:00:04.823 --> 2:00:06.116
I'll be going slow.

2:00:06.199 --> 2:00:07.784
So give me some space
before you follow.

2:00:18.962 --> 2:00:20.005

The boys?

2:00:29.431 --> 2:00:31.224
Are they out safely?

2:00:32.017 --> 2:00:34.770
We hope so. Your turn now.

2:00:37.439 --> 2:00:38.523

2:01:03.298 --> 2:01:05.258
He's no heavier than the boys.

2:01:07.427 --> 2:01:08.720
[Harry]
I'll be right behind you.

2:01:08.804 --> 2:01:10.222
Not too close.

2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:12.849
See you at the pub.

2:02:29.301 --> 2:02:31.720
All right.
I guess it's our turn now.

2:02:31.803 --> 2:02:33.764
You go. We follow.

2:02:33.847 --> 2:02:36.058
Yeah. I mean, remember,

2:02:36.141 --> 2:02:38.643
the current is much stronger
than it was.

2:02:38.727 --> 2:02:41.021
-And the water is, you know.
-Yeah.

2:02:41.104 --> 2:02:42.355
[reporter speaking Thai on TV]

2:02:42.439 --> 2:02:47.486
The clock is ticking,
putting pressure on the rescue team.

2:02:47.569 --> 2:02:52.491
The fear is the heavy downpour
will push water back into the cave

2:02:52.574 --> 2:02:58.246
faster than the volunteers
can divert the rain from the mountain.

2:02:58.330 --> 2:02:59.998

Steady now, lads.

2:04:53.153 --> 2:04:53.987

2:05:21.932 --> 2:05:23.642
It's really good to see you.

2:05:23.725 --> 2:05:25.810
I didn't know if anyone
was gonna be able to...

2:05:25.894 --> 2:05:27.604
Is he alive?

2:05:27.687 --> 2:05:29.022
-[Chris] Uh, yeah.
-[Rick] Yeah?

2:05:29.105 --> 2:05:30.899
No, yeah, he is, yeah. I...

2:05:30.982 --> 2:05:32.776
I lost the line back there.

2:05:32.859 --> 2:05:34.945
I found a power cable
and followed it here.

2:05:35.779 --> 2:05:37.364
I, uh...

2:05:37.447 --> 2:05:38.573
I don't know where I am.

2:05:38.657 --> 2:05:40.075
[Rick] You're still
in Chamber 4.

2:05:40.158 --> 2:05:41.201
Well done.

2:05:41.284 --> 2:05:42.869
[breathes heavily]

2:05:44.079 --> 2:05:45.163
Keep him topped up.

2:05:46.122 --> 2:05:47.415
You'll be fine.

2:05:47.499 --> 2:05:49.918
Wait for Harry.
He's coming now.

2:05:50.001 --> 2:05:51.294
Let him have a look, yeah?

2:05:51.378 --> 2:05:53.046
Yeah. Yeah.

2:05:53.129 --> 2:05:55.382
Your only duty is to that boy.

2:05:55.465 --> 2:05:56.716
We'll get you out.

2:05:58.593 --> 2:05:59.803
So get ready.

2:05:59.886 --> 2:06:01.471
Yeah. Okay.

2:06:01.554 --> 2:06:03.265
Put his mask on

2:06:03.348 --> 2:06:06.351
and do whatever Harry says
is best. Got it?

2:06:07.185 --> 2:06:08.603

2:07:39.277 --> 2:07:42.697
I, uh... I lost the line.

2:07:42.781 --> 2:07:43.990
Is your boy okay?

2:07:44.074 --> 2:07:45.241
I think so.

2:07:45.325 --> 2:07:47.911
You, uh,
might wanna check him.

2:07:47.994 --> 2:07:49.412
Did you give him a top-off?

2:07:49.496 --> 2:07:50.955
Yeah, I gave him one
about an hour ago, I think.

2:07:52.707 --> 2:07:54.167
Yeah, let's give him
another hit.

2:07:54.250 --> 2:07:55.293
Okay.

2:07:58.213 --> 2:08:01.174
Do you want me to maybe
take over from here?

that I was a rescuer, too.

what's best for the boy.
