1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,519
She was somewhat aloof, but a good girl.

2
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,160
She was one of those rich girls
who paint their nails black

3
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,600
to look like rebels.

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,519
Smarter.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
She thought she was different...

6
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,920
because she acted all mysterious.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,640
I thought I knew her,
but now I'm not sure.

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,600
-Where's your brother?
-In his room. Why?

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
No reason.

10
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,000
Because there's always people around,
and now we're all alone...

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,640
-Is it yours?
-No, my brother's.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,840
-What's all this?
-Samu, what's going on?

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,039
No way.
Someone's sending him license plates.

14
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,799
-What?
-Nano!

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,280
-Samuel?
-Nano!

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,680
-What?
-What's this?

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,959
-Who's sending you plates?
-Why do you have my phone?

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,519
How can you be stupid enough

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,239
to think about stealing cars again
while you're on parole?

20
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,799
You could go to jail again.

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,439
Leave me alone. Hi, Marina.

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,040
The people you owe money to are
in jail.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,280
-Maybe I could help.
-No, stay out of this.

24
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,840
-Here's what we'll do.
-What?

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,200
From now on,
mind your own fucking business.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,519
-Nano, what are you--
-Mind your own fucking business, Samu!

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,280
Look who's here!

28
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,840
What's that? What are you doing?

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,079
The clothes you gave me.
My dad's forcing me to return them.

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,560
So you paid for those clothes?

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,760
Obviously.
How could I have paid for them?

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,599
-Stay, and we'll talk about it.
-Sure.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,040
How can you return this?
It's cool and you looked great in it.

34
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,120
-Try it on.
-Now?

35
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,799
Now. Right, Polo?

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,879
And your butt looks great in these pants.
Put these on, too.

37
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,599
Maybe you both really do see me
as a sex object.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you saying?
Tell him he's wrong, Polo.

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,039
Take his pants off.

40
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,719
Come on.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
Careful. I got stuff down there.
Don't mess around.

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,680
What would you call
this thing we've got going on?

43
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,719
Why do we need to define it?

44
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,080
Labels are for clothes.

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
-Oh well!
-We can't return this.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,080
That sucks!

47
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,039
-Can't return this, either.
-Oh, oops!

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,759
No way.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,400
Good morning.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,919
Good morning.

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,680
-I'm so tired!
-Why?

52
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,840
Because I'm not sleeping well lately.

53
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,439
I'm taking a medication.
I hope the side effects won't last long.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,879
-The veil!
-Don't worry, I won't say anything.

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,479
I've already gotten used
to all this cultural diversity.

56
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,159
Come on, guys. It was a joke.
Nadia, I'm serious.

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,560
I think we should meet up
to share some ideas.

58
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,400
We could surprise each other.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,199
How about today
at Guzmán's birthday party?

60
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,560
Oh, no. She wasn't invited, right?

61
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,400
-Lu.
-Sorry, since you're such close friends...

62
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,840
I thought you'd be going.

63
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,479
Maybe it's just an intimate gathering,
right, Marina?

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Have a nice day.

65
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,520
Does she practice that at home,
or does she make it up on the spot?

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,240
Nadia, it isn't a big party.
It's a family thing.

67
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,960
Marina, don't worry.

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Samuel, one thing.

69
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,839
I know you only want to protect me,
and not involve me in your problems...

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,680
but I think I know
how to help your brother.

71
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,720
Seriously, Marina. Forget it.

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,000
The more you stay away from him,
the better.

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,000
Listen to me.

74
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm doing this for you.
I know you love him.

75
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,040
-Do you want him to get hurt?
-No, I don't want you to get hurt.

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,480
He's dangerous.
He could get you in a lot of trouble.

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
Look. Remember those files
you told me your parents hide in a safe?

78
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,519
-Yes.
-Well, my brother asked me to steal them.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,759
-What?
-I didn't do it.

80
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,279
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,959
I want you to stay away from him,
because I almost did it.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,839
My brother is capable of anything.

83
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,000
Understood?

84
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,600
Samuel, we'll talk later, OK?

85
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,040
Marina!

86
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,920
Happy birthday.

87
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,319
-It's your birthday, isn't it?
-Yes, thanks.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
It's actually the day my parents chose.
We don't know exactly when I was born.

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,120
Who told you?

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,279
It doesn't matter.

91
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,920
It was Lu, right?

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,079
Who else?

93
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,759
She invited herself to the party.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Do you want to celebrate,
just the two of us?

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,439
I'll kick everyone out of the house.
We'll be alone.

96
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,079
I'm not interested.

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
Damn!

98
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,519
Fuck!

99
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,199
We'll take a five-minute break!

100
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,480
Your wrist is OK, right?

101
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,240
So, what's going on?

102
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,399
Nothing. Why?

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,199
You're playing worse.

104
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,800
On Friday,
you have a match you need to win.

105
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm allowed to have a bad day, right?
Besides, it still hurts a little.

106
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,680
No excuses.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,879
I know what you're made of.
We share the same DNA, kid.

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,279
Enough, Dad. I like it better
when you're not trying to be nice.

109
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't I have five minutes?

110
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
A toast to the birthday boy, Guzmán.

111
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,720
Thanks.

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,480
Well, I have a little something
for the birthday boy.

113
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,839
I hope you like it.

114
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
How about that?

115
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,920
Your birthday is the perfect occasion
to start a watch collection, like mine.

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,279
Have I showed it to you?

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,879
-No.
-I'll have to.

118
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,720
Look, Guzmán. It's always with me.

119
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,319
If only it could talk, right, Ventura?

120
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,040
But not with ladies present.
Ones who grow prettier by the day.

121
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,160
Well, Guzmán, mine is more modest,

122
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,360
but happy birthday.

123
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,920
No... How did you know I wanted this?

124
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,000
I love it!

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,879
-I'll take a picture.
-No, wait. My present first.

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, well. What a great girlfriend!

127
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,560
We're just friends.

128
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,480
Do you like it?

129
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,959
-You shouldn't have, Lu.
-Who else could have bought it for you?

130
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,519
Other girls would need to save
for an eternity to buy it.

131
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,319
-Let's take the picture.
-Yes, sure.

132
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,399
-Excuse us.
-So much for the family photo.

133
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,959
It's fine.
Can you take a photo of me and my sister?

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Sure. Stand over there.

135
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,759
This is vintage... or just old, right?

136
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't worry about it. It's safe.
No one knows about it.

137
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,160
Everything is at stake.

138
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,160
-Have I ever failed you in these 20 years?
-Marina!

139
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,439
Smile!

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
How cute!

141
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,879
Hi! Samu isn't working.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,519
What the fuck were you doing
at my place when we hooked up?

143
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,879
I know what you did. Your brother told me.
I wanted to hear it from you.

144
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,680
So, what we had was a lie?

145
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,919
-You did it to break into my house.
-What do you mean, what we had?

146
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,840
-What did you think this was?
-Fuck you.

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,080
I fucked you to rob your place.
To keep you away from my brother.

148
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,039
To prove to him you're a rich girl
who falls for jerks.

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,159
-That's why I fucked you. And know what?
-What?

150
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,080
And now I can't get you out
of my fucking head.

151
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,879
But you're with my brother.
That's how it has to be.

152
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
It's what you both deserve.

153
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,399
Did you come to save me?
There's nothing to save here.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,399
Nano, I want to help you.

155
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,440
Don't ask me why, but I can't stand
the idea of something happening to you.

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,440
Look. My father's business partner
has an awesome watch collection.

157
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,519
And that jerk deserves
to be robbed way more than my family.

158
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,120
I don't know, with four or five watches,
you could pay off your debt.

159
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,879
What do you think?

160
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,320
I have to get back to work.

161
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,559
Listen, I've been a mess since I told you
that we tried to steal from your house.

162
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,919
I'd totally understand
if you don't want anything to do with me.

163
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,440
I needed to tell you that.
We'll talk tomorrow. Bye.

164
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,480
How are you doing?

165
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,879
-Hi.
-Hi.

166
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,879
Samuel, really, don't worry about that.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,919
Are you sure? I was freaking out.
Are we OK?

168
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,919
We are better than OK.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,080
Listen, Samuel.

170
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,080
I think it's time to take our relationship
to the next level, right?

171
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,600
-What do you mean, the next level?
-To do it... together.

172
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,320
Samu, are you there?

173
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,600
Hi.

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Hi, Samuel.

175
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,720
How can I help you?

176
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
I need eggs.

177
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,279
What's going on with you guys?

178
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,399
Can we talk outside, man?

179
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,919
My father needs me.

180
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,240
Omar.

181
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,399
Do you know what's going on with them?

182
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,919
Kid stuff.
One day like this, the next like that.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
So now you're okay
with talking to drug dealers?

184
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,759
I miss you, man.

185
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,120
Don't you miss me?

186
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,440
I don't need friends who judge me.

187
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,759
Omar, come on. I'm not judging you,
I'm worried about you.

188
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,759
I can't help it.

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,679
And this is your way of apologizing?
It sucks.

190
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,360
You're forgiven.

192
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,639
-I have something else to tell you.
-What?

193
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,519
Marina wants to do it with me.

194
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,960
-No. Bullshit!
-I'm telling you.

195
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,440
-Does she? Congratulations, man.
-Yeah.

196
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,600
-That's awesome. Cool.
-Well...

197
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,759
So why the long face? That's great news.

198
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
-Not great, fucking amazing.
-I know, but...

199
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,960
-Why are you so down?
-Because I'm a virgin.

200
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,240
Omar, it's my first time. I'm embarrassed.

201
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,039
I'm afraid that I won't get it up,

202
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
or that I'll get nervous...
and be awkward with her.

203
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,519
No. Just relax.

204
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,879
-Let nature do its thing--
-I'm worried about something else, too.

205
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,759
If I get nervous, I don't want her
to think that it's because of her issue.

206
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,919
-What issue?
-Her HIV, man.

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm scared she'll think it's
because I'm afraid of it.

208
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,519
-Let me think about it.
-Is there anything you want to tell me?

209
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,879
-Me? No.
-You're not a virgin anymore.

210
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,919
-Sorry, Muslims don't talk about that.
-Sorry, but I'm a bit of a jerk.

211
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
Asshole.

212
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,000
-Another fling?
-Hands off.

213
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
-Let me see.
-Let go.

214
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,639
-Let me see it.
-Don't be nosy.

215
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,000
-Let me see.
-Stop. I'm going inside.

216
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,559
Go home and start waxing.

217
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,039
-Waxing?
-That's what I said.

218
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
Omar! Should I get waxed?

219
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,919
-Sorry I'm late.
-Don't worry.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
Worried I wouldn't show up, huh?

221
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,320
Let's get drinks.

222
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,840
Let's act like this isn't our first time
in a gay bar.

223
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,519
Why the hell are we here?

224
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,559
Because there's more to life
than just school and training.

225
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
Or meeting up
in out-of-the-way places.

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Besides,
I needed to get my mind off tennis.

227
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,639
Plus, I wanted to show you off.

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,519
Tennis is driving you crazy, right?

229
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
Why don't you quit?

230
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,240
-It's the only thing I'm good at.
-You're not good at anything else, right?

231
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,960
If it isn't your thing,
you'll find something else.

232
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,840
Look. If I quit tennis,
I'll break my dad's heart.

233
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,360
It's your life, not his.

234
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,919
Besides, believe it or not,
no one dies from a broken heart.

235
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,759
Those two guys won't stop staring at us.

236
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,600
Obviously. We're the hottest ones here.

237
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,440
Enough with the pics, Narcissus.

238
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
Narcissus? How could I not be like him?
Have you seen these pics? Look.

239
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,399
I've got a gift, man. I'm killing it.

240
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,639
Listen.

241
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,159
I have an idea about how to convince
your father that you're not being bought.

242
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,679
-What if I get you a job?
-What do you mean, a job?

243
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,600
I don't want a shitty dishwasher job.
I'll have time for that later.

244
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,600
No, Christian. It's nothing like that.
Look.

245
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:49,360
Have I told you that my mom
is one of the most important CEOs

246
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,519
-in the publishing world?
-Maybe, but I don't recall.

247
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,720
I'm bad at acronyms.

248
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,720
That means chief executive officer.

249
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,919
She's working on one of this season's
most important ad campaigns.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
-They're looking for models.
-So?

251
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,120
-I can tell her to get you in.
-You'd do that for me?

252
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,120
-I'll call her.
-You're great, man!

253
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,840
Against feminine men
and those who defended women's rights.

254
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,159
Over time,
those men who defended women's rights...

255
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,159
and mainly women,
reappropriated that word,

256
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,480
starting with the pioneer
and suffragist Hubertine Auclert.

257
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,519
Thus, this word has lost its stigma
over time...

258
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,799
-The phone, please.
-Sorry, it was my mom.

259
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,039
This way, we can share with the class...

260
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,799
-Give me the phone.
-It was my mom.

261
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,200
You know the rules.
I don't care. Give me the phone.

262
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,240
She wants to know
what time I'm getting out.

263
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,240
Nadia, please read.

264
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,279
-Read.
-No.

265
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,879
"Marina doesn't have AIDS, asshole.

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,159
-It's HIV--"
-Stop reading that!

267
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,279
What the hell?

268
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,799
Guzmán, calm down. Enough, Guzmán!

269
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,159
-What are you writing?
-Calm down!

270
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,159
-How could you let her read it?
-First, show me some respect.

271
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,039
Second, you know the rules.

272
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
You can't use phones.
I had the right to do that.

273
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,159
-A hell of a right you had.
-Shut up.

274
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
Marina, do you have HIV?

275
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
Nadia, please.

276
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,879
-Really, I don't get it.
-What's that?

277
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,519
No.

278
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,519
Guys, please, calm down. Now!

279
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,000
Marina, you don't have to say anything.
Please, don't.

280
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Guzmán, stop. Please.

281
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
I caught it a year and a half ago,
more or less.

282
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,480
And, well... I guess...

283
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,159
this will be a trending topic for a while.

284
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,000
To make sure you're informed
about what you'll be talking about,

285
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,320
I'll tell you, really,
you don't need to worry about me.

286
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,000
I take my medication.

287
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,039
I take tests every four months, and...

288
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,879
the virus I have is undetectable
in the blood, so...

289
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,640
that means that you can't get infected.

290
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,440
Thanks, Marina.
It takes a lot of courage to share this.

291
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
Don't you think so, Nadia?

292
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,319
I'd rather not comment.

293
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,480
I don't want to hurt anyone.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,039
Here, man.

295
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,839
It was Pablo who infected her, right?

296
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,200
What? What did I miss?

297
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,640
Did you know?

298
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,160
-Did you tell him and not me?
-He told me when he was really down.

299
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,559
-And because I was there.
-Yeah.

300
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,240
-That's why you can't stand the new kids?
-Those people are nothing but trouble.

301
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,640
You can't judge all of them
based on what one individual did.

302
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
Polo, say what you want.

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,079
But Christian's using you and won't stop.
Why would he?

304
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,119
Some people have a plan to use others.
They know how to get what they want.

305
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
-What are you talking about?
-Do you want to tell him, or should I?

306
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,319
What?

307
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,359
Polo and Carla are experimenting
with Christian.

308
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,799
I keep telling him the risks,
but he won't listen.

309
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,000
I knew that already.
He told me himself at Samuel's party.

310
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,079
-He told you at the party?
-See?

311
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,640
For fuck's sake!

312
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,519
He's telling everyone
because he wants to use you.

313
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,759
He wants to fuck you over. Period.

314
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
Nobody uses me.

315
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
He won't use me.

316
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,519
When we were little, we were good friends.

317
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,119
Hi.

318
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,319
Can I sit?

319
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Sure, silly.

320
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,400
But then,
we drifted apart and we barely spoke.

321
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,480
How are you doing?

322
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,240
You know...

323
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,079
I really think you were brave.

324
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,440
And I'm sorry you had to go through
all this by yourself.

325
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,799
Don't worry. I had Guzmán and my parents.

326
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,599
Besides, it's been a long time
since we were close, so...

327
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,319
But you can always count on me.
You know that, right?

328
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,880
So, you didn't notice any changes,
anything unusual?

329
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
I could really use a friend.

330
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
I told you, we didn't talk.

331
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,640
I need so many things right now...

332
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,319
To talk, to vent...

333
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,079
I totally understand.

334
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,640
Would you like to meet up later?

335
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,759
-At your house or...
-Sure. At my house. Great.

336
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,799
OK.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,119
Yes, it's me.

338
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,039
Hi.

339
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,640
I couldn't find you.

340
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,759
-How are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

341
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,839
I couldn't stand any more pitying
or condescending looks.

342
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
Did you see how Nadia stared at me?

343
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,640
I was making a friend,
and I've already lost her.

344
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,200
I'm sorry. You had to say it
in front of everyone because of me.

345
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,680
It had to happen sooner or later.

346
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,640
And...

347
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
do you know when you think that...

348
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,359
you're brave,
but the truth is you act like a coward?

349
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,880
Saying it in front of the class like that
wasn't a cowardly thing to do.

350
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,240
Samuel,
I'm only brave when I'm forced to be.

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,319
So in the end, I have to thank you.

352
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,799
And... are you really afraid
of being with me because I have HIV?

353
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,279
That doesn't scare me at all, OK?

354
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,039
OK.

355
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm afraid that you'll compare me
to your ex.

356
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
What?

357
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,039
Or any guy you've been with,
and that you'll realize I'm just a kid.

358
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,759
-Samuel, we are the same age.
-Sure, but we're from different worlds.

359
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,759
What worlds?

360
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,880
People from your world have lived
like seven lives more than I have.

361
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,440
Samuel, you're a sweetheart.

362
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,680
-I could do it right here.
-No. No, our first time has to be great.

363
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,640
-And it will!
-Let me set it up.

364
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,079
Calm down.

365
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,519
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

366
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,079
I came to see you.

367
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,440
You were a bit harsh in class,

368
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,160
-with everything that happened.
-You didn't tell me about your sister.

369
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,359
That's her business. I didn't tell anyone.

370
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,880
You didn't do anything, either.
I thought you were friends.

371
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,599
I didn't say anything
because I care about her.

372
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,799
-If it were anyone else...
-What?

373
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,480
-Nothing. It doesn't matter.
-What's going on, Nadia?

374
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,119
This only makes me see
how different we are.

375
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,839
I don't know why I'm with people like you.

376
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
People like me?

377
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,799
What does that mean?

378
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,640
You tried to win a bet at my expense.

379
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,559
Then, you tell me about your father
snorting coke in the cellars.

380
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,839
And now, your sister with HIV.

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,920
And you say that our culture is archaic.

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,039
So your family's perfect,
everything's great?

383
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,960
No, I'm not saying that we're perfect,
nor that it's great.

384
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,519
But we don't have
those kinds of problems.

385
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,839
Those kinds of problems.

386
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,160
Hello.

387
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes, that will be €1.50, please.

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,799
-Thanks.
-See you.

389
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,200
Do you know what your brother is up to?
He deals drugs and sucks cock.

390
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,079
Have a nice day.

391
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,359
-What did he want?
-Nothing.

392
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,400
-Carla, thanks for everything.
-No worries. It's the least I could do.

393
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Let's have a drink.

394
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,480
Yeah, sure.

395
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,400
Beer or wine?

396
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,319
My mother speaks highly
of the last harvest.

397
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,359
-Wine it is, then.
-Great.

398
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,160
Shit, there's none left.

399
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,400
-I'll go to the cellar for another one.
-OK.

400
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,759
I'll be right back.

401
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,759
If my mom finds out I've opened
one of the good ones, she'll kill me.

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
Marina?

403
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,440
It looks exactly the same.
It's been a long time since I last came.

404
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,480
It's still the same mausoleum.

405
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,920
-Well, here's to...
-To friendship in shitty times.

406
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,039
Thank you.

407
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
Omar, can we talk?

408
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,720
Yeah.

409
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,519
I don't know how to ask you this,
so I'll do it quick.

410
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
Are you dealing drugs?

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,119
Who told you that?

412
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,559
Samuel. That fucking son of a bitch!

413
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,559
Samuel knows? So it's true?

414
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,359
I'm going to stop, don't worry.

415
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,079
What were you thinking,
getting involved with that? Why?

416
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,039
Do you know you can talk to me?

417
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,519
About anything.

418
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,359
I don't know, Nadia.
We've never really been the kind to talk.

419
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,920
I know. But you can talk to me.

420
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
About anything.

421
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,799
I promise I'll listen to you...
and help you.

422
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,759
Great. I'm going to do my homework.

423
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,480
Take care of the store.

424
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,319
And... there is something else, right?

425
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,839
Do you like guys?

426
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,839
Listen, if you do,
you'll distance yourself from Mom and Dad.

427
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,119
With everything they've done for us!

428
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,319
-I have the right to live my own life.
-Set it aside for a couple of years!

429
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,039
It can't be that difficult.

430
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,200
Look at me.

431
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
I'm not an ice cube like you.

432
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,039
Guzmán.

433
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,079
Hey.

434
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,880
Hey!

435
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,000
Surprise!

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,240
What are you doing here?

437
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,799
Is the alcohol in the usual place?
I can make the best margaritas.

438
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,039
Lu... I don't feel like it.

439
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,359
I get it. It's normal.

440
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,640
You've protected Marina your whole life,
and now this.

441
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,279
You need to get your mind off it.

442
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,200
Someone who gets you,
who doesn't judge.

443
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,160
I'm here to listen, you know.

444
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,119
We can watch a movie...

445
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,319
-How about it?
-Lu.

446
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm not in the mood, OK?

447
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,920
I want to be alone.

448
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,559
Don't you miss what we had?

449
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm not talking about the sex, that aside.

450
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,319
I'm talking about us.

451
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,400
You and me.

452
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,680
You get me better than anyone,
and I get you.

453
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,519
We're a team.

454
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,720
I won't allow us to lose that.

455
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,640
-Sorry.
-Sure.

456
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,319
Hi, Guzmán, I just wanted...

457
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,240
to apologize.

458
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,960
I know I've been harsh, and I'm sorry.

459
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,720
I'm done, Lu.

460
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,400
Lu?

461
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,920
Here we go again. What?

462
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,319
-What?
-Get out of the pool room.

463
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
-I can't hear you.
-Fine, I'm coming.

464
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
Lu, not now.

465
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,880
I just think you're really boring.

466
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,359
Can you stop fooling around, please?

467
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,440
Besides, we're not alone.

468
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm turning one of your worst days...

469
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
into a good one.

470
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,519
-Bye.
-No!

471
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,359
No way!

472
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,599
-Come in with me!
-No, Lu. I don't want to.

473
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,039
Just for a little while. Don't be boring!

474
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,839
I want you to leave.

475
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,839
OK, then. Help me get out.
I can't swim with shoes on.

476
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,720
-Don't do what you're thinking about.
-I won't.

477
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,119
I knew it.

478
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
Of course you knew. You know why?
Because you can't help it.

479
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,680
Because we can hook up with other people,
we can be with other people,

480
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,599
but you and me...
will always be you and me, honey.

481
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,160
Right? Come on, give me a kiss.

482
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,720
-No.
-Kiss me.

483
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,799
Tomorrow, the house will be empty, OK?

484
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,920
Her parents are away.
Carla will be in class.

485
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,759
The code for the alarm is 1-6-4-9.

486
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,599
I'll text it to you later.

487
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,039
To get the watches, go up the stairs
to her parents' bedroom.

488
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,640
There is a bathroom
with a dressing room inside.

489
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,359
In the dressing room,
there'll be some drawers,

490
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
and the watches will be there.

491
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,680
1-6-4-9.

492
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,039
That's it.

493
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,400
-Bye.
-Bye.

494
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,359
-They told me to come.
-Really?

495
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,519
-I'm telling you.
-What a nice chat you're having.

496
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,720
He has a casting call tomorrow.

497
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,880
Did you set it up?

498
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, with my mother.

499
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,200
Of course you did. Thanks so much, man!

500
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,519
By the way, I don't know what to wear.

501
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,599
Well, the less you wear
and the more you show, the better.

502
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,039
Don't you think, Polo?
You like him better undressed, right?

503
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,599
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go to class.

504
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,920
Thanks a lot.

505
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,039
You're welcome.

506
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,920
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU GET THEM.

507
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,119
-No! Did you get it?
-You know me.

508
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,240
What's going on?

509
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,720
Nothing, Lu was telling me...

510
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
-She gets everything she wants.
-Don't say anything.

511
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,599
-What?
-I'm talking about Martín.

512
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,960
She has him eating out of the palm
of her hand.

513
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:16,880
Martín? Why?

514
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,559
-Tell her.
-No.

515
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,759
I'll tell you myself.

516
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,480
She got him connections in the embassy
to expedite the adoption process.

517
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,200
Seriously?

518
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,160
Yes, I'm his favorite again. As always.

519
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,119
Poor thing,
he was going about it the honest way,

520
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,599
but when you don't have money,
honesty's a luxury you can't afford.

521
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,920
Yeah.

522
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,960
Oh, Marina!
I'm really happy we're friends again.

523
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,160
Fucking great!

524
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,440
Don't you tell me...
That's a fucking bummer.

525
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
Damn girl...

526
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,839
Nothing to do all day.
They don't even let you use the Internet.

527
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,440
They needed to spice it up.

528
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Not at all.
I'm not sure why I wanted to go there.

529
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,440
I'm taking a shower,
and I'll be right there.

530
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,359
OK? See you in a bit.

531
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'VE GOT THEM.

532
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,720
Shit!

533
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,280
-Are you going to tell us?
-Tell you what?

534
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,840
-Carla and Lu tell each other everything.
-It was nothing. Just a mistake.

535
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,519
A mistake, period. Please, drop it.

536
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,119
-A mistake?
-A mistake.

537
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,639
-OK.
-Please.

538
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
OK.

539
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,800
It's your friend.

540
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,960
Hey.

541
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,199
How are you doing?
Aren't you going to say hi?

542
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
-I didn't know they'd be here.
-Should I tell them to sit?

543
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,400
-It's fucking obvious.
-So what if they see us talking?

544
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,880
-I wanna kiss you.
-Are you drunk or something?

545
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,840
-No.
-Ander, come sit.

546
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,400
-Come.
-Come on, sit.

547
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,320
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

548
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,679
OK. Look, I wanted to say...

549
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,360
as long as you don't sell any shit
to my friend, we're OK.

550
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,519
I support you.
Gay power and all that, OK?

551
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
-What are you doing?
-What do you think?

552
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,760
-Don't go. I'm giving you my blessing.
-Who asked for your blessing?

553
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,119
-Don't leave, please.
-Omar!

554
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,559
Blessing?
It's not like you're their best man.

555
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,559
Omar, they're my friends.

556
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,679
-Hi. What's wrong?
-Omar!

557
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,039
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

558
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,719
-What?
-I'm a bit nervous.

559
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,639
-Don't be. Why?
-I don't know.

560
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,239
-Wait for me. I'm out in five minutes.
-OK.

561
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,239
See you in a bit.

562
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,920
Omar, let's just talk about it.

563
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Why did you tell people we're together?
No, no.

564
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,199
Besides, where did you even get that idea?

565
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,840
-They're my friends.
-We're not together!

566
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,599
It's not happening, Ander.
Not now, not ever.

567
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,719
-I don't get why you're acting like this.
-Because I can't do this.

568
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,159
Too many people know.
Even my sister, man.

569
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:07,719
And you don't know my family.
If they knew, I'd break their hearts.

570
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:13,400
-I thought nobody dies of a broken heart.
-Hi.

571
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,519
Omar, right?

572
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,920
-Yeah.
-Can you sell me something?

573
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,840
I think we might need it.

574
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,159
-How much?
-It's on the house.

575
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,960
But be careful with it.

576
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:30,920
It's strong,
and we don't want you to get sick.

577
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:32,960
Thanks.

578
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,679
Everything OK?

579
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes.

580
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,559
Wait.

581
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,159
What do you think?
Are the lights too much?

582
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,280
No, it's nice.

583
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,159
I've got pot. You want some?

584
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,920
-No, we're fine.
-OK.

585
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
-Samuel...
-What?

586
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,079
More slowly.

587
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,320
OK.

588
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,639
Fuck!

589
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,320
What? Just relax.

590
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,400
I can't believe this.

591
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
I'm fucking it up.

592
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,679
-I'm fucking up.
-Lay down.

593
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,719
Samuel.

594
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,199
Yes?

595
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,639
I want to love you.

596
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,519
-Sorry.
-Relax.

597
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,440
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

598
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,159
I wasn't so bad, right?

599
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,880
No. You were great.

600
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,559
Really great.

601
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,840
Samuel, I should leave soon.

602
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:56,599
-My mom works tonight.
-Yes, but they're expecting me for dinner.

603
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,239
Don't freak out, but someone broke in.
They took the watches and...

604
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,119
they took mine, too.

605
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
Yes, everything is in there.

606
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,519
-What's all this?
-I have enough to pay it all off.

607
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,719
Where did you get them?

608
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,119
-Let's say Marina helped me open a door.
-What?

609
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,559
Why did you drag her into this?

610
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,159
Fuck! Why did she get involved?

611
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,679
Because she loves you. Why else?

612
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,800
I'm telling you, it's going to be okay.
So be happy for me,

613
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,480
because I'm fixing everything with this.
It's about time.

614
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,519
Pun intended. This one's for you.

615
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,400
-Put it away.
-It smells like rich people.

616
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,320
OK.

617
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Man.

618
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,239
I just wanted to make sure
you got home safe.

619
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,400
I had a great time.

620
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,800
We can talk before going to bed.

621
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,239
Bye.

622
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,679
Hi, Guzmán.

623
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,960
Hi.

624
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,639
How is your sister?
She didn't come to the first class.

625
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,199
-I guess she overslept. I'm not sure.
-Look who it is.

626
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,440
You were great in your pool last night.
Sometimes I forget how good we are in bed.

627
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,480
So you did it to tell everyone, right?

628
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,480
-You don't surprise me anymore, Lu.
-Was it a secret?

629
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,199
Well, I thought there were no secrets
between friends.

630
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,079
See you later.

631
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,400
Nadia...

632
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,280
-Don't worry.
-It was nothing.

633
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,599
-Just you?
-Yes.

634
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,719
Hey.

635
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,880
I called three times.
My name wasn't on the casting list.

636
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,079
In the end, it didn't work out.
My mom wasn't sure about you. Sorry.

637
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,159
Yeah, fucking great.

638
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,079
Did you really ruin that for him?

639
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:11,239
Yeah.
What's wrong? I don't owe him anything.

640
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Besides, I'm tired of him using us.
He wants to take advantage of us.

641
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,119
Like we're not using him?

642
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,880
What's really bothering you?

643
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,360
He only wants us for one thing.

644
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,679
-Right.
-In fact, he only wants you.

645
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,280
You're jealous.

646
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,960
What are you saying?

647
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,519
Marina.

648
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,000
How are you doing?

649
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,440
I kept calling you last night.
I called you this morning, too.

650
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:38,400
Is everything OK?

651
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,079
Yeah, I was just tired, and my phone died.

652
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,719
Sure.

653
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,760
Sure what, Samuel?
You don't believe me?

654
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,039
It's not that. I'm starting
to get the feeling you're avoiding me.

655
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,599
-Don't get paranoid, Samuel.
-Paranoid about what?

656
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,480
I'm starting to feel like an idiot.

657
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,599
If something is going on, don't lie.

658
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,760
The only thing I can't stand
is being lied to.

659
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,360
That's the only thing you can't stand?
Lies?

660
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,400
Fuck, you can't stand much!

661
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,800
Because lies make life easier.

662
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,639
To avoid pain, to avoid suffering.
To avoid hurting people.

663
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,639
-Drop it.
-I'm not sure... Marina!

664
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
Marina!

665
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,719
Marina!

666
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,559
That's my boy.
I didn't expect any less from you.

667
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,480
Marina!

668
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,000
Marina, are you OK?

669
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:16,920
-Fuck!
-Why did you argue?

670
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,119
I'd never been close to anyone
with HIV.

671
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,239
Marina!

672
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,360
Marina. What happened?
What are you doing? Go get help!

673
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,519
Marina, look at me.

674
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,519
Martín!

675
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,599
Look at me!

676
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,280
Move over, I've got this. Come on.

677
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:36,639
Can you hear me? Look at me.

678
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,960
Look at me. Follow my finger, please.

679
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,239
Marina!

680
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,280
Fuck, look at those pupils. Damn it.

681
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,239
What did you take, Marina?
What did you take?

682
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
What happened with Marina?

683
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,800
You know this means immediate expulsion?
We have a zero-tolerance drug policy.

684
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,840
-No, don't.
-I'm taking you to the nurse.

685
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,599
-I don't want to.
-We're going.

686
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:02,519
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.

687
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,239
Are you sure
you didn't have a relationship

688
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,719
with Marina outside of class?

689
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:09,760
No, of course not.

690
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,199
I'm taking her to the hospital.
Tell administration.

691
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,159
-Let's go.
-Martín, no! No!

692
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,639
If you tell anyone,

693
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,639
I'll tell them about your deal with Lu.
The adoption.

694
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,199
Wait.

695
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,679
Of course,
it's not fair what they did to her.

696
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,440
No one deserves that.

697
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,920
Did you hate Marina?

698
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,320
