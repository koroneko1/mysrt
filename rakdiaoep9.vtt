00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Why are you jumping rope here?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Why? You want me to jump on your roof?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is a dog in your mouth lonely? You seem to let him out all the time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm afraid that yours would be lonely so I let mine out to play with yours.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When'll you be done?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Next week.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Listen, if you want to exercise,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you can, there's plenty of space.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I want to exercise alone. Don't wanna share same air with anyone.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Why don't you exercise in graveyard then?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Nobody breathes there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well you're welcomed there!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What funny?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Your butts are sticking out too high. Are you trying to plank or finding something to eat?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Such a show off, you wanna compete planking with me?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Loser won't be able to use this area for work out for a week.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Deal.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
After you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'll share you half of my mat.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So you won't complain about it when you lost.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm sharing half of my mat with you. Step back.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Fine.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Like this?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.000
This is too close, step back a little more.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Half of it? / That's right.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.000
Okay / Step back. 50/50

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The government promotes 50/50 plan. Don't you know about it?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
50/50 like this?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Are you simply dumb or completely stupid?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Fine. I'm not teasing you anymore.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Ready? / Ready.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's do it / Come on.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
You're turning green now. Are you giving up?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Nope.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Fine.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Please go back into your house. I don't want to share air with anyone.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Fine.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Why so moody?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Hey! Gam called and she said that she's free this evening.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.000
Do you want to have dinner with her?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I told you that I'm busy. Stop pushing me.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
If you want her that bad, why don't you make her your girlfriend?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If dating men didn't work, maybe dating girls could work.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Are you alright?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I'm fine. When he's moody, he's always acting like this.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I've never seen a mad chihuahua before.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You seem to care about my feeling? Do you have any feeling for me?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I shouldn't have asked it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Hello, Pim, Bank, Tangmo.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.500
Hello.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What did you do? Why did you look so much in pain?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I was in an exercise competition with a dog.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now I know what 'dog' you are talking about.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It's you, right?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.000
That's right. I walked by his house yesterday, so he invited me to exercise with him.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I want to know how you ended up in work out competition with Mr. Darling.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.000
He took my work out spot so I challenged him with planking.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You lost. And now you called him a dog?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That's right. I can answer that for him. Before if he won, he would have walked in here all like.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Hey, I competed planking with Rak and I won. Woohoo!

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It would be like this, wouldn't it?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yes.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Do it one more time. You're good.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Did you just cut your fur?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
That's right. My owner said that it was too long. So I was just groomed.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm a human not a dog!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Hello, everybody.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.000
Hello / Hello

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Good morning. You're late.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Don't tell me that you're late because you got lost in my heart.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I'm sorry. Let's get the meeting started. Stop playing.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I called everyone for a meeting today

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Because I want your opinion on URFOOD application.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Do you think we should add anything?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I think Tangmo's food photos are too bland.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.000
The foods didn't look that yummy.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Tangmo, please add more colors into these.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Got it.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I want food vendors' logo to be bigger.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If the logo is bigger, then it'd be catchier than our logo.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It'd take up more space in the first page of the app.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Viewer's number would be decreased.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.000
But I already talked with vendors to make their logo larger.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If you want to see larger logo,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
then the vendors should invest in their own app.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.000
They shouldn't invest with URFOOD.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Don't be so sarcastic.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I'm not sarcastic. It's the truth.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
If they want larger logo,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
then they should make their own application.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
When you talk to the vendors, you need to act on behalf of the company, not for the vendors.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.600
Diao.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I was stating the truth.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
What do you want me for?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I think you need to watch your tone.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I saw your conversation with Dao yesterday.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
What did I say?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.000
You suggested Dao to date a girl if dating a guy didn't work for her.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Good thing that Dao didn't take it seriously.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.000
She didn't take it seriously, so it's not your business.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I just want to warn your tone and language.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Wait. You said that home stuff should be discussed at home.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
This is workplace.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Fine.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I think your tone with Bank in the meeting room

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
was too harsh.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
What harsh? I told you that I just said the truth.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's good that you said the truth but your word shouldn't hurt anyone.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
He didn't take it seriously either. This is all about work.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
He may not take it seriously, but if he takes it seriously one day,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
what do you think he would feel?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
How could I know? I'm not his emotional receiver.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That's all? Excuse me, I have work to do.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Because my boss asked me to revise many things on the app.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
He's too stubborn.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I should carry something to discipline him next time.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Excuse me/ Welcome.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I'm gonna nominate you to join UR Wish Boy contest.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So you could win three consecutive years.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Can I nominate one more person?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Who?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Diao! Did you see that?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Someone nominated you to join UR Wish Boy contest.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Don't be confused. UR Wish Boy is a company's activity

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
All employees will vote who's gonna win a popular vote.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
What? I'm popular here?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Not yet. You've just got nominated.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.000
Then it's gonna be decided how many people have voted for you.

00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:38.500
Your competitor is tough. He was a 2-time winner

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.500
and he is

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
my boyfriend.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Your boyfriend is popular among showgirls.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I'm not talking about my real boyfriend. I'm talking about the imaginary one.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.500
Don't say that it was Rak.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.500
That's right/ Yep.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
A smart mouth like him won two years in a row?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Are you talking about me again?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I wasn't talking about you. I was just admiring you that

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
a smart mouth like you won two years.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Were you bribing the judges ?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You won for two years because I wasn't there to compete with you.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But I'm gonna win UR Wish Boy this year for sure.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
If you're afraid to lose, you can always withdraw.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.500
Kanomthai / Yeah?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Please gather feedbacks from our latest ad that we just launched

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.000
I want to know what people said about it.

00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:44.000
Got it.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.000
Thank you.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Don't forget to book a doctor's appointment. In case you didn't win, and you needed the doctor to stitch up your face.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What's wrong with you? You want to use the bathroom?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I'm furious.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I was just bluffing earlier. But after he challenged me like that,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I'm gonna win UR Wish Boy and steal the prize from him. Just you wait.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I think you're making a mistake by challenging Rak in UR Wish Boy contest.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I'm not scared. I know everyone in the office.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And I'm sure that they don't hate me.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.000
Right. They don't hate you. But everyone loves Rak.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
A smart mouth with unfriendly face like him? What's to like?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I don't know about people in your office but we love him here because he's super kind.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:03.600
That's right.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Wait, what did he do?

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.000
Lisa was having stomachache the other day so I cleaned up all by myself.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
He saw that so he helped me.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
If I was there, I would have helped you too.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But he called a taxi for me

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and took me to the hospital.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.500
That's right.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Listen. He's not only kind to people he knows,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.000
but he's also kind to a stranger. There was an elderly about to cross a road,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
he went there and helped him.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
People carrying lots of stuff and he went there to help them.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
A dog was about to cross the road. He even protected him from cars.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Diao would have crossed the road to bite that dog.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Like this is my road. Move!

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.000
I'm not a dog.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Let me tell you something. Rak is not a kind person.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
He is super nosy.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I call this type of person a good person.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
That's right. Hey, you!

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.500
Talking to him!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Your heart is cold. You don't understand anything about being a good person.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That's right. I don't get it. You all need to pay for your foods. I'm not buying anymore.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
This movie looks so good. Do you want to watch it with me?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It looks good.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Dao.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Do you want to watch this film with me?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
You invite me to a movie? Can you pay for my ticket?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I can ask Rak for it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Go back to study.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Please love me. Love me, only me.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Hello / Hello

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.600
Hello.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You're such a good sister. You know that I'm hungry.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Can you pass me a fork?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You can get it yourself. And you can fix yourself a plate.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.000
Because this one is not for you.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Whose plate is this then?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You called me here? What's up?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Here's spaghetti.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
To thank you for helping me change light bulb the other day.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Thank you

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.500
You're welcome.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You want this dish? I can get a new one.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.600
I'm not hungry.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Chapter 6 : Love Note. After Ryo and Ryu start to live together in this pink fenced house.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
They continue to develop good feeling towards one another in every minute of every day.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.500
Yum

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
You don't have to feed me. I can eat it by myself.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I'm gonna take care of you.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
If you don't want to take a shower by yourself. Just tell me, I can give you a bath.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.500
Yum.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Please. I can feed myself.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.000
Don't be too stubborn.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yum.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Thank you.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
No problem.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
He didn't get the real taste of spaghetti

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
because he could only taste the sweetness from Ryo's love.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
You write this story and you still get blushed?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
It's not that surprise. It's so wholesome. I ruined my pillows reading it too.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
It's not just a pillow that she ruined. She ruined my t-shirts too.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Honey!

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.000
It would be better if Rak and Diao lived their lives like in your fiction.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.000
Don't say it out loud! Or they'd know that this story is based on their lives.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
They could be mad at me.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:47.600
Okay.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Hey, my friend. You're changing your mind and buying us dinner?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.000
Can I have stir-fried beef with basil? Cook with one cow!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
One cow?

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.000
Fine. I can buy you dinner. But you two need to help me tomorrow.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.600
What is it?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Help me to get everyone to vote for me.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
I don't want to lose to him.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
We really want to help you but we don't think we can.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Everyone in the office loves Rak. Like really love him.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Why's that?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.000
You can ask everyone in the office.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Tangmo / Yeah?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.000
I want to ask you something / What's up?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Why did you vote Rak to be UR Wish Boy?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Because he's kind. There's one thing that he really touched my heart.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
There was a heavy rain one day and my tires blew up.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Rak stood in the rain with me and helped me change my tires.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Boosting up his good image.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Boosting up what?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
You're painting a good image.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Tangmo / Yeah?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Do you have anything with him?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I was just greeting him.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
That's not true. He just asked me why I voted for you.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Tangmo!

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
That's my name.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Hi mom? Yep, I paid for utility bill already.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What? Rak gave blood to Kaew's mom?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
That's right. If my mom didn't get blood from him, I didn't even want to imagine it.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I couldn't compete with that. I'm scared of needles.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
What else did he do for you?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
When there's a tough time, he would…

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Kaew, a courier will come to get the document, please give it to him.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.600
Okay / Thank you.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Did you come here to ask Kaew why she voted for me?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Nope.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That's not true. You just asked me about this earlier.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
People here didn't lie at all?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Hi dad? Mom just called earlier.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Is he a Superman? He helps everyone.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.000
I asked everyone in the office and he helped everyone.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I told you. That's why he won popular vote for two consecutive years.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
But there's one thing that he doesn't help me.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
What's that?

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.000
He won't agree to be my boyfriend.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
He doesn't want to be your boyfriend because he's afraid of you.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.000
Dao.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Listen to me my dear brother. Don't compete with him.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
It seems like everyone in the office loves him so much.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
I don't think you can't beat him for sure.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.000
That's right / Right.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
We love you but you need to listen to Dao.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
You can't compete with him. You'd lose for sure.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.000
Yep / Yep

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I can finally think of something. When he is loved by everyone and I can't win for sure.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Then I'm gonna do anything to have him withdrawn from the competition.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.500
What?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Wait and see.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I see, he said to wait for his dad.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Wait and see.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
If I won UR Wish Boy,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
you'd have to sign for my probation to pass early.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
But if I lost, I'd resign.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
He's speechless? I'm dead serious like this, he'd withdraw for sure.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Fine. Deal.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
What did you just say?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
I just accepted your challenge.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
If you won, I'd sign for your probation to pass.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
But if you lost, then you'd resign.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Damn it.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I'm in big trouble.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.700
What is it?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I challenged Rak earlier and he accepted it.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.000
What's your challenge?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I challenged him that if I won, he'd sign for my probation to pass.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.000
But if I lost, I'd resign.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.500
What?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
What were you thinking?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
He takes this job seriously. I thought that if I used it against him,

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.000
he'd see that this was nonsense, and he'd withdraw.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.000
But he didn't and he accepted the challenge.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
This is pure stupidity.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I know that. Please help me.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I think you have two options. One, you should Google for new job already.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And two, you should crawl back to him and apologize.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
That's right. And you need to cancel the challenge.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And you need to swallow your pride

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
because I can't pay for the rent by myself if you resign.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I don't need to. I can just threaten him to cancel it or I'd kick him out of the house.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
He'd agree.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Where is your common sense?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.000
Or you just weren’t born with it?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
You don't have to threaten him or anything. You can just apologize to him.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.000
He's mature enough. He won't be mad at you.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
That's right. You can just say that you're sorry and you're only good at barking.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
You look straight right into his face and you do this.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
That's just too much. He wouldn't dare to do it.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.000
Listen to me. You don't have to do what she said.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
You can just lick his legs. That's be enough.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Stop joking around. I'd be in trouble with the rent.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Listen to me. You need to apologize to Rak. Now.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Fine.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Can you all come with me? / Sure.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Nope. You challenged him all by yourself,

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.000
so you need to apologize to him by yourself too.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
I can't lose my cool act.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Dao asked me to give you fruits.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Are you sure that Dao asked you to?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I'm sure of it. Why would I be the one giving you these?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Because you like me.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
That's the opposite. I dislike you very much.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Thank you for giving me this.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
No problem.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I told you that Dao asked me to give it to you.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Fine. Thanks her for me.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Wait.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
People who dislike each other won't hold one's arm.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Sorry.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Dao is so kind to you. Don't you feel bad for her.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
If I resign, she needs to pay for the rent by herself.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
So you know that you're gonna lose for me.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Nope. I just think that I shouldn't jeopardize my career like that.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.000
If I lost, then Dao'd be in trouble too.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
In fact, I don't think I'm gonna lose.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
If you're so sure about that, then our challenge shall remain.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
What ? That's not good.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
It's gonna be a mix of personal stuff and work stuff.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And you don't like that, do you?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
We should call it off, right?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Nope, I'm the man of my word.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I accept the challenge and I need to take it.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Hey!

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
It's not healthy to be this serious.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
You can't be a good politician being too serious like this.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.000
Don't change the subject. Our challenge will be the same.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
If you lost, you'd resign.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Fine! Our deal will be the same. Give it back to me. You don't deserve this.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Are you sure that you give brownie to everyone?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.000
Yep.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
I bribed everyone like you asked.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Don't say that. It didn't sound good.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I just want my co-workers to eat something good.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
That's such a coincidence. You handed out sweets on the same day of voting.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.000
It's the day before election.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Is the voting out yet?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Not yet. I keep refreshing and my screen's about to break now.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Is it out yet?

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.000
Wow. Guy looks good topless.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Stop paying attention at men for a second?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
My future depends on UR Wish Boy's voting score.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
It's out now.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.500
What?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.500
Diao.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
What is it?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
UR Wish Boy's score is out.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I lost. I need to resign.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Calm down. I don't think Rak would take your word seriously.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
You're like a little dog, all you do is barking.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
You shouldn't be that stupid.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
How could we pay for the rent?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I know that what I did was wrong. But what did you want me to do? I already made a deal with him.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I'm sorry. Mom and Dad wanted me to stay with you.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I didn't help you out and I brought you more trouble.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
They must be really disappointed in me.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Don't think like that.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
It's okay.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
We're gonna figure it out together.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Did you ask Rak nicely if he wanted you to resign?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Not yet. When I knew that I lost, I went straight back home.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
It's all in your head.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
You should ask him again if he really wants you to quit your job.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
No need to. He told me that he was the man of his word.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
He's gonna let me resign for sure.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
What should I do?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Should I threaten him to kick him out?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Maybe he won't fire me.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.500
Hey!

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
You have to do that?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Well, I lost to you. If I didn't use this method, I'd have to resign.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Can I talk to him for a second?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I need to thank you for not firing him.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
He didn't say anything back. Change of plan. I need to find a rich husband.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Come on in.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
We can talk outside.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
I don't want Dao to hear about it.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
You don't have to be nice to me. Just say it.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Do you really think I'm gonna let you resign because of our challenge?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
You said that you were the man of your word.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
What else should I think? You're gonna give me big bonus?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I think you should think before you speak.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
What do you mean?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
You like to burst out your idea. Have you heard of word controlling over you?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
You should think before you speak.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.000
I know.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
You're such a know-it-all. But you've never acted like one.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Fine. I'm wrong. What do you want me to do? Resign?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I've never thought about that.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Why did you accept my challenge?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
To give you a lesson. I want to warn you about Dao and Bank.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
You didn't listen to me so I needed to use this way.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Did you nominate me for the contest ?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
This is called thinking before speaking.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
You planned to trick me from the beginning?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
The others could understand it easily.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
But you need the harsher way.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
If you're too stubborn with me, I'm gonna spank you.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Then act like an adult. So I don't need to carry a stick.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Fine. So I don't have to resign?

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.000
Yep.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Why're you smiling?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I'm just happy. Even though you're barking like a little dog,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
you still worry about your sister and your parents.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Were you eavesdropping?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
I need to get an insight information.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
You're such a hypocrite.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.500
Wait.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:38.000
I'm a man of my word. Your punishment is decreased.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
But you still need to be punished.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
What is that?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
What do you want?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Why didn't you talk to me nicely?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
What do you want, boss?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Should you cook for me?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Nope. You're so bad at cooking.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Should you wash my clothes?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Nope, you normally asked Dao to do it for you.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Should you mop the floor? Nope, you'd just issue new rule for a revenge.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That's right. Think carefully. I can get back at you.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:53.000
That's right. You're a big dog in the house but I'm more powerful in the office.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I need to use that as my advantage.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Don't add salt or I won't let you pass the probation.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Wait a second, boss.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Here it is.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
You're good at making coffee.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
What else do you need?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Don't go. Just in case my hands get tired and I want you to feed me.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Please feed me my coffee? My hands are tired.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I change my mind. I'll do it.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Pae.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Why did Dao in Rak's room and wear his shirt?

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.000
I need to call you baby.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I'm gonna wash my clothes.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Rit knows about this? What about Diao?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Were you sleeping with Dao?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Please calm down.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Kanom told me everything.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Stop moving, or you'd get hurt.
