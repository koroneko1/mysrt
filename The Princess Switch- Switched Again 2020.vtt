00:10.916 --> 00:15.583
[sleigh bells jangling]

00:31.791 --> 00:33.541
[woman] You probably remember me.

00:33.625 --> 00:36.458
I'm Stacy, that baker from Chicago,

00:36.541 --> 00:39.833
who flew to Belgravia
to enter a baking contest,

00:39.916 --> 00:44.333
but then switched places with Margaret,
the Duchess of Montenaro,

00:44.416 --> 00:46.291
who looks just like me.

00:46.375 --> 00:49.291
I'm guessing you remember
I married Prince Edward,

00:49.375 --> 00:53.500
and you probably remember that Margaret
fell in love with my best friend Kevin.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.000
Cutest couple ever, right?

00:57.208 --> 01:00.125
But what you don't know,
is that since all of that happened,

01:00.208 --> 01:02.208
the King of Montenaro died,

01:02.291 --> 01:04.625
and Margaret is now
in line for the throne,

01:04.708 --> 01:08.166
which has royally messed up
everything in the romance department.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.833
I've been pretty busy,
but take it from me,

01:12.916 --> 01:15.458
happily ever after is never easy.

01:15.541 --> 01:19.583
-[chuckles] Especially for a princess.
-[crowd clamoring]

01:22.833 --> 01:25.375
[crowd cheering, applauding]

01:27.750 --> 01:32.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for!

01:32.083 --> 01:38.291
The final results of Belgravia's 59th
Annual International Baking Competition!

01:40.125 --> 01:45.333
And here to announce the winner
is head judge and past champion,

01:45.416 --> 01:50.458
Stacy De Novo Wyndham,
Princess of Belgravia!

01:51.125 --> 01:52.291
[in American accent]
Thank you.

01:57.708 --> 01:58.583
Thank you.

01:59.375 --> 02:00.958
We are so pleased

02:01.041 --> 02:05.291
that these incredible bakers have come
from all over the world this Christmas.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.625
[crowd cheering, applauding in distance]

02:08.708 --> 02:10.500
Christmas is about giving...

02:11.083 --> 02:12.750
[in distance]
...and this year's contestants

02:12.833 --> 02:16.875
have given us creativity,
excellence and artistry.

02:17.666 --> 02:19.750
So without further ado,

02:19.833 --> 02:24.166
our first prize winner is someone
I competed against two years ago.

02:24.708 --> 02:28.458
This year he has created a cake
that is very special to me.

02:29.625 --> 02:33.250
The first time I kissed my husband
Prince Edward was under the mistletoe.

02:35.958 --> 02:40.166
Everyone, give it up for Zach Brachmann
from Munich, Germany

02:40.250 --> 02:42.000
and his mistletoe masterpiece.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.875
[crowd cheering, applauding]

02:48.791 --> 02:50.291
Congratulations.

02:52.791 --> 02:53.875
Congratulations.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.833
You were positively charming today,
darling.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.291
All I did was hand out some ribbons.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.791
I'm just sorry I didn't get to see
the whole ceremony.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.041
Yeah, parliament ran over, yet again.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.916
It's all good.

03:22.916 --> 03:24.750
Well, I don't know if it is,

03:25.875 --> 03:28.625
with my taking on more
of the king's responsibilities

03:28.708 --> 03:31.875
and you running the royal charities
and your bake shop, there…

03:32.458 --> 03:34.250
There hasn't been much time
for the two of us.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.583
Well, what we do is important.

03:37.166 --> 03:40.000
We're important too.
I don't want to lose that.

03:41.541 --> 03:44.916
Well, the good news is we'll be
in Montenaro by the end of the week.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.041
-Hmm.
-We'll have plenty of time together.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.458
Christmas in Montenaro
sounds absolutely enchanting.

03:53.291 --> 03:54.291
It does.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.166
-But I'm worried about Margaret.
-Why?

03:58.250 --> 04:00.041
Well, have you seen this?

04:00.125 --> 04:02.166
[Edward]
"Is the Duchess ready to rule?"

04:02.708 --> 04:03.541
And this?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.541
Margaret never expected to be queen.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.500
Remember how much she hated the spotlight?

04:11.333 --> 04:13.708
Well, with her coronation
televised on Christmas Day,

04:13.791 --> 04:15.916
she's going to have to
get used to it pretty quickly.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.833
[chuckles]

04:17.708 --> 04:20.166
She just sounded so sad when I called her.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.166
King Dennis died

04:21.250 --> 04:23.291
-and Prince Howard abdicated so…
-Yeah.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.458
…like it or not, she's next
in the line of succession.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.375
Remind me, why are we talking
about Margaret again right now?

04:30.916 --> 04:33.583
Because I can't sleep when I'm worried.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.375
Well, there are…

04:36.583 --> 04:40.125
other things we might do
to relieve your anxiety

04:40.208 --> 04:42.000
besides talking about Lady Margaret.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.333
To tell you the truth.
I think she's not over Kevin.

04:44.416 --> 04:48.083
I mean, the breakup must have been
incredibly hard for both of them.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.916
-We could light a fire.
-She was about to move to Chicago.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.458
-We could open a bottle of wine?
-They were almost engaged.

04:53.541 --> 04:54.875
We could put on some music.

04:54.958 --> 04:56.583
Did you know Kevin
was shopping for a ring?

04:56.666 --> 04:58.000
-Stacy!
-What?

04:58.083 --> 05:01.666
They went their separate ways.
People do it all the time.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.375
I know. It's just…

05:04.208 --> 05:06.541
Olivia texts me every single day.

05:06.625 --> 05:09.208
She says that her dad's
miserable without Margaret.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.541
He turned down the invitation
to the coronation.

05:13.041 --> 05:16.291
-Apparently, he doesn't want to see her.
-Well, men never know what they want.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.125
I know what I want.

05:19.958 --> 05:21.541
I have a great idea.

05:22.291 --> 05:26.458
Why don't we take a teeny tiny
little detour to Chicago

05:26.541 --> 05:27.916
on our way to Montenaro?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.791
Oh, darling. I wish I could
get away sooner. I really do.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.750
But… Unless you want to go
to Chicago without me…

05:34.833 --> 05:37.000
[both laugh]

05:37.083 --> 05:41.666

Stacy?

06:05.166 --> 06:07.083
[Stacy chuckles] Hi!

06:07.166 --> 06:09.416
-I missed you!
-I missed you.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.708
Stacy! What are you doing here?

06:13.791 --> 06:16.750
I was in the neighborhood and thought
I'd check on my business partner.

-Ooh.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.583

comfortable.

06:29.416 --> 06:30.541
Yeah, it's all good.

06:30.625 --> 06:34.750
He hasn't gone on a date since
the breakup with you-know-who.

06:35.375 --> 06:37.750
I have a business to run. Remember?

06:37.833 --> 06:40.250
[Stacy] Come on, Kev.
Life isn't about working all the time.

06:40.791 --> 06:44.166
I know, which is why we're adopting
another cat for Christmas.

06:44.791 --> 06:45.875
Another cat?

06:45.958 --> 06:47.916
Yeah. You can never have too many cats.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.125
We need to talk.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.708
How about you go and wipe down
one of those tables over there?

[groans]

07:01.541 --> 07:03.375
So, what's up?

07:03.458 --> 07:07.083
Well, you're wearing sweatpants,
you won't date and you're collecting cats.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.208
And?

07:11.041 --> 07:15.000
Two years ago, you handed me
an invitation that changed my life.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.958
It's time for me to return the favor.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.958
Stace, Margaret and I
called it quits six months ago.

07:27.041 --> 07:30.625
Yeah, which is probably the dumbest thing
you've ever done in your life.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.166
We just didn't want
the same things anymore.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.958
Besides, I mean, she's moved on.
I've moved on.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.625
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.916
'Cause you don't look
like you've moved on.

07:41.583 --> 07:43.125
I've already sent the RSVP.

07:43.583 --> 07:47.250
[clears throat] About that RSVP…

07:49.125 --> 07:51.458
It kind of never made it to the mailbox.

07:53.166 --> 07:56.541
Kevin, go to the coronation as her friend.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.958
[sighs] I don't know.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.291
Inheriting the throne is huge.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.416
Margaret needs us to be there for her,
all of us.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.083
[Olivia] Please, Daddy.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.250
She's my friend too.

-Fine.
-[Olivia and Stacy giggle]

08:17.291 --> 08:20.291
Hey! Call the cat sitter.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.708
Maybe before we leave, you should get,
like, a haircut and a real pair of pants.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.125
What's wrong with these?

08:56.166 --> 08:57.458
Thank you, Frank.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.333
Wow.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.583

I'm so happy you're here.

09:09.458 --> 09:10.541
Me too.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.416
I was afraid you'd be too busy
to manage it.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.458
-Oh, nonsense.
-There's no way we'd miss your coronation.

09:16.541 --> 09:18.208
Which is exactly what I told her.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.416
Mrs. Donatelli, you look amazing.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.583
Oh, thank you. And you look positively
radiant, Your Royal Highness.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.583
Well, Stacy was born to be a princess.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.583
It feels like ages since I saw you.

09:30.666 --> 09:34.375
Well, we're here now
and, uh, we brought you a little surprise.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.750
-Olivia!
-Margaret!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.291
Look at you! Oh!

09:44.958 --> 09:46.666
She's grown up since you last saw her.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.708
Indeed she has.

09:49.916 --> 09:52.708
When we didn't receive your RSVP,
we weren't sure you were coming.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.041
I hope it's okay that we're here…

09:55.541 --> 09:56.500
as friends.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.458
[chuckles]

09:58.125 --> 10:00.791
Of course, it is. As friends.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.250
Can we see your palace?

10:02.333 --> 10:03.791
-[laughs]
-[Margaret] Right this way.

10:05.333 --> 10:06.166
Hello!

10:22.875 --> 10:24.708
[Stacy]
Margaret, why is everything covered?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.375
I haven't quite settled in yet.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.083
Isn't there a Christmas Ball coming up?

10:29.208 --> 10:33.250
There is, but I stopped the staff
from decorating the residence.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.833
Honestly, I was thinking of canceling
the festivities…

10:37.458 --> 10:40.375
-the concert, the ball, all of it.
-Why?

10:40.458 --> 10:42.125
It doesn't seem right.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.750
The country is still mourning
the loss of their king.

10:44.833 --> 10:47.458
-It's also celebrating its new queen. 
-Yeah!

10:47.541 --> 10:50.333
The people are looking to you
as their new ruler, Lady Margaret.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.916
You're their hope for the future.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.541
Well, the problem is I don't know
if I'll ever feel at home here.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.041
Well, I don't know.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.708
A palace can feel quite cozy when you
share it with people you love.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.500
Well, I suppose it can.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.166
If you ask me, this place is in need
of some serious Christmas cheer.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.708

12:55.166 --> 12:57.125
I suppose I could give it a whirl.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.500
So… where is the kitchen?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.375
This way.

13:08.833 --> 13:09.750
[Stacy giggles]

13:10.375 --> 13:11.416
-Good thinking.
-Thank you!

13:11.500 --> 13:12.333
Yes!

13:22.666 --> 13:26.666
Okay. We need sugar,
powdered cocoa, milk and vanilla.

13:26.750 --> 13:27.833
All right.

13:30.541 --> 13:33.166
You've, uh... never been
in here before, have you?

13:33.750 --> 13:35.125
Of course I have.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.708
Let's check the refrigerator.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.750
Dear me, it's empty.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.416
Okay, good one.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.375
[Margaret] This shouldn't be too hard.

13:49.708 --> 13:52.083
-Ah. The sugar's behind the flour.
-[Kevin] I'll get it.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.166
-It's quite all right.
-It'll be easier if I get it.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.083
I told you--
[gasps]

13:56.166 --> 13:58.458
-[Margaret laughs]
-[spits, coughs]

13:59.041 --> 14:00.625
-Not funny.
-No.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.083
You want funny? I can give you funny.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.625
-No!
-No.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.583
[laughing]

14:09.375 --> 14:11.333
[squealing, laughing continues]

14:15.208 --> 14:17.041
[Antonio]
What in the world is going on here?

14:17.125 --> 14:18.375
Antonio!

14:18.458 --> 14:20.708
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow morning.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.208
I hope I'm not interrupting.

14:23.791 --> 14:26.541
-Not in the least.
-[Antonio] There's just so much to review.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.916
I thought we should get a jump on things
over a cup of tea.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Of course.

14:31.916 --> 14:32.833
Kevin Richards.

14:33.458 --> 14:36.750
Forgive me.
This is Antonio Rossi, my Chief of Staff.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.083
-I'd shake your hand, but--
-No worries.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.375
-My pleasure.
-Go.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.000
I got it.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.333
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.041
Well, all right.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.041
Now, about the concert on Christmas Eve,

14:52.125 --> 14:54.583
it would mean so much
to everyone if you attended,

14:55.458 --> 14:56.833
especially to the children.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.791
All right, I'll go.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.875
As long as there are no speeches.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.750
No speeches. I promise.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.208
Just a brief reception after and…

15:06.291 --> 15:09.708
all you have to do is smile
and shake some hands.

15:09.791 --> 15:11.916
Did you confirm my meeting
with the Treasury Secretary?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.750
He'll be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.833
And I'll be there as well.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.291
Tony…

15:18.791 --> 15:21.166
did you always attend
cabinet meetings with the king?

15:21.750 --> 15:22.708
Not always.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.875
But I thought
you could use a little guidance.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.375
Maybe I overstepped.

15:28.458 --> 15:29.458
Not at all.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.208
But I have to learn
to do this on my own.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.541
I have been training
for the past six months.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.791
I just want you to know I'm here for you,
whatever you need,

15:38.791 --> 15:40.500
whenever you need me.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.125
That's very sweet.

15:44.708 --> 15:46.208
[ornaments clattering]

15:48.291 --> 15:49.541
-[chuckles]
-[ornament jangles]

15:51.791 --> 15:55.208
I'm just bringing a few extra things
for the-- for the mantle.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.458
Like tinsel.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.625
You can never have enough tinsel!

16:00.833 --> 16:03.208
At least that's what
my nana used to say.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.708
She was a big fan. Really big.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.166
-Of tinsel?
-[Stacy] Yeah!

16:08.250 --> 16:09.250
The biggest.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.166
She used it for everything.

16:13.250 --> 16:16.125
You know, once she knitted me
a tinsel sweater.

16:18.208 --> 16:20.333
Anyways, don't mind me.
I'm just gonna…

16:47.666 --> 16:48.666
[knocking]

16:52.250 --> 16:53.166
Come in.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.541
Hey, um...

16:57.291 --> 16:58.916
can I borrow some hairspray?

17:00.333 --> 17:02.625
I thought you don't do hairspray.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.916
Oh, I don't. Just on special occasions.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.833
Ah.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.250
And will you be wearing your nana's
tinsel sweater to the ball this evening?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.166
[sighs] Ah...

17:12.541 --> 17:13.875
I forgot to pack it.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.958
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.375
Uh...

17:20.375 --> 17:22.708
What's the deal with you and Antonio?

17:23.458 --> 17:25.208
I've known Antonio forever.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.500
We went to school together.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.416
And now he works for you?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.833
He served the late king
for the last three years.

17:31.916 --> 17:34.041
Seemed prudent to keep him in place.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.166
Why do you ask?

17:35.791 --> 17:37.916
No reason. I just…

17:38.000 --> 17:41.833
saw the two of you in the dining room,
and you looked kinda…

17:41.916 --> 17:42.750
cozy.

17:44.041 --> 17:46.166
Tony's been an enormous help to me.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.083
And are you two a thing?

17:49.541 --> 17:51.750
We've had a few business dinners.

17:51.833 --> 17:52.666
That's all.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.291
But he's very dear.

17:55.416 --> 17:56.500
And very handsome.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.416
You know, Kevin has been looking
pretty hot these days.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.208
Yes, he has.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.958
But you know
things didn't work out between us

18:08.541 --> 18:11.500
and I can't spend my life
wishing things had turned out differently.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.458
Maybe it's time for a second chance?

18:17.333 --> 18:18.625
It's late.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.375
We'd better be getting ready.

18:20.458 --> 18:23.041
-The ball starts in two hours.
-Yeah, okay.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.333
Stacy…

18:27.416 --> 18:29.000
did Kevin say anything?

18:29.583 --> 18:30.625
About what?

18:30.708 --> 18:35.125
About, well, his feelings for me?

18:35.208 --> 18:36.083
[chuckles]

18:37.958 --> 18:39.458
You should ask for yourself.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.208
[guests chattering]

18:49.375 --> 18:51.375
[guests laughing, chatting]

19:02.000 --> 19:05.250
Has anyone ever told you
you were born to wear a tuxedo?

19:06.708 --> 19:07.958
-You...
-Oh.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.291
...every time I wear a tuxedo.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.666
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

19:12.791 --> 19:15.708
I hate to interrupt
the smooch fest, but…

19:16.916 --> 19:17.750
ta-da!

19:18.375 --> 19:21.666
-That is one serious party dress!
-Right? And look at my dad.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.333
-Ta-da!
-You'd better.

19:27.208 --> 19:33.375
[fanfare trumpeting]

19:34.291 --> 19:39.500
Her Royal Highness,
Lady Margaret Delacourt.

19:40.791 --> 19:43.333
[playing fanfare]

19:43.416 --> 19:45.333
[guests applauding]

20:02.458 --> 20:04.541
-[man] Your Highness.
-[woman] Your Highness

20:04.625 --> 20:05.666
Now's your moment.

20:06.416 --> 20:09.458
-My moment for what?
-Ask her to dance.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.000
-Go. Kevin!
-[Kevin] Uh...

20:12.083 --> 20:12.916
[Edward chuckles]

20:17.375 --> 20:20.666
I must say you are the most beautiful
monarch in the history of Montenaro.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.125
Oh...

20:24.250 --> 20:28.000
I've heard that our first queen,
Judith the Brave, rivaled Helen of Troy.

20:28.083 --> 20:31.041
Yeah, but her dance moves
really sucked, though.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.000
[laughs]

20:32.583 --> 20:34.166
Let's show them how it's done.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.625
All right. If you'll excuse me.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.333
Here we go.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.541
[classical arrangement
of "Silent Night" playing]

20:55.625 --> 20:58.500
I'm really happy
you decided to be a part of all this.

20:58.958 --> 20:59.791
Me too.

21:01.041 --> 21:02.958
To tell you the truth, I…

21:04.541 --> 21:06.458
wasn't sure we could still be friends.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.250
Yeah, things got complicated
after the whole queen thing happened.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.500
I suppose they did.

21:14.375 --> 21:18.375
Things used to be so spontaneous for us.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.750
Well, here's an idea.
Why don't we go back to spontaneous?

21:22.458 --> 21:23.291
How?

21:23.375 --> 21:26.458
Well, if you have time tomorrow,
maybe we can go for a drive.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.333
As friends?

21:28.416 --> 21:30.291
Sure, as friends.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.125
Sounds like a lovely idea.

21:41.250 --> 21:44.958
What could possibly come between two
people who look at each other like that?

21:45.041 --> 21:48.833
[in British accent] Yo, let's get
this party started, shall we?

21:56.541 --> 21:57.750
Excuse you.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.375
Announce me.

22:00.458 --> 22:01.458
-I--
-Do the thing.

22:01.541 --> 22:02.541
[scoffs] Never mind.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.833
[gasps]

22:04.666 --> 22:05.791
Uh...

22:06.083 --> 22:08.375
[coos] Maggie Moo!

22:09.791 --> 22:11.125
-[laughs softly]
-Ooh!

22:12.250 --> 22:14.000
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

22:14.750 --> 22:15.750
Here we go.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.375
-Must we really do this?
-Pics or it didn't happen.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.666
Say fromage!

22:24.750 --> 22:25.625
[camera clicks]

22:27.291 --> 22:28.166
[groans]

22:28.250 --> 22:30.250
Double chin! That's a delete.

22:30.708 --> 22:34.958
But no worries, it happens.
Not to me, but it happens.

22:35.541 --> 22:39.333
Fiona, I'm so… elated you could make it.

22:39.416 --> 22:43.166
Oh, you certainly have learned
how to throw a party. So proud of you.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.375
Proceeds from tonight's event
go to one of the royal charities.

22:46.916 --> 22:49.416
There's an orphanage
in particular need, St. Michael's.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.708
We're running a toy drive.

22:50.791 --> 22:54.500
Of course you are,
you cute little Mother Teresa.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.041
How long are you in town for?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.041
Until your big day.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.416
And then we jet off
to Capri for the New Year's,

23:02.500 --> 23:06.875
but I fully intend to spend as much time
as possible with my favorite little cuzzy.

23:06.958 --> 23:08.666
[chuckles] Lucky me.

23:09.625 --> 23:11.708
Well, hello, tuxedo man.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.208
Me?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.250
This is my friend Kevin,

23:16.333 --> 23:20.958
his daughter Olivia, Princess Stacy
and Prince Edward of Belgravia.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.958
Everyone,
this is my cousin Fiona Pembroke.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.916
Pembroke as in Lord Percival Pembroke?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.333
-The one who died of a peanut allergy?
-[Margaret] Her father, my uncle.

23:31.416 --> 23:33.291
Oh my God,

23:34.166 --> 23:37.083
you're the one who switched
places with my cuzzy!

23:37.166 --> 23:38.916
[chuckles] That's me.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.416
You two seriously look like twins! Spoopy!

23:43.541 --> 23:44.541
It means spooky.

23:45.708 --> 23:50.625
Have you two done the switch thing since
you tied the knot with his Royal Hotness?

23:50.708 --> 23:52.500
-[Edward chuckles]
-Fiona, please!

23:53.708 --> 23:55.583
Minions, I need more champagne.

23:58.041 --> 24:00.166
[scoffs] Reggie, Mindy!

24:00.750 --> 24:02.458
Oh yeah, gorgeous.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.000
Oh, it's such a pain
to find good help these days.

24:08.750 --> 24:09.625
You're yummy.

24:10.875 --> 24:11.750
[growls]

24:13.041 --> 24:14.250
Wow!

24:14.333 --> 24:16.625
I mean, I can see the family resemblance.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.500
You can't miss it.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.791
But is she really related to you?

24:21.583 --> 24:23.625
Fiona's always been a free spirit.

24:24.208 --> 24:26.666
She inherited quite the fortune
when my uncle died.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.416
Guessing there isn't much of it left.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.708
[Margaret] There isn't.

24:29.791 --> 24:32.958
Though she still has the old
Pembroke Estate in the country.

24:33.041 --> 24:36.708
She keeps Reggie and Mindy on staff,
but I've no idea how she pays them.

24:36.791 --> 24:39.375
Your Highness,
I apologize for disturbing you.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.458
The Prime Minister is asking for you.

24:41.541 --> 24:42.375
Of course.

24:43.541 --> 24:45.708
I have a meeting
with the Treasury tomorrow morning.

24:45.791 --> 24:47.208
Shall we say two o'clock?

24:47.833 --> 24:48.666
You got it.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.250
[men] Cheers.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.000
[woman] Mm, lovely.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.916
-[man] Are you having a good time?
-[woman 1] Yes, I am.

25:01.708 --> 25:02.708
Oh, stop it!

25:03.041 --> 25:06.708
[indistinct chatter]

25:06.791 --> 25:07.958
[woman 2] So sweet.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.041
[woman 2 giggles]

25:21.041 --> 25:22.333
Is that all of it?

25:22.916 --> 25:24.625
The place was dripping with money.

25:29.041 --> 25:30.500
[gasps] How did you…

25:32.416 --> 25:35.625
-[groans] Never mind. And you?
-Hmm.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.708
Explain to me how this is
going to pay for a summer in Capri.

25:40.791 --> 25:43.791
-It's double ply.
-And your point is?

25:43.875 --> 25:46.000
It's double ply!

25:46.875 --> 25:48.750
I'm so tired of this!

25:48.833 --> 25:52.208
If you're tired, Mindy,
then come up with something better.

25:52.291 --> 25:55.000
I can't be the looks
and brains of this operation.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.166
I thought I was the looks!

25:56.250 --> 25:58.416
And that's why you're not the brains.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.291
Why can't you be the one who gets to be
queen instead of your stupid cousin?

26:02.375 --> 26:03.625
Then we'd be set for life.

26:03.708 --> 26:05.291
Just stop talking.

26:06.083 --> 26:06.916
Leave me.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.125
[door opens]

26:16.541 --> 26:17.458
[sighs]

26:19.208 --> 26:20.208
[door closes]

26:31.750 --> 26:33.208
[door opens]

26:33.958 --> 26:34.875
[door closes]

26:37.583 --> 26:39.000
How was the Treasury meeting?

26:39.666 --> 26:41.833
I've spent the last several months

26:41.916 --> 26:45.208
analyzing the impact
of tariffs on the trade deficit.

26:46.375 --> 26:48.166
No one's even asked for my opinion.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.291
They will.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.125
How do you know?

26:51.708 --> 26:52.833
Because I know you.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.333
Margaret…

26:57.750 --> 26:59.625
I've been thinking, and, um…

27:00.500 --> 27:01.458
[Antonio] There you are.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.625
I've been looking everywhere for you.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.458
[Margaret] Is everything all right?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.541
I hate to bother you… again.

27:09.333 --> 27:13.166
But… there's an urgent matter
requiring your immediate attention.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.125
We'll be back in an hour.

27:15.708 --> 27:16.583
[chuckles]

27:16.958 --> 27:18.541
It really can't wait.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.416
I'm so sorry.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.166
Hey. Do what you have to.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.583
I thought there was something urgent.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.833
There is, but it's not what you think.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.458
I knew if I didn't do this now,
I'd lose my nerve.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.458
What's this all about?

27:58.916 --> 28:00.916
Margaret, I'd be lying…

28:01.791 --> 28:05.166
if I told you I served you
only out of a sense of duty.

28:06.791 --> 28:10.291
You're not just about to become
the Queen of Montenaro,

28:11.958 --> 28:14.125
you've also become
the queen of my heart.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.125
Tony.

28:16.875 --> 28:17.708
This is for you.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.125
I was going to give it
to you at Christmas,

28:21.208 --> 28:23.583
but… I want you to have it now.

28:26.750 --> 28:27.666
Oh.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.375
It's beautiful.

28:33.333 --> 28:37.125
We've been friends
for a long time now, you and I…

28:38.541 --> 28:42.041
but lately I've been wishing
we could be something more.

28:45.583 --> 28:47.000
Oh. I, uh...

28:48.583 --> 28:51.000
I really don't know what to think.

28:52.541 --> 28:54.750
I'm rather confused about everything.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.000
Does…

28:58.541 --> 29:01.583
everything include that friend of yours?

29:02.333 --> 29:03.333
I don't know.

29:05.250 --> 29:06.125
Maybe…

29:07.291 --> 29:08.125
Margaret…

29:09.916 --> 29:11.125
it's all right.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.333
It's such a relief to hear you say that.

29:14.916 --> 29:19.291
You know, we'd make a fantastic couple,
you and I.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.708
-Everyone says so.
-[laughs]

29:23.958 --> 29:26.083
Just promise me…

29:26.791 --> 29:28.208
you'll at least consider it.

29:31.541 --> 29:32.375
All right.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.416
What was I supposed to say?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.500
I thought you and Antonio
weren't a thing.

29:39.583 --> 29:40.541
We're not,

29:41.333 --> 29:43.625
but Tony's been a huge help to me.

29:44.291 --> 29:46.375
Don't you think
he's trying just a little too hard?

29:46.458 --> 29:47.291
[laughs]

29:47.791 --> 29:50.875
Tony's always spent a bit
too much on things he shouldn't,

29:50.958 --> 29:52.750
but we've known each other
since university.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.125
But maybe he's right.

29:56.708 --> 29:58.458
Maybe we could be good for each other.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.166
You and Kevin are good for each other.

30:01.250 --> 30:04.125
There's so much water
under the bridge, Stacy.

30:04.958 --> 30:08.375
Kevin and I haven't even begun to talk
about what went wrong between us,

30:08.458 --> 30:12.333
and every time we try, we never get
a chance to finish our conversation.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.625
I don't know if we ever will.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.750
Well, maybe you need to try harder.

30:18.041 --> 30:20.541
Is love really supposed
to take so much effort?

30:21.166 --> 30:24.458
Look, I know it in my heart.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.791
You and Kevin are meant to be.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.250
And I used to know it too,

30:30.125 --> 30:32.583
but maybe all we're meant to be
is a happy memory.

30:42.458 --> 30:44.500
I got your message. You wanted to see me?

30:45.666 --> 30:46.666
I did.

30:46.750 --> 30:47.875
Thank you for coming.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.750
-What's up?
-This is terribly hard to say,

30:53.791 --> 30:54.958
but here it is.

30:56.291 --> 30:59.000
I'm not sure
you're being fair to Lady Margaret.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.166
You want to explain that?

31:01.958 --> 31:06.000
I know the two of you
were involved for a time and…

31:06.958 --> 31:10.125
I can tell the relationship
was very meaningful.

31:10.791 --> 31:11.791
But, uh…

31:13.500 --> 31:14.833
But what?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.541
Could it be that you're holding her back?

31:20.541 --> 31:23.000
If that's the way she felt, she'd tell me.

31:23.083 --> 31:24.500
Yeah, uh...

31:26.041 --> 31:28.541
Lady Margaret's very confused right now.

31:29.541 --> 31:32.833
I'm certain she doesn't want
to hurt your feelings, but, uh…

31:33.625 --> 31:35.958
have you really considered
what's best for her?

31:38.041 --> 31:41.041
Let me guess, you're what's best for her?

31:42.041 --> 31:46.083
Look, I know you care deeply for her,
Mr. Richards, but…

31:46.166 --> 31:49.125
when affairs of state overwhelm her,

31:49.208 --> 31:52.791
are you really sure
you're the one she should turn to?

31:53.875 --> 31:56.041
You're a baker from Chicago,

31:56.875 --> 31:58.500
and I'm certain a very good one,

31:59.333 --> 32:03.958
but… are you truly
a consort for a queen?

32:09.625 --> 32:10.458
[knocking]

32:10.541 --> 32:11.416
[Stacy] Come in.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.333
Hey, what's up, kiddo?

32:14.916 --> 32:15.958
[Olivia] We gotta talk.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.208
Now!

32:20.583 --> 32:21.708
About what?

32:21.791 --> 32:26.250
Operation "Get Dad Back Together With
Margaret," it's going to crash and burn.

32:26.375 --> 32:27.708
Yeah, tell me about it.

32:27.791 --> 32:30.000
But I have an idea.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.041
You want us to do what?

32:34.125 --> 32:35.500
Switch places again.

32:36.125 --> 32:39.250
You said you needed more time
to talk things over with Kevin,

32:39.333 --> 32:41.916
but you can't do that
because you're too busy.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.375
So Stacy can be you,

32:44.458 --> 32:47.291
and you and my dad
can spend some quality time together.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.166
It's terribly risky.

32:49.250 --> 32:52.708
It was risky the last time
and you're the one who thought of it.

32:52.791 --> 32:56.458
Yes, but you're a princess now
and I'm about to become queen.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.958
We can't just stop everything
and swap lives.

33:00.041 --> 33:01.041
Why not?

33:01.916 --> 33:03.875
With everything
that's going on with Tony--

33:03.958 --> 33:04.958
[Stacy] Margaret…

33:06.125 --> 33:08.708
If you know for sure
that it's over with Kevin

33:08.791 --> 33:11.041
and you want to get serious with Antonio,

33:11.125 --> 33:13.541
we won't say another word about this.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.375
Do you really think we could pull it off?

33:16.958 --> 33:17.833
Again?

33:18.708 --> 33:21.833
Well, the only thing on your schedule
tomorrow is the Christmas concert.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.583
All you have to do
is sit and wave to people.

33:24.666 --> 33:27.166
Yeah, and when it's over Mrs. Donatelli
will walk you--

33:27.250 --> 33:31.000
I mean, me, through the reception
and then it's back to the palace.

33:31.083 --> 33:34.625
That way, you and Kevin have
plenty of alone time together.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.416
And then we switch back.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.375
I suppose it could work.

33:41.291 --> 33:42.541
Does that mean you'll do it?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.416
Did you talk this over with Kevin?

33:47.000 --> 33:47.833
[laughs]

33:48.333 --> 33:50.500
Did you talk this over with Margaret?

33:50.583 --> 33:53.125
Yeah, and she's good to go if you are.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.458
[sighs] I don't know.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.625
-Maybe she's better off with Antonio.
-[Stacy groans]

33:59.958 --> 34:00.958
He's a nice guy.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.333
-Yeah, well, you're a nicer guy.
-Yeah!

34:05.208 --> 34:06.041
[scoffs]

34:07.750 --> 34:09.541
Did you tell Edward about this?

34:09.625 --> 34:12.833
The less people who know, the better.

34:12.916 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, I'll fake a cold or something.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.416
Look, it'll only be for a few hours.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.958
Okay, and I'll tell him everything
as soon as it's over.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.833
You need to do this, Daddy.

34:31.208 --> 34:32.416
If Margaret's in…

34:33.458 --> 34:34.333
-I'm in.
-Yay!

34:34.416 --> 34:35.583
[squeals, grunts]

34:35.666 --> 34:37.791
[all laughing]

34:44.125 --> 34:46.625
Oh, there you are, darling!
Been looking all over for you!

34:46.708 --> 34:49.500
Oh, well, you know me. Always busy!

34:49.583 --> 34:52.791
-Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.
-Can we talk about it later?

34:52.875 --> 34:57.125
I was just on my way to the kitchen
to do some Christmas baking.

34:57.208 --> 35:00.000
Well, I was actually hoping
we might be able to find a moment

35:00.083 --> 35:01.583
to do something together.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.875
We will. I promise. As soon
as I'm done in the kitchen, okay?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.208
Why the change of clothes?

35:09.166 --> 35:10.541
Oh, what, these old things?

35:11.333 --> 35:13.791
I am donating them to the orphanage.

35:13.875 --> 35:16.041
I better get them to Frank.
He's coordinating everything.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.541
Didn't I get you that scarf
last Christmas?

35:19.208 --> 35:24.375
You did. I love it so much, I got
another one to donate to the orphans.

35:24.958 --> 35:27.875
Yeah. I love you. Bye.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.416
No.

[makes buzzing noise]

36:12.875 --> 36:14.250
I figured it out.

36:14.333 --> 36:15.458
Figured what out?

36:15.541 --> 36:17.416
Well, our big score.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.250
I'm listening.

36:19.333 --> 36:22.916
Remember when you said
if I were Margaret, we'd be set?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.416
Uh--
[laughs]

36:24.500 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, but, um… you're not Margaret.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.458
Well, of course
I'm not Margaret, Einstein.

36:30.041 --> 36:33.375
But, if Betty Crocker from Belgravia
could pull the switch,

36:34.250 --> 36:35.250
why can't I?

36:35.833 --> 36:37.375
I'm not feeling it.

[groans]

My Ariana Grande phase.

36:44.958 --> 36:45.791
[Reggie] Hmm.

36:46.750 --> 36:50.375
I wouldn't have to do it for long, just
long enough to get crowned queen

36:50.458 --> 36:54.791
and transfer a small fortune to an
unnumbered bank account in the Caymans.

36:54.875 --> 36:57.000
Oh, I'm starting to feel it!

36:57.083 --> 37:01.416
Then we spend the rest of our lives
sipping piña coladas on a beach

37:01.500 --> 37:04.458
in a country that doesn't have
an extradition policy.

37:04.541 --> 37:06.416
Yeah, baby!

37:06.708 --> 37:10.250
You're first cousins, so you know
the family history, right?

37:10.333 --> 37:11.166
Hmm.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.625
You're welcome,
and you grew up here with Margaret

37:14.708 --> 37:16.708
before you went to school in the States.

37:16.791 --> 37:21.541
So, we do the hair, we lose the nails
and the contouring,

37:21.625 --> 37:23.541
which is the only thing
giving her cheekbones.

37:23.625 --> 37:24.458
Excuse you!

37:24.541 --> 37:28.125
And no one's gonna notice
the little extra junk in the trunk.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.416
-What are you saying?
-Hey, I'm agreeing with you!

37:30.500 --> 37:31.416
Hold on!

37:31.958 --> 37:34.541
We've got a big, big problem here.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.166
Well, spit it out.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.666
Cousin Mags ain't gonna go along
with any of this.

37:39.750 --> 37:43.333
Which is why you'll have to grab her
and stash her somewhere.

37:43.416 --> 37:44.666
And to do that,

37:44.750 --> 37:47.083
I'm gonna need to know
exactly where she's gonna be

37:47.166 --> 37:49.875
and what she's gonna be doing
for the next few days.

37:49.958 --> 37:52.791
That shouldn't be
terribly difficult to find out.

-No worries, Royal Six-Pack.

38:18.250 --> 38:20.833
Can you tell Maggie
I've got something for her orphans?

38:21.416 --> 38:24.000
How… generous.

38:24.083 --> 38:25.208

51:36.125 --> 51:38.500
I thought we were going to live
the simple life.

51:40.041 --> 51:43.416
You, me, and Olivia,
you know, take things easy.

51:44.125 --> 51:45.333
Be spontaneous.

51:46.708 --> 51:50.291
Things were going good until your cousin
decided he didn't want to be king.

51:51.500 --> 51:55.333
I know that this whole royal affair
isn't what you want.

51:56.291 --> 51:57.833
But it's who I am now.

51:58.625 --> 52:00.041
I can't give it up.

52:02.166 --> 52:05.458
But the truth is
I don't want to give it up.

52:07.750 --> 52:10.208
It's become more than just a duty for me.

52:11.041 --> 52:12.666
I love this country.

52:13.375 --> 52:14.500
I love the people.

52:15.833 --> 52:18.500
This is something
that I was destined to do.

52:19.708 --> 52:20.958
It's who I am now.

52:24.208 --> 52:25.041
I know.

52:25.833 --> 52:28.416
-And I don't want you to give it up.
-You don't?

52:28.500 --> 52:29.500
No.

52:30.166 --> 52:31.875
You're gonna be a great queen.

52:34.583 --> 52:35.541
The thing is…

52:38.208 --> 52:39.750
I just don't want to hold you back.

52:40.458 --> 52:42.458
How could you ever hold me back?

52:45.083 --> 52:47.000
You need someone who's your equal.

52:47.958 --> 52:49.500
Someone who knows the ropes.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.708
Antonio's all that.

52:53.791 --> 52:54.666
I'm not.

52:56.458 --> 52:57.541
Don't you see?

52:58.583 --> 53:00.541
None of that matters.

53:01.583 --> 53:03.458
You're the one I love,

53:04.166 --> 53:05.125
not Tony.

53:05.916 --> 53:09.625
You don't have to be a count
or a prince or a king.

53:11.458 --> 53:12.750
You just need to be…

53:14.000 --> 53:14.833
you.

53:19.041 --> 53:20.291
Are you sure about that?

53:21.000 --> 53:24.541
I was heartbroken when you said
you just wanted to be friends.

53:25.333 --> 53:27.291
I only said that because you said that.

53:27.833 --> 53:31.375
[both laughing]

53:32.416 --> 53:33.333
Oh.

53:34.416 --> 53:35.958
-[sighs]
-[Kevin] Look…

53:37.625 --> 53:40.208
maybe the spontaneous thing to do is

53:41.416 --> 53:43.375
give us another chance.

53:43.458 --> 53:46.083
I do love spontaneous.

54:03.125 --> 54:03.958
[Margaret chuckles]

54:04.708 --> 54:05.750
Oh!

54:05.833 --> 54:09.500
[both laughing]

54:17.625 --> 54:20.291
[strings playing "O Christmas Tree"]

54:20.375 --> 54:22.500
[indistinct chatter]

54:26.625 --> 54:28.750
Ladies and gentlemen,

54:28.833 --> 54:34.208
our sponsor and patroness,
Lady Margaret Delacourt.

54:34.291 --> 54:36.125
[guests chattering happily]

54:36.208 --> 54:37.291
[man] Hear! Hear!

54:40.000 --> 54:42.583
Mrs. Donatelli!
You're just the person I'm looking for!

54:42.666 --> 54:44.291
I'm afraid now isn't the time, I--

54:44.375 --> 54:47.000
This dreadful man is threatening
to post lurid details

54:47.083 --> 54:48.791
about Duchess Margaret and Prince William!

54:48.875 --> 54:50.708
-[Reggie gasps dramatically]
-[Stacy gasps]

54:50.791 --> 54:53.416
I am terribly sorry, Your Grace.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.833
-You clumsy oaf!
-No, it was an accident!

54:55.916 --> 54:58.375
Oh, not to worry.
It's just a silly little spill.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.250
If I get you to the ladies' room quickly,
I can get that out for you.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.750
Jolly good! Back in a jiff.

55:04.833 --> 55:07.416
-All right. What is this all about?
-No, I don't.

55:10.708 --> 55:11.666
[door opens]

55:12.041 --> 55:15.208
-Right in here, Your Ladyship.
-Thank you, Mindy. You're an angel.

55:15.291 --> 55:16.875
Well, some say.

55:19.833 --> 55:22.416
[Stacy]
I haven't seen Fiona. Is she here?

55:23.333 --> 55:24.291
-[screams]
-Sh!

55:25.125 --> 55:28.041
[grunting softly]

55:28.125 --> 55:29.208
[groans]

55:29.291 --> 55:31.125
Surprise!

55:31.208 --> 55:33.000
Now it's my turn to switch.

55:33.083 --> 55:36.625
[Fiona laughing]

55:39.333 --> 55:40.250
[Stacy groaning]

55:40.333 --> 55:43.791
-[Mindy] Hurry up!
-This is as fast as I can go!

55:44.375 --> 55:46.291
Oh, dear. All right.

55:48.125 --> 55:49.708
All right, then. Come on, gently does it.

55:49.791 --> 55:51.541
[Stacy in American accent]
What are you doing?

55:51.625 --> 55:52.750
Where are you taking me?

55:53.625 --> 55:56.250
[both laughing]

56:12.250 --> 56:16.000
Margaret Delacourt, is it really you?

56:16.083 --> 56:18.041
Who else would it be?

56:18.125 --> 56:20.041
Where is my driver?

56:20.125 --> 56:22.125
Don't you remember me?

56:22.875 --> 56:25.291
Of course I do, you're…

56:25.375 --> 56:27.208
Shannon Earle!

56:27.291 --> 56:29.583
Only now it's Shannon Earle Carlisle.

56:30.375 --> 56:32.666
We went to Oxford together!

56:32.750 --> 56:34.916
Oxford. Dear Oxford green.

56:35.666 --> 56:37.625
Oh, it's Oxford blue.

56:38.125 --> 56:40.083
I'm color blind. Driver!

56:40.666 --> 56:43.166
You were in my Italian class.

56:45.208 --> 56:49.333
Dolce &amp; Gabbana.
My car, now.

56:49.416 --> 56:51.041
Take me to the palace.

56:55.958 --> 56:57.291
[Reggie grunting]

56:57.375 --> 56:58.541
[Stacy] Where am I?

56:58.625 --> 57:00.333
-[Reggie] All right.
-[Mindy] Blimey!

57:00.416 --> 57:01.458
[Stacy] What is this place?

57:01.541 --> 57:03.291
[Reggie] Mindy, help me out here, girl.

57:03.375 --> 57:06.083
-[Stacy groaning]
-[Reggie and Mindy grunting)

57:12.500 --> 57:13.750
[Reggie] All right, come on.

57:17.250 --> 57:19.708
Your royal suite, your Highnesty.

57:19.791 --> 57:21.208
[in American accent]
I'm telling you,

57:21.291 --> 57:22.833
you kidnapped the wrong person.

57:23.916 --> 57:26.541
-People are gonna be looking for me.
-[Reggie] Yeah, yeah. All right.

57:26.625 --> 57:28.916
-My husband is going to be looking for me.
-[Reggie] Uh-huh.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.250
[Stacy] You'll all go to prison!

57:30.333 --> 57:31.500
"Your Highnesty?"

57:31.583 --> 57:33.708
-Oh, shut up, Reggie.
-[laughing]

57:33.791 --> 57:35.750
Me? Your Highnesty.

57:35.833 --> 57:37.833
[Reggie continues laughing]

57:38.791 --> 57:39.791
[groans]

57:46.125 --> 57:48.125
Meow!

57:50.416 --> 57:51.291
[moans softly]

58:03.583 --> 58:04.541
[moans]

58:04.625 --> 58:06.250
Come to Mommy.

58:09.666 --> 58:10.958
[coos]

58:11.041 --> 58:13.416
-[door opens]
-[Margaret] Stacy, I'm back!

58:14.416 --> 58:17.333
-Who is it?
-It's me, Margaret.

58:34.041 --> 58:36.666
I had the most enchanting time of my life.

58:38.083 --> 58:39.291
Oh, my…

58:39.375 --> 58:42.333
Kevin is the most wonderful man
in the world.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.958
You were absolutely right.

58:46.041 --> 58:48.458
All we needed was a little time together.

58:49.833 --> 58:52.291
I've never been happier in my life.

58:53.291 --> 58:56.375
And I owe it all to you, you darling girl.

58:56.958 --> 58:58.958
Well, you and Olivia.

58:59.041 --> 59:03.416
Oh, Stacy, I'm so glad
you talked me into switching places.

59:06.041 --> 59:06.916
Did…

59:07.000 --> 59:11.875
Did I really have to talk you
into switching places?

59:12.541 --> 59:15.833
I was honestly terrified
we wouldn't be able to pull it off again,

59:16.583 --> 59:18.541
but apparently we did.

59:20.166 --> 59:21.041
Apparently.

59:22.041 --> 59:24.416
I hope the Christmas concert
wasn't too much trouble.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.291
I love a good concert.

59:26.375 --> 59:29.708
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I need to change for dinner.

59:29.791 --> 59:31.375
I don't want to keep Kevin waiting.

59:32.250 --> 59:34.375
By the way, your accent is much better.

59:38.333 --> 59:39.541
Dinner with Kevin?

59:40.375 --> 59:42.833
Aren't you the least bit concerned
about Edward?

59:44.291 --> 59:46.625
What has any of this got
to do with Edward?

59:47.250 --> 59:48.958
He is your husband after all.

59:50.250 --> 59:51.083
Don't be silly.

59:51.166 --> 59:52.083
Stacy.

59:53.125 --> 59:55.708
You know how much
I treasure our friendship,

59:56.291 --> 59:59.625
but barging in here and going on about
how you're planning to cheat on Edward.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:00.708
Well...

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:02.708
I think you better go.

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:05.958
Stacy, the game is over.

1:00:06.041 --> 1:00:09.541
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

1:00:09.625 --> 1:00:13.000
This isn't funny.
It's time to switch back.

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:16.416
I insist you take your leave at once.

1:00:16.500 --> 1:00:18.166
You must be joking.

1:00:18.250 --> 1:00:21.291
Or would you rather I call the guard
and have you thrown out?

1:00:25.041 --> 1:00:25.916
[sighs]

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.750
That won't be necessary.

1:00:38.666 --> 1:00:39.708
[groans]

1:00:43.625 --> 1:00:44.500
[thuds]

1:00:44.583 --> 1:00:45.416
[grunts]

1:00:47.291 --> 1:00:49.000
We are so screwed!

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:51.375
You're such a drama queen.

1:00:51.458 --> 1:00:53.500
We grabbed the wrong Maggie.

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:57.041
This one's got free Wi-Fi
and Taco Tuesdays.

1:00:57.125 --> 1:00:58.625
Oh, and a cabana boy!

1:00:58.708 --> 1:01:01.791
You're not going to need
a cabana boy in prison.

1:01:01.875 --> 1:01:04.708
So, would you two
please stop talking and focus?

1:01:04.791 --> 1:01:07.875
All right, Fi-Fi!
There's no reason to get testy.

1:01:07.958 --> 1:01:08.833
[huffs]

1:01:08.916 --> 1:01:10.166
Really, Reggie?

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:11.666
Because I think there is.

1:01:11.750 --> 1:01:13.750
I think there's a very big reason.

1:01:13.833 --> 1:01:17.000
If your cousin's there,
then who've we got in the basement?

1:01:17.083 --> 1:01:19.625
Well, the look-alike from Belgravia.

1:01:20.833 --> 1:01:23.166
She did say you grabbed the wrong person.

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:24.708
Me?

1:01:25.291 --> 1:01:27.666
-So now it's my fault?
-Well, it's not mine.

1:01:27.750 --> 1:01:29.500
-[Reggie] It's not mine!
-[Mindy] Yes, it is.

1:01:29.583 --> 1:01:30.916
-[Reggie] I's not!
-[Mindy] It is.

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.250
-No, it's not. I was following you!
-It's 'cause you said--

1:01:33.333 --> 1:01:36.375
[grunts] We need a plan.

1:01:36.458 --> 1:01:37.500
All right…

1:01:39.375 --> 1:01:41.916
You said this was a get-in,
get-out job, right?

1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:42.833
So?

1:01:42.916 --> 1:01:45.375
So all you have to do is get out faster.

1:01:45.458 --> 1:01:49.166
Well, no can do.
The coronation isn't till tomorrow.

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:51.041
So move it up to tonight.

1:01:51.125 --> 1:01:53.458
And how am I supposed to do that?

1:01:53.541 --> 1:01:56.375
Hello? You're going to be queen.

1:01:56.458 --> 1:01:57.875
You make the rules.

1:01:58.375 --> 1:02:00.791
I do, don't I?

1:02:06.541 --> 1:02:07.625
Hmm.

1:02:08.375 --> 1:02:10.958
But first I've got some
dinner plans to cancel.

1:02:21.416 --> 1:02:22.250
Darling!

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.791
-So glad your headache's better.
-There's something I have to tell you.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.291
[Edward] Let me go first.

1:02:27.708 --> 1:02:28.541
[sighs]

1:02:28.625 --> 1:02:31.458
I need to apologize
if I've hovered too much,

1:02:32.125 --> 1:02:36.416
you know, like a helicopter,
circling about and buzzing all the while.

1:02:37.916 --> 1:02:41.041
Why are you speaking
with a different accent?

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:43.708
I'm not speaking with an accent.
I'm Margaret.

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:44.750
[laughs]

1:02:45.041 --> 1:02:45.916
Don't be silly.

1:02:46.541 --> 1:02:48.916
Why won't anyone believe me?

1:02:50.833 --> 1:02:51.916
-You're serious.
-Yeah.

1:02:52.416 --> 1:02:54.208
I've never been more serious in my life.

1:02:55.750 --> 1:02:58.458
-But Stacy promised me that she'd never--
-It's my fault.

1:02:58.541 --> 1:03:01.958
I needed time with Kevin
and Stacy was only trying to help.

1:03:03.041 --> 1:03:04.333
No one was supposed to know.

1:03:04.958 --> 1:03:07.208
If no one's supposed to know,
why are you telling me now?

1:03:07.291 --> 1:03:09.125
There's been a bit of a snag.

1:03:09.625 --> 1:03:12.583
Well, a rather major snag to be precise.

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:15.166
[Frank]
Come on now, remember our chat.

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:18.500
-Twenty-five years--
-Come on, happy face.

1:03:18.583 --> 1:03:20.208
Mrs. Donatelli? Are you all right?

1:03:21.125 --> 1:03:22.000
No.

1:03:23.041 --> 1:03:25.291
No, I am most certainly not all right.

1:03:25.375 --> 1:03:27.500
The most awful thing has happened.

1:03:27.583 --> 1:03:30.791
After 25 years of loyal service,
Lady Margaret has…

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:33.625
Well, she's given me the boot.

1:03:34.375 --> 1:03:36.333
She says that she doesn't need me anymore,

1:03:36.416 --> 1:03:38.708
and she's moved the coronation
up to tonight

1:03:38.791 --> 1:03:41.000
so that she can spend Christmas
with the orphans.

1:03:41.083 --> 1:03:44.041
I would never fire you, Mrs. Donatelli,

1:03:44.125 --> 1:03:46.791
and I certainly am not moving up
my coronation.

1:03:47.375 --> 1:03:48.208
[gasps]

1:03:49.625 --> 1:03:50.458
Lady Margaret?

1:03:51.625 --> 1:03:52.750
Oh. [laughs]

1:03:53.416 --> 1:03:54.416
[sighs] Oh.

1:03:55.625 --> 1:03:58.500
-And… he knows?
-Yes.

1:03:59.875 --> 1:04:01.791
-And you've not switched back yet?
-No.

1:04:01.875 --> 1:04:05.583
And I can assure you the woman upstairs
in my suite is not Princess Stacy,

1:04:05.666 --> 1:04:08.333
unless she's gone
completely off her trolley.

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:11.583
Let me see if I follow this, so…

1:04:12.375 --> 1:04:14.416
if the two of you haven't switched back

1:04:15.333 --> 1:04:16.708
and this is Lady Margaret,

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:21.000
and if Lady Margaret upstairs isn't Stacy,

1:04:22.250 --> 1:04:24.500
who's upstairs and where's my wife?

1:04:25.250 --> 1:04:26.958
Off with their heads.

1:04:27.041 --> 1:04:28.666
[laughs]

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:30.375
[knocking]

1:04:30.458 --> 1:04:31.291
Who--

1:04:32.416 --> 1:04:34.291
-Who is it?
-It's Kevin.

1:04:43.541 --> 1:04:44.375
Come in.

1:04:47.791 --> 1:04:49.625
I know, I'm kind of early but…

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.333
Oh! I can come back later if--

1:04:52.416 --> 1:04:54.166
No, Kevin, please stay.

1:04:54.250 --> 1:04:56.458
There's something we need to discuss.

1:04:57.208 --> 1:04:58.416
Yeah. Sure.

1:04:59.291 --> 1:05:00.125
Everything okay?

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:02.291
I'm afraid it isn't.

1:05:03.083 --> 1:05:04.041
[gasps]

1:05:05.541 --> 1:05:08.791
The time we spent together today
was truly magical.

1:05:08.875 --> 1:05:10.291
Yeah, I thought so too.

1:05:10.875 --> 1:05:12.333
But it isn't right.

1:05:15.166 --> 1:05:17.708
Deep down, we both know it.

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:23.083
You need a wife and your darling
little girl needs a mother.

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:26.875
Like it or not, I have a country to run.

1:05:28.333 --> 1:05:31.791
And I can't be the wife
and mother you both deserve.

1:05:32.666 --> 1:05:33.500
That's not true.

1:05:33.583 --> 1:05:35.666
Don't make this harder than it is.

1:05:36.958 --> 1:05:39.750
-But you said--
-You must forget what I said.

1:05:40.666 --> 1:05:43.041
I was emotional. I wasn't thinking.

1:05:45.583 --> 1:05:47.083
Margaret, this isn't like you.

1:05:49.250 --> 1:05:50.083
Please,

1:05:50.666 --> 1:05:53.416
it's best for both of us
if we end this now.

1:05:57.125 --> 1:05:59.125
You and Olivia need to go home.

1:06:00.916 --> 1:06:01.958
You really mean that?

1:06:04.708 --> 1:06:05.833
Because if you do,

1:06:07.041 --> 1:06:08.458
I'm not coming back…

1:06:09.958 --> 1:06:10.791
ever.

1:06:11.083 --> 1:06:13.375
[sighs] Goodbye, Kevin.

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:33.375
[chuckles]

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:36.833
Bye!

1:06:44.833 --> 1:06:45.833
Hello?

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.208
Hello, can anyone hear me?

1:06:51.125 --> 1:06:52.041
Hello!

1:07:15.291 --> 1:07:18.000
I still don't understand what happened.

1:07:20.750 --> 1:07:22.833
She changed her mind. That's all.

1:07:25.375 --> 1:07:27.791
Are you sure she wasn't pranking you?

1:07:27.875 --> 1:07:28.750
Liv…

1:07:30.375 --> 1:07:32.708
I know how much
you care about Margaret,

1:07:33.583 --> 1:07:35.166
but it's time to let go.

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:37.500
For both of us.

1:07:38.083 --> 1:07:39.916
-But, Daddy--
-Livvie…

1:07:40.791 --> 1:07:41.708
let's go.

1:07:43.041 --> 1:07:44.041
Come on.

1:07:46.375 --> 1:07:47.416
Get in the car.

1:07:57.333 --> 1:07:58.291
Airport, please.

1:08:00.125 --> 1:08:01.041
Very good, sir.

1:08:08.833 --> 1:08:10.708
After the concert what happened?

1:08:10.791 --> 1:08:13.375
We were separated for a few minutes
at the reception,

1:08:13.875 --> 1:08:16.708
and then she returned
to the palace in her limousine.

1:08:16.791 --> 1:08:17.666
Without you?

1:08:17.750 --> 1:08:21.000
I'd been informed that she'd already left.
So I took a separate car.

1:08:21.083 --> 1:08:24.541
So something must have happened
after the concert and before you returned.

1:08:26.291 --> 1:08:27.125
[gasps]

1:08:27.416 --> 1:08:29.958
-The drink!
-Ah-ha! So you were drinking!

1:08:30.041 --> 1:08:32.250
Not me, you fool.

1:08:32.916 --> 1:08:35.958
The man with your cousin Fiona… Reggie.

1:08:36.041 --> 1:08:38.708
-He spilled a drink on your dress.
-Stacy's dress.

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:43.000
Yes, and then Fiona's secretary
took her to the ladies' room.

1:08:43.083 --> 1:08:44.833
-Ah-ha!
-What are you thinking, Frank?

1:08:45.416 --> 1:08:48.083
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:49.958
I think I know.

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:53.083
They made the switch
in the powder room.

1:08:53.666 --> 1:08:56.083
They kidnapped Stacy
because they thought it was me.

1:08:56.875 --> 1:09:00.125
-So the woman upstairs is your cousin.
-I wouldn't put it past her.

1:09:00.208 --> 1:09:04.375
And underneath all that peroxide,
there is a striking resemblance.

1:09:04.458 --> 1:09:06.708
So if Fiona's associates took Stacy,

1:09:07.666 --> 1:09:08.958
where would they go?

1:09:09.041 --> 1:09:11.541
I'm guessing
they're at her father's old estate.

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.500
It's less than an hour away from here.

1:09:13.583 --> 1:09:16.125
Right. I'll get the car.

1:09:16.208 --> 1:09:17.333
I'll deal with Fiona.

1:09:17.416 --> 1:09:20.750
Well, I wouldn't confront her just yet.
Not while they still have Stacy.

1:09:20.833 --> 1:09:23.083
Right, then we'll come with you.

1:09:23.833 --> 1:09:27.291
Notify Count Rossi of our suspicions
and have him delay the coronation.

1:09:27.375 --> 1:09:28.666
Right away, Your Highness.

1:09:29.333 --> 1:09:30.166
Bingo.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.333
I honestly don't understand the urgency.

1:09:36.416 --> 1:09:38.500
Then I shall review it for you again.

1:09:39.541 --> 1:09:43.916
I intend to spend Christmas with
those poor, poor orphans at St. Matthew's.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.666
Aren't the orphans at St. Michael's?

1:09:46.833 --> 1:09:48.083
I am in charge

1:09:48.166 --> 1:09:52.500
and you as my loyal subject must do
precisely what I tell you to do.

1:09:53.083 --> 1:09:53.916
[sighs]

1:09:56.625 --> 1:09:57.458
I would…

1:09:58.541 --> 1:10:00.333
if you were really Lady Margaret.

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:03.958
But you're not, are you?

1:10:04.791 --> 1:10:06.916
How dare you question me!

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.208
You're Margaret's cousin.

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:09.291
[gasps]

1:10:09.375 --> 1:10:11.666
-I'll have you arrested for treason.
-I don't think you will

1:10:11.750 --> 1:10:13.958
-because I can prove it.
-I'm calling the guards!

1:10:14.041 --> 1:10:16.166
All it takes is a close look at your hand.

1:10:16.875 --> 1:10:18.500
The little tattoo on your pinkie…

1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:21.500
you should take greater care
to cover it up.

1:10:26.458 --> 1:10:27.791
So now what?

1:10:28.958 --> 1:10:30.625
I'm guessing you're after money.

1:10:31.291 --> 1:10:35.208
You're not stupid enough to think that
you can maintain this charade for long.

1:10:36.625 --> 1:10:40.208
So you can either make me a partner
in your little scheme

1:10:41.125 --> 1:10:44.625
or be exposed
as an impostor and a traitor.

1:10:45.208 --> 1:10:47.875
You don't need my money.
You're filthy rich.

1:10:47.958 --> 1:10:51.458
My eldest brother inherited
the majority of the family estate,

1:10:51.958 --> 1:10:55.791
which left me with expensive tastes
and a very small income.

1:10:56.666 --> 1:10:57.583
[sighs]

1:10:58.833 --> 1:11:00.166
What about Margaret?

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:02.625
Once you've gotten what you came for,

1:11:02.708 --> 1:11:06.750
you'll vanish without a trace, which means
Margaret never has to know anything.

1:11:08.166 --> 1:11:10.708
I'll make sure the coronation
happens tonight.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:15.375
And afterwards, you'll meet
with the Chancellor of the Exchequer

1:11:15.458 --> 1:11:19.041
and make an incredibly generous donation
to a fictitious charity

1:11:19.125 --> 1:11:21.500
of which you
are the Chief Financial Officer.

1:11:22.333 --> 1:11:25.083
As soon as you write a check to me
for my services,

1:11:25.166 --> 1:11:27.500
I'll arrange for your discreet departure.

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:31.000
You can do whatever you like
with the rest of the money.

1:11:36.541 --> 1:11:38.416
When we arrive, everyone keep alert.

1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:40.500
There's no telling
what we'll find when we get there.

1:11:40.583 --> 1:11:44.541
Mm-hmm. And it's a good thing
that these are registered weapons.

1:11:44.625 --> 1:11:46.875
-Frank! Hands on the wheel!
-All right!

1:11:52.833 --> 1:11:54.000
[hums softly]

1:11:56.416 --> 1:11:59.000
Your dinner is served.

1:12:01.666 --> 1:12:02.666
Hello?

1:12:05.208 --> 1:12:07.125
Your Highnesty?

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:09.916
Hello?

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:16.125
You playing hide and seek?

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:20.416
You are!

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:22.333
[Stacy grunts]

1:12:23.541 --> 1:12:26.458
[screaming]

1:12:26.541 --> 1:12:27.958
[grunts]

1:12:28.041 --> 1:12:29.166
[Reggie whimpers]

1:12:31.875 --> 1:12:34.958
[gasping]

1:12:36.833 --> 1:12:37.666
[Reggie] Oy!

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:40.375
Oy! Come here!

1:12:40.458 --> 1:12:42.666
-[Stacy panting]
-[Reggie grunting]

1:12:44.791 --> 1:12:46.000
Oh my God.

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:47.250
[Stacy grunts]

1:12:47.333 --> 1:12:49.541
[Reggie yelling]

1:12:57.166 --> 1:12:58.125
Is anyone there?

1:12:58.750 --> 1:13:01.250
[Reggie] Mindy! Get her!

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:03.166
Where do you think you're going? Oh!

1:13:03.250 --> 1:13:04.833
[screaming]

1:13:09.791 --> 1:13:11.458
[Mindy] Help! Help me, Reggie.

1:13:12.416 --> 1:13:16.333
[pounding] Reggie, get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Reggie!

1:13:17.625 --> 1:13:18.708
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1:13:18.791 --> 1:13:20.125
-Sir…
-[Margaret] Oh dear, Edward!

1:13:20.208 --> 1:13:22.125
Stacy? Can you hear me?

1:13:22.208 --> 1:13:23.666
[panting]

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:24.791
-[Edward] Stacy?
-Thank God.

1:13:24.875 --> 1:13:25.750
Come here!

1:13:27.666 --> 1:13:28.541
[screaming]

1:13:28.625 --> 1:13:30.666
They're over there! Go!

1:13:31.875 --> 1:13:35.208
-Call the police! Frank, you're with me!
-Always, sir. Always!

1:13:35.291 --> 1:13:37.083
-[Stacy grunts]
-[Edward] Get away from her!

1:13:40.166 --> 1:13:41.000
[hollers]

1:13:41.666 --> 1:13:42.541
[grunts]

1:13:42.625 --> 1:13:45.458
[groaning]

1:13:47.125 --> 1:13:48.500
[Stacy and Edward gasp]

1:13:48.583 --> 1:13:49.833
[Stacy] Oh!

1:13:50.083 --> 1:13:53.083
I'm so sorry. 
I should have told you everything.

1:13:53.166 --> 1:13:55.416
As long as you're all right,
that's all that matters.

1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:59.458
I promise you I will never make you
feel like I'm too busy for you ever again.

1:13:59.541 --> 1:14:02.708
And I promise I will never hover
like a helicopter again.

1:14:02.791 --> 1:14:03.875
Wait, what?

1:14:03.958 --> 1:14:05.083
-It doesn't matter.
-Okay.

1:14:08.083 --> 1:14:09.208
Margaret--

1:14:09.291 --> 1:14:10.208
[grunts]

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:14.000
[clears throat] I'm so terribly sorry
to interrupt, Your Graces,

1:14:14.083 --> 1:14:16.166
but Fiona is headed to the cathedral.

1:14:16.250 --> 1:14:17.416
Right, let's go.

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:26.541
-[organ music playing]
-[voices murmuring]

1:14:26.625 --> 1:14:28.583
[archbishop] This is highly irregular.

1:14:29.333 --> 1:14:32.500
The coronation is scheduled
for tomorrow on Christmas Day.

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:35.500
But I'm going to be
at St. Michael's on Christmas Day.

1:14:36.250 --> 1:14:37.875
I've promised the orphans.

1:14:37.958 --> 1:14:40.000
I thought the orphans
were at St. Matthew's.

1:14:41.333 --> 1:14:44.166
It's a world tour of orphans.

1:14:44.250 --> 1:14:46.500
[Antonio] It may be an unusual request,
Your Excellency,

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:48.708
but there's nothing
in canon or civil law

1:14:48.791 --> 1:14:52.791
that prevents an heir apparent
from selecting the date of the coronation.

1:14:52.875 --> 1:14:54.208
-[door opens]
-I know the law, sir,

1:14:54.291 --> 1:14:57.458
and it clearly states that
a representative of the civil government

1:14:57.541 --> 1:14:59.833
must be in attendance
when a new monarch is crowned.

1:14:59.916 --> 1:15:02.041
I spoke to the Prime Minister an hour ago.

1:15:02.708 --> 1:15:04.291
And here she is now.

1:15:08.458 --> 1:15:09.583
I see.

1:15:10.458 --> 1:15:12.250
We'll need some time to prepare.

1:15:24.625 --> 1:15:26.833
Wait a second,
wasn't that the turnoff for the airport?

1:15:26.916 --> 1:15:31.416
It was, but the bridge got washed away
six months ago.

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:32.750
Terrible flood.

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:34.833
A flood? In June?

1:15:34.916 --> 1:15:37.416
Summer storms can be so unpredictable.

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.833
-As long as we don't miss our flight, man.
-We wouldn't want that.

1:15:42.958 --> 1:15:45.208
Is Your Majesty willing and able

1:15:45.291 --> 1:15:48.791
to take this sacred oath
to uphold the laws and customs

1:15:48.875 --> 1:15:51.125
of the Sovereign Nation of Montenaro?

1:15:51.208 --> 1:15:52.500
Yes, I am.

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:55.500
Willing and able.

1:15:56.041 --> 1:15:57.791
Then repeat after me.

1:15:58.541 --> 1:16:01.375
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…

1:16:01.958 --> 1:16:04.041
I, Margaret Clara Karen--

1:16:04.125 --> 1:16:06.166
Margaret Katherine Claire.

1:16:06.791 --> 1:16:09.208
I, Margaret Katherine Claire…

1:16:10.083 --> 1:16:12.375
-Dela--
-Delacourt, right.

1:16:13.708 --> 1:16:16.500
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt--

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:19.875
I command you to stop
these proceedings at once.

1:16:22.458 --> 1:16:25.000
Oh, dear Lord. There are three of them.

1:16:25.083 --> 1:16:26.666
No, Your Eminence.

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:29.541
There is only one Margaret Delacourt
and I am she.

1:16:30.125 --> 1:16:33.125
The woman you were about to crown
as your queen is an impostor.

1:16:34.166 --> 1:16:35.666
Antonio, tell them.

1:16:37.125 --> 1:16:39.875
Guards,
arrest this woman at once for treason.

1:16:39.958 --> 1:16:41.000
Antonio, it's me.

1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:43.666
Don't you dare!

1:16:44.208 --> 1:16:45.041
And you are?

1:16:45.125 --> 1:16:49.041
I'm Princess Stacy Juliette
De Novo Wyndham of Belgravia.

1:16:49.666 --> 1:16:52.250
Fiona kidnapped me
thinking I was Margaret,

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:55.208
but I wasn't Margaret
because Margaret and I switched places.

1:16:55.291 --> 1:16:56.958
I'm very confused.

1:16:57.041 --> 1:16:59.625
I understand exactly how you feel,
Your Eminence,

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:02.000
but it seems the woman
you're about to crown

1:17:02.083 --> 1:17:04.375
is actually Lady Margaret's cousin.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:06.583
Is this true?

1:17:08.208 --> 1:17:09.958
Fiona, it's over.

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:14.166
-Reggie and Mindy are in police custody.
-They confessed to everything.

1:17:14.250 --> 1:17:15.166
[sighs]

1:17:16.250 --> 1:17:17.916
Oh, all right, it's me,

1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:22.458
but I didn't want to go through with it.
That freak Antonio made me do it.

1:17:23.583 --> 1:17:24.750
[chuckles]

1:17:24.833 --> 1:17:26.916
Margaret, she's lying.

1:17:27.416 --> 1:17:29.666
You were ready to throw me in prison.

1:17:31.041 --> 1:17:32.916
Look, if you'll only just listen to me--

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.250
I've listened long enough.

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.875
You almost had me convinced
that I wasn't ready to rule on my own,

1:17:39.625 --> 1:17:43.458
but the fact is I've never been
more ready for anything in my life.

1:17:44.250 --> 1:17:45.791
I love Montenaro.

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:49.125
I love its people and I've learned
everything I can about them

1:17:49.208 --> 1:17:52.708
for the past six months, so I can
serve them to the best of my ability.

1:17:53.333 --> 1:17:54.916
You don't know how to command.

1:17:56.333 --> 1:17:57.291
Watch this.

1:17:57.375 --> 1:18:01.166
Arrest him and take him to the dungeon.

1:18:07.458 --> 1:18:08.833
I bet that felt good.

1:18:14.416 --> 1:18:16.833
One tiny teeny little question.

1:18:17.375 --> 1:18:21.750
Since I technically didn't kidnap you,
am I really guilty?

1:18:22.791 --> 1:18:23.791
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:18:23.875 --> 1:18:27.708
But, Maggie Moo,
it's Christmas and I'm your cuzzy.

1:18:27.791 --> 1:18:30.375
Are you kidding? You committed treason!

1:18:30.458 --> 1:18:32.166
Well, I didn't mean to.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:34.000
[scoffs]

1:18:34.083 --> 1:18:36.375
You know, it's always been hard for me,

1:18:36.458 --> 1:18:38.791
growing up with parents who despised me.

1:18:38.875 --> 1:18:41.250
They didn't despise you.

1:18:43.625 --> 1:18:46.666
The truth is
I've always wanted to be you.

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:49.125
I just got carried away this time.

1:18:50.333 --> 1:18:52.833
But I could never be half of what you are.

1:18:54.208 --> 1:18:58.916
You were born to be queen, even
though you didn't realize until now.

1:18:59.958 --> 1:19:01.958
I owe you an apology, Moo.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:04.833
I behaved abominably. I'm sorry.

1:19:05.708 --> 1:19:08.416
You're the only real family I've ever had.

1:19:09.833 --> 1:19:11.458
The only one who truly cares.

1:19:11.541 --> 1:19:14.166
Poor, poor girl.

1:19:15.041 --> 1:19:16.708
-Oh, please.
-[Frank] What?

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.416
I suppose I could ask the judge
for a reduced sentence.

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:22.750
[Stacy] Are you sure about that?

1:19:23.333 --> 1:19:27.083
Along with supervised community
service for many, many years.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:28.750
[archbishop] I hate to interrupt,

1:19:28.833 --> 1:19:31.583
but are we proceeding
with the coronation?

1:19:31.666 --> 1:19:35.291
The coronation will proceed
on Christmas Day as scheduled.

1:19:35.875 --> 1:19:39.625
Now if you all will excuse me,
I really must call Kevin.

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:41.625
We were supposed to have dinner hours ago.

1:19:41.708 --> 1:19:43.125
[Fiona] About Kevin…

1:19:43.208 --> 1:19:44.666
What about Kevin?

1:19:44.750 --> 1:19:47.541
He would have found me out,
so I had to send him packing.

1:19:47.625 --> 1:19:48.625
[Edward] Oh, dear.

1:19:49.083 --> 1:19:50.291
Dear…

No, he's not answering.

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:57.916
I'm guessing he's on his way
to the airport with that small person.

1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.291
His daughter?

1:19:59.375 --> 1:20:00.916
He mentioned an Octavia.

1:20:01.583 --> 1:20:02.958
You mean Olivia?

1:20:03.041 --> 1:20:04.583
That's what I said.

1:20:05.625 --> 1:20:06.583
Frank, get the car.

1:20:06.666 --> 1:20:07.958
At the double, sir.

1:20:27.541 --> 1:20:28.750
Keep the change, man.

1:20:28.833 --> 1:20:30.083
Don't worry, sir.

1:20:31.125 --> 1:20:34.083
Everything's gonna be all right.
I guarantee it.

1:21:14.500 --> 1:21:16.125
Right, let's go. Right.

1:21:25.833 --> 1:21:27.333
Looks like we made it on time.

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:28.333

1:21:29.875 --> 1:21:30.708
[Margaret] Kevin!

1:21:33.375 --> 1:21:34.208

1:21:35.458 --> 1:21:36.541
Come on.

1:21:37.375 --> 1:21:38.333
Kevin!

1:21:39.791 --> 1:21:43.583
Kevin, please don't leave.
I can explain everything.

1:21:44.958 --> 1:21:47.750
You look like Stacy
but you sound like Margaret.

1:21:47.833 --> 1:21:49.541
Well, because I am Margaret.

1:21:50.041 --> 1:21:51.375
We never switched back.

1:21:51.458 --> 1:21:52.291
Oh.

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:54.916
Why are you dressed like that?

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.291
Fiona kidnapped me
and took Margaret's place.

1:21:57.791 --> 1:21:58.625
Right…

1:21:58.708 --> 1:22:00.166
Don't you get it?

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:04.375
It wasn't Margaret who told you to leave.
It was Fiona.

1:22:04.458 --> 1:22:05.541
[Kevin] Is that true?

1:22:06.250 --> 1:22:08.125
Nothing has ever been more true.

1:22:10.083 --> 1:22:12.458
I can't imagine my life without you.

1:22:13.041 --> 1:22:14.833
I can't imagine my life without you.

1:22:15.541 --> 1:22:18.041
Well, then…

1:22:19.458 --> 1:22:20.583
Marry me?

1:22:21.416 --> 1:22:23.666
That's what I was gonna ask you
last summer.

1:22:23.750 --> 1:22:25.125

-Wait.

1:22:25.625 --> 1:22:26.458

1:23:13.416 --> 1:23:14.916
This is my fiancé, Kevin.

I wish I could promise you the world,

1:24:36.875 --> 1:24:38.583

1:24:39.750 --> 1:24:41.625

1:24:41.708 --> 1:24:42.750
is my world

1:24:43.625 --> 1:24:45.875
