1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,030
Say it, that you also love me.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,593
Young master!

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:07,563
Young master.

4
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:15,633
Watch out! Young master!

5
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:22,151
I don't want things
to be any more out of control.

6
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:24,265
Do you only think of him as your pet?

7
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:29,605
Both Sun and I will decide
what is best for ourselves.

8
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,298
Young master...

9
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:56,265
I'm checking in to see if you're alright.

10
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,305
Truth is, Sun being like this...

11
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,405
is actually all my fault.

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,235
Sun is willing to do everything
for you, young master.

13
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,165
He's just doing his job.

14
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,735
After all that,

15
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:21,895
don't you understand, young master?

16
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,705
What he actually feels about you.

17
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:27,465
I'm just his boss.

18
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:30,965
He did what dad ordered him to do.

19
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,635
Including the blood donation.

20
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:38,765
Even if boss didn't order him,

21
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:44,295
he's still willing to donate his blood
for you, young master.

22
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:49,495
Don't get my hopes up.

23
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:52,165
I just want you to know that.

24
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,505
He dared putting his life at risk.

25
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,135
Because for him,

26
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,435
Young master is the center
of his universe.

27
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:09,765
Without you, he wouldn't want to live.

28
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,135
You don't have to believe me though,

29
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:23,965
but I want you to take a look
at this notebook.

30
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:29,795
Whether it was just his duty
like you think or not.

31
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:45,865
I'll take my leave now.

00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:12,651

00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,081

♪Overflowing my heart♪

42
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:42,565
What are you doing?

43
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,035
Come on.

44
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,175
Wet hair in front of the AC,
do you want to get sick?

45
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:55,345
Well, what a blessing to have
such a kind boyfriend.

46
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,175
Who said I'm kind?

47
00:04:57,675 --> 00:05:00,845
I don't want you to get sick,
because I'm sick of taking care of you.

48
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,120
What's the matter?

49
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:05,375
You look troubled.

50
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:07,545
It's about Sky.

51
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:11,045
Since that incident,
he's been watching Sun all the time.

52
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:16,475
He looks very worn-out.

53
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,275
What should I do?

54
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,505
You just have to be a good friend.

55
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,775
Listen to him.

56
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,575
Maybe that's the only thing he needs.

57
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:40,405
Wow, I didn't think you were so capable.

58
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,305
Was that a compliment?

59
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:47,375
Of course, my boyfriend is very cute,
how can I not praise him?

60
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,775
Come here, I'll give you a reward.

61
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:56,908
One more time.

62
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,975
What to reward?
I don't want it.

63
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,545
Come here,
come get your reward.

64
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:11,278
What are you doing?

65
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,615
You want to play hard to get? Alright.

66
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,075
So you have all those feelings for me,

67
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:34,015
why don't you just confess it to me.

68
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,905
Can you wake up and tell me now?

69
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:47,745
Wake up and confess
your true feelings to me, Sun.

70
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,675
Say that you also love me.

71
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,845
Like how I love you.

72
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,375
Can I have yours?

73
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,175
And you can keep mine.

74
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:34,578
Why?

75
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,945
That represents my heart.

76
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:43,545
This represents yours.

77
00:08:45,615 --> 00:08:49,445
That represents my heart,

78
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,075
and this represents yours.

79
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:00,875
If you're not here,

80
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,505
what's the meaning
of this other half, Sun.

81
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:12,445
Can you wake up Sun?

82
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,945
I'm not ready to lose you now.

83
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:29,579
Young master.

84
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,275
Sun!

85
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,745
Don't disappear on me again.

86
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:13,945
I don't know what to do, Bank.

87
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:16,945
When Sun gets better,

88
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:20,305
Dad would want to take him back.

89
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,915
What's the reason
you don't want to let him go?

90
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,175
Because I love him.

91
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:31,305
I thought so.

92
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,348
Hold on.

93
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:35,908
You knew?

94
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:40,345
Well, Sky. I eat rice, not grass.

95
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:44,945
I'm not the only one who knows.

96
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:50,645
Hey, do you know about me and Pitch?

97
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:52,548
What?

98
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:54,775
Don't tell me.

99
00:10:57,015 --> 00:10:59,645
Hey, when did you guys get together?

100
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,515
Anyway, that's not the main point here.

101
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,331
It's about you and Sun.

102
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,805
What are you going to do?

103
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:12,875
It's not that easy to find someone
who can risk his life for you.

104
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,375
I know.

105
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,515
I've been worried.

106
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,515
Don't think too much.

107
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,048
Let's go.

108
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:30,536
How is it?

109
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,675
Do you feel better breathing fresh air?

110
00:11:34,775 --> 00:11:37,505
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

111
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:44,005
Although, you don't have
to bother taking care of me.

112
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,071
Don't say that.

113
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,947
I'm willing to do this.

114
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,545
Futhurmore,

115
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,475
I have something to talk to you.

116
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:19,815
I love you, Sun.

117
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,775
I want you to honestly tell me.

118
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,705
Do you feel the same way?

119
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:32,748
Young master.

120
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:36,645
There, I order you, don't lie.

121
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,245
I love you, Young master.

122
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:12,745
If possible, I want to be with you,

123
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:19,105
Not only as a bodyguard
or a made-up relation.

124
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,251
I also want to be with you.

125
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,975
Not as your young master.

126
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:28,905
But as your lover.

127
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:38,215
If you don't mind,

128
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:43,637
I want to be with you...

129
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,345
as long as you want.

130
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,545
What if I want you
for the rest of my life?

131
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,405
I'm...

132
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:06,145
more than... please.

133
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,545
From now on, call me Sky.

134
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:23,475
I will be your Sky forever.

135
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:26,848
Yes,

136
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,115
You are my Sky.

137
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,608
Dad.

138
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,005
Hey, Sky.

139
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,575
Why don't you call me?

140
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,175
Coming all the way here,
what's the matter?

141
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,375
I have something to beg of you.

142
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,245
Can you let Sun live with me?

143
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:39,975
Sky, you're not listening to me.

144
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,870
We're done with that.

145
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:44,716
I don't want to talk anymore.

146
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,805
I want Sun to continue living with me.

147
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,245
I love him.

148
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,515
And he also loves me.

149
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:58,805
You see, he's willing
to risk his life for me.

150
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:04,005
Also I'm willing to risk
my life for him too.

151
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:07,075
Isn't this enough?

152
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:10,675
How many times
do you want me to say this?

153
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,461
Sun was just doing his job.

154
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,405
He wasn't just doing his job.

155
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,445
He was following his heart.

156
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,805
Stop fooling yourself.

157
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:24,191
You just feel guilty
and responsible for his life.

158
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,561
Because he took the bullet for you.

159
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:28,675
Can you stop thinking for me?

160
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:30,745
Listen to what I have to say,

161
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,405
Sun and I, we love each other.

162
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,975
Whether you approve of this or not.

163
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,445
Sun is the one for me.

164
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:44,505
Anyhow, he has to come back
and work with me.

165
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,705
Immediately, when he gets better.

166
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:51,831
And you, your only duty is to study hard.

167
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,175
You can't do this.

168
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:54,445
Go back to your house.

169
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:00,005
Go back!

170
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:10,575
I've never thought you'd be this mean.

171
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:16,045
You raised him up
just because you want his blood?

172
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:18,915
You also look down on him.

173
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:24,005
Then, why did you have
to make him call you father?

174
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,145
If you just want to use him?

175
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,533
Sun also has a heart.

176
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,645
He's not a thing nor a pet.

177
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,545
Bank!

178
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,566
This way.

179
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:14,505
Hey girls, you come so early.

180
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:17,425
What about you?

181
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:19,415
You are with Pitch all the time.

182
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,045
Is something going on?

183
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,545
We're lover.

184
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,215
Hey, you.

185
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,045
Are you for real?

186
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:37,045
Why? You don't believe me?

187
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:39,145
Alright.

188
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,705
Hey!

189
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:45,875
What are you doing?

190
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:49,045
Why? When we're at home
you didn't even tell me to stop.

191
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,459
If he's home,
he wouldn't tell me to stop.

192
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,215
Is this a revenge?

193
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:55,905
No more.

194
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:00,805
Oh, are you surprised?

195
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:03,205
Don't be surprised, don't be.

196
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,605
Other than us, there's one more.

197
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:34,992
Is it good?

198
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,522
It's an apple from Korea.

199
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,078
Yummy.

200
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:45,205
She's very happy to know
that you're awake.

201
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:51,945
Did the doctor tell you
when you can get discharged?

202
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,345
Have to get checked one more time,
then I'm good to go.

203
00:19:57,045 --> 00:20:00,375
Great. I've been missing you.

204
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,698
When you get discharged,

205
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,915
let's go on a date.

206
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:15,905
I can't.

207
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:18,475
Why?

208
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:38,075
I already have someone I love.

209
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,415
You mean...

210
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:54,215
Yeah, I love Sky.

211
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:00,945
I'm sorry.

212
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,745
Good for you.

213
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:17,475
Then, I'll leave Sun to Sky.

214
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,843
If he's hurt again,

215
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,082
I won't forgive you.

216
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:28,175
Then, I'll leave Sky to you, Sun.

217
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,945
There, we should get going.

218
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:19,475
When you get better,
can you run away with me?

219
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,715
Where do you want to go?

220
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,605
Anywhere, far away.

221
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:28,015
So, dad couldn't find us.

222
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:33,545
Sky, don't joke around.

223
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,045
I'm not joking.

224
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:40,675
Dad said he wants you to go back with him.

225
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,775
He won't let you stay with me anymore.

226
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:46,745
No matter how I beg him.

227
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:49,745
I don't know what else to do.

228
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:55,315
But running away won't solve anything.

229
00:22:56,215 --> 00:23:00,745
Eventually, father will find us.

230
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,345
He's not that great.

231
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:09,375
I don't want you to be reckless
and do things hastily.

232
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:18,487
But if you really want to run away,

233
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,145
I'm willing to follow you.

234
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,595
Thanks for the heads up.

235
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:31,262
Anyway,

236
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,745
I'm not giving you up to dad.

237
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:01,588
Ew, too much love in the air.

238
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:10,975
What's wrong?

239
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,242
It's my dad.

240
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:15,575
He won't accept Sun.

241
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:17,920
He said I was just being moody.

242
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,305
Give him some time.

243
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:22,605
Think about it,

244
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:27,305
If your dad doesn't love you,
or care about you.

245
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:30,145
He wouldn't send Sun to protect you.

246
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:36,045
Moreover, if he didn't send Sun over
in the first place,

247
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:41,705
you wouldn't get to see him
and fall in love.

248
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:50,105
Don't think too much.

249
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:54,345
Thanks, bro.

250
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,675
This is today's ledger, boss.

251
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:03,875
Thanks.

252
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,975
-Shin.
-Yes, sir.

253
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:09,745
Do you think
I'm doing anything wrong?

254
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,345
About young master?

255
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:16,945
At first, I wanted Sun to protect him.

256
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:19,275
How does everything
and it turn out like this?

257
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:22,375
Maybe, it's destiny.

258
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:27,545
For those two kids who have
the same rare blood-type.

259
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:29,205
To meet each other.

260
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:30,833
A destiny?

261
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,875
I'm the one who brought them together.

262
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:37,305
I found Sun, so everything
is the way it is now.

263
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:41,405
It's love, no one can control that, boss.

264
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:43,905
You're right.

265
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:47,245
You can't control love.

266
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,224
Then, from now on,

267
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:52,075
I'll control everything.

268
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:58,745
Get rid of Sun!

269
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:17,345
Going to buy some food for you.

270
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,375
Riders are not picking up my order.

271
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,945
Allow yourself to miss me while waiting.

272
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:44,505
Yes, Shin?

273
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:23,031
I'm back.

274
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:24,161
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:27,405
I went to the supermarket
while I was out.

276
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,745
Come down and help me arrange things.

277
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:33,345
Sun.

278
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:38,508
Sun?

279
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,105
Where is he?

280
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,705
Eh? When did he send this?

281
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:58,375
Sky, Shin called me to meet up.

282
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,175
I know it was father's order.

283
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,009
I think it's time.

284
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,528
Don't be mad at father.

285
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,745
He did this because he loves you.

286
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:13,845
A guy like me is not worth it for you.

287
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:18,315
Sky, you have a bright future ahead,
not like me.

288
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,875
Even without me,
you have to take good care of yourself.

289
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:24,940
I love you, Sky.

290
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,575
More than my life.

291
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,508
Sun?

292
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,638
Hey, how is it?

293
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:21,891
Can you contact him?

294
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:24,305
Not at all.
I couldn't reach him.

295
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,845
Oh, I remember something.

296
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:29,275
Sun downloaded the tracking app
on your phone.

297
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:31,176
If his phone is still on,

298
00:29:31,608 --> 00:29:33,405
we'll be able to reach him.

299
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:36,045
Yeah, right. I forgot about it.

300
00:29:36,545 --> 00:29:39,645
Let's hurry now. Get in my car.
You search the map.

301
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,645
You know that you can't win.
Why don't you give up?

302
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:53,231
You knew why.

303
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,675
I won't hesitate, I'm serious.

304
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,745
Run while you still have the chance.

305
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:07,575
That's the only thing I can help.

306
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,645
No.

307
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:19,315
A life without young master
is like living dead.

308
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:22,045
My life belongs to father.

309
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,293
If father wants me dead,

310
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:27,069
then I'll accept it.

311
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:30,105
Then, be prepared for your death.

312
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,445
GPS said it's here.

313
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,915
Let's split up to look for him.

314
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,145
Okay.

315
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:58,875
Then, I'll go inside.

316
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,331
-Bank, you go that way.
-Alright, bro

317
00:31:02,415 --> 00:31:04,015
I'll go this way.

318
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:14,675
Do you think you can make
my only son happy?

319
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,845
I'm not quite sure.

320
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:24,775
But I'm sure that I love him,

321
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:27,905
and I will protect him with my own life.

322
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,465
Just love is not enough.

323
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,145
Not worth it for Sky.

324
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:36,399
You were adopted,

325
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:39,145
don't be so arrogant.

326
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:42,405
You dare to touch my only son.

327
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:48,645
I'm just a bodyguard.

328
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,075
My only duty is to protect you,

329
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:04,975
no right to be otherwise.

330
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:28,945
Sun?

331
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:30,705
Sun?

332
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:35,145
Let it all end here.

333
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,305
Sun?

334
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,905
Sun!

335
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,705
Are you alright?

336
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,275
I'm fine.

337
00:33:54,975 --> 00:33:56,605
Dad, don't you think
you went a bit too far?

338
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,945
Do you know how much
I'm worried about him?

339
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:01,275
I just want to test him.

340
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:06,275
If he's worth it for you.

341
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:09,945
But...

342
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,275
For the test result,

343
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,575
I'll say pass.

344
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,445
Are you happy?

345
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:26,315
So, you mean
you approve of our relationship?

346
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:27,675
Nope.

347
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:30,375
Today is just the first test.

348
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,005
I'll send you to study abroad.

349
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,705
-I won't go.
-You have to go.

350
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:39,145
You can't separate us like that.

351
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,686
Sun and I love each other.
Do you hear me?

352
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,415
We love each other.
I won't go anywhere.

353
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:46,575
I said you have to go.

354
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:49,591
If you believe that it's the actual love.

355
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,105
You've got to prove it.

356
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,361
If you both
are in a long distant relationship,

357
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:55,875
then you forget about each other.

358
00:34:56,945 --> 00:35:00,545
That means it's just a teen-love,
not real love.

359
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,345
Father.

360
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:12,115
Please send young master aboard.

361
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:22,345
During that time, we'll break our contact.

362
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:25,245
We'll prove our love for you.

363
00:35:26,445 --> 00:35:31,375
Our feelings are not just
a spark because we're close.

364
00:35:33,045 --> 00:35:37,045
I'll wait until Sky finishes school
and comes back.

365
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:40,150
Till that day,

366
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,305
if we are still the same.

367
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:46,846
I beg you,

368
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:52,245
can you approve of our love then?

369
00:35:58,475 --> 00:35:59,345
Alright,

370
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,075
I accept the deal.

371
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,645
Why don't you fight for us?

372
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:16,475
Why you want us to be apart?

373
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:21,045
It's our fight.

374
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,445
We'll fight together.

375
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,245
We'll get father's approval.

376
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:35,675
I'm sure that time won't change me.

377
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,745
What about you?

378
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:53,845
For me, you define forever.

379
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:15,175
Hey, can I play with another rubik's cube?

380
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:18,745
I only have one.

381
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,618
What about the one poking my back?

382
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:23,745
That's a gun.

383
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:28,875
Can I check out your gun?

384
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,931
Didn't you say you want to check the gun?

385
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,615
Didn't dad tell you?

386
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,715
Before you check someone's gun,

387
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:52,105
you have to search him first.

388
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:50,745
What are you thinking?

389
00:38:54,015 --> 00:38:54,975
I miss you.

390
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:01,521
I'm right here.

391
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:03,845
Why do you still miss me?

392
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:11,975
But soon, I have to go.

393
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,475
Let's leave the worries to the future.

394
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:39,675
Today, we're still together.

395
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:42,532
When I come back,

396
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,282
what if dad still doesn't approve?

397
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,645
Then, I'll wait until he does.

398
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,067
What if it's been five years,

399
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:58,759
ten years,

400
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:04,478
but dad still doesn't.

401
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:18,505
For me, I can wait for you my whole life.

402
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:22,345
You won't forget me right?

403
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,645
How can I forget?

404
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:33,045
My heart is with you, Sky.

405
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:43,515
My heart is with you too.

406
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:47,945
This is BYSENSTER's butterfly Pea
natural formula with Thai flower flavor!

407
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,715
You'll have a floral breath
when you talk.

408
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:12,175
Does it smell good?

409
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,745
What is it?

410
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:21,375
A face mask.

411
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,215
Here you go.

412
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,575
I miss the sea of stars back then.

413
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:08,075
I can't see any stars in Bangkok,

414
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,945
even though we are under the same sky.

415
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,545
When you come back,

416
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:28,075
we'll go there together.

417
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:31,415
Promise?

418
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,115
I promise.

419
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:42,975
Why are you looking at me?

420
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:45,745
Aren't you getting used to it?

421
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:53,875
Do you remember the last time
when we were watching the stars?

422
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:00,645
Suppose you are not my bodyguard.

423
00:44:02,845 --> 00:44:06,845
Will you help me like what you did?

424
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,905
Definitely, I'll help you.

425
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:18,705
-Because I...
-You what?

426
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:26,245
You know what I was going to say?

427
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:33,345
Do you?

428
00:44:37,415 --> 00:44:38,639
You didn't say it.

429
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,784
How would I know?

430
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:46,105
You really don't?

431
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:49,675
Alright, I do,

432
00:44:52,075 --> 00:44:54,275
but I want to hear it from you.

433
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:56,605
I love you.

434
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,175
It doesn't matter what we are.

435
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:11,145
I'll protect you with my life.

436
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:11,745
Sun?

437
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:28,375
Sun?

438
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,075
We won't say goodbye, Sky.

439
00:49:09,715 --> 00:49:11,345
Take good care of yourself.

440
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:13,975
Let's trade the hat once we meet again.

441
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:17,805
Ps. Finish this too.

442
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:12,375
(Six years later)

443
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:16,615
(Japan)

444
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,445
-I'll apply ointment.
-I already did.

445
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:36,345
Can you actually reach your back?

446
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:38,120
Take off your shirt.

447
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:44,678
Are you hurt?

448
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:38,275
Hi, dad.

449
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:40,575
Welcome back home, son.

450
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:44,945
Really miss you, son.

451
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:49,175
How are you? Feels like home?

452
00:52:49,745 --> 00:52:53,075
I miss Thailand, and also miss you too.

453
00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:58,915
How's it going? What's your plans
after coming back?

454
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:03,705
I want to help your business.

455
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,256
You've been hard working.

456
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,019
It's time for retirement.

457
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:11,475
I'm glad to hear you say that.

458
00:53:11,915 --> 00:53:13,275
So I can retire from all this.

459
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:16,745
When do you want to start?

460
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:21,005
I want to have a break
and meet up with my friends first.

461
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:22,178
Hey.

462
00:53:23,775 --> 00:53:27,175
Where is Sun?

463
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:29,888
Why didn't he come to pick me up?

464
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:35,905
He won't get to see you till I allow him.

465
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,975
I keep my promise.

466
00:53:40,145 --> 00:53:42,505
I hope you do too.

467
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:46,475
It's been six years.

468
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:48,875
How can you be so sure...

469
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:52,305
that he'll still have feelings for you?

470
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:54,975
I believe in him.

471
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,731
-Shin.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:51,648
Where is Sky?

473
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:53,305
Young master went out to donate his blood.

474
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:56,275
He said later he'll meet up
with his friends.

475
00:54:58,515 --> 00:54:59,348
Boss.

476
00:55:02,775 --> 00:55:04,476
They both proved themselves,

477
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:07,538
what are you going to do?

478
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,475
Just kidding.

479
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,145
Hey, Sky.

480
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:20,245
Come sit next to me.

481
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:27,145
It's been so long.
How long have you been here?

482
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,405
For ages.

483
00:55:37,515 --> 00:55:39,845
Oh, it's just you, Pitch.

484
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:43,275
How did you get here?
It's our class reunion.

485
00:55:43,745 --> 00:55:45,205
Why can't I be here?

486
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:50,075
Your class reunion includes my lover.

487
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,185
He's here.

488
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:53,761
Then, I have to watch over him.

489
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:56,345
Oh, so sweet of you two.

490
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:58,775
Too sweet, everyone's envious.

491
00:56:01,115 --> 00:56:03,545
Toktaeng, Juno, how are you?

492
00:56:04,075 --> 00:56:05,205
I'm good.

493
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:11,575
What about Sun?
Didn't he come with you?

494
00:56:28,545 --> 00:56:30,205
Don't tell me you
haven't seen him yet?

495
00:56:32,715 --> 00:56:33,745
Yeah.

496
00:56:35,545 --> 00:56:36,875
You knew about my dad.

497
00:56:39,445 --> 00:56:41,045
What are you going to do then?

498
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,945
For now, I just keep donating
my blood every three months.

499
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:48,305
So I can have my own spare.

500
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:50,805
I don't have to bother him.

501
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:53,345
You both are like, born for each other.

502
00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:57,345
The golden blood, so romantic, man.

503
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:02,745
Well, you said you're going
to work with your dad.

504
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,375
When will you start?

505
00:57:06,915 --> 00:57:08,715
I have something I want to do first.

506
00:57:43,745 --> 00:57:47,975
When you come back,
we'll go there together.

507
00:57:49,315 --> 00:57:50,375
Promise?

508
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:19,669
Don't go out by yourself.

509
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,906
It's dangerous.

510
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:32,375
You promised, we'll go together.

511
00:58:33,115 --> 00:58:36,215
Why did you sneak here alone?

512
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:44,115
How did you know I'm here?

513
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:48,145
Father told me to come here.

514
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:51,175
Dad?

515
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:55,245
Father said you're here.

516
00:58:56,645 --> 00:59:02,105
And he allows me to protect you.

517
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,005
I'm here now.

518
00:59:32,415 --> 00:59:33,675
I miss you.

519
00:59:34,915 --> 00:59:36,415
Very very much.

520
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,945
From now on, I'll be by your side,
young master.

521
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:43,045
I'm not going anywhere.

522
00:59:43,975 --> 00:59:45,305
Forever?

523
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:49,245
For the rest of my life.

524
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:52,105
Hey!

525
00:59:53,615 --> 00:59:54,845
Did you forget something?

526
01:00:07,215 --> 01:00:10,375
I'm not your young master anymore.

527
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:19,608
Yes.

528
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:23,275
You're my Sky.

529
01:01:26,366 --> 01:01:30,313
(The End)
