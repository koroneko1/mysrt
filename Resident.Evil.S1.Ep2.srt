We got hacked.

I was working late when the whole system
went down and the virus…

It must have overridden our security.

The cage unlocked, the dog got out.

wiped every hard drive on campus.

Still a pain in my ass.

00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,138
An attack like this,
usually, it's ransomware,

207
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,473
but this was just burn it all down.

Why?

209
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,562
I thought you were in Tokyo now.

I split time.

The drug has side effects.

-Minor side effects.

Did you see the fucking monster
in the lobby?

218

So we fix it. We make it better.

What happened in Tijuana,
we're taking it seriously.

That's why I'm moving
the Joy production line here,

so I can keep an eye on it.

When will he be back?

335
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,155
Um, I never really know.

336
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,867
[cats meowing]

337
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,286
[Melinda] Sorry. It's feeding time.

338
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,704
[chuckles]

339
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,290
This is, uh, Rocky.
[chuckles]

340
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,293
Or maybe Sonny.

341
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,545
I can't keep them straight.

342
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,546
[grunts]

343
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,425
What did you say your name was?

344
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,928
The last time I was here,
there was no Umbrella.

345
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,389
-Now they're everywhere.
-[Melinda] Yes.

346
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,184
The city signed a security contract
with them last month.

347
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,602
It's been incredible.

348
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,896
We haven't had
a single infection since then.

349
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,233
I feel so much safer,
what with all the patrols and the cameras.

350
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,276
[Jade] Yeah.

351
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,987
That's Umbrella. Always watching.

352
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,532
Well, I have nothing to hide.

353
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,328
[chuckles]
Right.

354
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,665
I, uh, need to make a call.
Can I use your sat link?

355
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,045
Uh, just one, and then I'll leave.

356

361
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,061
Jade. I, I've been trying to call.

362
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,021
The, the perimeter alarms
at your camp went off.

363
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,690
I, I didn't know if you were dead.

364
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,067
Not dead.

365
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,487
-[Arjun] What happened?
-Scavengers.

366
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,781
[Arjun] Oh, they took your equipment?

367
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,409
That's fine.

368
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,953
That, we can replace.

369
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,746
[Jade] They tried to sell me to Umbrella.

370
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,916
The company, they, they know I'm here.

371
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,042
Where are you?

372
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,794
Dover.

373
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,588
But Umbrella's everywhere.

374
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,714
They've taken over. I heard.

375
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,967
You need to get to Calais.

376
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,551
"Calais"?

377
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,972
That, that's Brotherhood territory.

378
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,974
And that's still better than Umbrella.

379
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,809
[Arjun] The Brotherhood hate Umbrella.

380
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,479
Get across the Channel,
I'll, I'll send a team to come meet you.

381
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,689
[Jade] Get across, how?

382
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,816
[pensive music continues]

383
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,527
I, I… I don't know.

384
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,491
Hey, hey, I'll be okay.

385
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,787
Uh, is, uh… Is Bea there?

386
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,038
Can I talk to her?

387
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,040
[Arjun] She's at ballet practice.

388
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,337
Good. Yeah, that's good.

389
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey, uh, tell her I, um…

390
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,679
I will.

391
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,558
[emotional music]

392
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,108

[sighs deeply]

398
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,165
I need to see Barry.

399
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,541
I could call the authorities.

400
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,169
-[Melinda] Umbrella.
-You don't want to do that.

401
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,337
Oh, watch me.

[meows]

407
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,730
Yeah.
[breathes heavily]

408
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,900
One of the cats must have
gotten locked in the bathroom.

What the fuck?

422
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,199
When Barry came home
from his last trip, he…

423
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,784
He wasn't feeling well.

424
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,912
The next morning,
I found him chained in the bathroom.

425
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,539
He did that to himself.

426
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,207
You can't keep him chained up in there.

427
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,002
We both know how this ends.
He gets out, and he will kill you.

428
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,296
[breathes heavily]
Marriage is complicated.

429

Fine. You do you.

430
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,885
But I need to get to France,
and I can't take the ferry.

431
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,470
I need someone to smuggle me out.

432
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,931
Why? What did you do?

433
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,725
Well, I didn't keep
a fucking brain eater in my bathtub.

434
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,768
Let's start there.

435
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:15,937
[sighs]
Okay.

436
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,648
Did Barry know anyone who could help me?

437
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,191
I, uh…

438
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,235
Oh, maybe.

439
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,528
Charon.

440
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,821
Okay. Where is he?

441
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,532
Why, I, I… I don't know.

442
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,493
I mean, Barry kept all
that sort of thing in his pocketbook.

443
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,954
-Okay, and, and where's the pocketbook?

I was an investigative reporter
at The Baja Post.

But you're not anymore?

health and safety violations for years.

"Die"? How?

00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:30,929
Last week, a worker at the Umbrella lab
went on a rampage,

and he killed nine people.

And when I talked to his wife,

761
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:38,729
she told me he was bitten
by an animal in the lab.

762
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,316
Within 72 hours,
he became erratic, violent.

He saw things. He heard things.

764

Where is he now?

765
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:48,989

well, Umbrella got me fired, hmm?

767

But people need to hear the truth.

you need to tell me.

Have you seen the bite?

Was there a… a red rash around it?
