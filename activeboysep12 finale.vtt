Episode 12 (End of season 1): "Our youth!!!"

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.280
Leave me out!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.760
No

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.320
Get out!

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.740
I won't

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.360
Let me out!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.190
Ok let's out!

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.750
That's good! It's early morning and you wanna troll me?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.890
What do you want? Leave me out!

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.710
I can let you go

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.110
But you have to tell me

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.230
Where' you going?

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.430
You're very brave now?

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.720
You intend to help mom worry about me?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.970
You think you have enough capacity?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.370
I'm your brother!

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.700
It's normal that I worry about you

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.080
- Let me go
- Are you going with Long?

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.250
Long... Who's Long? who knows him?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.040
Hey! Don't act anymore!

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.550
My plane sister, I go first.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.280
What a crazy man!

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.280
I had to spend 8 hours making up!

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.150
Please, I wanna get the tickets that I've booked. My name's Hoang Dang!

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.730
Yes

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.260
Thanks for coming! Wish you have a nice experience!

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.650
It's lucky that I've booked 2 tickets, or else we have to wait!

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.320
Hey

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.630
What are you staring at? Looking at a girl?

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.020
You thought that it was easy for everyone to come into my eyes?

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.960
Look!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.240
Oops... It's Long and Ms. Thao?

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.470
Hey hey, where' you going? Are you crazy?

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.440
I wanna tease them

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.420
There isn't any differences from letting them know that we're also here!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.440
Don't be stupid like that!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.180
So, let's run away!

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.790
And humiliate him later!

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.290
Hey. It seems like knowing my sister is a snub?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.590
So which way do you wanna die? Gun or knife?

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.440
Huh... Gun!

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.390
Go!

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.590
Oops... Sis, you watch this film, too?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.490
I heard this was very interesting!

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.560
Stop acting as if you were innocent!

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.790
Dating with a boy but you even can't get rid of me.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.290
Maybe because of your lifestyle

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.420
And even wearing couple T-shirts!

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.790
Sitting on the chair for couple, too!

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.800
That's right!

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.950
You are here, too!

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.670
Also dating, right?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.800
Well...
Also dating, right?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.070
Well...

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.130
Nope, not at all... We are friends. Keep watching!

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.640
Thao, are you okay

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.980
No. no

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.030
Let's sit here!

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.930
Are you okay?

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.690
I'm sorry

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.960
It's okay!

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.590
It seems very hurt?
It's okay!

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.590
It's okay

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.250
Wait a minute!

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.910
Long long

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.190
What a hurry man!

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.310
Ay da

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.520

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.080
(Whispering about an accident)

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.850
Long... Long...

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.230
Long...

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.750
Where was you go?

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.240
Do you know that I'm very worried about you?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.710
I thought that you were...

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.320
Leave me out!

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.210
No!

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.630
I will hold you tighter!

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
Until you realize that I'm your lover!

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.450
Why are you still there? Don't you know how to greet the older?

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.230
Good afternoon, madam!

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.450
Sit down!

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.450
Yes

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.810
I have something to talk to you

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.160
Yes

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.240
Wait

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.020
Help me call Dang come back here, please.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.350
Yes

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.900
Good afternoon mom, auntie!

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.710
Lam

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.510
Yes?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.190
You have something hiding me and Mrs Ngoc, right?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.750
Oops. Ngoc sister

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.400
Oh, my friend Ngoc.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.400
- Not at all
- We're hiding nothing, madam!

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:06.760
Dang

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.790
You said that you wouldn't hide me anything, didn't you?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.490
Ha My told me all about it

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.740
Sis, that girl is very talkative!

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.270
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't say anything!

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.120
Me...

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.700
Me...

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.740
Mom, The fact is...

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.350
It's not like that mom.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.700
It's me... I flirted Lam first.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.510
I like Lam first!

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.050
Uh... uh...

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.420
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.620
In fact, we have known about all.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.060
But want you to talk it out by yourselves for resting assured!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.910
You know all?

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.980
yes

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.100
Are you angry with us?

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.570
Why do I have to be angry with you?

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.480
Love has no errors. How am I angry with you?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.600
Yes

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.630
You make us so scared!

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.210
Thank you very much!

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.660
But sis, Lam is still a child

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.160
It's very lucky that he has Dang to protect him!

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.640
Dang is also very "small"!

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.070
What? He's small?

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.980
Lam my son is also small, too!

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.560
Very small

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.890
Like a chilli baby.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.640
This guy is smaller than a chilli

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.860
Sometimes they thought that I was his younger sister

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.060
Everyone all talk like that. They don't believe that I have got a big son like that

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.920
we are very young

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.150
- Yes, we're always young
- Your face don't have any errors!

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.170
You got a surgery?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.350
Nope. It's natural

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.440
I've just got a surgery, it's very nice!

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.800
Yes, very nice

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.910
The adults are talking. You two can go upstairs

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.570
Yes, we go

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.180
Yes

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:48.960
Let's go

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.460
Wait a minute!

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.950
Oops, my God!

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.530
Dang, Dang are you okay?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.030
What's the matter with you?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.950
God, are you okay?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.330
I will call helper

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.550
Leave me out!

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.270
How can you kid like that?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.610
Give me a place to sit

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.340
Oh

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.750
I need to make you contented

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.610
What?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.960
There!

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.810
well... I wasn't intentionally!

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.320
It's worth nothing

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.050
Uh... You wrote on my "dangerous place".

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.230
I said that I was unmeant in doing that. I will rend it later!

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.140
Unmeant?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.880
Hey, no...

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.020
No... enough

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.700
I wrong the room. Keep going on!

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.130
Naturally, naturally!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.800
Hey, It's not fun

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.640
It's fun

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.690
Leave me out!

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.320
Dang, your mom is waiting downstairs

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.010
Enjoy you time hurry up!

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.540
Your mom calls you! Let's go home!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.080
Uh. I go home!

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.900
Uh

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.930
You owe me this time. You have to pay double next time.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.380
Pay you my elbow! Let's go home, your mom's worrying

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.490
Bye

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.100
Bye

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.900
Thanks for listening my song

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.290
And this song

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.590
I want to give to a special one

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.170
He is my motivation for trying until now

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.020
I wanna tell him that...

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.440
I want to care and beside you!

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.670
Because you are yourself, not like any other ones.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.520
Please give me a chance to be your special one

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.770
Dung

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.550
Stop!

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.370
Aren't you afraid of being disciplined?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.800
The love between teacher and student has never been supported!

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.570
Even we are boys.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.890
I don't care!

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.270
I can quit my job

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.270
I jus know that

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.060
Right now, I'm scared of losing Dung!
