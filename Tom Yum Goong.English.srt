1
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,840
The Jaturungkabart...

2
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,759
were sworn to protect
the mighty royal elephants.

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,159
Why, Dad?

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,719
Elephants are so big, who could hurt them?

5
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,079
The king sits on top of them.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
So they must beware of things from below.

7
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,640
Beware of what, Dad?

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,719
If they lost their swords,
they would use their bodies as weapons.

9
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,439
Throw, Crush, Grab and Break.

10
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,319
What do they need to be careful of?

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
I cannot tell you yet.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
But I'm going to be a Jaturungkabart,
I have to know.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,280
Not yet, Kham. One day you will know.

14
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,759
Bye.

16
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,960
Hello.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,319
Splash him, son, splash him.
Come on, splash him.

18
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,759
Splash him all over, son.
Splash him, son, splash him.

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,639
Por Yai, you're so naughty!
Dad, look at him.

20
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,719
How was it?
Was Por Yai up to his old tricks again?

21
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,879
Why did you do that to him?

22
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,039
Splash him.

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
Come on.

24
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,360
Dad, I'm here.

25
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
Dad, Dad, Dad. Where's Por Yai going?

26
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Let him go, son.

27
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
Pull! Pull it tight. Lasso it.

28
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,720
Come on, pull. Pull it.

29
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
Holy crap!

30
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,839
If I ever had the chance
to present Por Yai to the King,

31
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,160
it would be biggest honor of my life.

32
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,399
At the very least it would mean that
I upheld the name of the Jaturungkabart.

33
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,439
Korn,

34
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,000
I have something to show you.

35
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,759
Is it nice?

36
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
I reckon this Songkran Water Festival
is going to be fun.

37
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,519
Mr. Suthep is taking care of everything.
He's throwing a huge party.

38
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,120
Well, his son's now a member
of government.

39
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,600
Hopefully,
he can give us back some of our profits.

40
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,639
Koi, I heard they are going to check
the elephants for royal status.

41
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,679
Aren't you going to take your elephants,

42
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,840
to see if they're in with a chance?

43
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,639
Say goodbye to Por Yai, Kham.

44
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,399
After Por Yai has been checked,

45
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
we might not have the chance
to see him again.

46
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,279
This could be a great opportunity for you.
There's no reason to worry.

47
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,279
ANNUAL SONGKRAN WATER FESTIVAL

48
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,799
Mr. Koi, this way, please. Hello.

49
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,679
Welcome.

50
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,679
Dad. They're here.

51
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Hello, Mr. Koi.

52
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
-Please, come inside.
-Yes, sir.

53
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,519
Everything's ready. Come in.

54
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
-Go on, Korn.
-You wait outside for a while.

55
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,000
Your father should go in alone.

56
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,720
It's gonna be okay.

57
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,639
This is Supoj, a friend of mine.

58
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,240
Hello, sir.

59
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,480
He takes care of this place.
He will take care of everything for you.

60
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,919
Young man,
would you like a bell for your elephant?

61
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,639
Do you want a bell?
Would you like a bell for your elephant?

62
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,600
-Do you want one?
-It's for good luck.

63
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,519
Do you want one for your elephant?

64
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,799
-How much is this one?
-That one is 40 Baht.

65
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,519
It's not expensive.

66
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,120
Buy a bell for your elephant
and get good luck.

67
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,279
Thank you, sir.

68
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,639
Let me take a look.

69
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,320
That's lovely.

70
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,840
Let's go.

71
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,519
Alright, Jungo. Jungo threw a left punch!

72
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,519
Hit Precisely. Be alert, be alert.

73
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,519
Be careful,
the referee has been knocked down.

74
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,679
It's coming.

75
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,559
Thank you.

76
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,759
Come on.

77
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,399
Bring it here.

78
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,679
Wait! Are you taking him away today?

79
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,879
Yes, today, Uncle.

80
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
You can go back home and wait there.
I will let you know what happens later.

81
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,840
Come on. Quickly.

82
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,679
Come on, move it.

83
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,519
Come on. Quickly.

84
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,320
Come on. Go.

85
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,600
You can't take him. Not yet.
I won't let you.

86
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,720
-What are you doing?
-You can't.

87
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,159
-You can't. You can't take him.
-Let go.

88
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,279
Force it to go.

89
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,720
-I said you can't take him.
-You old fart. I told you.

90
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
Move it. Quickly.

91
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,000
Look! Elephants.

92
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,440
Didn't you see the truck?

93
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,120
Dad.

94
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,840
Dad. What happened, Dad?

95
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,679
-Dad.
-Kham.

96
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,240
Check on Por Yai.

97
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Move!

98
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,960
Go!

99
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,879
Move it. I said move!

100
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Baby, we belong together

101
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
Enjoying the forest with a joyful heart

102
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,400
The waterfall pours down

103
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,160
As if heaven was before our eyes

104
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,359
Birds coo like my loving words for you

105
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,119
Hey!

106
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,599
Who the hell are you?

107
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,079
Do you want my foot in your mouth?

108
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,079
Go on. Get him.

109
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,519
What are you waiting for? Go get him!

110
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,119
Boss, my teeth! My teeth!

111
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,799
Boss! Wait for me! Boss!

112
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,440
Where are Por Yai and Korn?

113
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,839
-Where are they?
-I don't know. I don't know.

114
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,960
You don't know? You don't know?

115
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,640
Johnny took them.

116
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,599
They are in Sydney.

117
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,480
Where is he?

118
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,200
Dad! Shoot! Shoot him!

119
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,319
Enough.

120
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,880
My arm!

121
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,279
-Hey, you.
-Come on. Quickly.

122
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,920
Move it.

123
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,480
WITH LIFE THE SKY HAS NO LIMIT

124
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
BOAT NOODLES

125
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
Hey!

126
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
And this is the main Asian market
in downtown Sydney.

127
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,720
Most of the people here are Asian,
you know?

128
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,200
Chinese, Thai, Vietnam...

129
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,240
and Laos.

130
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,359
So officers here
need to understand Asian's way,

131
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,160
like me, for instance.

132
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,599
This is how I do my job.

133
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,839
It's important
to stay mates with the people.

134
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,000
-What beautiful mangoes.
-Hello. How are you?

135
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,440
They look lovely.

136
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,519
-How much is it?
-Do you want some? It's okay.

137
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,400
-Take some. Take them. It's no problem.
-That's enough.

138
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
-How much?
-Forget it.

139
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,000
-Are you sure?
-Just take them.

140
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,440
-Well, okay then. Can I take two more?
-Take them. Go on.

141
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,720
-Thank you very much.
-Not at all.

142
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,680
This just the way we do things here.

143
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,400
Being Asian in foreign place,
need to stick together, like a family.

144
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,039
Sure thing, love.
I'll be there in two shakes. Why?

145
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,680
Do you miss me?

146
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,440
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

147
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,640
Take it easy, baby.
I give you a kiss first, okay?

148
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,799
I love you, bye.

149
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,079
Hey! Just in time.

150
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,559
This is my new partner Rick.

151
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,960
He's just a young energetic kind of bloke.

152
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,519
A little less hard working than I am.

153
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,079
Hey, lighten up, mate.

154
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
There's no work right now.

155
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,279
Using public services
is part of our job as police officer.

156
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,160
You know? To serve and protect.

157
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,119
You look like you're constipated.

158
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,000
Why did you call the police?

159
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,559
-What am I supposed to do?
-Calm down...

160
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,559
-Hey, take it easy! Easy!
-Call the police.

161
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't come in.

162
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,559
-Hey, Take it easy.
-I'll blow their guts out!

163
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
-Call the police!
-Calm down.

164
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,759
Rick, Rick, Rick. No, no, no.

165
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,799
Leave him to me.

166
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,079
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

167
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's talk, okay?

168
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,240
Hey, Tui. You stupid prick.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

169
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,480
How did you know, Sarge?

170
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,119
You idiot. With a face like that,
who wouldn't be able to spot you?

171
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,279
Put the damn gun down.

172
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,640
-Put it down!
-Stay away.

173
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,759
-If you come any closer, I'll shoot.
-Shoot me if you want.

174
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,680
But don't forget about your mother.
When she gets here, you're in deep shit.

175
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,359
Don't lie to me.

176
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,160
-My mom isn't here.
-She is. Look behind you!

177
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,960
-You silly twit!
-No, no, no, no.

178
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,799
-Stop! Stop! Hey! Hey!
-Show me your face.

179
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,160
Hey! Stop! Stop! Please.

180
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,839
Come on. Imbecile.

181
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,240
It's been just another day.
Anyway, enough fun for now, okay? bye.

182
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,680
Go on, run.
Don't be such a wimp. You idiot.

183
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,039
It's no use
arresting a young junkie, mate.

184
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
Put a sock in it!

185
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Don't you know?

186
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,519
Cut some slack!

187
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,359
Stunned, you're stunned.

188
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,039
Go! Go! Go! Let's go.

189
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,200
Shit! When did that happen?

190
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,480
Why didn't anyone tell me?

191
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Why aren't you working?

192
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,440
When are you gonna pay
your boyfriend's debt?

193
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,400
Wittaya? Remember him?
Or you wanna die like him?

194
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,839
I know. I can pay.

195
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,039
You know you can pay?
How the hell are you gonna pay?

196
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,319
Thai students are only allowed
two jobs here.

197
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,759
One, you can be a waitress
or you can be a call girl.

198
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,839
What can you do?

199
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,720
You've got two weeks. That's it!

200
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,279
If the NGOs truly understood

201
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:38,599
the elephant situation here,
then they wouldn't be so against us.

202
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,440
From all the exits to the meeting room,

203
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,480
guards have been placed
at every ten meters.

204
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,640
Uncle, I have arranged everything for you.

205
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,640
I've hired Sydney's top chef
to make Abalone soup.

206
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,319
I made it for all of you.

207
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,200
I hope everyone will enjoy it.
Especially you, Uncle.

208
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,200
You should have some more of it.

209
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,359
This is good for your health.
It will keep you strong.

210
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,400
With good health,

211
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,759
you'll be able to look after
the family business forever.

212
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,000
Are you sure this is Abalone?

213
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,000
It's bland.
There's no aroma and no sweetness.

214
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,599
It tastes like earthworms.

215
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
You know earthworms, right?

216
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,559
Slithering insects...

217
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,559
which have two genders
without being either.

218
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,319
So what about it, Rose?

219
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
If you can't even provide
proper food for me,

220
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
how do you expect to protect me?

221
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,920
For security,
it's better to let Cheng handle it.

222
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,599
I think this is better.

223
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,160
When your father was alive,
Cheng was in charge.

224
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,680
What you do shows no respect
to our clients.

225
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,759
We are negotiating
with representatives of the government.

226
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,160
If we unite with them,
our business will grow rapidly.

227
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:17,039
Concentrate on the restaurant I gave you.

228
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,279
That's enough
responsibility for you, Rose.

229
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,680
That stupid old man
made me lose face in front of everyone.

230
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,359
You don't need to be angry; or impatient.

231
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,039
You already have this, don't you?

232
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,559
I think this new fate of mine
will finally rid me of that old man.

233
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,559
A tricycle is faster than this.

234
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,119
Stop here!

235
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Is that the best you can do?

236
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,240
God, you drive like a pensioner.

237
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,160
Hey! Jimmy.

238
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Calm down. Calm down.

239
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:06,880
Let's talk. Okay?

240
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,119
Hey, hey. Stop!

241
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,840
What the hell are you doing?

242
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:40,960
He was a hostage!

243
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,440
I didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,519
I will handle this.

245
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,800
Jimmy was no ordinary thief.
I know him well.

246
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,880
And this guy was not with him.

247
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,679
I don't, I just have a hunch.

248
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,639
What are you doing here?

249
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,599
Are you Thai?

250
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,599
I'm speaking Thai.
Do you think I'm Burmese?

251
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,960
Did you come to Sydney to break the law?

252
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,480
No, sir. I've come here
to find Por Yai and my little brother.

253
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
-Are you looking for your relatives?
-Yes.

254
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,159
-What do they look like?
-Like elephants.

255
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,920
Elephants?

256
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,440
Elephants?
Who's like an elephant in Thaitown?

257
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,920
Come on.
Let's talk about this back at my office.

258
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,280
Mark.

259
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,559
-Hello.
-How's it going, Goong?

260
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,400
-Are your clients keeping you busy?
-Not really.

261
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,599
It's your fault.
You never visit my restaurant.

262
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,679
I'm really busy now.

263
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,599
-There's a new promotion on.
-Yeah?

264
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,239
Special price at lunchtime.

265
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,679
-I will go if I have time.
-Okay.

266
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,119
It's a Thai Restaurant.
Tom-Yum-Goong is Thai food.

267
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,159
So, why did they hire
a Vietnamese guy like Johnny,

268
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,679
to be the general manager?

269
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,320
Johnny, Johnny.

270
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,079
-Okay. See you later.
-See you.

271
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,880
-Work hard.
-You too.

272
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,199
Follow them quickly.

273
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,519
Hurry up!

274
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,719
-Don't start any trouble.
-Follow that car! Quickly!

275
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,480
Quiet down! Quiet down!

276
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,519
Those are the people
that took Por Yai and Korn.

277
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,840
Don't say that. You can't accuse someone
without any evidence.

278
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
I have a photo. But it's in the taxi.

279
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,920
Don't waste my time.
We'll talk at the station.

280
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,079
Hey!

281
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,159
Let him go.

282
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Johnny, where are my elephants?

283
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,079
Where are my elephants?

284
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,440
Johnny! Give me back my elephants.

285
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,480
We are both Thais. So, I'll warn you.

286
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,239
Don't get involved with them.

287
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,599
Where is Jimmy's body?

288
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:57,880
And the evidence?

289
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,239
I know.

290
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,719
You're an ugly son of a bitch.

291
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,719
Okay. Thanks.

292

MAMA CUP TOM YUM GOONG FLAVOR

293
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,119
Kings sit upon the elephants.

294
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,920
Vital areas are underneath.

295
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,119
Enemies aim for those areas.

296
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,119
Soldiers protect the four most vital areas
of the elephants.

297
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,679
What are the vital areas, Dad?

298
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
One day you will know, Kham.

299
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,119
Come on out!

300
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,320
What are you doing?

301
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,079
Tui.

302
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,000
What the hell are you doing?

303
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,199
He forced me to do it, Sarge. I...

304
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,239
Rick.

305
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
-Hello.
-Mark. This is Goong.

306
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,239
Where are you?

307
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
I just watched the news
and I'm worried about you.

308
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,239
Don't say anything.
Someone might be listening.

309
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,159
Can we meet?

310
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,079
Pla has just called me.

311
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,800
She has evidence
which can prove that you're innocent.

312
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,400
She won't see me unless I see you first.

313
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,599
No problem. Where?

314
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,559
Mark.

315
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,039
I'm sorry.

316
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:36,920
You.

317
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,079
Ever since Johnny and his men came here,

318
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
it has been hell for everyone.

319
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,639
Everyone from the waitresses
to the manager.

320
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,760
I don't know what to do.

321
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,039
They built a secret entrance
at the back of the restaurant...

322
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,920
for their VIP clients.

323
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,760
Everyone wants to know
what goes on up there.

324
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,519
Maybe the relative you are looking for
is up there.

325
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:40,360
Where's Johnny?

326
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,159
Don't let him in.

327
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,960
Hey, bro!

328
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,920
Where are my elephants?

329
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,639
Where are my elephants?

330
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,599
What is he saying?

331
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:21,519
Where are my elephants?

332
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,880
Korn!

333
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,239
Hey. Hey.

334
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,119
-What are you doing? Hey, Johnny!
-Don't touch me. Let me go.

335
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:23,440
-Johnny!
-Johnny!

336
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,199
-Mark!
-Johnny.

337
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,639
-Johnny. Let her go, Johnny.
-Let me go.

338
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,960
Let her go, Johnny.

339
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,440
Korn!

340
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:32,640
Have you found your brother?

341
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:43,439
Korn! Korn!

342
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,640
Korn!

343
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,119
Shit!

344
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:48,840
An elephant! A real elephant!

345
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,000
How did you get here?

346
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:53,199
Korn!

347
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:41,840
Rose, the heir to the business
should be Sim's Son.

348
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,760
But Chao is only 13. He's still a child.

349
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,680
He doesn't yet have the ability
to run the family business.

350
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,960
Then, the most suitable person
should be Kang.

351
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,960
He is the son of Third Aunt,

352
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,600
who is the younger sister
of Sim and your father.

353
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,960
That should be good. Kang has just
graduated in Management from England.

354
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,439
He should be able
to take good care of the business.

355
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,000
Why don't any of you
think about how I feel?

356
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:12,039
I am also my father's child.

357
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,119
I have devoted everything to this family.

358
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,319
I would always help Uncle
when he was still alive.

359
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:26,399
Take a good look at yourself.
You're neither a man nor a woman.

360
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,199
How do you expect us
to let you run the family business?

361
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,159
We wouldn't be able
to show our faces in public.

362
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,159
Kang! What's wrong with you?

363
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:38,680
Please don't scare me. Help! Help!

364
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:40,800
Help! Help!

365
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,119
You! Why did you have to do this?

366
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,560
The most suitable person is dead.

367
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,279
What's wrong? Tell me, Chao!

368
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:51,159
-And the second is dying.
-Chao! What's wrong? Chao!

369
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:52,600
Is there anyone suitable left?

370
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,159
In that case, I accept the responsibility.

371
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,239
I promise you all...

372
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,600
I will make the family business
better than ever.

373
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,880
I won't let you down.
I won't let my father down.

374
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,840
And I hope for the utmost cooperation
from you all.

375
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,720
Be patient, Korn.

376
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,039
We'll find Por Yai together.

377
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,239
Hey, Kham. We can't stay here anymore!

378
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,119
I think we've disturbed you enough,
father.

379
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,039
Thank you very much
for your gracious assistance.

380
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,840
Once you have stepped on fire,

381
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,840
no matter how far you run,

382
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,359
your feet will still burn.

383
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:28,199
At least, we won't cause you any problems.

384
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,239
I must go now, father.

385
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:31,640
Come on, Kham.

386
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:50,880
-What are you going to do now?
-I must find Por Yai.

387
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,119
I think that transsexual knows something.

388
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,279
Maybe we should go back
to the temple for now.

389
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,239
Father!

390
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,840
-Someone, help!
-Father!

391
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,279
Get out quickly. Go on.

392
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,159
Damn it!

393
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,199
Kham!

394
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:58,880
You should take the elephant
back to Bangkok.

395
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,039
I have connections at the port.

396
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:02,560
It would be easy for you to go back.

397
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,079
What about you, Sarge?

398
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,479
Don't worry about me.

399
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,520
Where's my elephant?

400
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,079
Where is he?

401
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,039
Vincent.

402
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,119
Asshole!

403
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,960
You piece of shit!

404
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,079
Korn!

405
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,119
You're scum!

406
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:34,800
You son of a bitch.

407
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,199
Your mother's a dirty whore.

408
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:40,000
Get up! Get up!

409
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,039
Get up!

410
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,960
Johnny! Put the gun down.

411
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:52,880
This majestic elephant...

412
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:55,680
will enhance your dominion.

413
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,039
All will bow to you

414
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,760
and the power which you hold.

415
01:34:32,439 --> 01:34:34,960
Korn! Korn!

416
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:40,119
Korn! Korn! Korn!

417
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:04,399
Stupid!

418
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,039
Watch out! What have you done?
Be careful. My elephant.

419
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,479
Bring him down. Get up! Move!

420
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:58,479
An elephant is most vulnerable
at its tendons.

421
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,439
If its tendons are severed, it will fall.

422
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,960
Wait.

423
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:18,319
-Come on, come on. Quickly.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

424
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:20,199
Lower it down! Lower it down!
Lower it down!

425
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:23,640
-Come on, come on. Quickly, quickly.
-Up! Up!

426
01:39:32,119 --> 01:39:33,319
Are you okay, Goong?

427
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:52,359
Name?

428
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:53,520
Somsak, Sir.

429
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,159
-God, are you Thai?
-Aren't I speaking clear enough?

430
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:57,359
You sarcastic piece of shit!

431
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,000
Elephants have represented Thailand
for many years.

432
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:39,840
We respect them
as if they were our own brothers,

433
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,880
our family.

434
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,279
Thai people don't appreciate it
if anyone tries to hurt an elephant.

435
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:49,960
Actually, Thai people like peace.

436
01:40:50,039 --> 01:40:52,319
Peace, peace, you know?

437
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,760
But we don't like it
when people take our liberties.

438
