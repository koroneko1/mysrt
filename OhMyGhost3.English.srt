1
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:12,250
-Be careful.
-Yes, you too.

2
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,250
-Slowly.
-I know.

3
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,832
-I love you.
-I love you too.

4
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,332
Are you alright?

5
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,207
-Love you.
-Love you.

6
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,500
It's so beautiful!

7
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:41,917
Pancake.

8
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,875
-Did you call me?
-Pancake.

9
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,707
Tangtong, how did you find me?

10
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:57,125
-Come back home.
-Your home's not mine.

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,332
-You should go back. Please.
-Who's this?

12
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,500
He's just a boy next door.

13
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,917
-What about our baby?
-How can you call it our baby?

14
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,042
It's yours, not mine.

15
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,707
That little innocent baby

16
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:17,292
was born out of lust, not love.

17
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:20,250
-Why are you like this?
-Tangtong.

18
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:25,000
Just let me go. Stop holding me back.

19
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,082
You know what? I'm still hot.

20
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:32,542
I'm young and beautiful. More importantly,
I have many countries to cover.

21
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,917
From now on, you and I...

22
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:40,250
let's just say we're strangers.

23
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,167
Pancake!

24
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,750
Oh!

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,707
What brought you to Korea?

26
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:14,917
You're such a slut!

27
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:19,250
-So thirsty for men.
-Oh, well, excuse you.

28
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,541
-Don't be jealous.
-I'm not jealous.

29
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:23,958
-Aren't you though?
-A little.

30
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,750
What are you wearing?
Mama's a tiger, baby's a snake?

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,291
I'm sorry. Are you looking for the zoo?

32
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
What about you? Is that a mongrel?

33
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,458
-Cute little lamb!
-The day has come.

34
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,875
A tiger like me and a snake like him
will wreck a little lamb like you.

35
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,958
-Do you think you can threaten me?
-You're not scared?

36
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,083
-Piss off!
-Fuck you!

37
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,791
Tangtong, is that you?

38
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:54,375
You sold me out so that old hag could
come all the way to just diss me.

39
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,583
I'm telling you, that guy Tangtong...

40
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,500
-you can have him.
-And I'm telling you,

41
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:05,208
Tangtong's not the kind of guy
you think he is.

42
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,750
-So you're saying no?
-No!

43
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,916
Mom.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,625
-Are you done?
-I still have my robe on.

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,958
Get out!

46
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,000
Tangtong.

47
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,625
Hey! What's going on?

48
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,333
Don't!

49
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,666
Mom!

50
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,916
What's the matter? Go away!

51
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Mom!

52
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,041
Kouy's head got stuck.

53
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,458
Just "your head," OK?
You don't have to say "Kouy."

54
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,458
Open. Out. Close.

55
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,583
Open. Out.

56
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,458
Close.

57
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,833
Tangtong, where are we?

58
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,166
Open. Get. In.

59
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,291
I respect you like my mother.

60
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,041
Mother? Yeah, like a motherfucker.

61
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,416
-What the hell?
-Tangtong.

62
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:43,000
-How about that? Does it turn you off?
-The smell of your fart...

63
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,958
makes me so horny!

64
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,875
Let me go! Hey!

65
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,625
Tangtong, let me take you to heaven!

66
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,916
-Oh, my god!
-Oh, my god!

67
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,750
-She's so dead!
-Mod, what's wrong?

68
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,458
-What?
-She's murdered upstairs!

69
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,958
Yeah, there're a lot of Southerners.
You're a Southerner, idiot.

70
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,375
-You're not listening!
-She’s annoying!

71
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,750
-Here's what happened--
-What are they saying?

72
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,958
-On the eighth floor...
-On the eighth floor...

73
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,916
-she's been murdered.
-she's been murdered!

74
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,958
-What happened, Dad?
-This is not a kid's concern.

75
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,041
How do you know?
You got into their room?

76
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,416
Well, I...

77
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,666
-My underwear!
-You’re the underwear thief!

78
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,875
That's why people were complaining
about missing undies, you perv!

79
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,166
What?

80
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,500
Caught in the act, pervert!

81
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,708
-Who steals what? No!
-Shut your face!

82
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,875
-Where's the proof?
-In your hands.

83
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,958
So who's dead? Which room?
Who murdered whom?

84
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:03,125
-Here's the story...
-Here's the story, in room 808,

85
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,708
Someone strangled her so
she choked on her tongue to death.

86
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,625
Let's go check it out. Songkram,

87
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,541
stay here and don't go anywhere.

88
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,958
-Kaengho, take care of the shop.
-Yes, Dad.

89
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,916
Let's go! Come on!

90
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,875
She's really dead.

91
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,166
Where is she?

92
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,333
Oh, my god! What!

93
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,708
Ratree!

94
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,542
-Ratree!
-She's...

95
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,514
dead!

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,250
-Who did this to you?
-Who killed her?

97
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,375
How can we know? We--

98
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:45,082
-Why are you babbling so much?
-Don't leave me!

99
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,375
Wake up! Wake up! Please!

100
00:08:56,292 --> 00:09:01,917
Holy shit!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

101
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,292
So steady.

102
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,167
He seems respectable.

103
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,125
Please, sir.

104
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,957
Come on. Let's get inside.

105
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,832
Why are you crying? Come in!

106
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,625
Phookan, come in. Thank you. Thank you.

107
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,125
Hello, venerable sir.

108
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,957
Come sit here, Phookan.

109
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:30,082
Where's Songkram? I told her
to bring the photo. Where is she?

110
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,082
She'll be here soon.

111
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:34,667
She has to look here and there--

112
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,750
Stop looking. There she is.

113
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,457
Careful. Careful. Place it nicely.

114
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,957
Beautiful.

115
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,792
Songkram! Why are you bringing this photo?

116
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,167
There's only this one.

117
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,457
And if you find only my photo,
will you use that as her funeral photo?

118
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:54,707
You will? I'm gonna kick your ass!

119
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:59,292
-In front of the monks?
-I'm sorry.

120
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:02,417
-But she does look dead though.
-Yeah, we can use it.

121
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,663
Looks like a corpse.

122
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,082
-Please continue.
-Moddum,

123
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,332
I'm sorry. Someone's looking for you.

124
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:12,832
Who? We're in the middle of the ceremony.

125
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:17,707
Perfect timing. Damn it.
What's so important?

126
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,457
Here he is.

127
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,832
Evening, officers. What can I do for you?

128
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:27,582
A woman called to report
a homicide in this dormitory.

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,125
A homicide? That's a misunderstanding.
We just have a funeral ceremony.

130
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,917
Our friend died. She's very old.

131
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,500
She was electrocuted by a crock pot.

132
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:37,707
Dead on the spot.

133
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:41,500
It happened yesterday. So we arranged
a little ceremony for her, officers.

134
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:45,417
Do you want to examine the body?

135
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,000
It's probably a prank call then.

136
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,917
Yeah, prank calling 191 happens a lot.

137
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:52,582
You look a little pale, sarge.

138
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:56,500
I think we should go.

139
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah. Goodbye, officers.

140
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:02,042
-Waste of time! Who prank called us?
-Right, lieutenant.

141
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:07,457
-Is that...?
-Undoubtedly!

142
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,957
-If so, let's go!
-Run!

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,125
Moddum, I saw two cops down there.

144
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,042
They ran like hell when they saw me. Why?

145
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,457
They saw your face and they ran?

146
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,457
What?

147
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:04,375
Moddum, who placed
my photo in front of the casket?

148
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,125
Bitch, is that you?

149
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:15,000
-It's her.
-Songkram, I'm gonna smack you so hard!

150
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,375
Why are you doing this?

151
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:22,332
-So what now?
-Please continue praying.

152
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,792
We take care of this.

153
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,457
-Do you want us to continue?
-Yes, please.

154
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:47,750
-Please go on.
-Well selected.

155
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,750
I don't think this is a good idea.

156
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,082
What do we do now?

157
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,875
Are you sure that...

158
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,667
The weather's nice today.

159
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,582
Right, my little fawn?

160
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,000
Mom, where are we going today?

161
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:02,917
Wait and see.

162
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:09,332
We've been in Korea for a while,
so I want to tell you that

163
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,792
we should be careful with money.

164
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:15,917
Don't buy drinking water.
Just scoop up some snow then boil it.

165
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,417
Is that doable?

166
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,667
Of course.

167
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,167
Jang Keun-Suk, come on darling!

168
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,625
I think love is a connection.

169
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:30,542
-I think real love--
-But I think...

170
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:34,000
-goes on beyond times--
-this town is not abandoned.

171
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:34,957
It's just that...

172
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:38,582
Pancake!

173
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,292
You!

174
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:48,917
Oopsie-whoopsie! Mother-son duo,
what are you wearing today?

175
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,707
-Little fawn.
-Little fawn? Aww!

176
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,707
Patchy like a leprotic mutt.

177
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,125
Mom, she called me a leprotic mutt!

178
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,832
Pancake, how dare you insult my son?

179
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:03,875
Never heard of this trend?
It's called Twilight style.

180
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:07,332
-Twilight Saga?
-Twilight Thai Luk Thung.

181
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,667
-What about you?
-This?

182
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,417
-It's called "coh-ca-die"
-Crocodile?

183
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,582
My, oh my!
You're a lot smaller than before.

184
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,125
You're too thin to be a crocodile.
Monitor lizard's more likely.

185
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,582
-You want to die, Pancake?
-Calm down, will you?

186
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,667
Oh, hey,

187
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,042
-can I ask you something?
-What?

188
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:31,917
Tangtong, who I gave you...

189
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:35,250
-did you hit it?
-Hit it or not? Look at me.

190
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,292
Did you?

191
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,375
Mom, why are you crying?

192
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,207
He left me hanging. No, I didn't hit it.

193
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,625
By the way, why didn't
those two hags come along with you?

194
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,957
-They couldn't join us.
-Why?

195
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,625
They just got their nose jobs done.

196
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,542
-So they couldn't pass the security check.
-Why?

197
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,457
Their faces didn't match the passports.

198
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,000
Right? I was dying to know

199
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,000
how our faces didn't match the passports.

200
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
Look! Comparing side by side,

201
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
you look exactly the same, Moddum.

202
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,041
Yeah. How could they do that?

203
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,208
Those stupid officers
were absolutely blinded!

204
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:21,125
And they accused me
of being a prostitute. Remember?

205
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,208
I really believed
that they didn't have eyes.

206
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,791
-How stupid!
-They probably thought I was so pretty.

207
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
-Bitch!
-What did you say?

208
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,083
Hey, how did it go
with that guy last night?

209
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,875
Last night? I was well-fed.
Today's a new day, I'll get a new one.

210
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,250
Less than a day
and you're looking for a new boy?

211
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,250
Well, I have a lot of countries to cover.

212
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,666
What? You're walking with me now?

213
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,750
No, I just want to say that
it's so nice here.

214
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,625
-Yeah.
-Oh, did you sell your dormitory?

215
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,958
Not yet. But I have them take care of it.

216
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,583
They'll give me a call when it's sold.

217
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,083
Speaking of the devil! Maybe they sold it.

218
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,208
So freezy! I can't even touch the cellie.

219
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,083
Hello? Say what?

220
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,666
-Grandpa's dead!
-Oh, no!

221
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,166
Who's grandpa?

222
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:26,041
Grandpa's my dad's dad...

223
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,166
My father's father
and mom is your mother...

224
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,500
so grandpa's father of... Screw it!

225
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,000
-How old is he?
-He's 120.

226
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,666
A regular human probably would have died
twice. And who called to tell you?

227
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,333
-Grandma.
-She's still alive?

228
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,791
-She's two years older than him.
-Hey,

229
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,166
what do your ancestors
eat to live that long?

230
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,708
Ginseng. Grandpa...

231
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,833
-There, there. Don't be sad.
-Grandpa!

232
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,833
Yeah, you can stop right there.

233
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,833
We arrived. Come on.

234
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,875
Take your stuff, Kouy.

235
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,000
Get everything out.

236
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,916
All done. Thank you.

237
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,458
This place gives off a spooky vibe.

238
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,166
Didn't notice you got a new haircut.

239
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,416
My son is so handsome.

240
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,375
-Where did you get that?
-At the duty-free salon.

241
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,833
You didn't pay tax
for that cut? Good boy!

242
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,791
But what kind of airport
has a duty-free salon?

243
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:48,041
-In Korea, mom.
-Oh, Maeng-ka-chon Airport.

244
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,791
-Incheon Airport.
-Yeah, Incheon Airport.

245
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,875
Kouy, do you see what I see?

246
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,958
Clearly.

247
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,125
-Cartoon!
-Aunt Cartoon!

248
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,666
You told me only Grandpa died.
Why did you have to die too?

249
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,875
I have to see for myself. Cartoon!

250
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,041
-Why are you so stiff?
-I'm scared.

251
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,541
You don't have to be stiff.

252
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,625
Kouy's not stiff.

253
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,958
Just for now or permanently?

254
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,208
For now.

255
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,791
All right, then. Follow me.

256
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,958
Cartoon!

257
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:57,500
We didn't get to say goodbye,
Cartoon. Kouy, take this.

258
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,958
I want to see my sis for the last time.

259
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,083
-Careful, Mom.
-Cartoon!

260
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,125
Cartoon!

261
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:17,250
Help....

262
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,291
Help what? This is not the time.

263
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,083
I just want to say goodbye to my sis.

264
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,416
Spot on!

265
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,463
Spot on what?

266
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,041
Spot on!

267
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,083
Spot on what, Mom?

268
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,041
That one...

269
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,125
and this one are spot on.

270
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,291
Help me...

271
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,375
Let's go.

272
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,500
Mom, should we help her?

273
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,250
No. Can you move to the left a little?

274
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,083
Your goddamn left, not mine.

275
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,666
I mean, please move
to your left, not mine.

276
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,333
Do we have to be this close?

277
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:34,083
-You're sure we can pass?
-Yes, come on out.

278
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,625
Can you pass? There you are. Easy-peasy!

279
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,625
Mom, run back!

280
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, no! Have us at both ends.

281
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,291
-Wow! Intense stare! Really...
-Our luggage.

282
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,541
If you're not gonna move, please let us
have our luggage. There's stuff inside.

283
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,958
Just a little. Yeah, a little.

284
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:04,916
Kouy, one, two, three...
Good luck! Let's go!

285
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,666
-Moddum! Cartoon!
-What's voice?

286
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,000
Aunt Cartoon!

287
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,916
-It's Taew.
-What are they doing?

288
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,125
Are they sleeping or are they
doing something else? Cartoon!

289
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,916
-Hold on. Moddum!
-Taew, is that you?

290
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,875
It's really her!

291
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,041
Oh! You're back!

292
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,666
-How was Korea?
-Let's talk inside.

293
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,666
I don't want to be spooked.
Come on, close the door.

294
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,958
-Come here! Come here!
-Hurry up!

295
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,708
-Why?
-You two,

296
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,791
why is there a dead body in that room?

297
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,041
The funeral pavilions are all full.
You can ask her.

298
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,666
Yeah. I went to many temples.
They're all full.

299
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,791
So we decided to wait.

300
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,208
Do you know whom we ran into?

301
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,291
Kouy, tell them whom we saw.

302
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,875
"Help..."

303
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,416
-Ghost!
-Kouy, get in there!

304
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,583
Come on in!

305
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,250
We're safe. She dare not come in here.

306
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,958
Kouy, you shouldn't be sitting
with elders. Get down.

307
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,125
-Get down! It's crowded up here.
-I'm scared.

308
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,875
-Too crowded...
-Don't be scorched. Mom's right here.

309
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,000
-Scorched?
-Scorched as in frightened.

310
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,458
"Scared," not "scorched"

311
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,708
I'm Chinese. I don't know.

312
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,958
Cartoon, how's grandpa's funeral?

313
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,416
All done. We had a Chinese ceremony
and he is buried.

314
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,208
It's so strange. There're so many people.
Your relatives kept showing up.

315
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:59,083
He's from China. He had a big family.

316
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,291
It's pretty normal.
All those people related to him,

317
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:06,041
-there are 109 in total.
-Whoa! 109?

318
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:09,166
-He had 80 wives.
-Eighty wives?

319
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,791
-Twenty-six children.
-Twenty-six children?

320
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,500
So that's 106 people.
What about the other three?

321
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,166
The rest are Taew, Kouy and I.

322
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,291
Yes.

323
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,083
-One hundred and nine.
-Oh, 109.

324
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,208
Go get the luggage.

325
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:23,583
Yes, mom.

326
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,750
You bought us something?

327
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,875
We should be thinking of each other.

328
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:33,083
Big suitcase! Don't tell me
you have a Korean man inside.

329
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,250
Are you crazy? Who would
huddle up in here for 20 hours?

330
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,416
-What is it? I'm so excited!
-Hurry!

331
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,708
Close your eyes.

332
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,958
-Close your eyes.
-When you open, you see... this.

333
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:49,375
You went all the way to Korea
just to get me these pickles?

334
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,916
I can just chop, throw them in a jar
for three days, and it tastes better.

335
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,208
Don't call me your sis anymore, bitch!

336
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,375
But it's Korea's national food.

337
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:05,416
-All right.
-Do I have to close my eyes?

338
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:09,333
So I'll be surprised like her.

339
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,208
You don't have to,
'cause when you open your eyes,

340
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:18,083
you'll scream in my face like she did.
Here's your seaweeds.

341
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,083
-Bitch!
-See? Remember.

342
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:28,125
Take her as an example.
Keep it short but meaningful.

343
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:34,375
Why so sullen?
These are just little souvenirs.

344
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:41,166
I have surprises for you, the nice kinds.

345
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:45,500
-I knew it!
-I'm not that stingy.

346
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:49,750
-Kouy, bring them here.
-Yes.

347
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:54,708
Moddum, you look tired lately.
I mean, your face looks disturbing.

348
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,541
You need this face mask.

349
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,208
Face mask? My face looks tired

350
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,750
so you bought me this face mask.

351
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:06,416
But If I look disturbing,
what about Cartoon?

352
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,041
She's too far gone for any face masks.

353
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:14,250
-What should I do with my face?
-There's only one way. Kouy.

354
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,875
You should be reborn. It might help.

355
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,833
-Can you turn your voice the other way?
-I don't like it either.

356
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,791
Oh, hey,

357
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,625
-where's Pancake?
-Oh, Pancake?

358
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,666
Why do you act like you don't know her?
Shout if you want to meet.

359
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,083
Pancake!

360
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:49,708
-Dae Jang Geum.
-Annyeonghaseyo!

361
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,083
-Korean look.
-Why are you calling me here?

362
00:27:56,166 --> 00:28:00,250
You screamed so loud at this hour.
Don't you think it's disturbing?

363
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,416
Or you want me to summon you
via BlackBerry app?

364
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,208
BB? You're so out.

365
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,083
-So what's in?
-Here.

366
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,291
-Oh, iPhone 4 sex.
-What sex? It's iPhone 4S.

367
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,041
-4X?
-4S.

368
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:18,541
But the reason why I haven't bought
this iPhone

369
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:22,083
-is because I'm waiting for the iPhone 5.
-Last night, I got Steve Jobs.

370
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,541
-Got what?
-Got this iPhone for you.

371
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,083
-So what's the matter? Why did you call?
-I want to ask you about...

372
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,875
that woman. I want to know what happened.
How did she die and who killed her?

373
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,375
-I'll talk to her.
-OK.

374
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,541
She's got it!

375
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,208
-How's it going?
-I can't talk to her.

376
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,416
Aw!

377
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,750
She doesn't allow me.
Her spirit is full of rage! Wrath!

378
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,666
Revenge!

379
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,875
Get startled a little.

380
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,500
OK. What else?

381
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,416
I think, for now,

382
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,958
you should bring her body to a temple
and dedicate merits to her soul.

383
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,833
-Sure. Cartoon,
-Yes.

384
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:10,083
you take care of the temple.
This time you have to find it.

385
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,208
-Yes, sure.
-You guys help me take care of the body.

386
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,583
-OK.
-Anything else?

387
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,833
If not, I leave now.

388
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,416
A slut like you
can go to hell for all I care.

389
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,708
-You hoe!
-Hey, bitch!

390
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,458
-What?
-You summon me whenever you want.

391
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,041
You don't give a damn about me.

392
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,458
When I'm of no use,
you kick me out like I'm nothing.

393
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,083
I'm telling you something.

394
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,625
-What?
-It's you!

395
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,833
You're shamelessly brazen-faced.

396
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,208
Your face is even more durable
than a co-no-cre-te road.

397
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:45,000
-What is that?
-Concrete road, you idiot!

398
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,083
I told you not to
play poker so late at night.

399
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,916
-Loved it much, huh?
-It was fun.

400
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,791
We're this late. Who's gonna give us food?

401
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,708
-Hurry!
-You still owe me money though.

402
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,333
Ratree, I'm sorry.

403
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,458
If you'd listened to me,

404
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,583
it wouldn't have ended like this.

405
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,250
Please forgive me, Ratree.

406
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,500
-Hey, Pratueang.
-Yes?

407
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,666
Why is she getting dressed so slow?

408
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,333
We'll be late for the monks' breakfast.

409
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:36,041
Monks eat corpses?

410
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,750
Shut it! What kind of monks eat corpses?

411
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,333
Take the body to the temple
before their breakfast time. Get it?

412
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:42,375
Oh.

413
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:47,000
-You're sure she's not up during the day?
-How do I know?

414
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:55,833
You go first.

415
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,458
-I don't think I can protect us.
-Your face surely can.

416
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,083
Come on! Get in!

417
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,958
Belbel, come here.

418
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,375
-What?
-What are they doing?

419
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,333
Moddum.

420
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,458
What are you afraid of?

421
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,125
Let me ask you something.

422
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,291
Did you take all the hair from your
grandmas, grandpas, child, nieces, nephews

423
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:27,708
and ancestors to put on your head?

424
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,583
Is that a hairdo? Ugly beyond belief.

425
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:35,500
You don't get a chance
to have a burden on your head like me.

426
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:40,750
A burden? Look at me. I could die.

427
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,125
It's nothing compared to me. Look!

428
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:53,708
One more for luck. How's that?
I'm not just a lion, but a mega lion.

429
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,291
Wait...

430
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:59,291
Where's the monk
that we invited to lead the body?

431
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,125
-Why don't you lead it yourself?
-I'm not a monk.

432
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,500
He's downstairs. Stop bossing around.
I'm responsible.

433
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,625
-You go first.
-No, you go first.

434
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,291
So you can shield me
from the ghost with your face.

435
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,583
-Go!
-Don't push me!

436
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,208
Or do you need a kick?

437
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,625
Just a push.

438
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,750
Come on in.

439
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,375
Yeah, this room. We saw her last night

440
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh!

441
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:28,625
-What?
-Look over there.

442
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,583
What are they doing?

443
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:36,875
Stop it!

444
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,041
He's a monk. Why are you scared?

445
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,916
-A monk or a ghost?
-Venerable sir.

446
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,416
Please proceed.

447
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,666
-Go on.
-Yes, please.

448
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,666
Looks like he could be dead.

449
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,708
-He shrieks.
-He's a twink.

450
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,208
-Are you?
-I'm not.

451
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,208
-Why did you shriek?
-I'm not a twink.

452
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,333
Don't be rude. He's a monk.

453
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,375
Please continue, venerable.

454
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,000
-Radiant like a respectable monk
-Yes.

455
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,916
Moddum.

456
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,083
Loud and clear.

457
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,416
-Pitch higher than a banshee.
-At the top of your lungs.

458
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,000
And you said you're not.

459
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,208
Why do care so much about a monk's gender?

460
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,416
Moddum, the body's gone!

461
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,166
-Gone?
-Damn!

462
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:39,541
Is that Man vs Ghost?

463
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,166
Is Jane there?

464
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,333
The one with the catchphrases,
"I can feel it,"

465
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:52,000
"I got a shiver down my spine."
Oh, Jane's not there?

466
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:56,458
What about Riw? Riw with the sixth sense?

467
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,666
The guy who asks anyone he meets,

468
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,250
"Did you have an abortion?" That one.

469
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:09,083
-Riw's not there. What do we do?
-I know someone.

470
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:14,208
Jane call him brother. Riw calls him
father. Krit calls him uncle.

471
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,000
Tui X-ray calls him grandpa.

472
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:36,083
This place is heavily
surrounded by spirits

473
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,333
I can feel it!

474
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,083
I have a shiver down my spine.

475
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,625
Jane's catchphrases.

476
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,416
He's standing right next to me.

477
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,291
Someone jumped off the building
at that spot, right?

478
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,791
Did anyone die here?

479
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,416
-No!
-No one died, master.

480
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,041
Here! I can see him!

481
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,625
He's just jumped off.

482
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,833
-It's too late.
-How is he?

483
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,166
Smashed.

484
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,625
-He's the real deal.
-Is this it?

485
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:13,208
-The room with the missing body?
-Yes, this room.

486
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,375
Yes.

487
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,333
I don't see anything.

488
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,875
-Pancake's standing here. How can he not?
-Can he feel it?

489
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,083
He can feel shit!

490
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,708
-This bitch!
-Look! She's standing with a smile.

491
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:36,041
-Where?
-Behind his back. I can feel it.

492
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,708
Who brings him here?

493
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:43,458
The monk suggested it. Master Yantip.

494
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:46,916
Master Yantip? Go back to your rooms.

495
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,791
I'm gonna play with this pseudo master.

496
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,666
-Have fun.
-Come on. Let's go.

497
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:55,166
It's all right.
Pancake's gonna handle this.

498
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:01,208
-Damn!
-Come on.

499
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,541
-What?
-Why don't you let us watch?

500
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,541
I thought he has
a sixth sense or something?

501
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:08,666
Who did you recommend him?
He's not even believable!

502
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,875
He's a fraud!

503
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,708
I think he's genuinely capable.

504
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,708
-He can feel it
-I can feel it.

505
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,083
And he always gets a shiver
down his spine.

506
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,541
Feel it?

507
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:24,208
-He shivers because he needs to poop.
-Yeah, right.

508
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:29,416
-Who hit me?
-Who hit you? It's me.

509
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,625
I have strong faith in him.

510
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,666
Here!

511
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:38,958
It's you, Pan?

512
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:40,333
Yeah, it's me, Pancake.

513
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,666
You see me now?

514
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,541
You want to test me? Fine.

515
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:53,583
No! Please don't! What are you doing?

516
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,875
-You are, right?
-Am I what?

517
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:13,625
Am I what? Come back here!
What are you talking about?

518
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:18,458
I'm gonna jump off now!

519
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,041
Phookan, close the door!

520
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,375
-Hey!
-What?

521
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,333
Gluta bitch, do you know who I am?

522
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,458
-No.
-Oh, Dumbo!

523
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,291
Literally every ghost
in this world knows who I am

524
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:00,166
because I'm so popular.
Amy Winehouse and I are buddies, you know?

525
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,541
Why don't you know me?

526
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,416
I just died.

527
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:07,208
I'm warning you now.
Don't you dare harm my nephew, Phookan

528
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
and everyone in here,

529
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:11,666
including Petch. Understand?

530
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:17,125
Aren't you dismissed?
What are you standing here for?

531
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,791
I don't know how to disappear.

532
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,416
You dumbass! I don't even know
what to say.

533
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,083
Here's the door! Go!

534
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,416
Still here?

535
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,458
What are you looking at? Out!

536
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,541
Hit me right in the eye! Bitch!

537
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,750
How are my lashes?

538
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,583
Why is she so bright, though?

539
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,875
-You ape!
-I'm not. I was born in the year of Tiger.

540
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,041
I'm not talking about the zodiac year.
I mean you look like an ape.

541
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:14,250
-You don't know shit. It's a facial mask.
-What is it?

542
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:18,250
Taew bought me this.
Here she is. You can ask her.

543
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,541
Tell her what a facial mask is.
Tell her about the brand.

544
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,375
It's a skincare product from Korea.

545
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,208
-From Korea.
-Korea?

546
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,166
It's called Gomasikoltamperry.

547
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:33,916
-What?
-It's Golbrimaskspakam--

548
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,083
What brand, tell them.

549
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,125
Gold Bright Mask by Bath Berry.

550
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,958
I'm using it. How do I look?

551
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,708
You look exactly lame.

552
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,166
I use this expensive stuff
and still look the same?

553
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:48,000
No, I mean you look lame.

554
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:49,916
-Itchy?
-Bitch!

555
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,625
Hey.

556
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,458
So do you know

557
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,958
-where the body is?
-Huh.

558
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:02,416
You look me in the eyes. See?

559
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,166
It kept me up all night
as I tried to figure it out.

560
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,000
-Thought about it all night.
-Still no idea.

561
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:11,666
Do you have any clues

562
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,875
who the killer is?

563
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,000
-Yes.
-How do you know?

564
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,791
808

565
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,166
-What are you doing?
-What about you?

566
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,583
No!

567
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:18,166
Phookan is a good boy.
He would never do that.

568
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:19,958
But we saw him outside.

569
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,708
You two stop arguing, including me.

570
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,333
-Who argues with you?
-Right.

571
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,458
I made an appointment with a master.

572
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,791
He's so amazing.

573
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,375
He knows instantly who killed her

574
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:36,375
with what weapon and what motives.

575
00:43:36,666 --> 00:43:40,125
Then why were you asking us?

576
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,791
Why don't you go ask your master?

577
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,958
-Right.
-I'm meeting him right now.

578
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:49,333
-Where?
-Phutthamonthon Sai 4, Thawi Watthana,

579
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:52,916
Bangkok, 10170.

580
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,416
Wow! Fully decorated!

581
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,416
Hail Lord Ram. Victory to Lord Rama.

582
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:17,916
Dammit! I could smell
all the spirits as soon as I arrived.

583
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,291
Chaku.

584
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,833
-Music!
-Right on, Hanuman.

585
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,916
Enjoy yourself much?
Your voice's cracked so hard.

586
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,250
Scatter the petals.

587
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,958
Hail Lord Ram. Where is she?

588
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,708
She's on the eight floor.

589
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:59,333
All of you go wait in that room!

590
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,500
-She's upstairs. Why are we going there?
-Don't argue.

591
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,875
Your ancestors' spirits
reside in that room.

592
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:08,166
How does he know?

593
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:11,291
See? Grandma and Grandpa

594
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,666
-are both in that room.
-Right.

595
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,375
-What about you?
-I lead the way.

596
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:21,083
Come on. Follow him.

597
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,708
Hail--

598
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,666
Don't get so close. I'm OK. I can do this.

599
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,958
-I haven't stepped back.
-So step back.

600
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,791
Hail Lord Ram.

601
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:02,000
-The lights went off!
-Where's the flashlight?

602
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,125
-Master!
-Where's Master?

603
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,000
-Master!
-Where is he?

604
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,833
Is that him?

605
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:21,666
-Master's dead!
-He's just showed up and died?

606
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:22,833
Go!

607
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,625
If you were human,
I would punch you in the face. Chaku!

608
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:23,458
-Are we done, Hanuman?
-All done.

609
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,875
Let's go. We have another job
so don't wash it off yet.

610
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,208
-Is that a Photharam accent?
-Indian.

611
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,916
Really? Let's call a taxi motorcycle.

612
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:37,583
-Kaengho, open the door.
-Where's the key?

613
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,125
-Where?
-The key?

614
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,083
Come on! Hurry!

615
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,541
Watch your back in case she's following.

616
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:53,500
Where should we hide?

617
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,166
What is it, Mom?

618
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,041
-Ho, Kaengho.
-Yes?

619
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:07,583
-What are you doing up there?
-I'm behind you.

620
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,041
-Really?
-I'm here!

621
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,833
So who is it? Give me the flashlight.

622
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:17,416
Here.

623
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,791
What are you doing up there, Ratree?

624
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,875
You were in that room.
Why didn't you help me?

625
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,125
I don't really know anything.

626
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,250
You have to go ask Moddum.

627
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:36,875
Bullshit! You liar!

628
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:42,708
-Mom, she can understand us.
-She tells me off in Northern dialect.

629
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,666
We almost there! We're safe--

630
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,750
What, Mom?

631
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:28,125
Well, I'm not sure.
I can't tell you what it is. But you...

632
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:34,791
go "one, two, three" and run.
Then help me confirm if it's her.

633
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,458
-Yes, Mom.
-OK?

634
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:41,958
One... two... three...

635
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,166
-Is it?
-It is.

636
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,541
Change of plan, Kouy.

637
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:53,750
You take a detour and get in over there.

638
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:57,000
Lock the door and stay put.
I'll stall her here.

639
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,666
Wait, what about you?

640
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,416
After you get safely inside,
you come out and stay here.

641
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:07,166
So I can take a detour
to our room like you.

642
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:08,291
Sure, Mom.

643
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:09,875
You look smart but...

644
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,041
Kouy is smart, mom.

645
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,500
Attaboy!

646
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:15,208
Good luck!

647
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,458
-Ho?
-Yes, Mom?

648
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:19,416
Why are we staying?

649
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,125
-We should go.
-Let's go.

650
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,000
We're leaving, Ratree.

651
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,666
-Where is she?
-We should go.

652
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,458
Mom, she's got stuck.

653
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:11,666
I can't take it!

654
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:18,666
It's so cold!
I'm gonna be frozen to death.

655
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:22,500
You don't have to do that.
Even though I look like a pig

656
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,583
but you don't have
to put me in the freezer, you know?

657
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,250
-Then what are you?
-What am I?

658
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:29,708
I'm a toad.

659
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,708
Bitch! Why don't you give me a sign first?

660
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,125
Can you not follow me?

661
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,500
Ratree!

662
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,875
Umm, I have to...

663
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:14,166
I have to check on my son.
I'll be back before you know it.

664
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,458
Promise.

665
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:19,833
I trust you.

666
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,375
You are such a sweet ghost.

667
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:25,750
Thanks a lot.

668
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,291
I'll be back for you to scare me.

669
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,750
It gives me the chills,
the fact that you're so nice.

670
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,708
I'll be back for you, I promise.

671
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:38,333
-You can trust me.
-Go now, bitch!

672
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,375
Uh.

673
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,291
Kouy!

674
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,791
Kouy! She's gone! Kouy!

675
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,333
Hey, I told you to wait at the stairs.

676
00:52:55,458 --> 00:52:57,041
How can you get into my room?

677
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,291
And where's my son?

678
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,333
-Mom, help me.
-Who allows you to talk?

679
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,375
-Mom!
-Shut up!

680
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,166
-Mom
-Shut up!

681
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,958
-Not yet!
-Why are you hurting him? He said nothing.

682
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,458
Don't you understand?
I told you to wait over there

683
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,208
while I check on my son. Then I

684
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:20,166
go back for you to scare me.
I come for him,

685
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,041
go back for you.

686
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,541
It's not that I won't be there
so you have to come here.

687
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,583
-What kind of ghost are you?
-Where?

688
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,500
-At the stairs.
-I won't go.

689
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,458
-Will you?
-No!

690
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:30,875
-Will you?
-No!

691
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,250
Bitch! It hurts!

692
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:42,166
I wait for you at the stairs.

693
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,166
Good. I'll be right back.

694
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,208
It won't be long.

695
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:52,208
I've never seen
such a stupid ghost before.

696
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,958
What an idiot!

697
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,791
You're an idiot!

698
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,625
You don't keep your words.

699
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,541
-We made a deal.
-See you at the stairs.

700
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,875
OK.

701
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,708
-Why didn't you tell me she was back?
-Kouy didn't see.

702
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,291
Kouy didn't see? Kouy didn't see?

703
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,958
Where the hell is Pancake?

704
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,291
We could use
some help in a situation like this.

705
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,041
Stop, Gluta bitch!

706
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,250
-Where're you going?
-I'm going to take revenge.

707
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,708
Whoa! She's taking revenge.

708
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,541
That being said,

709
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,958
who killed you and where is your body?

710
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,375
Nosy! It's none of your business!

711
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,375
Hey!

712
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:42,208
You newbie,

713
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:45,291
what can you do to take revenge?

714
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,958
Pew! Let me tell you,

715
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,916
I could turn my neck 360 degrees
before my parents even met.

716
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,916
Ghosts these days, let me show you.

717
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,916
-What the hell are you doing?
-Do you know?

718
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,166
It's a ten-grand art.

719
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,833
I wouldn't waste a dime on it.

720
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,625
You don't have taste!

721
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,916
A low-life who can't appreciate art!

722
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,875
-I'm leaving.
-Where to?

723
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,125
To take revenge.

724
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:42,083
Before you take revenge,
please take me to the shower.

725
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:44,708
Ow...

726
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:46,583
Who will help me?

727
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,250
Who's knocking?

728
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,375
Who is it? Let's take a look.

729
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,375
Who's there? Oh!

730
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,708
What's the matter with you?

731
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:02,708
No, it's not true. I don't believe it.
Screw you, bitch!

732
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,333
Hmm?

733
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,958
-Who are you with?
-Oy!

734
00:56:06,291 --> 00:56:07,750
I'm by myself.

735
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,416
It's not true! I don't believe it!

736
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,375
If you don't believe me, I count for you.

737
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,666
-One.
-Two.

738
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,166
See? I told you it's two.

739
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,875
-Stop!
-Why?

740
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,583
-Let me down.
-This bitch!

741
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,333
You didn't tell me when you got up

742
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:32,541
but you tell me
when you want letting down, asshole!

743
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,375
-I can't!
-What are you hurrying for?

744
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,208
It hurts my head!

745
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,833
Come on! It's late!

746
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,750
People will see us.

747
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,250
-Taew!
-Phookan!

748
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,291
What is it?

749
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,083
I heard you might have something to do

750
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,875
with Ratree's murder.

751
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,291
I didn't do it. I don't know.

752
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:13,166
How could you not know?

753
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,875
The day she died,

754
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,583
you're standing in front of that room.

755
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:20,250
True. I saw you with my own two eyes.

756
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,250
-She saw you.
-She saw you too.

757
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:24,958
Phookan.

758
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:28,916
I've known you a long time.
You're not like that.

759
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,666
You two!

760
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,291
How can you blame him?

761
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,583
-Aw.
-True.

762
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,458
-Phookan's not like that.
-Kouy, stop.

763
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,666
Kouy, you don't know him that well.

764
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,291
So not so fast.
Keep your opinions to yourself.

765
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,291
I've been listening.

766
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,791
-So you're the murderer!
-You are the murderer!

767
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,416
-You're accusing me?
-Hey! Stop!

768
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,208
Both of you stop now!

769
00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:51,000
Can you see who's standing here?

770
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,416
She's a senior,
the owner of this building.

771
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,000
-Right.
-And she's not just any senior

772
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:57,125
but a very old senior.

773
00:57:57,208 --> 00:58:00,583
This is what we call the prototype,
the original prototype. Look at her.

774
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,041
You're right.

775
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:05,625
You'd better keep it in mind.

776
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,000
You're a bunch of young lads.

777
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,541
You should learn to respect elders.

778
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,875
This old-head is standing right here.

779
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,041
She's not a toe,

780
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:19,791
so you can step over

781
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,625
and she's not a hoe,
so you can just kick her out.

782
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,583
Understand?

783
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:28,166
Mom, they call you a hoe.

784
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,166
Let it end with them.

785
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,000
Don't recite.

786
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,958
Both of you,

787
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:40,708
come talk to me outside.

788
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,958
I have something to discuss.

789
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,083
Stop! Kouy, don't point your finger at me.

790
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,291
What just happened?

791
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,416
Hey! Hey!

792
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:54,083
If you don't respect that hag,
can you just respect this bitch.

793
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:56,166
You bitch!

794
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,250
Get out!

795
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,166
You go downstairs. Go!

796
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,833
Go!

797
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:08,791
What is it?

798
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:12,750
You keep an eye on those two, OK?

799
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,458
-Is that all?
-Yes.

800
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,250
Wait.

801
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,500
The fact that both of you

802
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,208
bitches called me a hoe,

803
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:24,833
-I don't forget. We settle that later.
-Why don't do it now?

804
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,375
I'm sorry I'm can't do it today.

805
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:28,875
Always nice to me.

806
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:33,000
I was just joking.

807
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:34,625
I was teaching them a lesson.

808
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,041
No, you meant it. I knew.

809
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,708
We settle that later, ratfink.

810
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,541
You'll see.

811
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,458
Let's go, Kouy.

812
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,916
You have to keep an eye on them too.

813
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:48,625
Sure, Mom.

814
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,458
I don't want them to...

815
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:53,166
So cute!

816
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,000
Why is this so loud?

817
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,416
This room, Mom.

818
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:58,583
It's from this room?

819
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,666
What are they playing?
Or is someone getting murdered?

820
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,291
It's so noisy.

821
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:09,833
Who's that?

822
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,583
Taew, hi! Please come on in.

823
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:18,000
What's with the noise?

824
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,791
Why don't you go to school?

825
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,833
It's not a holiday.

826
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,541
Look at you! Don't you have any shame?

827
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,291
You little dickhead faggots.

828
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,458
What noise? It's just my regular voice.

829
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:33,333
You're louder than anyone, rabbit.

830
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,291
I'm sorry, that's not my name.

831
01:00:35,625 --> 01:00:38,125
I didn't say it's your name.
I mean you look like one.

832
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:39,958
Thank you.

833
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:42,125
-The one that's used to grate coconut.
-Fishwife!

834
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:47,541
I want to kick your face
but I'm afraid of your teeth.

835
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,708
All right, girls.

836
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,208
She's the owner here.

837
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,875
We don't want to get kicked out, right?

838
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:56,083
I'm so sorry about my girl friends.

839
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:57,583
Your friends are fine.

840
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,375
How about you? Is your neck alright?

841
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:01,833
Oh, no! It's fine.

842
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,833
I can take you
to the hospital to get it checked.

843
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,375
No, I'm fine. It's just

844
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,000
the way I am.

845
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,208
Is it?

846
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,791
-Let's go, Kouy.
-What?

847
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:16,416
-What's his name?
-Kouy.

848
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:19,208
-I want to have some.
-You want to have mine?

849
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,125
-Goodbye.
-Let's go, Kouy. Close the door.

850
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:25,333
Lay down your money.

851
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,250
-Done.
-Cut the cards.

852
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,958
OK.

853
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,416
Let me see

854
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,916
if hell is real, right?

855
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,125
Come on!

856
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,708
Check it out.

857
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,041
-Me?
-Go!

858
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:48,291
-This one?
-Yes, get in the truck.

859
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,958
Officers, you can keep them.

860
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,375
Don't let them out.

861
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,458
These corrupting demons.

862
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,083
Not only pose as monks,
they're also drunk.

863
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,958
Move along.

864
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,041
Ready!

865
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,583
Sinners.

866
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,250
I'm sorry, Ratree.

867
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,750
I didn't mean to.

868
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,833
So much homework.
I don't know if I can finish it tonight.

869
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,541
It's not just the homework.

870
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:25,166
-I don't think we're gonna get any sleep.
-You're right.

871
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:26,833
Peek-a-boo!

872
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,958
-Where are you going, cuties?
-We're just back from school.

873
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,583
-We're going to our room.
-Whoopsie, going to your room.

874
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:38,666
You are, right?

875
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,375
Yes.

876
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,541
That's huge! You can use all that?

877
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,916
Of course.

878
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,333
Please don't do anything!

879
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,333
I never do it! Please!

880
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,000
Ooh, that little pinky!

881
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:15,750
What's the matter with you?

882
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,833
-I can't stay here!
-Run!

883
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,458
Come on! Run!

884
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,625
Wiggly butts.

885
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,000
So cute.

886
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,708
You're so happy, huh?

887
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:40,791
Hey!

888
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,083
Hey!

889
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,500
Hey!

890
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:50,958
Sleeping like a log.

891
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:05,416
One's in bed and one's on the floor.

892
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,875
Now you can't cuddle.

893
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:11,541
Mom, what are you doing?

894
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:16,416
I'm stalking Tangtong's Instagram.

895
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,166
Kouy.

896
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,041
Am I beautiful?

897
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:27,208
You the most
beautiful woman in this world.

898
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,625
Here's my fresh face.

899
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:35,666
Tangtong, you can choose

900
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:38,083
between the freezing temperature out there

901
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,333
and my hot body.

902
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,083
If you choose the freeze,

903
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:46,041
you'll be stiff till you're shrunk.
If you choose me,

904
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,458
you'll be stiff

905
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,291
and never shrunk.

906
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:02,375
If I'm that beautiful,
why did Tangtong ignore me?

907
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,041
He's head over heels for Pancake.

908
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,541
Pancake looks sweet

909
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:10,750
What about me?

910
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,916
You're spicy.

911
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,208
Right. Sweetness...

912
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:18,875
should be balanced with spiciness.

913
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:23,333
Pancake!

914
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,708
Pancake, where are you?

915
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:29,458
Pancake!

916
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,375
Tangtong!

917
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:46,166
-Pancake...
-Wait!

918
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:50,000
Don't turn back. Turn away.

919
01:06:58,916 --> 01:06:59,791
Tangtong.

920
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,250
Where have you been?

921
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:10,791
Do you know?

922
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,208
Love...

923
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,000
has nothing to do with your goodness,

924
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,250
it just has to be right.

925
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,666
But you are-- Where are you?

926
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,875
But you're right for me, Tangtong.

927
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,791
-I love you.
-Enough already.

928
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,541
-Stop lying to me!
-I lied?

929
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,625
When did I lie to you?

930
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,208
-It's not true.
-Pancake!

931
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,250
Surprise?

932
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,916
Taew.

933
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,375
I'm the one who called Tangtong,

934
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:47,416
so he knows the real you.

935
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,333
The real me?

936
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:51,416
What are you talking about?

937
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,833
She gets around
with every guy in this place.

938
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:58,083
-This whole place. Slut!
-Right.

939
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,500
That's not true, Tangtong.

940
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,583
It's not like what she said at all.

941
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,458
I'm not that kind of girl.

942
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:05,916
-You know it.
-Please just stop.

943
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,916
What about these boys?

944
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:19,917
Waii, the clip.

945
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:21,832
Here it is.

946
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:26,750
Tangtong.

947
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,582
Oh! It feels so good!

948
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:33,542
Ahh!

949
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:36,582
It's so good! Ahh!

950
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,042
That's not true.

951
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:41,042
Anybody can edit it, Tangtong.

952
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,125
That night,

953
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:44,292
who had fun with Pancake?

954
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:46,957
-Raise your hand.
-Me!

955
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,542
You're the one who recorded it, silly.

956
01:08:53,457 --> 01:08:54,332
Waah! You're with me.

957
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,125
How could you join them?

958
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:57,582
Put your hand down, Kouy.

959
01:08:57,707 --> 01:08:58,625
I forgot.

960
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:02,667
Well done, everyone.
Put your hands down.

961
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:05,957
Everybody, leave.

962
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:09,957
That's not true.

963
01:09:11,207 --> 01:09:12,750
Your girl is being framed, Tangtong.

964
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,707
I'm not like that.

965
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,625
-It's not true.
-What happened?

966
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,042
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

967
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:22,000
Moddum!

968
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:24,332
Taew's framing me.

969
01:09:24,582 --> 01:09:26,457
-Moddum, please help me.
-Moddum!

970
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:28,917
Tangtong.

971
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:30,792
It's not true.

972
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,457
These people are trying to frame me.

973
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:34,957
-I'm your wife.
-Kouy!

974
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:37,207
Here, Mom.

975
01:09:38,457 --> 01:09:39,332
We knew it.

976
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:47,250
Check... Check. One. Two. One. Two.

977
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,332
What is it?
Why are you carrying your handbag?

978
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:52,207
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

979
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:54,250
You can carry it for me.

980
01:09:54,332 --> 01:09:56,457
-So, last night,
-What happened?

981
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:58,832
Last night was so amazing.

982
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:00,292
What I had last night

983
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,292
was a lot better
than 3 years with Tangtong.

984
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:05,417
Better than three years with Tangtong?
Do you hear it?

985
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:07,125
Of course. It came out of my mouth.

986
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:08,500
-Oh... Check.
-Can you believe--

987
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,167
-it's satisfying-- Check. One.
-Check. One.

988
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,875
You're acting suspicious.

989
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:15,375
What? No! I'm not being suspicious.

990
01:10:15,457 --> 01:10:17,875
-Can you confirm?
-I confirm, it's me Pancake.

991
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:21,417
I am Pancake, the generous vamp

992
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:23,000
from last night.

993
01:10:23,082 --> 01:10:25,332
Pancake who can gets around with everyone.

994
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:26,707
I'm not a slut, just generous.

995
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,582
I repeat. Check. One.

996
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,832
-What?
-Even if there were ten Tangtongs,

997
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,292
I wouldn't care.

998
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:37,332
-You're the golden slut.
-It's not easily trained

999
01:10:37,707 --> 01:10:38,832
but I can achieve this

1000
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,667
because of my talents--

1001
01:10:42,957 --> 01:10:45,082
Tangtong, do you really believe that?

1002
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,125
You believe these people's lies
about your wife?

1003
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,125
Shut up!

1004
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:50,917
What kind of girl does this?

1005
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,082
You're married with a baby.
You'd should be with them

1006
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:55,750
instead of flirting with every man.

1007
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:57,832
Do you know
the word "loyal?" Do you?

1008
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:00,082
You're not only a toad,
but you are also a hoe.

1009
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,250
Who can be friend with her?

1010
01:11:01,332 --> 01:11:03,250
You stinky shitweasel!

1011
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,332
Whore!

1012
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:08,042
You're... right.

1013
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,417
Tangtong.

1014
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,832
I love you. I've been waiting
for you since you left.

1015
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:15,250
-I've been waiting just for you!
-Enough!

1016
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:16,417
You wicked Kakee!

1017
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:19,792
Tangtong...

1018
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,542
I'd never have thought

1019
01:11:23,707 --> 01:11:25,750
that I'd hear that word out of your mouth.

1020
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:28,042
If Kakee is evil,

1021
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:30,957
why do cops and soldiers wear khaki?

1022
01:11:36,082 --> 01:11:38,542
Tangtong, you have to believe me.

1023
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,292
Pancake, just stop.

1024
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:43,500
It's over.

1025
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,167
Taew, who would have thought

1026
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,000
we've known each other for 10 years,

1027
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,542
and you would hurt me.

1028
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:53,875
-Snake!
-I'm a python,

1029
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,000
nonvenomous,

1030
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:57,125
but can crush tightly.

1031
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,875
Kouy.

1032
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:01,207
Dad!

1033
01:12:02,457 --> 01:12:03,375
"Dad?"

1034
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,707
You call him Dad?

1035
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:22,250
Once love's lost, how can I live?

1036
01:12:22,332 --> 01:12:25,917
When you're gone, how will life be?

1037
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,707
-Since you are my breath...
-Tangtong! Don't go!

1038
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,625
You're the meaning of life.

1039
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:36,000
When love's lost, I can no longer stand

1040
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:37,750
-Sly bitch!
-When I lose you...

1041
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:41,082
I won't let you go. I won't let you

1042
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:45,125
Leave me behind, no matter what it takes.

1043
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,917
I will fight.

1044
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,250
Won't stop?

1045
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:11,582
Pancake!

1046
01:13:11,957 --> 01:13:13,167
We broke up for real.

1047
01:13:19,832 --> 01:13:21,000
Tangtong!

1048
01:13:21,707 --> 01:13:22,707
Tangtong!

1049
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,207
No! Tangtong!

1050
01:13:26,457 --> 01:13:27,582
Tangtong!

1051
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:30,500
Tangtong!

1052
01:13:37,832 --> 01:13:39,082
Oh, look at that!

1053
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:49,957
Where's Daddy Tangtong?

1054
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:53,125
Don't worry. He's with us now.

1055
01:13:53,207 --> 01:13:54,375
-He'll be back soon.
-Taew!

1056
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:04,582
Come here!

1057
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:06,207
You called me?

1058
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,667
OK.

1059
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,792
You want to talk to me?

1060
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:13,457
What's your business?

1061
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:15,500
-Taew!
-What?

1062
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,417
It's just a guy! I can't believe

1063
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,250
that you'd do me dirty. Remember it, Taew,

1064
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,125
from now on, we're not friends!

1065
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,957
It's not over.

1066
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,875
Pancake!

1067
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Pancake, don't hurt my mom!

1068
01:14:35,957 --> 01:14:36,832
Kouy.

1069
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:38,832
Find Moddum and call...

1070
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:40,582
someone to help.

1071
01:14:40,832 --> 01:14:42,042
Yes, Mom.

1072
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:44,875
Aunt Cartoon! Aunt Moddum!

1073
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,125
Pancake!

1074
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:49,375
Do you remember...

1075
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:52,000
when we were in Korea?

1076
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:56,292
You're like a sister to me.

1077
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,500
Of course I love you.
Who else would I love?

1078
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,375
Sis,

1079
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:04,582
thank you!

1080
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,167
-I lied.
-Bitch!

1081
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:09,667
Sis,

1082
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:11,792
actually

1083
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,167
you're like my second mother.

1084
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,875
Of course I love you too.

1085
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,500
Aunt Moddum!

1086
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,457
Aunt Moddum! It's Mom!

1087
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,417
Pancake's strangling Mom upstairs.

1088
01:15:48,957 --> 01:15:50,417
Cartoon!

1089
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,542
What's going on, Moddum?

1090
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:54,082
Pancake's strangling Taew.

1091
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:56,332
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1092
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:07,417
Taew!

1093
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:09,707
No!

1094
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:11,832
It's not me.

1095
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,625
I didn't kill her.

1096
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,250
-Hurry!
-Come on! This way!

1097
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,250
Is she all right?

1098
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,875
-Oh, no!
-Taew!

1099
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:33,082
-Taew!
-Please don't die!

1100
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:34,500
Taew!

1101
01:16:34,707 --> 01:16:35,582
Taew!

1102
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,707
-Taew!
-She's dead.

1103
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,332
Taew!

1104
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:43,750
Taew! Wake up!

1105
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:44,707
Why wait?

1106
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,417
Let's take her downstairs.

1107
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,375
Taew!

1108
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:52,332
Taew!

1109
01:16:54,082 --> 01:16:56,207
Do you think it's a good idea?

1110
01:16:57,457 --> 01:17:00,250
Mom, you'll get cold a little.

1111
01:17:02,707 --> 01:17:04,542
So evil!

1112
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:05,542
Close it.

1113
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,082
Come on, close it.

1114
01:17:11,207 --> 01:17:13,707
Wait, don't close it.

1115
01:17:13,792 --> 01:17:16,375
How can she breathe?

1116
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:18,667
Bitch, she's dead.

1117
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:22,332
Turn it to subzero

1118
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,042
in case she wakes up.

1119
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,042
Taew!

1120
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:30,500
Taew!

1121
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:39,250
This is all because of Pancake.

1122
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,250
She shouldn't have done that with Taew.

1123
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:47,082
Moddum, Cartoon, Kouy.

1124
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:49,082
Pancake!

1125
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:50,667
You're so evil!

1126
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,542
How could you do that?
It's just a guy.

1127
01:17:53,832 --> 01:17:56,167
-You killed her over a guy?
-Right.

1128
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,207
I didn't kill her--

1129
01:17:58,625 --> 01:17:59,957
-Stop lying!
-You...

1130
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:04,457
-You strangled her to death!
-Yes!

1131
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,250
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1132
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:07,582
How could you be so sure?

1133
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,125
-You ran off.
-I know what I saw.

1134
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:12,542
-Saw what?
-This.

1135
01:18:12,707 --> 01:18:15,042
-Kouy, I'm your sis!
-Sis?

1136
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:16,667
Here!

1137
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:20,082
By rank, I'm your aunt!

1138
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:21,082
Aunt?

1139
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:24,707
Kouy.

1140
01:18:25,792 --> 01:18:26,667
Er...

1141
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,125
I apologize for what happened.

1142
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,000
No matter what I say,

1143
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,207
no one will believe me.

1144
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,832
But I tell you this,

1145
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:39,792
I'm sorry for what happened.

1146
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:43,250
Please take good care of Taew's body.

1147
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:46,625
Don't let it rot.
I'll find a way to bring her back.

1148
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,875
Not that powerful but pretty solid.

1149
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,625
Are you Manny Pacquiao?

1150
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:56,750
"Don't let it rot."

1151
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,332
"Will bring her back."

1152
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:15,042
Moddum! Cartoon!

1153
01:19:15,457 --> 01:19:17,875
Moddum! It's Hung.

1154
01:19:19,082 --> 01:19:19,957
Who howls?

1155
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:22,207
Your father perhaps. It’s me, Hunglay.

1156
01:19:22,332 --> 01:19:23,332
Oh, Hunglay!

1157
01:19:23,417 --> 01:19:24,832
-Hunglay.
-Hey!

1158
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,250
Cartoon, Moddum, that boy Petch

1159
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:30,792
is having a fight
with Phookan on the rooftop.

1160
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,957
-Phookan!
-Because of you, Phookan,

1161
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,625
it turned out like this!

1162
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,707
It's beyond that point.

1163
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,167
What point?

1164
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:48,000
What do you want from me?

1165
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:51,417
You'd better tell me

1166
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,417
where you hid Ratree's body.

1167
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,917
I didn't do it. I don't know.

1168
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:57,582
It's your fault!

1169
01:19:58,457 --> 01:20:00,750
This is all because of you!

1170
01:20:00,957 --> 01:20:02,542
Come on!

1171
01:20:03,207 --> 01:20:04,500
What's going on with them?

1172
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:06,957
Yeah, I heard that

1173
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,167
"it's beyond that point" or something.

1174
01:20:09,332 --> 01:20:11,375
-Beyond that point?
-What point?

1175
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:14,582
Some point about a body.

1176
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:17,542
Body? Which means

1177
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:19,000
they know about the body.

1178
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:21,500
Ratree's body?

1179
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,042
Phookan's walking here.

1180
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,375
Phookan's here! Let's hide!

1181
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:35,457
Hey! What is it?

1182
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,167
Where is he?

1183
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:01,500
Hey, Phookan likes to sneak around here

1184
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,625
very often.

1185
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,875
Come on! Let’s see.

1186
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:10,375
He's over there! See?

1187
01:21:13,082 --> 01:21:14,957
I think it's he...

1188
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,667
who hid the body.

1189
01:21:17,082 --> 01:21:18,417
That's why she's so terrorizing.

1190
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,625
You mean the ghost of that body.

1191
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,167
Yeah.

1192
01:21:25,957 --> 01:21:27,375
Petch, I have an idea.

1193
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:30,332
I knew this shaman. He's incredible.

1194
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:34,000
But tonight is not the right time.

1195
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:35,542
I think we should go.

1196
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,250
Ratree!

1197
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,582
You'd better come out right now!

1198
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,625
Ratree, where are you?

1199
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,000
Ratree!

1200
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,917
-Ratree!
-What do you want from me?

1201
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:23,582
What have I done to you?

1202
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:25,542
Why did you have to kill me?

1203
01:22:25,832 --> 01:22:26,832
I didn't!

1204
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:28,667
Pancake did.

1205
01:22:30,167 --> 01:22:31,582
Stop lying.

1206
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:35,625
Pancake loved me like a sister.
She would never kill me.

1207
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:39,082
Then you can die because of love!

1208
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:47,832
Ratree! Why are you doing this? Let me go!

1209
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:52,167
I want to know if your best friends

1210
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,582
will come and help you.

1211
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,582
Let me go. Let me go!

1212
01:22:56,457 --> 01:22:58,582
We can duel one-on-one.

1213
01:22:59,957 --> 01:23:00,917
Ratree!

1214
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,957
You wicked evil spirit!

1215
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:26,207
Why is it down?

1216
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:38,542
Help!

1217
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:40,875
Help!

1218
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,125
Ratree,

1219
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,167
I'm sorry about that night.

1220
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:08,167
Forget it. I don't want to talk about it.

1221
01:25:11,792 --> 01:25:13,457
But I love you.

1222
01:25:14,832 --> 01:25:17,875
-Will you give me a chance?
-I can't. I don't love you.

1223
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,207
What's wrong?

1224
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:26,457
No, it's nothing.

1225
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:51,957
Mom, I miss you.

1226
01:25:53,957 --> 01:25:54,832
Mom,

1227
01:25:56,332 --> 01:25:57,207
Kouy's hard...

1228
01:25:58,292 --> 01:25:59,957
at school just for you.

1229
01:26:01,207 --> 01:26:03,917
Mom, do you know since you left,

1230
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:06,207
Kouy gets up early...

1231
01:26:07,582 --> 01:26:09,125
to give offerings to the monks for you.

1232
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:12,292
Mom,

1233
01:26:13,832 --> 01:26:14,917
Kouy promises that

1234
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:16,792
Kouy will be a big...

1235
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:19,207
boy for you.

1236
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,417
Mom,

1237
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,875
come back to me.

1238
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,207
Kouy misses you.

1239
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,042
Kouy...

1240
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,375
don't be sad.

1241
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:36,375
it's gonna be okay.

1242
01:26:41,292 --> 01:26:42,207
Kouy, stay strong...

1243
01:26:42,707 --> 01:26:46,125
and keep fighting.
I'm always by your side.

1244
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:49,875
Kouy... Kouy, get up...

1245
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:52,582
and fight...

1246
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:55,082
You can do it.

1247
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:58,917
Kouy, maybe you should change your name.

1248
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:02,250
Why are you crying your hearts out?

1249
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:05,667
I have news for you.

1250
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,875
What?

1251
01:27:07,207 --> 01:27:09,707
For Taew, it's not her time to die.

1252
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:12,082
She still has years left.

1253
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,167
Wee!

1254
01:27:13,417 --> 01:27:14,542
She can still come back.

1255
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,207
Here's the way.

1256
01:27:17,582 --> 01:27:20,125
Everybody has to take her body

1257
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:22,707
to the praying ceremony

1258
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:25,000
in order to nourish
her soul with good merits.

1259
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,417
Hey!

1260
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:20,000
Master!

1261
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:21,750
Ratree rises up now.

1262
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,457
Untie her.

1263
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,125
Who? Me?

1264
01:28:26,707 --> 01:28:28,667
-You do it!
-No, I'm scared!

1265
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,832
Come on! Hurry!

1266
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,167
I paid you to do it.

1267
01:28:32,832 --> 01:28:33,750
-Hurry!
-Damn it!

1268
01:28:42,707 --> 01:28:43,582
Ratree!

1269
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:45,707
Phookan!

1270
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:47,500
Hey!

1271
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:51,500
Ratree! Don't hurt her!

1272
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,167
-Stop it!
-I told you to stop!

1273
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,957
-Don't hurt Ratree!
-Stay still!

1274
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,917
-Let me go!
-Stop!

1275
01:29:00,957 --> 01:29:03,167
-Go to hell!
-Stop fighting!

1276
01:29:05,957 --> 01:29:06,832
Master!

1277
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,042
-Stop!
-Master!

1278
01:29:12,417 --> 01:29:13,292
-Ratree!
-Hey!

1279
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:19,207
Let me go!

1280
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,000
Ratree!

1281
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:23,707
Ratree!

1282
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,917
Kouy, hold me tight!

1283
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:30,542
Let's go, Pancake!

1284
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,917
With my good deeds

1285
01:29:35,332 --> 01:29:37,125
that I'd collected,

1286
01:29:37,207 --> 01:29:39,250
that I'd donated

1287
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,417
the rain cloths and essential offerings.

1288
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:45,542
I also gave a homeless man 40 Bahts.

1289
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:46,957
I gave rice with chicken too.

1290
01:29:47,082 --> 01:29:49,082
With my merits,

1291
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:51,582
from my love for everyone and vice versa,

1292
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,125
may I be freed from the evil snare.

1293
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:00,582
I'm freed!

1294
01:30:01,707 --> 01:30:02,582
Ratree!

1295
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,332
What are you doing?

1296
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,917
Huh?

1297
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,457
-Why?
-Hey!

1298
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:10,792
You!

1299
01:30:12,082 --> 01:30:14,667
-Who are you?
-I'm a ghost.

1300
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:16,750
You're a man,
how can you choke me?

1301
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,250
It's supposed to be me choking you.

1302
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,667
Sacred rice again!
Why didn't you cook it before use?

1303
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,125
Eat my sacred rice!

1304
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:32,582
Ratree!

1305
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:36,125
Taew, take the knife!

1306
01:30:39,707 --> 01:30:41,167
Where is it?

1307
01:30:47,332 --> 01:30:48,582
She's split in half!

1308
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:53,957
Taew, I'm here to help you!

1309
01:30:56,082 --> 01:30:58,000
Taew! What happened to you? Kouy!

1310
01:30:58,082 --> 01:31:00,250
Take care of your mom.
I'll take care of that shaman.

1311
01:31:00,582 --> 01:31:01,457
Mom!

1312
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,750
Mom! What happened to you?

1313
01:31:09,207 --> 01:31:10,082
Mom!

1314
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,500
Who are you? You want to fight?

1315
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,875
You want to know who I am.

1316
01:31:18,582 --> 01:31:20,667
I am Gaga, pupil of Buakaw.

1317
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:26,082
How's that? The French
couldn't even stop me.

1318
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,042
I hit you in the targets.
Where's my gold medal?

1319
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,625
What is the reason?

1320
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,332
I won! I won!

1321
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:44,542
Taew!

1322
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:47,000
Kouy!

1323
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,957
-What happened to her?
-Mom...

1324
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,542
Mom's split in half!

1325
01:31:51,292 --> 01:31:52,542
She's sold by pieces?

1326
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,417
Bitch!

1327
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:57,667
The person who loves her the most

1328
01:31:58,292 --> 01:31:59,542
can't help her.

1329
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:04,417
No! Is she really going to die?

1330
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,375
Mom!

1331
01:32:06,667 --> 01:32:07,667
-Pancake.
-No!

1332
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:09,457
No! Taew!

1333
01:32:11,332 --> 01:32:12,207
Taew!

1334
01:32:12,917 --> 01:32:15,417
I'll pray for you.
I'll give my merits to you.

1335
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:43,542
Mom? Are you really dead?

1336
01:32:47,667 --> 01:32:49,542
Taew! You're not dead!

1337
01:32:49,707 --> 01:32:51,582
-Yes, I'm not dead!
-Mom!

1338
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,125
I'm the one who has to pray for you.

1339
01:32:55,207 --> 01:32:57,957
You're really not dead!

1340
01:32:58,082 --> 01:32:59,792
That's my head.

1341
01:32:59,957 --> 01:33:01,250
-Respect me a bit.
-Mom's alive!

1342
01:33:05,082 --> 01:33:06,167
You really made it back!

1343
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,792
-Phookan.
-Ratree.

1344
01:33:12,707 --> 01:33:13,832
Thank you so much

1345
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:16,667
for taking care of me all this time.

1346
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:22,042
You're not mad at me
about everything that happened?

1347
01:33:24,207 --> 01:33:25,375
I understand.

1348
01:33:28,207 --> 01:33:29,957
I want to talk to Taew.

1349
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:36,292
Oops!

1350
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:39,750
Phookan.

1351
01:33:40,707 --> 01:33:42,125
Taew,

1352
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:44,000
she has something to tell you.

1353
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,457
Taew, Pancake,

1354
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,125
Kouy,

1355
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:56,542
thank you, everyone, for helping me.

1356
01:33:57,542 --> 01:33:58,457
Taew,

1357
01:33:58,832 --> 01:34:01,125
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1358
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:04,750
I've been wondering who killed you.

1359
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:06,500
Close your eyes.

1360
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,875
You want me to kill my own baby?

1361
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:16,500
-I can't do that.
-Get rid of it!

1362
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:18,750
But it's our baby!

1363
01:34:23,332 --> 01:34:25,917
-That was it.
-So who killed her?

1364
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,375
Why didn't you close your eyes?

1365
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:31,375
Phookan.

1366
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:47,042
Phookan, I'm sorry

1367
01:34:47,582 --> 01:34:50,582
that I suspected you.
Who knew it was Petch.

1368
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:52,542
Petch is the killer.

1369
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:55,957
-Call the cops to take him away.
-Yes, ma'am.

1370
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:58,625
-Pancake
-Yes?

1371
01:34:58,707 --> 01:35:00,250
I have to apologize to you too.

1372
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:01,582
About what?

1373
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:04,582
Everything that happened was my plan.

1374
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:08,042
I have to admit that

1375
01:35:08,332 --> 01:35:11,082
I was so thirsty for him,
it made me blind.

1376
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:14,582
Yeah, I get it.

1377
01:35:14,707 --> 01:35:17,542
Nobody really got hurt, so it's fine.
Love makes you blind, you know?

1378
01:35:17,957 --> 01:35:20,542
-Can I say something to you?
-Yeah, sure.

1379
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:21,667
Fuck you.

1380
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,792
She cusses at me and you smile?

1381
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:02,582
Cartoon! Cartoon! Hunglay!

1382
01:36:02,832 --> 01:36:04,832
Come here!

1383
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:06,582
She's back!

1384
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,125
-Hurry!
-What? What happened?

1385
01:36:08,457 --> 01:36:09,582
She's back!

1386
01:36:09,667 --> 01:36:11,167
-Taew's alive?
-Come on!

1387
01:36:12,332 --> 01:36:14,332
Taew!

1388
01:36:14,457 --> 01:36:16,000
Taew's alive!

1389
01:36:16,082 --> 01:36:17,332
Taew!

1390
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:19,707
-Come on, you guys!
-What?

1391
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:20,957
She made it out alive!

1392
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:22,332
-How are you doing?
-She's back!

1393
01:36:22,457 --> 01:36:24,332
She's back!

1394
01:36:24,457 --> 01:36:25,750
-She's alive.
-What?

1395
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,875
-What's wrong?
-What's the matter?

1396
01:36:28,042 --> 01:36:29,792
Open it.

1397
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:33,042
Taew! Taew!

1398
01:36:33,125 --> 01:36:35,625
-How are you doing?
-I can't breathe.

1399
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Who the hell put me in the freezer?

1400
01:36:39,332 --> 01:36:41,042
-Taew, come on out!
-Why are you poking?

1401
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:43,167
-Come on out!
-Let's get her out.

1402
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,417
Why did you all become nuns?
Your mother's dead?

1403
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,292
-Your mother!
-Come out.

1404
01:36:48,457 --> 01:36:49,332
-I'll help.
-Come out.

1405
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:52,167
Careful. Careful.

1406
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,125
-How did I end up here?
-Can you stand?

1407
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:56,750
-Can you stand?
-Wait! Wait!

1408
01:36:57,542 --> 01:36:59,542
I forgot my iPhone 4Sex.

1409
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,542
It's 4S!

1410
01:37:01,707 --> 01:37:02,875
Let's go.

1411
01:37:03,707 --> 01:37:04,582
How are you feeling?

1412
01:37:04,875 --> 01:37:06,042
I'm fine.

1413
01:37:06,792 --> 01:37:08,332
Should I die again?

1414
01:37:13,457 --> 01:37:16,875
It feels so peaceful after making merits.

1415
01:37:17,042 --> 01:37:20,250
I'm so happy when we come to the temple.

1416
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:22,417
That's right.

1417
01:37:22,832 --> 01:37:23,875
Nuns.

1418
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:27,082
-So respectable.
-Pay respect, y'all.

1419
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,542
So calm and collected.

1420
01:37:29,042 --> 01:37:30,875
Hey!

1421
01:37:30,957 --> 01:37:31,875
That's the fake monk.

1422
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,042
Yeah, she was arrested.

1423
01:37:34,332 --> 01:37:35,500
But now she's a nun.

1424
01:37:36,042 --> 01:37:37,125
Call the cops again.

1425
01:37:37,832 --> 01:37:39,457
They wouldn't do that

1426
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:42,000
because I paid my fine for 2,000

1427
01:37:42,332 --> 01:37:43,375
so they released me.

1428
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:46,625
Back then she was a fake monk,

1429
01:37:46,707 --> 01:37:50,082
but now she's sorry
and gets ordained for real.

1430
01:37:50,625 --> 01:37:51,832
Still fake.

1431
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:56,207
-Let's leave. It's time to pray.
-Yes.

1432
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,457
Wicked sinners!

1433
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:02,917
People like them
make our religion corrupted.

1434
01:38:03,082 --> 01:38:03,957
Mmm.

1435
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:07,000
What kind of people
make religion prosper?

1436
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,417
People like us.

1437
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:10,417
Damn!

1438
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:12,500
Hey, we should go.

1439
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:17,250
Nobody's at the dormitory.
I'm afraid it'll get stolen.

1440
01:38:17,457 --> 01:38:18,875
-Let's go.
-Sis!

1441
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:23,250
My god!

1442
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:25,207
I come to say goodbye.

1443
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:28,125
-Where are you going?
-To find true love.

1444
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:31,125
A man who loves me truly.

1445
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,332
It must be Tangtong.

1446
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,292
You can have him.

1447
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:40,250
Hey! I have to go now.
I don't want them to wait.

1448
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:42,457
It's a private charter flight.

1449
01:38:43,832 --> 01:38:47,000
-A chanting flight?
-Yes.

1450
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,457
Morons! Chanting what?

1451
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:51,792
A charter flight!

1452
01:38:52,332 --> 01:38:53,625
You know anything about air travel?

1453
01:38:54,082 --> 01:38:55,542
Probably never traveled by plane.

1454
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:02,082
-What do we do?
-Judging from the back,

1455
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:03,375
I'd think that was a rottweiler.

1456
01:39:11,332 --> 01:39:12,500
So cold!

1457
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:21,957
-Tangtong!
-Pancake.

1458
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:25,167
-You want to meet me?
-Well...

1459
01:39:25,707 --> 01:39:28,082
I want to apologize for everything.

1460
01:39:29,667 --> 01:39:31,417
Can we be back together, Tangtong?

1461
01:39:34,042 --> 01:39:34,917
Pancake.

1462
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I don't want to drag you down.
You're young and beautiful.

1463
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:43,125
You're hot. More importantly,

1464
01:39:44,542 --> 01:39:47,417
you have many countries to cover.
Please let me go.

1465
01:39:49,082 --> 01:39:50,167
Tangtong, I love you--

1466
01:39:53,832 --> 01:39:56,750
Why? Why can't we be together, Tangtong?

1467
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:01,082
Pancake, I found someone.

1468
01:40:03,042 --> 01:40:04,957
You found someone? Who is she?

1469
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:06,917
Who, Tangtong?

1470
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:10,917
Nong Pan Lo.

1471
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,417
Nong Pan Lo.

1472
01:40:18,582 --> 01:40:19,457
Annyeonghaseyo.

1473
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,957
Yo' ass!

1474
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,125
Tangtong.

1475
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:25,207
If you want a new girlfriend,

1476
01:40:25,792 --> 01:40:27,457
at least find someone better.

1477
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,542
Pancake, good luck.

1478
01:40:42,582 --> 01:40:44,667
-Annyeonghaseyo
-Yo' mama!

1479
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,750
She's a megabitch.

1480
01:40:50,167 --> 01:40:52,875
You pig! Gorilla!

1481
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:54,457
Moron!

1482
01:40:55,542 --> 01:40:56,417
Tangtong.

1483
01:40:57,167 --> 01:40:58,457
Flaunting his new girlfriend.

1484
01:41:02,176 --> 01:41:04,588
STAY TUNED FOR GAG REELS

1485
01:41:06,082 --> 01:41:07,875
A face like this, what am I to him?

1486
01:41:07,957 --> 01:41:09,707
-Mother and son?
-Your mother!

1487
01:41:10,332 --> 01:41:12,500
You got a foul mouth. Hey, look at me.

1488
01:41:12,582 --> 01:41:13,917
How you like me now?

1489
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,667
Eyebrows like benbedbrow.

1490
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,542
Like what again, Ma?

1491
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:19,417
Like a bent bow.

1492
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,832
Like a bowtben?

1493
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:23,042
Like a bowtben. Remember that.

1494
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:25,167
-He's from--
-Nakhon...

1495
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,667
Nakhon Si Thammarat.

1496
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,500
He's from Nakhon Si
Thammaharat Nakhon Nayok.

1497
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:31,250
Nakhonma Si Maharat

1498
01:41:31,332 --> 01:41:32,917
Where is Pa from? Tell me again.

1499
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,542
Nakhonma Si Maharat.

1500
01:41:34,832 --> 01:41:36,542
Listen carefully. I can't pronounce it.

1501
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:37,875
Where is that province, Ma?

1502
01:41:37,957 --> 01:41:40,832
Nakhonma Si Maharat. You're so stubborn!

1503
01:41:40,917 --> 01:41:43,792
You keep asking me! You should
listen carefully the first time.

1504
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,667
It won't be the same the second time.

1505
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:48,042
Cut!

1506
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:51,042
Someone told me Kouy

1507
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:52,542
-has something to do...
-Hmm?

1508
01:41:52,875 --> 01:41:54,957
-What's his name?
-Phookan.

1509
01:41:55,167 --> 01:41:56,125
Hey, Cartoon.

1510
01:41:56,332 --> 01:41:58,375
What did Kouy leave for us?

1511
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,667
Grandpa.

1512
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,917
Don't be confused.

1513
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,000
They all laugh before you even say "cut!"

1514
01:42:29,457 --> 01:42:31,542
We're gonna fight them!
When I open the door,

1515
01:42:31,667 --> 01:42:33,832
-you follow suit.
-Let's ask Ekkachai.

1516
01:42:33,957 --> 01:42:36,792
Ekkachai's homo! He can't fight anyone!

1517
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:39,500
-Damn! That bitch's homo!
-Who?

1518
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:42,082
I'm talking about Ekkachai.
You thought it was Yingsak?

1519
01:42:42,167 --> 01:42:44,417
No, Yingsak isn't homo.

1520
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,207
-I know him!
-He's straight.

1521
01:42:46,332 --> 01:42:48,457
I know. He has two kids.

1522
01:42:48,542 --> 01:42:50,167
-Are you?
-Cut!

1523
01:42:50,917 --> 01:42:52,917
