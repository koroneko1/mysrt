In 1670, Molière was commissioned
by King Louis XIV,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.460
nicknamed the Sun King,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.060
to write a play
that was meant to ridicule a certain...

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.260
Plagg, you promised
you wouldn't go back there!

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.900
Sorry, Sugarcube, but I can't resist
such irresistible beauty!

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.140
Here it sits, every day,
beckoning me with gooey lusciousness.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.620
And every time I eat it, it just pops
right back up the very next day!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.860
Don't you think it's strange this gross,
stinky thing reappears in the same spot,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.020
day after day?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.500
That's precisely why I call it
the magic cheese!

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.620
I've got you at last, strange creatures!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.780
This is exactly why
you should always listen to me!

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.420
Let's get outta here!

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.980
And they speak, too!

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.820
I can't! It's impossible to abandon
such a creamy,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.820
cosy Reblochon!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
- Hey! What's going on?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.540
Stay focused on Molière and his plays!

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540
Go ahead and run away.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.060
<i>I have proof</i>
<i>of my great scientific discovery!</i>

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.860
Hmm.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.940
You don't want me reading
your little secrets, Marinette?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.380
I don't have secrets from you.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.060
You're the only one
I can discuss my life with.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.780
Even my parents or Alya
don't know me as well as you do.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.420
I'm so happy to have you, Tikki.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.980
You're the only being I can be myself
with, without ever having to lie.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.020
I'm really happy to have you, too.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.780
Good night, Tikki.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.580
Goodnight, Marinette.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.460
Plagg, we must tell our owners
or Master Fu what happened today.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.420
Chill out, Sugarcube! Don't forget
that nobody can capture or record us!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.900
I know that, but we were actually seen
by a human, and at school, too!

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.260
That could reveal our owners' identities!

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.860
Oh, OK, I promise you I won't eat
any more magic cheese, ever again!

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.540
What's the worst that could happen anyway?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.140
Mr Damocles, can you confirm rumours
that Mrs Mendeleiev isn't here

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.700
because she'll be
on the<i> Alternative Truth</i> show?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.940
Where everything isn't always true,
but nothing is really false!

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.260
It is indeed quite possible
that Mrs Mendeleiev

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.780
has made a scientific discovery
of utmost importance.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.580
Can we watch the show please?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.660
Huh?

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.940
My brother's one of the guests.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.100
<i>We're back for the next segment</i>
<i>of</i> Alternative Truth!

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.540
<i>Where everything isn't always true,</i>
<i>but nothing is really false!</i>

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.300
<i>Let's welcome our last guest today,</i>
<i>Mrs Mendeleiev,</i>

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.020
<i>a science teacher</i>
<i>at François Dupont High School.</i>

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.980
Yay! That's our teacher!

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.380
Kim, sit down, please!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.460
<i>-Hello. Thank you for having me.</i>
<i>-You'll describe a scientific theory</i>

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.740
<i>to our panel of experts,</i>
<i>who will decide if it's true or false!</i>

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.940
-True or false!
-Sit.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.220
<i>Mrs Mendeleiev,</i>
<i>you already know our jury.</i>

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.940
<i>Its members are, as always, the famous</i>
<i>singer, XY, the one and only Mr Banana...</i>

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.740
<i>Stay peachy!</i>

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.620
<i>And the incredible Manon Chamack,</i>

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.060
<i>daughter of news reporter, Nadia Chamack!</i>
<i>Over to you.</i>

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.180
<i>You're about to witness proof of the</i>
<i>existence of interdimensional creatures</i>

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.540
<i>with incredible powers</i>

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.300
<i>who can move through matter</i>
<i>and seem to be attracted</i>

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.580
<i>to aged cheese.</i>

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.020
<i>I discovered the first one</i>
<i>soon after school began.</i>

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.540
<i>I started observing it closely,</i>
<i>then I discovered a second one.</i>

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.020
<i>I have proof! Watch closely!</i>
<i>You can't see the creatures themselves</i>

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.940
<i>because they're not filmable.</i>

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.420
<i>-But look right there!</i>

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.220
<i>As I was unable to capture</i>
<i>these creatures on video,</i>

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.900
<i>I've made sketches of them, to give you</i>
<i>an idea of what they look like.</i>

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.820
-What's that even supposed to be?
-I doubt this show is remotely scientific.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.260
<i> Mrs Mendeleiev,</i>

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.900
<i>are you serious about</i>
<i>actually chasing cheese-eating ghosts?</i>

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.340
<i>I'm always serious!</i>

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.500
I thought we didn't keep secrets!

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.020
I didn't want to bother you
with kwami nonsense!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.180
I thought the problem had been resolved.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.820
Plagg promised
he'd no longer eat magic cheese!

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.060
Wait a sec! Plagg was here in this school,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.700
which means Cat Noir is a student here,
just like me?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.580
If I just figured this out,
Cat Noir probably figured out

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.140
that I figured out that he figured it out!

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.020
No, not at all!

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.500
Plagg would travel for miles
to sink his teeth into good cheese!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.540
Now I'll always wonder
whether you're lying or not!

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.220
I'm so sorry, Marinette.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.580
It's OK. You're trying to protect me.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.860
If I figure out who he is,
I'll have to give up my Miraculous.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.380
So, I won't try.
And I hope he doesn't either.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.780
<i>It's time for our jury to tell us</i>
<i>if the theories we heard are...</i>

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.580
True or false?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.900
<i>Jalil Kubdel hypothesized</i>
<i>that Egyptian pyramids are, in fact,</i>

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.300
<i>alien spaceships that ran out of gas.</i>
<i>What do you think?</i>

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.900
-Alix, look! It's your brother!

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.420
<i>Our jury has been convinced.</i>
<i>Jalil succeeds!</i>

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.060
<i>True or false?</i>

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.860
Whoa! Your brother's won! Awesome!

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.220
<i>Theory number two! Mr Vincent Aza</i>
<i>hypothesised that snow is, in fact,</i>

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.340
<i>boogers from a giant</i>
<i>who lives in the clouds!</i>

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.340
<i>Mr Banana was not convinced.</i>

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.820
<i>No, but stay peachy!</i>

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.580
<i>But you do have two votes,</i>
<i>which means that you too have won!</i>

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.260
<i>Last, Mrs Mendeleiev says there are</i>
<i>creatures who like to eat cheese.</i>

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.940
<i>I'm very sorry,</i>
<i>but your fake video footage</i>

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.860
<i>failed to convince our panel of experts!</i>

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.980
<i>Stay peachy!</i>

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.140
<i>It wasn't fake! This is an authentic,</i>
<i>major, scientific discovery!</i>

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.100
You're welcome to come back when
you've captured your invisible creatures!

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.580
Now there's a very familiar emotion.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.700
Fly away, my little akuma
and evilise

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.980
her misunderstood heart!

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.540
Kwamibuster, I am Hawk Moth.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.460
They made a mockery of your science.
I'm ready to believe you!

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.380
Really?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.540
Of course!

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.180
These interdimensional creatures
are called kwamis.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.340
And I'm giving you the power
to capture them.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.460
But in return, you must give me
Ladybug and Cat Noir's magic jewels,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.620
their Miraculous.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.420
You can count on me, Hawk Moth.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.140
Soon, I will be the greatest scientist
in the whole world!

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.580
You could have been captured!
That was so irresponsible of you!

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.060
Please!
It's impossible to capture a kwami!

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.940
We can move through matter
and we can't be filmed or photographed!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.340
You're as much of a party-pooper
as Sugarcube!

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.340
Sugarcube? Who's Sugarcube?

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.140
Tikki! Ladybug's kwami!

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.100
Wait a second! If Tikki was there too,
that means she was here at school,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.180
which means Ladybug is a student here,
just like me,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.220
which means I probably know
Ladybug already!

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.820
Oh, no!

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.100
<i>A big thank you to all our scientists</i>
<i>and members of the jury!</i>

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.820
<i>We'll see you again next week</i>
<i>for another edition</i>

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.020
<i> of</i> Alternative Truth!

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.820
I feel sorry for Mrs Mendeleiev.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.300
I feel sorry for myself
that she's my teacher!

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.580
Wait! The show's not over!

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.060
<i>I am Kwamibuster! And I'm going</i>
<i>to conduct one last scientific experiment!</i>

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.100
I just can't stop thinking
about who Cat Noir really is!

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.140
He has to be one of the boys.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.340
<i>An akumatized person</i>
<i>has appeared near the TV Station.</i>

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.460
<i>It appears to be a teacher</i>
<i>from François Dupont High School.</i>

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.380
<i>This safety vault will withstand</i>
<i>a 50-storey fall. True or false?</i>

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.140
<i>-</i><i> False! It won't!</i>
-We gotta go.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.300
I must convince Cat Noir that Marinette
Dupain-Cheng can't possibly be Ladybug!

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.100
Or I won't be able to be Ladybug any more.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.420
Tikki, spots on!

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.180
Adrien, won't you, like, summon me
to jump into action or something?

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.940
Plagg, what if Marinette were Ladybug?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.340
Marinette? Nah!

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.940
Besides, you shouldn't be
trying to find out more.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.540
If you discovered her identity,
you'd have to give your Miraculous back!

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.260
So, if I were you,
I'd act like nothing's going on.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.860
That's what I do when there's a problem.
It's always worked fine for me!

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.300
Maybe, for once, I'd better listen to you.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.780
Plagg, claws out!

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.140
Let me go!
I mean, don't! Don't do that!

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.420
Excellent, Kwamibuster.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.100
Ladybug and Cat Noir
will have to come to this emcee's rescue!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.420
Then I can easily capture their kwamis!

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.740
Fly!

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.740
Aaah!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.860
So predictable!

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.740
Aaah!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.780
Thanks, Ladybug!
Ladybug saved me!

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.620
There you have it.
The answer was "True".

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.300
Ladybug defies the laws of science!

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.820
I'll capture your kwamis
and prove to everyone

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.780
these magic creatures really do exist!
True or false?

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.380
I don't think it matters. We won't
give you a chance to prove anything!

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.060
I love this plan!
I'm excited to be part of it! Let's do it!

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.100
Back off, kids! I'm a scientist!

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.900
You're no scientist.
You're more like a game-show host!

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.420
I'll prove to the world

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.660
that I am a great scientist
and that I made a major discovery!

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.460
I hope your kwami doesn't ever
do anything like this again!

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.420
Well, I heard your kwami was with him!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.980
She was trying to talk sense into yours!

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.340
I get the feeling
you two are a perfect match!

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.620
Aaah!

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.820
This Kwamibuster villain,
she's from the high school, right?

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.860
Don't forget the rules. We can't know
each other's secret identity!

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.860
So, kwamis don't exist, huh?
Well, here's proof!

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.420
Aaah!

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.900
Ladybug!

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.060
-Ladybug! Is everything... ?
-Don't look over here!

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.660
You can find out

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.540
who Ladybug is
and take her Miraculous from her.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.540
She's powerless
now that she's lost her kwami!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.980
Cataclysm!

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.740
Now I'm going to seize your kwami, Cat!
True or false?

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.820
Gotcha!

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.580
Don't waste your energy.
We can't go through it.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.620
It's all down to your cheese addiction!

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.060
I still have my cata--

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.860
No! You can't control it.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.860
Your cataclysm could
make things even worse!

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.860
So how are you planning to get us
out of here, Sugarcube?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.980
I'm not. But I'm sure Ladybug will.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.500
I already have your kwamis.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.740
And, soon, I'll have your Miraculous too.
True or false?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.340
Master,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.740
Tikki and Plagg have been captured

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.420
and Cat Noir might discover
my secret identity!

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.380
You both know the consequences of that.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.260
That's why I'll fix everything
and save Tikki.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.060
Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
you have to pick a Miraculous.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.220
Only, this time,
you won't be giving it to someone else.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.620
You'll wear it yourself,
until you get Tikki back.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.580
You can't do that. Merging Miraculous
would give you way too much power!

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.220
It could make you lose your mind!

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.540
Don't worry, Master,
I only need one power, the Mouse's.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.020
I'm just wearing the others
so I can free the kwamis.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.980
I need them to pull off my plan.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.700
Mullo, get squeaky!

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.580
And now I'm Multimouse!

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.460
-Are you sure about this, Marinette?
-If I don't do it,

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.820
who else will defeat Kwamibuster?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.740
To capture the akuma,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.260
I must save Tikki
and get my Ladybug powers back first!

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.100
To do that, I'll let myself get captured!

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.820
Multitude!

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.020
Toppo,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.740
Trixx,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.940
unify!

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.380
And now, I'm Multifox!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.380
- Let's go!
- Mmm?

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.860
If Marinette fails,

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.420
Hawk Moth will claim
almost every Miraculous for himself.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.780
She's never failed!

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.340
True or false? Cat Noir
has disguised himself as Mr Banana!

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.020
Uh... Stay peachy?

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.020
Stay put!

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.580
Soon we'll discover
Cat Noir's true identity

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.940
and his Miraculous will be mine,
at last!

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.420
Charge!

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.980
There's something you don't see every day!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.420
Kwamibuster, I promised you kwamis
and here they are!

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.660
Now, bring me
all the Miraculous in return!

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.140
You can't get away from me!
You're no match for Kwamibuster!

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.900
Catch us if you can!

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.900
Psst! Cat Noir? Is that you?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.220
Ladybug?

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.180
Just when I think I finally know you,
you surprise me again!

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.140
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm not Ladybug. I'm Multimouse.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.620
Ladybug has sent me
to fetch your Miraculous.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.500
How do I know I can trust you?

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.140
Ladybug trusted me when she gave me
a Miraculous, didn't she?

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.260
I'm relying on her to bring Plagg back!

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.220
OK! Thank you. Oh, yeah, Ladybug said
you should meet her on the roof!

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.620
I will catch you all! Ha, ha, ha!

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.820
It looks like your owner
has failed us, Tikki! We're doomed.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.900
-Ladybug?
-I told you that my owner was the best!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.580
I'd never abandon you, Tikki!

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.340
Plagg, Mullo, unify!

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.620
Tikki, Mullo, unify!

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.580
Cataclysm!

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.420
Oooh!

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.380
Oh! Ugh!

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.820
Lucky Charm!

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.940
Mullo, Plagg, divide!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.540
As promised.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.020
Thank you, mysterious Multimouse!

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.580
Thank you! See you, Cat Noir!

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.620
Mirage!

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.820
I think you should convince everyone
you're not a student at the high school!

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.180
You're right, that would be safer!

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.100
Plagg, claws out!

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.860
Being Cat Noir is much more
a-peeling than being a banana!

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.540
Good job, Multimouse! Thanks to you,
I got my kwami back and Cat Noir's!

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.820
Awesome plan, girls!

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.060
Time to de-evilise!

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.100
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.820
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.100
We came, we saw, we kicked her hat!
Now I gotta give you this back, right?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.820
No, not here!

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.260
You shouldn't have given me
the Miraculous back in front of...

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.580
But I didn't think you kept any secrets
from each other.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.500
Oh! I am so clumsy!

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.460
I'm sorry, but now your identity
is no longer a secret,

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.980
I won't be able to give you
a Miraculous again.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.620
I'll take Marinette back, Cat Noir.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.340
-You take care of Mrs Mendeleiev.
-Ladybug, wait!

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.220
I wanted to apologise for my kwami
being in that elementary school.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.940
-It was a high school.
-High school, right.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.340
I promise it'll never happen again!

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.580
Bug out!

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.700
Mr Cat, would you be willing to testify
I really did make a scientific discovery?

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.860
I'm sorry, Mrs Mendeleiev,
but I can't do that.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.540
And you must keep it a secret if you
want us to protect Paris from Hawk Moth!

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.260
I understand.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.340
I guess I'm just like Copernicus,
way ahead of my time!

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.860
Uh, yeah, that's right... just like him!

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.660
Oh !
 Whee!

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.780
All his kwamis, so many powers!

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.140
If I can capture them first,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.220
I will form my own army

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.340
of Miraculous-wearing supervillains

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.540
and defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir
once and for all!

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.700
I must find the guardian!

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.020
Reality!

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.580
Mullo, Trixx, divide!

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.740
Mullo, divide!

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.140
No more evil-doing for you,
little akuma.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.780
Time to de-evilise.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.860
Gotcha!

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.620
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.300
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.180
Whee!

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.620
No worries, Master,
Cat Noir

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700
wouldn't imagine that I'm Ladybug.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.180
Now I know he's not a student
at François Dupont.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.540
He thought it was an elementary school!

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.860
If you'd been forced to give up

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.700
being Ladybug because of me,
I would've never forgiven myself.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.020
We all make mistakes, Tikki. But I know
you're a friend I can truly rely on!

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.900
No Miraculous owner in all of history

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.980
has ever been strong enough

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.980
to use that many Miraculous
at the same time.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.540
Marinette truly is special, Master.
