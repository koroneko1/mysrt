1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,519
Mm.

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
I thought you said
Omar wouldn't be home till later.

3
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
-He said he wouldn't.
-Well, fuck.

4
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,239
What are you doing?
He won't go to bed for another half hour.

5
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,319
This whole situation's
totally freaking me out.

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,760
How do you think I feel?

7
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,719
But I'm the one who's having to lie
and move my plans around to see you.

8
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,439
What? Do you think
I don't wanna see you during the day?

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,799
That I don't wanna have a drink with you
or give you a kiss when I go to class?

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
I really don't know.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
You want that?

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,519
Does it really matter?

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,560
Do you care how it feels to constantly see
you and Guzmán making plans together?

14
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,919
And then, I just get the leftover crumbs.

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,639
That means,
to you, this is just sloppy seconds?

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
-No, it's not.
-Then what is it?

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,159
Tell me, 'cause I'm not sure.
You're the one setting the pace here.

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,479
You're coming and going.
It's all been your decision.

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,439
Well, of course it's my decision.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm the one coming,
going, and essentially doing it all.

21
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,120
Because you just passively wait around
for others to do things.

22
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,199
Like when my dad got you out of the bar.

23
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,560
The hell does that mean?

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
It's obvious, Samuel.

25
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,400
You're always waiting for everyone else
to make your decisions.

26
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,520
Wake the fuck up and live your life.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
You have the all-clear.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
You have the same.

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,439
Start sticking your neck out a bit more.
Till then, you don't get to demand things.

30
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,159
Did you do it, Samuel?

31
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
I'd never hurt Ari.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,000
Then I bet… you know who did.

33
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,279
Comin' through.

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,079
-Good morning, Benjamín.
-Good morning, Your Highness. Welcome.

35
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,120
-If you would come with me.
-I'll see you later, okay?

36
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,360
ARI, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

37
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,920
Hey. Morning, buddy.
Whoa. Relax, dude.

38
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
-Jesus.
-Hold on. Wait.

39
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
What's wrong?
Put speed in your coffee this morning?

40
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,319
-No. Why?
-Have you seen Ari?

41
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,120
What? Why would…?
What do you mean, have I seen--

42
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,920
-What the hell's the matter?
-Huh?

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Listen up, I need you to text her.

44
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,399
Tell her you'll meet tomorrow
at the Lake Club.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,360
-Why should I? She's your girlfriend.
-Because I wanna surprise her.

46
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,720
Do me this favor.

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Say it's to talk
about the debate or whatever.

48
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,319
-Okay, but what should I write? I mean…
-Great. Thanks a lot, man.

49
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,639
Fuck.

50
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,240
SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE LAKE CLUB.

51
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,279
All done.

52
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,519
-Look, she's replying.
-Huh?

53
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,199
I said, she's replying.

54
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,959
-Let me see.
-What?

55
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Well, you just got a message.

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE LAKE CLUB? DEBATE?

57
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,480
Just keep insisting you need to meet her
outside of the school.

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,519
-C'mon, tell her.
-Yeah, sure.

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,879
I'D RATHER MEET OUTSIDE SCHOOL SO WE CAN
TAKE OUR TIME PREPARING OUR ARGUMENT.

60
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,920
-All good.
-She's sending something.

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,439
-Okay.
-Let me see.

62
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,199
-She answered.
-Let's see what she said.

63
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,920
-Shut up. I wanna hear what she says.
-No. It's my phone, dude.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
-Shh!
-What?

65
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,240
Is that all?
Is that all you have to tell me?

66
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,439
As though last night never happened?

67
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,680
"Last night"?

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,040
What happened last night?

69
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,079
Hmm.

70
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,360
Okay, well, um…
That's, uh, um… I mean, that's exactly…

71
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,319
What she's talking about there
is the debate.

72
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,319
It got heated,
and she wanted to apologize--

73
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,000
-Samuel.
-And it's no big deal.

74
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,680
I don't know what's wrong, but listen.

75
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,160
Make sure she comes.
That's all. Thanks, pal.

76
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,000
Man, oh, man.

77
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
You've been MIA since we saw Ambar.

78
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,680
You didn't miss me either.

79
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,199
-Jesus, Patrick.
-What?

80
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,720
Hey, I had a fuckin' awesome time. Thanks.

81
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,720
Well, I'm glad you did.

82
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
I know that look, dude.

83
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,360
I've felt that way a hell of a lot.

84
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Well, I was a dickhead
and got too carried away.

85
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,519
Come on. You're not.

86
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
We've all lost our minds over someone.

87
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,319
-Or something.
-No.

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,879
I don't.

89
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,519
I always decide when,

90
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,279
how much, and how long.

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,639
That's great.

92
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
But Ander's very Ander.

93
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,720
When he wants you,
you feel like the king of the world.

94
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,199
But when he shuts down
or tosses you aside…

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,560
Come on. Cheer up, man.

96
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,360
You'll be back
to fuckin' everything that moves soon.

97
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,159
Hey, so, well, I've been thinking

98
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
that it'd be a good idea
for you to leave Armando's hotel room.

99
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,519
I mean, don't you think?

100
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,440
Why? I thought he didn't mind.

101
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,919
No, he doesn't, but…

102
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,399
It's just…

103
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,320
…I'd rather not have anything to do
with him anymore.

104
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
-That's all.
-See.

105
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,039
I knew it.

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,519
He left the concert 'cause you fought.
What did he do? I'll smash his face in.

107
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,440
It's nothing.
He just gets really annoying and intense.

108
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,759
Don't worry about it, kay?

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm sure my old lady
won't slam the door on me.

110
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
But if she makes me choose,
I know what I'd do.

111
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,399
Like, I'll go live under a bridge.
I don't even care.

112
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
So, um…

113
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
…why don't… we make the most of

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,279
this last night at the hotel?

115
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,879
Um, okay.

116
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,639
I mean, if you want to.

117
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,480
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Yeah?

118
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,519
Which bridge
do you think you'll live under?

119
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,639
-Hey, I'll come up with one.
-Sure you will.

120
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,120
A school full of girls from good families,

121
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,519
all waiting for my son to look at them,

122
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,240
and he falls for the janitor?

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
She wants to be a fashion designer.

124
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,759
She's a very bright and intelligent girl.

125
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,720
I know that sort of intelligence.

126
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,960
I've seen it in all the other
Little Miss Nobodies after him.

127
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
Cayetana will behave
and stick to the path set for her.

128
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
How do you know that?

129
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,799
She has shown unconditional support
for her boyfriends before.

130
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
She'll be with him no matter what.

131
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,799
She has everything to gain.

132
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,080
-They're mine.
-Are you sure?

133
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,799
Yes.

134
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,279
Wow, Phillipe.

135
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,320
They're pretty good. Very good.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
I mean, a prince, a designer, and hetero?

137
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,759
You'd be my mythical Prince Charming
if you weren't a predator.

138
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,759
Ciao.

139
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,279
They're not mine, though.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,240
Then whose?

141
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,759
Caye, you forgot this.

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,039
-Where were they?
-In the printer.

143
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,679
Ah, okay. Thanks. Anyone else see these?

144
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,840
I don't know.

145
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,240
Me. What's the matter?

146
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Are you afraid I'll tell the principal
you're using school equipment

147
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,960
without permission, Cayetana?

148
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
No.

149
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,200
Snitch on me, then. I don't care.

150
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,759
They're very good.

151
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,720
Ari told me that.

152
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:14,840
Oh, really?

153
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,320
To be fair, I thought they were his.

154
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,960
And for something a prince
was doing on a whim, they weren't bad.

155
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

156
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,360
What?

157
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
He heard your message.

158
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
-Guzmán?
-Yeah.

159
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
Why'd you ask me
to meet up about the debate?

160
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,919
He's planning a surprise.
He'll be the one at the club tomorrow.

161
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,039
You wanted me to take a stance, and I am.
But for my friend.

162
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,639
I can't keep sneaking around

163
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,200
and repeatedly stabbing him in the back
like this.

164
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,639
It's Guzmán or me.

165
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,399
Now take a stance and make up your mind.

166
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,320
You'll throw a New Year's Eve party.

167
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,279
The media will be there,
and there'll be a photo shoot.

168
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
I want you to invite all your friends.

169
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,279
You can bring that girl if you want.

170
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,200
Cayetana.

171
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,960
So, Benjamín filled you in.

172
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,440
Do you really like her?

173
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,799
Very much.

174
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,519
Have you at least given
other girls a chance?

175
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,679
I don't want other girls.

176
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,879
I want her.

177
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,799
Fine, you'll introduce her formally
at the party.

178
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,919
That's part of your campaign
to clean up my image, right?

179
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,679
We're not together right now.

180
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,159
You mean you can't win
your peasant girl back?

181
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
Don't call her that.

182
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you want her back or not?

183
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,519
Yes, Mom.

184
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Well then, do what you need to do.

185
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,960
What's happened to you here in Madrid?

186
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,960
Hmm?

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,519
I don't recognize you anymore.

188
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,919
-Why are you here?
-Just visiting my friend.

189
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,320
Sure, I'm not busy.

190
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,000
Want a Mahou?

191
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,879
Okay. In the room with the fireplace?
It's quieter there, okay?

192
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,799
Guys, we have a guest.

193
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,320
This is Armando.

194
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,559
Alumni president
and a former student at Las Encinas.

195
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,159
He just came by to make the association's

196
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
very generous annual donation
to the school,

197
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,360
and he wanted to meet all of you.

198
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
No, we already know him.
Isn't he your friend from the concert?

199
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,080
-Uh, yeah.
-Oh.

200
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,639
Uh, you're friends?

201
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,080
We've bumped into each other
while having drinks.

202
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,440
-I see.
-How are you?

203
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,960
-Hi.
-Hello.

204
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,279
Yeah, Patrick and I get along well.

205
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,559
And no, it's not your business.

206
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know
if you guys intend to take things further.

207
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,559
Actually, no. It's not important to me.

208
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,000
Well, to be totally honest,

209
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,279
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you for your indifference.

210
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,960
If I didn't know better,
I would say you're a little bit jealous.

211
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,519
What the fuck?

212
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,679
I know you,
and I think you're very jealous.

213
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,399
It's not jealousy. It's concern.

214
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,519
Excuse me?

215
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,000
Omar, Patrick cozied up to you
two seconds after I pissed him off.

216
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,240
Just sayin'.

217
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
I cozied up to Patrick.

218
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,799
Mainly 'cause you left him
in a fucking shambles.

219
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,519
Not my fault
if the guy has an imagination.

220
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,759
Uh, yeah, no.
It was a little bit your fault, honestly.

221
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,639
Patrick may be intense,
but he's not a dumbass.

222
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,639
Omar, I'm just asking you
not to get your hopes up.

223
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,159
'Cause you're really into him,
but all he wants is to get even.

224
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,559
The hell?

225
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,839
Omar.

226
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,559
So, he hit on you
because you're such a catch,

227
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
but I'm just a rebound?

228
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,680
You've got guts.

229
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,799
Look, I'm just worried about you.

230
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
No, really, you've got a lot of nerve
to go around making one-sided decisions

231
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,599
and getting upset when I try to get over
the damage you've done.

232
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,519
I'm not upset.

233
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,799
You're like the dog in the manger.

234
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't want me, you don't want Patrick,

235
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
but you also don't want us to build a life
without you.

236
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,279
If I'm just your buddy
and Patrick was a booty call,

237
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,920
why don't you just let us
do our own thing?

238
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,039
Leave. I have to work.

239
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,079
We've always had rules.

240
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,160
You're telling me
they're more oppressive now than ever.

241
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,359
I'll tell you there were way more rules
in my day.

242
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,799
Before, people will say,
in their day, there were even more.

243
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,839
And so on, ad infinitum.

244
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,880
Well, I doubt when you were studying

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,839
at Las Encinas,
it felt so much like a… a bunker.

246
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,880
Even back then, it was very strict.
Trust me.

247
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,119
You had to do a balancing act
to skip class or break a rule.

248
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,720
The previous principal
had kinda loosened the rules.

249
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,160
But now
my father's reinstating them all, right?

250
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Hmm.

251
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
If you'll excuse me for just a second.

252
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,079
Sure.

253
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,799
Mencía?

254
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,559
Yeah?

255
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
You okay?

256
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,839
I'm great.
Never been better, Benjamín. Why?

257
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
-Thought you were a vegetarian.
-Look, I'm not making anything up.

258
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,519
Everything, then.

259
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,119
-I need to use the bathroom.
-What's gotten into her now?

260
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,400
What the actual fuck
are you doing in my house?

261
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,000
-Your dad asked me to stay for lunch.
-In general. Before that.

262
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,160
Why'd you show up
at my house in the first place?

263
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
I always deliver the annual donation.

264
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,400
Armando, don't give me that shit.

265
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,240
You could've easily given it to him
at the school or a fucking bar.

266
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,160
But you showed up here, so tell me why.
To fuck me over?

267
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,440
Me? Fuck you over?
What are you talkin' about?

268
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,839
You think you can blackmail me
so you can fuck me forever, don't you?

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
It really pisses you off

270
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,440
that you can't have me
whenever you want, I guess.

271
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,400
You can't end a relationship
over a tantrum.

272
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,880
You and I don't have a relationship!

273
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,680
So, we can talk about the menu
for the remainder of the week later on.

274
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,279
That'll be all for now.

275
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,319
-You've been tense since you saw him.
-Yeah, well, I'm tense by nature.

276
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,279
-Will you tell me what's goin' on?
-Nothing. We're friends. I told you.

277
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,240
How do a minor and a former alum
three times her age become friends?

278
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,519
We told you already. We met at a bar.

279
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm gonna sit back down.

280
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Honey.

281
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,559
What?

282
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,440
I know that our rapport
is pretty much, uh, nonexistent.

283
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,200
And when we do talk,
it's a declaration of war.

284
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,480
I think you can deduce that…

285
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,000
…even if I don't tell you…

286
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,039
Well, I don't want you to deduce.
I want you to know

287
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,200
that if there's something happening to you

288
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,240
or you're worried about something
or you have a problem,

289
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,759
well, you could tell me.

290
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,680
And with just one phone call,

291
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,759
I can get rid of, uh,
whatever it is that's the problem.

292
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,680
For you or your brother and sister.

293
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
That's good to know.

294
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,799
If… If I need that call,
I'll be sure to… let ya know.

295
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,400
Okay?

296
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,759
Okay. I've talked too much already.
Now your turn.

297
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,039
What are you doing after graduating?

298
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,960
You have to join the alumni.

299
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,400
Well, honestly, I would love
to join the alumni association.

300
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,359
Oh yeah.

301
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,119
And have Armando
introduce us to his old classmates.

302
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
-Nothin' beats a boomer.
-Patrick!

303
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,799
You have such a one-track mind!

304
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm going to tell my father,
and it's going to fuck up your life.

305
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,519
A bunch of old guys
in a room, lookin' back on their lives.

306
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,480
Who knows
what they get up to in there?

307
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,720
Everything?
Even how you've been making a living?

308
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,839
Accept it. You are mine.

309
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,319
You're so annoying.

310
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
How is it, Armando?

311
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,079
I hope everything's to your liking.

312
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,599
Everything's perfect, Benjamín. Thank you.

313
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,480
How have my kids been treating you?

314
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,880
It seems you've really… hit it off,
haven't you?

315
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,119
Your children are a pleasure.

316
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,079
A toast.

317
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,720
-Sure.
-Oh, yes.

318
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,759
-But it's bad luck to toast with water.
-Not with water. Come on.

319
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,680
Well, that's what you're getting,
all right?

320
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,400
I WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

321
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,839
WHAT TIME SHOULD WE GO TO THE HOTEL?

322
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,839
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

323
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,839
I'M SORRY, REBE. I CAN'T GO.

324
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,599
Yes?

325
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,240
-Hi.
-Hello.

326
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,160
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, come in.

327
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,359
It's just that my mother decided

328
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,240
she wanted to come here
and spend Christmas with me.

329
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,359
Uh-huh.

330
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,519
And since it seems
she can never have an empty schedule,

331
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,400
she's putting together a networking event
with young entrepreneurs.

332
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,160
A get-together
to strengthen business ties and all.

333
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,079
Oh. Hmm.

334
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,000
How fun. Yippee.

335
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,519
Uh, I requested
that she invite our seed designer.

336
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,599
-Ah, Sadelagu?
-Mm-hmm.

337
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,279
Wait, wow.

338
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,279
Is Sadelagu really gonna be there?

339
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,759
-Yeah.
-Oh.

340
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,519
I don't know. I was hoping
that maybe you'd like to come with me,

341
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,039
meet him in person,
and show him your designs.

342
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,720
Okay,
you're… you're joking right now.

343
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,359
No. You have talent, Caye.

344
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,319
Thank you so much, Phillipe.
I… I don't know what to say.

345
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,279
Say nothing.

346
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,200
Really, thanks a lot.

347
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,920
So, is that a yes?

348
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,119
Dress code?

349
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
Hello. Good evening.

350
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
Cayetana Grajera.

351
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,359
Thank you.

352
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,559
I think I'll leave you alone.

353
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,440
-Where can I find your father?
-He's over there, schmoozing.

354
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Wow. Christian Dior?

355
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,480
Grajera Pando.

356
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,039
Wow.

357
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,279
Yeah.

358
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,119
To be honest, I never imagined
I'd meet Sadelagu at such a solemn affair.

359
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,279
Dreams come true wearing charcoal gray
and holding a tumbler.

360
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,319
Hmm.

361
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,799
Hey, look.

362
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,079
-Is that…?
-That's him.

363
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,079
-It's him?
-I'll get him.

364
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,640
Okay.

365
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Really?

366
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,960
You'll enter the lion's den
to make sure you get what you want.

367
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,519
He invited me without my asking.

368
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,000
Sure.

369
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,880
And leaving your designs
out in plain sight?

370
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,279
Just coincidence?

371
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah, it actually was.

372
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,599
You were very quick
to get over your doubts about him.

373
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
There's not a foolish hair on your head,

374
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,640
but you're stupid.

375
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,400
And a climber.

376
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,039
You're just a stupid climber.

377
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Oh shit.

378
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,559
What the fuck is this?

379
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
If you don't mind.

380
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
So, do you like it?

381
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,359
It's delicious.
I've never tried it.

382
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,400
Fashion, I'm told,

383
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
is what brought you
and Phillipe together, right?

384
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,720
Yes. And especially
our mutual admiration for you.

385
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,400
-Oh, come on.
-But anyway…

386
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,960
Sorry. I had to.

387
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Really. Meeting you is a dream come true.

388
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,240
Mm-hmm.

389
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,160
Charge it to room 973.

390
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,880
It's on me.

391
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,039
Um, I'm sorry.
Do you have maybe five minutes?

392
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,680
I'd love to show you
some of these sketches I made.

393
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,160
Sure.

394
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,119
Really?

395
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,359
I have all the time in the world for you.

396
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,920
The thing is, I'd rather take a look
at them in my room, you know?

397
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,400
It's just,
I find it way more comfortable and quiet.

398
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,680
-Uh…
-What do you say?

399
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,039
Why are you with him again?

400
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,119
Rebe, look. I'll explain later, okay?

401
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,440
What do you mean, "later"?

402
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,640
Is this how you show
you want nothing to do with this dude?

403
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,640
Mencía.

404
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,640
I need you to go now.

405
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,519
Come on.

406
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
You coming?

407
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,039
Yeah. Hell no, I'm not going away.

408
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,880
Mencía, let's go.

409
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Mencía, what is this?

410
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,519
I'd rather send my designs
to your workshops

411
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,359
and we'll talk whenever you're available.

412
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
Everyone,
here are your New Year's Eve invitations.

413
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm so excited to start the year with you.

414
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,200
Samuel.

415
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,440
I just don't understand, Mencía.

416
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,640
You wanted nothing to do with him,
and now you're together again?

417
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,720
That's how I am. Capricious and volatile.

418
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,960
Ander.

419
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,119
Well, maybe it's true.

420
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,680
I mean, you and I've gotten closer
tryin' to forget him.

421
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,920
Now let's forget him, okay?

422
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,400
-What?
-Your invitations, guys.

423
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,920
I WANT TO START THE YEAR WITH YOU.
PHILLIPE

424
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,920
What are your rates like, Cayetana?
For designing a dress, not mopping.

425
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,759
I want a dress for New Year's Eve,
and I'd like to look truly spectacular.

426
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,920
Well, I'd have to crunch some numbers.

427
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Two grand? Not including materials.

428
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,039
What are you up to?

429
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,480
You have talent.

430
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:20,640
And dignity.

431
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,240
Plus, the 2,000 euros
are a tax-deductible donation.

432
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
God, I can't stomach you.

433
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,400
Cayetana,
I want your talent, not your friendship.

434
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,640
So, yes or no?

435
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,960
-I'll start concepts and get back to you.
-You have three days.

436
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,519
I only need two.

437
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,200
Oh, and I want a 10% bonus
for every 500 likes you get.

438
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,200
Five percent.

439
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,759
-No, no.
-Omar.

440
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,039
-No.
-Yes.

441
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,680
Come on.

442
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,279
I said no.
No way we're gonna fuck here, Patrick.

443
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:05,880
No, it's just a spell. I'm an exorcist.

444
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Yeah, a spell, my ass.

445
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,000
Ander?

446
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,119
I don't know any Ander.

447
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,519
So, have you forgotten him?

448
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,119
It's cool.

449
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,400
Poco a poco. Hmm?

450
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,079
Trust me, Ander's not forever.

451
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,039
Oh, baby.

452
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,920
Do you know

453
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,719
one of the thousands of ways
you and I are the same?

454
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,000
Without fail,

455
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,559
it doesn't matter if the people
we love hurt us again and again

456
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,079
and again and again,

457
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,280
we never leave their side.

458
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,760
We keep letting ourselves get punched
in the gut and take it like champs.

459
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,159
Bam, bam, bam!

460
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
For those we love, we'll do what it takes.

461
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,360
You and I are fighters.

462
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
But do you know how we're different?

463
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,639
I wait for the people I love…
to hit rock bottom,

464
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,880
alone and ashamed, and come back
with their tails between their legs.

465
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,880
But you're not like that.

466
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,239
You refuse to just sit by and watch
if you know they're about to hit bottom.

467
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,079
You don't give up, and you never stop.

468
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,480
And I think
that's one of your best traits.

469
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,519
Maybe you're me, but the improved version?

470
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,639
Hey, I said, "maybe."

471
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,880
Come here, sweetie.

472
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
Please, come in.

473
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,079
So, you go to Las Encinas?

474
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,920
-Yeah. We're in class together.
-Mm.

475
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,840
-Uh, I'm Patrick.
-Great.

476
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,840
-Uh, is Ander here?
-He is. Just a minute. I'll go get him.

477
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,320
Okay. Thank you.

478
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,239
Hey there, handsome.

479
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,559
Patrick?

480
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,519
Patrick,
I think I'm a victim of butt-dialing.

481
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Honey,
your friend Patrick is here to see you.

482
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,719
-Patrick?
-Yes, he's downstairs.

483
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,679
What's this about?

484
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,440
I'll tell you later, kay?

485
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,119
Ander? How are you?

486
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,880
What the fuck?

487
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,840
Hey, can we chat for a sec?

488
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,280
Look, Ander, you really don't get it.

489
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,559
You think
the whole world revolves around you?

490
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,719
It doesn't.

491
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,480
If I'm with Omar, it's because I like him
and I wanna pursue something.

492
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,079
And if that pisses you off,
then honestly, that's your problem, dude.

493
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,480
It's fine with me
if you two are together.

494
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,920
As long as you're honest
and don't hurt him.

495
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,039
-'Cause Omar's not like me.
-I know. That's why I like him.

496
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,199
No, I'm saying
he's someone you could really hurt.

497
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,119
Because he does have feelings for you.

498
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,079
And I hope you do too.

499
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,960
He's not just someone
to pass the time with.

500
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,239
Unlike me?

501
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,199
That's right. I was… a palate cleanser.

502
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,800
To get rid of Omar's scent
with a couple of fucks and a few kisses.

503
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,440
Well, relax. I'm not like you.

504
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,639
I only hope I can make him feel
half as good as he makes me feel.

505
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,480
Look, man.
If I hurt you, I'm sorry, all right?

506
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,960
I thought it was clear
that it was just sex.

507
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,679
Because at least to me,
that was super clear.

508
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,679
'Cause I never had doubts
about my feelings for Omar.

509
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,519
Like, when I got cured,

510
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,119
I traded backpacking around the world
just to be with him.

511
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,599
I've always loved him.

512
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,199
And I always will.

513
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,559
So, don't play mind games with him,
don't use him,

514
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,679
and, above all,

515
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,199
don't you dare break his heart.

516
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,719
Don't worry.

517
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,639
You can answer your WhatsApps.

518
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,239
I'll get out of the way… forever. I swear.

519
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,039
Fuck.

520
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,719
Why the long face?

521
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,440
It's nothing.

522
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,159
Honey, when are you finally gonna tell me
what's going on?

523
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,760
Have I ever told you
how annoying you are when you shut down?

524
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,639
BEFORE I GO: MOM, GUZMÁN, OMAR

525
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,599
Thank you.

526
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Hmm.

527
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,719
-What?
-It's good.

528
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
And you were against it
'cause it's not French.

529
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

530
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,360
But you should so serve it
at your New Year's Eve party.

531
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,519
Well, there's something else

532
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,599
I'd like to have
at my New Year's Eve party.

533
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,000
-Hmm?
-Or rather, someone else, I should say.

534
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,960
I would love it if you would come.

535
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,599
I am.

536
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:43,039
Yeah, but… as my date.

537
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,320
That sounds like a couples plan.

538
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,960
Yes. It is.

539
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,760
Except we're just friends, remember?

540
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Yeah, but we're friends who are exes.

541
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:02,039
And exes…
can get back together for Christmas.

542
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,519
-Hmm.
-Hmm?

543
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,039
Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

544
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,480
No.

545
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,400
Something great just happened,
and that's all I really think about.

546
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,639
Is it something great…
that you'd be willing to share with me?

547
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,719
I am sharing it.

548
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,000
C'mon,
aren't things fine the way they are?

549
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,039
Yeah, sure.

550
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,679
-It's okay to change our minds, right?
-Calm down. We're just making out.

551
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,639
And I don't even know why.
Look, Phillipe, we'd better…

552
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,519
Okay.

553
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:53,920
Wait.

554
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,119
Stop.

555
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,639
What?

556
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,840
We'd better not.

557
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
Why?

558
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,920
Friends is better.
You sit there. I'll sit here.

559
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,920
But Caye,
I'm more certain than ever.

560
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,719
Yeah, and I no longer see you as an idol.

561
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't have to swoon
when we're together, you know?

562
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,320
Yeah, but what if it's the idol
who does the swooning?

563
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,440
No, really, I mean it.

564
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,079
I think it's better
if we just be friends, okay?

565
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,679
Phillipe, stop.

566
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,440
Stop. Hey, I said stop.

567
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,360
You like to feel
you have power over me, huh?

568
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,840
-What?
-All girls do.

569
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,159
What are you saying? Stop.

570
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,880
Stop it, Phillipe.
Get off me. Get off me! Let me go!

571
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,719
I don't want to!
Okay, seriously, let me go, Phillipe.

572
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,599
Oh my God! Please, enough!

573
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,480
Stop! I already said no. I said, get off!

574
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,840
Shit.

575
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,440
Cayetana!

576
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,360
My girlfriend's here.

577
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,199
Sorry I'm late
to my own freakin' surprise.

578
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,760
They decided to block the entrance
in the middle of December

579
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,599
so that they could prune or something.

580
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,159
Thank you.

581
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,840
-You all right?
-Yeah.

582
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,119
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

583
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,079
Why's this extra plate here?

584
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,639
I'll have them take it away.

585
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,519
Aren't you workin' today?

586
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,760
Hold on a minute.
You said he canceled on you.

587
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,800
What do you mean, I canceled?

588
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,239
Samuel, have a seat.

589
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:16,239
Wait, why should he have a seat?

590
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,800
Ari, can you tell me what's goin' on?

591
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,679
Guzmán…

592
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,920
I've been seeing Samuel.

593
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,400
Seeing him as what?

594
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,719
Was it or was it not Guzmán?

595
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,800
Samuel, are you listening to me?

596
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,599
I'm sorry to put you in this situation,

597
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,599
but I think what I have with Samuel
isn't just a fling.

598
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:13,039
Samuel, I've fallen in love with you,

599
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,079
and I don't wanna leave you.

600
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:22,800
But Guzmán,
I'm in love with you too.

601
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,639
Guzmán, look at me.

602
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,320
I don't wanna leave you either.

603
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,719
Look at me!

604
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,320
Listen, I know you're probably thinking
I'm crazy right now.

605
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,199
But I think that I'd be crazy if… if…

606
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:44,039
if I were to give up on either of you.
