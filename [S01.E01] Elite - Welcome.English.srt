1
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,399
Samuel.

2
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,880
I have to ask you some questions.

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,079
You haven't been
at this school for long, right?

4
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,600
RECONSTRUCTION OF:
SAN ESTEBAN HIGH SCHOOL

5
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,799
No, almost four months.
I used to attend San Esteban.

6
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,240
SWINDLERS

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,120
San Esteban, the school that collapsed?

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
Calm down.

9
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,400
It's going to be all right.

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,840
Another woman's after your husband.

11
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,960
Have you noticed anything off lately?

12
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,639
What are you doing?

13
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,719
It's hers. I was just holding it for her.

14
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,120
This kid, I'm telling you.

15
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,759
To win over the locals,

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
the construction company
funded three scholarships...

17
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,560
to study here at Las Encinas.

18
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,159
I was one of the lucky ones.

19
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,280
Samu!

20
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
-What's up, man?
-How are you?

21
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,599
Hello, beautiful.

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,840
Shit, sorry. You won't blow yourself up
because I said that, right?

23
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,680
Do you know each other?

24
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,240
He's a buddy of my brother's.

25
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
This is fucking paradise, man.

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Can't you smell it?

27
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,240
Those chicks pee cologne, dude.
I'm telling you.

28
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,439
Let's take a walk around, OK?

29
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,479
Shit.
They're looking at us like we're Martians.

30
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,159
You get used to it.

31
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,120
Come on, how about a photo?
A selfie or something.

32
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,639
Let's take a look around.

33
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,719
You know you can't use your phone?

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,439
If they catch you,
they'll confiscate it for a week.

35
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,399
That's against the Constitution.

36
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
-You've read the Constitution?
-No. I'm waiting for the movie.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,759
-It's in the handbook.
-You've read the handbook?

38
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
When your name is Nadia Shanaa,

39
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
you'd better know
what can get you expelled.

40
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,040
Just in case.

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,639
The swimming pool
is bigger than the school!

42
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,759
You like to swim, right?

43
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,279
You were in the same class.

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,839
Samuel.

45
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,240
You'd be saving us a lot of time and work
if you answered a simple question.

46
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Why did you have blood on you?

47
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,800
I've done nothing.
I want a lawyer, please.

48
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,519
What else isn't allowed?

49
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,639
Drinking, smoking on the grounds,
doing drugs.

50
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,439
So, they don't allow anything cool.

51
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,680
-Depends on what you think is cool.
-Olé!

52
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
Hey!

53
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
What the fuck, man?

54
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,920
Sorry!

55
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,600
Don't cry!

56
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,839
This is your classroom.

57
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,439
Wait for your teacher,
and after class, I'll assign you lockers.

58
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,759
-Welcome!
-Cool.

59
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,120
-Are you the new kids?
-Yes.

60
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,920
Good luck, then. You're gonna need it.

61
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,160
What's up, guys? I'm Christian.

62
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Look at this guy.

63
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,319
Hi there.

64
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,399
Hello.

65
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,920
-Not there!
-Is it taken?

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,639
-By my invisible friend.
-Oh. Enjoy his company.

67
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,519
Good morning, class. How is everybody
doing today? Please sit down.

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,680
Okay. So, as we all know, we have
three new students with us today.

69
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's meet them.

70
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Damn. Wasn't this a tutorial class?

71
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,319
In English. It's a bilingual school.
You knew that, right?

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,079
Christian Varela.

73
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Yes?

74
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you want to introduce yourself
to the class?

75
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,600
What's he saying?

76
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Introduce yourself.

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,519
Yes. Hello.

78
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,480
Goodbye?

79
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Okay...

80
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,160
Great.

81
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
Thank you, Mr. Teacher.

82
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,240
"Mr. Teacher."

83
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,519
Nadia Shanaa.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,319
Hello. I'm Nadia. I'm 16.

85
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,439
My family is from Palestine,

86
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,480
but I was born here in Spain.

87
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,079
And when I finish my studies,

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,399
I'd like to be professional diplomat
in the United Nations.

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,879
Wow. Impressive.

90
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:42,160
You know, every year we choose
our best student, and...

91
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
the trophy is rather ugly,

92
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
but it allows you
to study the next year at...

93
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,240
Who can tell me where?

94
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,160
Carla.

95
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,759
At a school in Florida.

96
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,319
Which gives you access
to an Ivy League university.

97
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,920
How can you win?

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,079
Excelling in all activities,
both curricular and extracurricular.

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
The more extracurriculars, the better.
Photography, chess, Chinese...

100
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,959
Check out the list.

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
If I were you, I'd watch out for her.

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,639
She'll take no prisoners.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
Ridiculous.

104
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,879
Wasn't this a secular school?

105
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
Samuel García.

106
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
Hi. My name is Samuel.

107
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,519
I've got the feeling anything I say
will be used against me,

108
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,319
-so I'll remain silent.
-How darling!

109
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,639
Don't be afraid.
At this school, we teach values.

110
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,279
Manners and respect are paramount.

111
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,639
The leaders of tomorrow are
at this school.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,919
-I know. That's what I'm afraid of.
-What did the waiter say?

113
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,000
He's talking to us.

114
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,120
-Guys.
-Sorry.

115
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,519
All right. My name's Samuel, and I am,
as your classmate said, a waiter.

116
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,120
Strange as it may seem to you,
sometimes waiters get a seat at the table.

117
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,679
But you don't need to worry.
I'm not here to take anybody's place.

118
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,440
You are still the leaders of tomorrow.

119
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

120
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,120
So, let me continue
with where we left yesterday...

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
Of all the people there,
you had to mess with my brother.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
That was your brother?

123
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,320
And they say the rich don't suffer.

124
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,279
I see.

125
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,759
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

126
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,120
Shall we?

127
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,399
Hey... in case nobody's told you,
it's cool having you in class.

128
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,240
Thanks.

129
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,000
Hello.

130
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Where to? We'll go with you.

131
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,000
-Stop being a dick.
-Watch that mouth.

132
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,440
We're only trying to be friendly.
What's the matter, waiter?

133
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,879
Do you like my sister?

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,120
-She's a fan of lost causes...
-Guzmán, go to hell.

135
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,039
Seriously, leave him alone.

136
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,559
Let us have him for a bit.
We want to get to know him.

137
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,480
Or are you afraid of us?

138
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,799
-He is afraid of us!
-He is, yeah.

139
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,919
Waiter... hands off my sister.

140
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,559
Pretend you have a restraining order.

141
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,279
Guzmán... take this.

142
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,759
Nadia.

143
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Can you come with me for a moment?
The principal wants a word.

144
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,960
No one had mentioned the scarf.

145
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,679
Why now?

146
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,399
Per our rules, no accessories are allowed.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,720
My hijab is no accessory.

148
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,559
Besides, everybody has things around here.

149
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,639
Expensive bags, gold watches.

150
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
Those are ornamental.
They don't mean anything.

151
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
They do. They mean many things.

152
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,879
They mean "I have more money,
more style. I'm better than you."

153
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Nadia, we understand, but--

154
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,840
Look, if you understood...

155
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,679
you wouldn't ask me to give up
my culture or religion.

156
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,759
Nadia, think about it.

157
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
It's up to you.

158
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
But if you wear it tomorrow...

159
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,960
we'll have no choice but to expel you.

160
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
Who do you think calls the shots here?

161
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,639
Don't you have other things
to worry about?

162
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
Like the fact that you speak no English.

163
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,799
Come on, it's not nothing,
it's "a little butt."

164
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,200
I got it all under control.

165
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,000
Lend me your notes in English,

166
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,519
and I'll translate them online
to understand.

167
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,519
I'm not giving you my notes.
And you shouldn't be here.

168
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,080
You're taking a spot
somebody else actually needs.

169
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,240
Wait, do you think I am here to study? No.

170
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm here to meet the people
who rule the roost.

171
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,559
They're not the ones with the best grades,
but the ones in with the right crowd.

172
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,000
Watch.

173
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,639
-What time's the party?
-Party?

174
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,519
Somebody say party? Hi, I'm Christian.

175
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,799
Hello, do you speak Spanish?

176
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,159
I was talking to my friends.

177
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Oh, sorry.
By the way, are you on Instagram?

178
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,960
I can give you mine if you want.

179
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes, please!

180
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,480
It's pekechristian007.
The first one is a k.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,639
Pekechristian.

182
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,559
Pekechristian. Oh, no!

183
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
I've fucking had it with these people.

184
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't understand
how they got into this school.

185
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,159
Wow, this video! Look at this.

186
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,919
Do not touch me!

187
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,320
Lu, don't be mean.

188
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,799
Pay no attention to my friend.

189
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,679
So, what about this party?

190
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,639
My sister's coming-out party is private,
like our conversation.

191
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,840
Who do I need to talk to
about getting an invite?

192
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,399
You've never partied with me.

193
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,559
You had a roof collapse on you, right?

194
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,320
Maybe that impaired your ability
to take a hint.

195
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,480
Shall I say it in English so you get it?

196
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,879
Goodbye.

197
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,759
-And if I don't feel like it?
-Look...

198
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,519
You're slow,
so you don't get how things work here.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
But your friend there
is starting to get it.

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,720
Come on, let's go, Guzmán.

201
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,039
Cool video.

202
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,559
Christian, it can happen to anyone,
going too far.

203
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,919
It's the party
for the end of the school year...

204
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,200
There's alcohol.

205
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,480
I don't know,
maybe a fight gets out of control.

206
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,639
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not like that.

207
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,480
Can you interrogate me
without my parents here?

208
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,279
These are just questions.

209
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,200
But if you don't want to cooperate,
we can take you to the station.

210
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
With your parents and a lawyer.

211
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,840
How did you get that injury?

212
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Hit myself on a door.

213
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,360
Why do I get the feeling you're lying?

214
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
The change may end up
not being all that bad.

215
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,639
How is your new school?

216
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm a Muslim, I don't play soccer,

217
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,519
and I was caught reading in the hallway.
I'll be on wanted signs tomorrow.

218
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,080
-The reward will be a reggaeton concert.
-I'm a dead man, then.

219
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,159
Shit, man, I wish some rubble had fallen
on me when the school collapsed.

220
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
Christian got 14 stitches.

221
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,159
And a scholarship to Las Encinas,
dickhead.

222
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,440
With any luck, the same will happen
at your new school.

223
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,240
-No such luck, I'm afraid.
-Roofs do collapse.

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,879
You're the worst!

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
Hi.

226
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,720
Look at him.

227
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,120
He looks like a minister.

228
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,600
Little brother!

229
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
Little brother!

230
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,919
Wow!

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,200
-Doing well in fancyland, huh?
-Yes.

232
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,919
-I'll fight anyone who bothers you.
-Why are you here?

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,559
-Aren't you happy to see me?
-Yes! But they let you out?

234
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,279
No, I'm still there. What do you think?
Let's have a beer.

235
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
Here you go.

236
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,559
Wow!

237
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,240
This is nice, right?

238
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,759
The three of us together again.

239
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,759
-Let's go out tonight.
-I can't.

240
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,519
-You can.
-I work tonight, Nano.

241
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,080
Just call in sick.

242
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,200
What if I get caught? It's the only job
we've had since you left.

243
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,840
Is this how it's gonna be?

244
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,080
Samu, I didn't leave. They made me leave.

245
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,559
How was your first day?

246
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,879
Very good.

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
OPEN

248
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
CLOSED

249
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,039
How about this one?

250
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,960
-Do you like it?
-Mom...

251
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,000
You showed me yesterday.
The answer remains the same.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,639
You don't like anything, Marina.

253
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,759
Is it that hard
to be a bit more enthusiastic?

254
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,720
Mom and Dad are doing this for you.

255
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,519
For me?

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,399
Nobody asked them to.

257
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,360
Sweetheart...

258
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,559
We want to celebrate your coming of age
and to introduce you into society.

259
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,559
As a virginal young lady
looking for a boyfriend.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Marina, please.

261
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,359
What? Are we never going to talk about it?

262
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,759
What are the new students like?

263
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,640
A moron, a fundamentalist,
and one with a raised fist.

264
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,519
-As a joke, they'd be priceless.
-Hey...

265
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,880
Why don't you invite one to the party?

266
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Are you serious?

267
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,160
Why not?

268
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,400
Have you lost your mind?

269
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,559
Hello. No, I told you not to worry.

270
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,200
-OK?
-I think it's a great idea.

271
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,519
Besides, it's my party, right?

272
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,440
Sons of bitches!

273
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,000
Cool.

274
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,720
Hey! Have you seen my uniform?

275
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,599
No? Nothing?

276
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,839
You haven't seen my clothes?

277
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,640
What's up, handsome?

278
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,960
Hello, beautiful.
You haven't seen my clothes?

279
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,599
No? Come on! There we are!

280
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,559
All right, then. Fuck you all.

281
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,079
Enjoy the view! This one too, come on.

282
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
You wish you had this ass!

283
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,200
Hey, would you like to come to a party
at my place tomorrow evening?

284
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,640
Why would you invite me to a party?

285
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,359
Because I need somebody else
to enjoy it as little as I will.

286
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
Besides, wouldn't you like
to see the look on my brother's face?

287
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,359
OK.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,799
Your hair looks nice today.

289
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,759
Did you have any problems
with the other students?

290
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,960
No. Not with anybody.

291
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,160
How was your relationship
with the other students?

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Did you get along? Were you friends?

293
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,839
You're Ander, right?

294
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,160
I've seen all your trophies, man.
I'm crazy about tennis.

295
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Come on, guys!

296
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
To your next class!

297
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,720
Anybody left in the locker room?

298
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,480
What are you doing?

299
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,599
-Anything wrong?
-No, why?

300
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,839
OK, then. Off to class.

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,359
Thanks a lot.

302
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,440
-You're all right, bro.
-I'm not your bro. I just saved your ass.

303
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,079
You could pay me back.

304
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,880
Guzmán!

305
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,359
-What?
-We've been seen!

306
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
-What is it?
-Shit!

307
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,400
-We were seen?
-Shit!

308
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,559
Don't worry, he'll be here soon.
I talked to him ten minutes ago.

309
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:12,039
Besides, nobody will see you here, man.
Don't worry.

310
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,920
-But can he be trusted?
-Of course!

311
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,759
What's he gonna do? Go on TV
to say a rich boy is buying joints?

312
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,839
Come on! That wouldn't be news.

313
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
I don't want them to know at school.

314
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,640
Who's going to find out?
I won't tell. Don't worry.

315
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,960
Besides, I don't have any friends there.
Or do I?

316
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,519
Yeah! Good man!

317
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,720
By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.

318
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,680
-Shoot.
-Why do you all mess with us?

319
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,279
Something happened
with a scholarship student.

320
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,960
The son of one of the cooks.

321
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,440
They didn't offer scholarships
for a full year.

322
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,079
It was a huge mess.

323
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
Until you arrived.

324
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,160
Hey!

325
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,039
What's up, man?

326
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,160
-How are you?
-Hi.

327
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,720
I'll introduce you. Mr. X, Mr. Dealer.
Sorry, no real names.

328
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,279
Thanks, much obliged.

329
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,160
You see how polite he is?
You can't complain,

330
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
I bring you quality clients.

331
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't you forget.

332
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,400
By the way, we'll talk soon.
You owe me one!

333
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,000
Here we go, now we're all set!

334
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,680
-Hey, my man!
-So good to see you!

335
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,039
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

336
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,960
Hang in there!
Fifteen, sixteen, that's it!

337
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,839
So, they make a school collapse,
and get away with it.

338
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,839
Can't wrap my fucking head around that!

339
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,039
-When will the others be released?
-What do I know, man?

340
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,799
That's how the world works.

341
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,319
Some of us in jail for small shit,
and the real crooks out on the street.

342
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,519
It figures.

343
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
I almost didn't live to tell it.
I got a huge cut in my head.

344
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:23,480
But, that got me a ticket to fancyland.

345
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,759
It's no joke, Christian.
What if there had been casualties?

346
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,000
This is not OK.
This country is a fucking joke.

347
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,680
Get him a drink. We're losing him!

348
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
-There are none left.
-None?

349
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
I'll take care of it. I'll be right back.

350
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,640
Man, save and you can buy it.

351
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,799
A little stuck on that topic, isn't he?

352
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,880
I mean, I don't know,
Nano is like a brother to me, you know.

353
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,839
And... my brother's brother
is also my brother, right?

354
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,279
You want my notes, right?

355
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,519
Shit, man. That's fucking gross.

356
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,119
WELCOME.
SHALL WE CREATE YOUR PROFILE?

357
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,359
A GUY

358
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,559
Look at him! Sleeping like a baby.

359
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,519
Catch!

360
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,319
I have an epic idea to end the night.

361
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,279
Jaime, I'm taking it.

362
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,160
Nano, tell me where we're going.

363
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,039
To visit our friend
the owner of the construction company

364
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,000
to give him something to remember us by.

365
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,400
-Get off.
-What?

366
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,319
Get off!

367
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,440
Keep watch.

368
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,160
No! What are you doing?
Don't even think about it!

369
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
Let's live a little, Samu!

370
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,079
Nano!

371
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
You just got out of jail,
and this is the dumbest shit you could do!

372
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,440
Nano, someone's coming! Nano!

373
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,839
-Huh?
-Someone's coming. Let's go!

374
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,839
Motherfucker...

375
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,759
THI

376
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,720
Come on!

377
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,160
Just one more thing, Nadia.
Help us, and then you can go.

378
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
What can you tell me about this trophy?

379
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,799
Why?

380
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,079
We think it's the murder weapon.

381
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,200
What?

382
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,920
We've been told
you wanted to win it more than anything.

383
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,559
Just me?

384
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,240
It's her word against ours.

385
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,880
You want to risk them believing her?

386
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,279
-This is all your fault.
-Mine?

387
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,759
Yes, you and your silly obsession
with doing it in public places.

388
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,359
Sure.

389
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,839
As if you didn't like it.

390
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,640
Hello.

391
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
Sorry about yesterday.
We thought we were alone.

392
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:05,920
If only.

393
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,000
I know we started off
on the wrong foot. I'd like to fix that.

394
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,119
Why don't you come
to my sister's party tonight?

395
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
We can get to know each other.

396
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,359
Thanks, but no.

397
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,039
Have a nice day.

398
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,920
Boo!

399
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,759
I love her!

400
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,920
Who? Carla?

401
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,920
Her mother is a Spanish grandee.

402
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,839
Do you know
Marquesado de Caleruega wines?

403
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,680
-No.
-That's her mommy, the marchioness.

404
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,079
That guy, Polo,
has been her boyfriend since they were 12.

405
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,680
That guy? For real?

406
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,000
No, come on, she deserves much better.
You're fucking kidding me!

407
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,839
I'd watch out for the girls here.

408
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah. I'll be watching this one.

409
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,960
Nadia.

410
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,359
How are you?

411
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,279
Listen, I'd like you to come to my party.

412
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,640
Thank you, but it isn't my scene.

413
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,480
You can come in your scarf, or without it.
Come as you want, OK?

414
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,920
It's called a hijab.

415
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,119
Not a scarf.

416
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Hijab.

417
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,279
-And nobody forces me to wear it.
-Lucky you!

418
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,160
I do feel like I'm being forced
to have this ridiculous party.

419
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,599
I don't know. Give us a chance.
We're not all like my brother.

420
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,400
It starts at 8:00.

421
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,319
Samuel has the address.

422
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,359
-Fuck, man, this doesn't draw well.
-Don't make fun of the newbie, OK?

423
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm not making fun.

424
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,799
For a first joint,
made with a tutorial, it's not bad.

425
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,640
Why the fuck don't you wanna go
to the party?

426
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Stop obsessing about the party.

427
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,599
I'm not obsessing.

428
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,480
You may be used to all this luxury
and stuff, but I'm not.

429
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,680
This is new to me. I'm excited about it.

430
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,759
What do you think?

431
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,079
-That I live like the rest of them?
-You don't?

432
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,079
-Not even close.
-Then what are you doing at that school?

433
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,759
Kid, I'm the principal's son.

434
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,599
Son of a bitch! You've got connections!

435
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,240
Anyway...

436
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,599
-You want to go, right?
-Of course.

437
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,440
-Are you positive?
-Completely, yes.

438
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,000
-Do you have anything decent to wear?
-Of course I do, man!

439
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,200
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,079
Nadia wants to go to the party.

441
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,200
My dad wants to be sure
there won't be alcohol

442
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,039
and that parents will be there.
Just say yes. I want to go home.

443
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,480
Yeah, man, don't worry.

444
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,400
Damn!

445
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,319
This is a serious party.

446
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
THI

447
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,079
What's up, Samu?

448
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,480
-Hi.
-You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

449
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,599
Let's go in!

450
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Here you have it, a coming-out party
in all its ridiculousness!

451
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,319
What is it for?

452
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,960
In other times, to find a husband quickly.

453
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:24,200
Nowadays, it's more about networking.

454
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,599
Although the husband thing
is not ruled out.

455
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,480
You're so much fun when you drink.

456
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,640
Wow, you rich people know
how to throw a party!

457
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,640
Are you color-blind?

458
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,519
Or did you not turn on the light
when you got dressed?

459
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,519
Lu, don't be mean.

460
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,359
Handsome guys look good
in anything.

461
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,799
We've already said hi. Are you staying?

462
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,599
I don't know. Do you want me to stay?

463
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,599
-If you say yes, I'll stay forever.
-Well, well, let's start with a drink.

464
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
Please.

465
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,079
Ah, move aside.

466
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,519
Can you explain
why you brought the influencer?

467
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,400
-You brought the girl, right?
-It's my home, Ander.

468
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,559
I don't know, he wanted to come.
Nothing's going to happen.

469
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,599
This whole crusade of yours
against them is ridiculous.

470
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,559
Look...

471
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,680
I forgive you,
because you're really drunk.

472
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,920
But I'd never betray you like this!

473
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,839
What betrayal, Guzmán?

474
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,359
What betrayal?

475
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,480
Fucking champagne! Where's the beer?

476
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,359
You've come.

477
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Dad.

478
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,920
Pleased to meet you.

479
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,559
The balls on you, kid, showing up here!
Don't you know we have security cameras?

480
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,720
Shall we talk later?

481
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,680
Only alcohol can make this tolerable.
Here.

482
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,119
Thanks. I don't drink.

483
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,160
It's going to be a hard night, then.

484
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,920
-I'm leaving soon.
-Of course.

485
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,000
Why give us a chance if you've already
passed judgment on us all, right?

486
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,200
Here's everything you hate about the West.

487
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,039
All the sinful decadence.

488
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,799
I thought I was the one judging.

489
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,440
But I can see you've decided
what I think and what I don't.

490
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,119
With a scarf on your head,
you can't possibly think much, dear.

491
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Is this about me
not accepting the champagne,

492
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,279
or are you a born racist?

493
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,799
Forgive me. Oh, no, forgive me.

494
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
Sorry, I came here in peace, I swear.

495
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,640
I'm sure you and I
have something in common.

496
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,559
Don't worry.
I've come to Las Encinas to study.

497
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm not interested in anything
beyond that.

498
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,920
Let me give you some advice, dear.

499
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,599
You can do it all.

500
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,639
Look at me.

501
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,440
I date. I have fun, a lot.

502
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,679
And I'm at the top of the class.

503
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,639
Or you were.

504
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:18,559
Right?

505
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,480
So?

506
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,000
What do you think of my party?

507
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,239
Wouldn't you love to set us all on fire?

508
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,559
OK. I'll order a glass of water,
just in case.

509
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,360
Samuel...

510
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,920
Sorry I didn't tell you
my dad's company...

511
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,800
-was the one from your school.
-Right.

512
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,920
-It would have been good to know.
-I'm not like him.

513
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,880
And to be honest,
I think I don't even like him.

514
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,639
But he's done this for you.

515
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,199
Yeah, he's very good at solving problems
by throwing money at them.

516
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Wanna dance?

517
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,960
-What?
-What's wrong?

518
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,159
Don't you see?

519
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,880
It's not about the skirt. I don't care.
It's that Taliban girl.

520
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,719
That little hypocrite.

521
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,880
Wearing a scarf on your head
makes you superior to us?

522
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,239
Please, how ridiculous!

523
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,400
I don't want her here,
but we have to keep her from telling.

524
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,840
I have an idea.

525
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,800
Let's hear it.

526
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,159
I propose a game.

527
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,480
Why don't you seduce her?

528
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,760
Then everybody finds out...
and that's that.

529
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,480
You want me to hook up
with the Palestinian

530
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,039
who walks around in a turban?

531
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,199
Oh, sweetie...

532
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,920
the idea of making a virginal Muslim girl
fall for you doesn't turn you on?

533
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:19,719
Come on, you woo her, she falls for you,
everybody finds out...

534
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,119
That's it! We cut her down to size,
and she can't act all superior.

535
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,679
Not even if I ask you?

536
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,760
Then I'll let you do
whatever you want with me.

537
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,400
I already do whatever I want with you.

538
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,960
Not even half of it.

539
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,559
I'm thinking today
would be a good day to do it. Right?

540
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,800
I call the tow truck,
and they don't come for me.

541
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Well, I don't know.

542
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,679
Here? Right now?

543
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,199
And why not?

544
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,840
But if you're not sure,
let's forget about it.

545
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,159
Hey.

546
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,519
-Samuel, right?
-Yes.

547
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,880
What exactly did you mean to write here,
on my front wall?

548
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,320
T-H-I...

549
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,440
S.

550
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,519
"This above all:
to thine own self be true."

551
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
-Ah.
-It's a quote from Hamlet.

552
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,599
Yes, of course, a quote from Hamlet.
Ingenious.

553
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,679
But...

554
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,760
I think you wanted to write...

555
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,519
thief, son of a bitch,

556
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,079
or one of those names
the press is calling me lately.

557
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,880
Bring the other scholarship kids,
and we'll take a photo of the four of us.

558
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,840
Shaking hands and smiling.

559
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,199
I don't know.

560
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,639
Come on, man.

561
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,800
What's wrong with taking a photo?
It could be good for everybody.

562
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,679
For the town, for the school,
even for you.

563
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,039
I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.

564
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,320
It's OK, kid.

565
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,280
I'll report your brother tomorrow.
Let's see what happens to his parole.

566
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,440
Think about it.

567
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,480
What did he say?

568
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,360
He wants a photo
with the scholarship students.

569
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
-Really?
-Yes.

570
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,599
That's why he wanted me to invite you.
His image makeover bullshit.

571
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,199
He doesn't waste an opportunity.

572
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,760
Samuel, don't play along.
You don't have to.

573
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,400
I don't mind doing it.

574
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,400
What's wrong?

575
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,880
Nothing. I don't know.
I thought you were different.

576
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Hello.

577
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,519
COME GET ME?

578
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,559
Come on, we have things to do.

579
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,000
What is this?

580
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:10,880
Olé.

581
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,079
We have 15 minutes
before they realize I'm not there.

582
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,800
Are you taking your clothes off?

583
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,599
That comes off, too.
But slowly, so I can see you.

584
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,559
OK. And you too.

585
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Let's do it at the same time.

586
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,800
Like this?

587
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,079
Am I doing it right?

588
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,760
Yes, you're doing fucking great.

589
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,079
HEY, COOL PROFILE

590
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
YOURS TOO. WHAT'S UP?

591
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
BORED. WANT TO MEET?

592
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,920
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PHOTO?

593
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,239
I can't believe it.
Explain it to me, please.

594
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,920
You knew it was him who ruined our wall,

595
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,960
and you let him in our home?

596
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,039
Who?

597
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,159
The skinny kid.

598
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,119
Because he had ulterior motives.
He wanted a picture with him.

599
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,519
What?

600
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,920
Mom, I don't know why you are surprised.

601
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,199
You are the only one
Dad still manages to disappoint.

602
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,360
Those people are poison.
You know it.

603
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,519
Why are you with them every time
I turn around, Marina? Why?

604
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:33,800
Why don't you leave them alone?

605
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,239
Because I refuse
to let you get hurt again, Marina!

606
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,639
-Pablo did not mean to hurt me!
-Marina!

607
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
Now is not the time. Please.

608
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,480
Then when?
Tell me, when is the right time?

609
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,280
Why can't we talk about it?

610
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,320
You've spent a fortune on psychologists
to convince me nothing happened.

611
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,199
That life goes on.
That everything would be fine.

612
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,599
And you know what?

613
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,199
Every time you avoid the subject,
I feel like a piece of shit.

614
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,599
I fell in love with a boy. He infected me.

615
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
I need you to say it!

616
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,599
Say it! Say it, Mom!

617
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,079
"My 16-year-old daughter is HIV-positive."

618
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
Do you regret tonight?

619
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,800
It was... intense.

620
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,239
But it was good.

621
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:47,880
You're sure?

622
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,840
Good night.

623
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,239
GOOD NIGHT, GORGEOUS

624
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,039
I love you. I love you more than ever.

625
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:28,639
You! This is how you thank us
for your scholarship?

626
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,119
-Guzmán!
-By vandalizing other people's property?

627
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,400
-You disgust me!
-What's going on here?

628
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,920
And who are you?

629
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,679
Unbelievable,
the riffraff we have here tonight!

630
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,679
Should I take that as a compliment
or punch you?

631
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,039
Take it as you will.

632
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,360
-Let's go.
-I won't let this prep boy insult us.

633
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,599
I'm not insulting you,
just stating the facts.

634
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:46,559
One question.

635
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,880
What do you call people who keep millions
that don't belong to them

636
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,880
so they can live the way you do?

637
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:54,400
Thieves or simply bastards?

638
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,360
How dare you come to this house

639
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,519
to insult me and my family?

640
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,880
Who do you think you are, fucking clown?

641
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,199
-What are you doing?
-OK.

642
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,679
You don't deserve my brother!

643
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,920
Get off me!

644
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,440
Shove your money up your asses!

645
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,400
You! Hey!

646
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,400
You are finished!

647
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,079
Tomorrow, everybody at school
will know you are a fucking criminal!

648
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:20,840
Forget about your scholarship!

649
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Guzmán. Are you OK?
Did they hurt you?

650
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,880
Does it hurt a lot?

651
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,320
Polo...

652
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,679
Why don't you get lost
and stop making a fool of yourself?

653
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:40,960
Go!

654
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,440
Guzmán,

655
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,360
don't take it out on Samuel.
He's a good person.

656
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,079
Let's see
what the principal says tomorrow.

657
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,119
Your sister is right.
Samuel is a good person.

658
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:55,519
Me, not so much.

659
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,960
If you say anything at school,
I'll share what I saw in the shower.

660
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,440
Thanks for inviting me.

661
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:08,519
Nadia.

662
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,159
Nadia, you win.

663
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,480
I lost my temper.
I won't tell on your friend.

664
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,559
Stay a little longer.
Let me show you we are worth the trouble.

665
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,840
You all are too good
at looking down on people.

666
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,039
Teach me how to look at you.

667
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,000
I promise I'll be a fast learner.

668
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:41,599
What's going on, honey?

669
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,079
This one needs to be taken down
a peg or two.

670
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,719
Hey.

671
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:31,440
Are you gonna say nothing all night?
After I stood up for you?

672
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:34,119
You are clueless.
Do you know what I've done for you?

673
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,599
I had it under control,
and you had to make a mess.

674
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,079
Now I have to clean it up.

675
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,480
I was protecting you, asshole!
Like I have my entire fucking life.

676
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,639
I never asked you to!

677
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,920
Come on, Samu! I won't let those people,
who are a real cancer, laugh at you!

678
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,400
You've been blaming them your whole life.
Maybe you're the cancer.

679
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,559
Is Samuel home?

680
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,360
Is Samuel here?

681
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,440
He's sleeping.

682
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:54,719
He was up all night hugging the toilet.

683
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,519
He says it's a hangover,

684
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:59,119
but it's the fear of having to go back
to that school.

685
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,239
He can come back, no problem.

686
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,639
I came to tell him
my brother won't say anything.

687
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:07,119
Very well.

688
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,360
Anything else?

689
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,920
Coffee, water, beer?

690
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,800
Sit down if you want.

691
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,559
Did you tag my wall?

692
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,280
My letter of introduction.

693
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,559
Next time, finish it.

694
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,480
I liked what you said at the party.

695
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,079
You dared to shout what a lot of us think.
Or at least I do.

696
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,400
Somebody had to say it.

697
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
And... is it true you've been to jail?

698
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,880
You love to ask questions, huh?

699
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:11,159
Yes, but only for a short while.

700
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,960
Sleeping badly, eating worse.

701
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,119
No women,
unless you count my mother, my lawyer,

702
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,079
and my second aunt from Murcia.
I'm not sure why she came.

703
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,199
None like you, I can tell you that.

704
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,360
Stay any longer,
and I'll make you iron.

705
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,679
I'll go.

706
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,599
You'd better.

707
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:38,639
-Bye.
-Bye.

708
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,440
Here you go. Washed and pressed.
By the way...

709
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:07,360
fancy girl was here.
She wants you to go back to school.

710
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:30,400
