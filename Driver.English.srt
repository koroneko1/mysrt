1
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,666
What happened, Kade?

2
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,291
Tae has gone to Korea on a business trip.

3
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,583
He was supposed to be back yesterday.

4
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,000
But he disappeared

5
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,708
and I can't contact him.

6
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,375
Has he ever disappeared like this before?

7
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,500
Never.

8
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,916
He's never turned off his phone like this.

9
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,750
How do you want me to help you?

10
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,875
I don't know.

11
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,916
Tum, you're a police officer.

12
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,500
Can you tell me what to do?

13
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,166
Can you send me his flight details?

14
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,708
I'll check with the airline first.

15
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,666
Give me his hotel address in Korea, too.

16
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,208
I'll check if thereÂ 
was an accident or anything.

17
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,583
Does his mom know about this?

18
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,541
I already called her this morning.

19
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,166
I didn't want her to be the last to know.

20
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,666
Tae won't be gone for too long.
He'll be back.

21
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,333
Don't worry.

22
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,291
Tum will take care of it.

23
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,208
Okay.

24
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,000
Mac, did you drive Tae to the airport?

25
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,750
The day he flew to Korea.

26
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, I did.

27
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,291
Did he tell you to pick him up
when he gets back?

28
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,291
No, he didn't.

29
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,250
He didn't tell me anything.

30
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,541
Did you see anything unusual, Mac?

31
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,416
How unusual?

32
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,750
You really don't know...

33
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,541
or are you hiding something for your boss?

34
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,333
I'm a driver.

35
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,458
My job is to drive.

36
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,500
Men.

37
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,625
When they're not with us,
they're not our husbands.

38
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:08,041
We can't control them all the time.

39
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,583
What am I supposed to do?

40
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,000
Just let them be.

41
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,583
There's no such thing as trust.

42
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,791
See what you like to see, Kade.

43
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,458
And you don't need to know everything.

44
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,375
I'm trying.

45
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,583
I've never pried into his business.

46
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,416
We both give each other privacy.

47
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,416
Are you sure?

48
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,833
What about the maid you just fired?

49
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,708
You don't need
a young and beautiful housemaid.

50
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:37,250
Get the old one with kids...

51
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,625
to avoid trouble.

52
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,291
If you don't,
you've to wash your dishes yourself.

53
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,166
Not on the lips.

54
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,333
If not on the lips...

55
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,416
then can I kiss somewhere else?

56
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,416
Excuse me.

57
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't you have to drive mom?

58
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,541
Tum is taking care of her now.

59
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,291
Do you want me to do anything else?

60
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,833
There's no work at the office.

61
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,208
Boss hasn't come back yet anyway.

62
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,166
Oh...

63
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,875
I'm sorry.

64
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,500
I didn't mean to worry you.

65
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,041
It's okay.

66
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,708
Can you take me to Tae's office?

67
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,291
Sure.

68
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,666
Let me get changed first.

69
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,000
Excuse me.

70
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,916
-Miss Kade is here.
-Oh!

71
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,625
-Hello.
-Hi.

72
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,333
Can I take a look at Tae's office?

73
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,708
Of course.

74
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,625
Boss didn't come home, did he?

75
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,083
That's why she's here.

76
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,833
Have you seen him here today?

77
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,208
No, I haven't.

78
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,000
I haven't seen him since the day
you dropped him at the airport.

79
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,416
Same here.

80
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,708
Our boss's wife looks so intimidating.

81
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:08,083
When she looked at me,
I was afraid to look back.

82
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,000
It has to be a woman like her
to win boss's heart.

83
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,583
Beautiful, smart...

84
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,291
and big tits.

85
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,375
It's an electricity bill.

86
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,291
But the address is a house in Chonburi.

87
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,666
I never knew about a house there.

88
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,208
Have you ever driven him there, Mac?

89
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,458
Never.

90
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,250
Can you take me there, please?

91
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:51,916
Sure.

92
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,708
Do you know exactly where this house is?

93
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,583
Do you want to take a look
at the bill again?

94
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,541
It's okay.

95
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,958
I know how to get there.

96
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,708
Do you drive to Chonburi often?

97
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,583
Just passed by.

98
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,541
Boss came for work often.

99
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,041
Aren't you going to tell Tum about this?

100
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,708
About what?

101
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,166
About where we're going to.

102
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,750
We don't even know whose house it is.

103
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,416
If he knows, he's going to tell Tae's mom.

104
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,666
Let's not make her worried.

105
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,958
Perhaps I've troubled youÂ 
too much already.

106
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,666
Not at all. It's my job.

107
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,958
Thank you.

108
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,250
Do you want me to turn on the radio?

109
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,416
Please don't.

110
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,416
Just talk to me like this...

111
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,458
it helps clear my mind.

112
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,583
Let me help you.

113
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:40,875
Here.

114
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,916
Okay.

115
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,333
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

116
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,583
Do you think there's someone in there?

117
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,291
I hope so.

118
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,333
Tae!

119
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,416
Kade...

120
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,541
I found a nice house design.

121
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,583
Look.

122
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,625
The beach house

123
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,958
with big glass windows.

124
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,250
You're going to love it.

125
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,041
-Which one?
-Here. See?

126
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,458
Listen,

127
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,541
if I finish this project,

128
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,958
I might have the money
to build this house for you.

129
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,041
We can wait until I get pregnant.

130
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,083
Let's try again now.

131
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,208
Right here?

132
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,208
What are you doing?

133
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,291
We've already broken into someone's house.

134
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,416
Stealing some food
shouldn't be much of a problem.

135
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,041
I forgot.
We didn't stop by anywhere to eat.

136
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,208
Let's have some cereal.

137
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,458
Is it the boss's house?

138
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,958
I think so.

139
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,583
Here are his phone and credit card bills.

140
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,583
Maybe he rented it...

141
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,541
because he wouldn't have any money
to buy this house.

142
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,166
You'd better eat something.

143
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,125
It will make you feel better.

144
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,250
You are a very polite driver,
you know that?

145
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,166
No wonder Tae hired you.

146
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,083
I can't do anything better than driving.

147
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,750
Is this blazer a uniform?

148
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,541
It looks good on you.

149
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,208
I've never seen other drivers
wearing a blazer like that.

150
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:43,708
If I'm not wearing this,
they'll cut my salary.

151
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,458
Does a driver like you...

152
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,958
get lost sometimes?

153
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,916
If I get lost too often,
they'll cut my salary, too.

154
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,666
I mean getting lost on purpose.

155
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,500
Like getting lost...

156
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,166
in a place you can't tellÂ 
anybody about...

157
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,875
or in some secret places.

158
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:34,625
If I found Tae here in this house...

159
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,000
with his significant other...

160
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,958
what do you think I should do?

161
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,750
There's something
at the bottom of the pool.

162
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,416
Do you want to get it out?

163
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,458
I'm going to get wet
if I get into the pool.

164
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,041
I don't have a spare set of clothes.

165
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,833
Alright.

166
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,333
Can you go and get it for me?

167
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,291
I'm going to get wet
if I get into the pool.

168
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,833
I don't have a spare set of clothes.

169
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,541
Get in without any clothes, then.

170
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,333
Are you kidding me?

171
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,750
I'll get you a towel.

172
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,500
A key?

173
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,166
Why was it in the pool?

174
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,625
Can I have the towel?

175
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,291
I found a VIP card for his spa membership.

176
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,041
There's a phone number here.

177
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:25,250
Can you call to ask if Tae's there?

178
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,166
Do you think it's a good idea?

179
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,791
Jasmine Spa and Massage.

180
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,708
Can I have your membership number?

181
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,875
What's that?

182
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,750
Your membership number on the card.

183
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,208
JASMINE SPA &amp; MASSAGE

184
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,791
Three, eight, zero, six.

185
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,458
Hello, Tae.

186
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:10,208
Would you like to confirm the booking
at 4 p.m. today?

187
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,833
Yes.

188
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,625
Jacuzzi room, right?

189
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:22,791
Yes.

190
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,208
With the same staff?

191
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,875
Yes.

192
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,833
Alrighty!

193
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,333
He might be there at 4 p.m.

194
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:02,625
Where have you been?

195
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,333
I went out for a cigarette.

196
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,291
Smoking?

197
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,625
Don't you know that
you can't smoke during work hours?

198
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,791
Mind your own business.

199
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,333
How many staff does Tae want today?

200
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,541
Today...

201
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,083
it's just you,
no one else is in this early.

202
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,041
After this, I'm out.

203
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,000
How come? You'd better stay on call.

204
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:42,000
I can't.
I already came four times yesterday.

205
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,208
I need to go back to the gym.

206
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,416
My muscles are shrinking.

207
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,625
Never mind muscles.
Don't let your dick shrink.

208
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,666
Or else you will lose your job.

209
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,666
Come on.

210
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,625
My dick doesn't shrink easily.
Do you want to check it out?

211
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,333
Stop it, before I puke.

212
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,458
Wait in bed.
Let me get back to the reception.

213
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,583
-Hey!
-Wait!

214
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,916
Wait. Let me ask you something.

215
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Ask me what?

216
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,458
Where is Tae?

217
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,958
I don't know. I'm waiting for him, too.

218
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,125
Does he come here often?

219
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,750
Why don't you answer her?

220
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,208
Why are you asking? Are you a cop?

221
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,250
No...

222
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,791
but Tae is my husband.

223
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,333
Do you know what this place is?

224
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,791
A spa?

225
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,666
A spa or a brothel?

226
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,583
You've come here often, haven't you?

227
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,833
-Watch your mouth, asshole!
-Wait.

228
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,708
Why did Tae pick a male masseuse?

229
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,625
I'm telling you nothing.

230
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,791
We can't share clients' information.

231
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,708
Give me a minute.

232
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,208
-I'll take care of it.
-Hey!

233
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,208
What is this? Why are you bullying me?

234
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,666
Can you talk now?

235
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,750
Shame on you.

236
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,666
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

237
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,333
And there is a price for everything.

238
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,291
Tell me everything.

239
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,750
We've got a new boy in town, sir.

240
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:56,958
Tae made a house call once
to his old apartment in Pattanakarn.

241
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,625
Maybe it turned him on.

242
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,000
Do you still have the address?

243
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,916
This way.

244
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,958
I think that's enough for today.

245
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,916
Tae wouldn't be here anyway.

246
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,791
Did you lose something?

247
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,875
You were born into a good family...

248
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,083
and a wealthy life.

249
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,458
But your palm tells...

250
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,500
that you will lose...

251
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,416
something important.

252
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,500
What should I do?

253
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,541
What was it that you lost?

254
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,041
What's the matter?
How come we can't talk on the phone?

255
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,000
Well...

256
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:36,458
I must show you some photos.

257
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:42,375
I can't send them to you
because I don't want them to leak.

258
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:44,041
What photos?

259
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,208
May I go to the restroom?

260
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,875
A client of mine hired me
to follow her husband.

261
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:05,958
I took a lot of photos of him, everywhere.

262
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,583
Until I remembered...

263
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,375
he is your friend.

264
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,125
Who is he?

265
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,208
Why do you carry a gun in your bag?

266
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,333
What is wrong with you?

267
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:52,833
Nothing's fucking wrong with me.

268
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,458
I'm legally his wife...

269
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,208
and you're...

270
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,875
just a driver...

271
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,166
that he happened to have sex with.

272
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,166
You can say anything you want.

273
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,916
But the truth is still the truth.

274
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,000
Do you know about the truth?

275
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,416
Well...

276
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,666
tell me the truth, Mac.

277
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,083
Your husband...

278
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:41,416
stayed with you...

279
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,625
because of your money.

280
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:47,500
He doesn't love you.

281
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,833
He loves me.

282
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,500
Do you understand?

283
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,916
He never loved you. He loves me.

284
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,750
If he loves you that much...

285
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,541
why did he put you in a place like this?

286
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,000
Why?

287
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,291
I want you to hear it from Tae...

288
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,083
which one he will choose.

289
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,541
And who he built...

290
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,625
that beach house for?

291
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,833
Do you really believe...

292
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,458
that he would...

293
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,375
leave me...

294
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,041
for a driver like you?

295
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,291
TUM

296
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,750
Tum.

297
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,333
Maybe he found Tae.

298
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,708
Do you want to talk to him?

299
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:12,958
Hello, Tum.

300
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,125
Where are you, Kade?

301
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,833
I'm out running an errand.

302
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:21,916
Do you have any updates?

303
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:26,041
Kade, I happen to know
that you hired someone to follow Tae.

304
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,208
That person used to work for me.

305
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,958
He recognized Tae from the photos he took.

306
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,041
Have you seen the photos?

307
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:34,791
I've seen them.

308
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,208
Tae has been seeing a lot of people.

309
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,375
But it's a surprise
he's seeing this person.

310
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,708
It looks serious.

311
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,208
Who are you talking about?

312
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,875
I mean his driver.

313
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,750
You knew all about it.

314
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,916
I was with you everywhere.

315
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:31,666
I was with you all day.

316
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,875
And you knew all about it.

317
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,166
What do you want?

318
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,791
You forgot this at the shop.

319
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,875
Thank you.

320
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,500
How come you look so pale and sweaty?

321
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,958
Um...

322
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,708
Oh...

323
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,583
that pretty lady, right?

324
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,833
I'm not going to bother you then.

325
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,041
You know where Tae is, right?

326
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,416
Do you want some, bitch?

327
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,375
I don't take leftovers, bitch!

328
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,166
Try my fucking leftovers then.

329
00:50:58,458 --> 00:50:59,875
Where is Tae?

330
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,875
Where is Tae?

331
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,083
Mac.

332
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,708
Don't do this. I want to rest.

333
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,416
Why are you avoiding me?

334
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,166
I'm not avoiding you. I'm taking a nap.

335
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:39,000
I was away for so many days.
Didn't you miss me?

336
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:40,875
Tell me.

337
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:42,208
-No.
-Did you miss me?

338
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:45,500
But I missed you, Mac.

339
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,166
I missed you every day.

340
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,791
Let me kiss you.

341
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:57,208
What is all this? Come on, let's talk.

342
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,916
No need to talk,
it won't make any difference.

343
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,791
I don't want to talk anymore.

344
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,375
Maybe you don't want a gift from Korea.

345
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,083
What a shame. No one wants my gift.

346
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,708
-What is it?
-Guess!

347
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,875
I don't want to guess. Give it to me.

348
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,708
I thought you were taking a nap,
weren't you?

349
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,541
Give it to me.

350
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:34,875
Tae!

351
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:37,416
Don't do this again.

352
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,041
Let's move in together.

353
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,500
Are you serious?

354
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,041
I'm serious.

355
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:02,000
Move in with you to be what?

356
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,541
If I have to live like a mistress...

357
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,500
these keys mean nothing at all.

358
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:12,000
I'll take care of everything.

359
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,416
You always say this.

360
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,041
I don't believe you anymore.

361
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,166
Give me more time.

362
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,583
I'll tell Kade everything
when I get back to her.

363
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,958
I had to let you marry her...

364
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,541
even though we were seeing
each other long before.

365
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,208
I had to see you with her every day.

366
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,375
I had to put up with that...

367
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,458
because you needed it for business.

368
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:50,791
But now I can't do it anymore.

369
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:53,541
You have to let me go.

370
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:54,958
No.

371
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,416
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

372
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,500
We're going to live here together.

373
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,708
I can't pretend to be her husband anymore.

374
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,166
Is Tae here?

375
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,625
Is Tae here?

376
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,625
Follow me if you want to find out.

377
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,041
Hello, can I take your order?

378
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:39,166
Whiskey on the rocks.

379
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,083
And for the gentleman?

380
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:42,750
Same, please.

381
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:49,625
Stop playing games. Where is he?

382
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,458
You've lost your husband...

383
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,666
let's have a drink to relax.

384
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,000
Where is Tae?

385
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,708
Go and look around.

386
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,416
Do you want to drink with me?

387
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,833
No, thanks.

388
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:32,833
Excuse me.

389
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,083
Do you know
where the woman who was with me is?

390
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,708
Maybe she went to the restroom.

391
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,375
Aren't you having your drink, sir?

392
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,916
No, I'm not.

393
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,250
Try this one,
it tastes better than whiskey.

394
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,541
No, thanks.

395
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,708
I don't drink. I don't want to get drunk.

396
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,583
Where is the restroom?

397
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,500
You look so cute.

398
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:03,916
You don't drink. What about a smoke?

399
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,208
I don't smoke.

400
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,583
No alcohol, no cigarettes.

401
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,583
What else do you want?

402
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:29,000
We got it all here.

403
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:32,583
No, thanks.

404
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,583
You don't want anything.

405
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:37,833
Why did you come here?

406
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,625
I'm looking for someone.

407
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:46,083
Can I be someone for you?

408
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:47,625
No, you can't.

409
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,208
You can't keep saying "no" to hurt people,
you know that?

410
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,500
Where is the restroom?

411
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,583
Have some of these
and I'll take you to the restroom.

412
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,166
Don't tell me you don't like sweets.

413
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,916
What is all this?

414
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,208
You don't like women, do you?

415
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,916
Can I have some water?

416
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,958
Where is the restroom?

417
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:36,041
I can't pretend to be her husband anymore.

418
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,041
I'm only yours.

419
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:45,833
Do you really mean it?

420
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,791
I mean it.

421
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:52,916
Hey!

422
01:02:58,333 --> 01:02:59,333
Hey!

423
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,291
Do you really have to go?

424
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,750
I can't cancel on my mom.

425
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,125
I don't want you to go.

426
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,666
I'll come back soon.

427
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,791
I need to get my stuff from the apartment.

428
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,666
Hey!

429
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,250
You want to kill me now?

430
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,125
Don't you want to see your husband?

431
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,041
Where is Tae?

432
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:52,416
Did you hear me? Where is Tae?

433
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,666
He's been waiting for youÂ 
down at the beach.

434
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,291
Tae!

435
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:53,791
Tae!

436
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,208
Tae!

437
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,458
Tae!

438
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,625
Tae!

439
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:29,916
Tae!

440
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:11,333
-Let go.
-Why did you kill him?

441
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,250
Kade...

442
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:31,833
how did you get here?

443
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:33,625
Nice house.

444
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,875
It's the house I built for you, baby.

445
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,708
I was planning to surprise you
on our anniversary.

446
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,458
This must be...

447
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,125
the key you were planning to give me,Â 
right?

448
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:48,625
Oh, yes.

449
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,333
You knew everything,
so it's not a surprise anymore.

450
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:53,541
I caught you like this...

451
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,875
but you're still lying to me.

452
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,208
I'm not lying.

453
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,208
Do you want him to be your driver...

454
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,041
or your wife?

455
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:09,916
What are you talking about?

456
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,750
I saw you fuck him on that couch.

457
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:16,708
Just fucking.

458
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,083
I don't even love him.

459
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:23,083
It's just sex, Kade.

460
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,291
I hope you understand.

461
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,750
I don't want to understand
a liar like you.

462
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,958
Hello, Tum. What's the matter?

463
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,250
Tum...

464
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,708
what are you trying to tell me?

465
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,625
You don't need to tell me that.

466
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,666
I know how Tae is.

467
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,041
I even know what happened
between you and him.

468
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,416
I just didn't want to talk about it.

469
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,958
If he chooses to live like this...

470
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,375
I'm not going to warn him anymore.

471
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,833
If he hadn't marriedÂ Kade...

472
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,250
he wouldn't have come this far.

473
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,250
Did you find him?

474
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:21,916
