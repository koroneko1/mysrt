1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,679
If you carry on with your investigation,

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,279
the only thing you will really achieve
will be ending up like Christian.

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,519
Samuel, this is not enough
to change the course of an investigation.

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,440
Less than this was enough
to put my brother in jail.

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,399
-Your brother fit the profile.
-The profile?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,559
Of someone who could commit
a crime like that.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,359
-With a criminal record. Violent--
-He's not a murderer.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,600
-And now he is on the run.
-He has disappeared.

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,359
We believe that he is on the run,

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,759
and there is currently
a warrant for his arrest.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,240
Do you see the difference?

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,200
Samuel, go home.

13
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,240
Focus on your studies.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,799
Don't get into trouble.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,560
Stop looking at the past
and focus on your future.

16
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,920
84 HOURS MISSING

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,879
You tell me.

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,640
Yesterday, someone called the tip hotline

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,319
for information on Samuel,

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,359
and after 30 seconds of silence,
they hung up.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,280
And?

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,599
We traced the call. It was someone
who knew Samuel very well.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Who?

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,640
We just need some more ice.
Do you need anything else?

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,319
No.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Listen, are you friends with the guy
who rides the bike? Samu.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,280
The one who lives
on the square with the steps.

28
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,640
Why?

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,719
Because you should warn him as a friend
that he'd better watch out.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
He got involved with the wrong people.

31
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,840
Bullshit. Just get on with your work.
We still have lots to do.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,719
Remember that I warned you.
Don't come crying to me later.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,719
The police have no time
to listen to your stories.

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,439
-They are not stories.
-But they don't believe you.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,039
-Neither do I.
-No.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
You don't want to believe me

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
because you're afraid
that your friends are your enemies,

38
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,960
and I'm the only person telling you
the fucking truth.

39
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,479
Listen, stop--

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,319
Stop stirring shit up.

41
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,360
Hi, gorgeous!

42
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,879
-Hi! Sorry.
-It's okay. Do you have a moment?

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,120
-Sure.
-I wanted to talk about... something.

44
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,080
There is an NGO, Smile 4 the Child,
that has just arrived here in Spain.

45
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,759
They have made me the Spanish ambassador.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
-For real?
-Yes.

47
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,159
-That's great.
-No, really,

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,000
they do a fantastic job helping
poor children in developing countries.

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,599
-Amazing work.
-Cool.

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,759
I'd like to put on a small event.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,639
A charity dinner to start off,
with maybe 10 or 15 people.

52
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
-Okay.
-But I haven't got many contacts here yet.

53
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,319
And you need my help, right?

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
-Yes.
-And you know you'll have it.

55
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,639
Thank you, babe. You're the best.

56
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,840
I know! So are you.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,520
-I'll make a few calls and let you know.
-Okay, darling.

58
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,199
-Thank you, baby.
-Relax. It'll be great.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
-Bye.
-Bye.

60
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,039
Well, you tell Marcos for me
that you and he should stop freaking out.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,919
No one is coming to get me,
because I'm a nobody.

62
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,120
Haven't you seen in the movies

63
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,439
how, when they want to scare someone,
they kill the dog?

64
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,639
You're basically the dog.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,759
I saw them around back when I was dealing.

66
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,079
They don't want anyone stepping on
and fucking up their business.

67
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,839
Because that's it, isn't it?
You're dealing.

68
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,920
I only deliver stuff.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,079
After the grief I got from you to quit
that shit, now you're at it yourself!

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
Omar, they won't give us back
the bail money.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,800
We need to pay the lawyer.
What I earn is not enough.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,839
-I need the money.
-I needed it, too!

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,800
But a friend had a go at me and said
I would end up in prison or worse.

74
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,720
Maybe your friend didn't know
what he was talking about.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,639
Maybe he saved my life.

76
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,920
Samu, one day, Fer, my weed dealer,
stopped picking up the phone.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
A week later, he calls me and tells me
he had been in the hospital.

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,079
He got shot in the leg.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,720
It seems like easy money,
but it makes your life more difficult.

80
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Why did you call and not say anything?

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Who are you afraid of?

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,639
-What's going on with Samuel?
-Which Samuel?

83
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,519
-The one from your class.
-Nothing. Nothing is going on. Why?

84
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,040
He went to the police.

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
He has been talking about you, me, Polo.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,000
Apparently, he even had
a recording of you.

87
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,639
And what was I saying in that recording?

88
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,560
Nothing important, I suppose.

89
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,959
They ignored him. But watch out for him.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,480
Could you do me a favor and meet
your brother so you can give it to him?

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,879
Don't tell him I sent it.

92
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
He has clothes and doesn't need it.

93
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Omar is not at home.

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,639
And it is always colder outside the house.

95
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,240
And...

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
tell him that his mother
misses him a lot, too.

97
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,639
Well, the fishing was excellent.

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I have about 80 people interested
in collaborating. They already confirmed.

99
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,879
Most of them are
the parents from this class.

100
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Well, those that actually have something
to contribute, of course.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Wow, Lu, that's a ton of people.

102
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,839
There's not enough space
in the place I rented.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,439
We'll find somewhere else.

104
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,199
But there won't be time tomorrow.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,399
Darling, do you know
who you're talking to?

106
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,639
I love saying that. It sounds so dramatic.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,959
I got you into this mess,
and I'll get you out of it. Okay?

108
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,120
My dad knows
the owner of the Starlight Hotel.

109
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,839
The terrace is beautiful.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
You can count on me.

111
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,319
I forgot how good it feels
when I help the needy.

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,839
And I love parties. So do you.

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,959
I don't want to give you so much work.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,319
Let's talk to your mother
and get her to give us a hand.

115
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,720
No! She doesn't know anything.

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
I didn't want her to interrupt
her travels for me.

117
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,560
This is just a silly thing.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,639
You're so sweet.

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,839
It's a bit much.

120
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,959
It's a bit too much.

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,920
Come on!
Too much to help those in need?

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,560
The more people that come, the better.

123
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,959
And it's going to be
such a great party. Relax.

124
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, guys, how aboutÂ we study together
this afternoon?

125
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,519
Come on, Polo, you will pass
by the skin of your teeth anyway,

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,279
but at least this way,
we can have a laugh.

127
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
-Count me in.
-Ander.

128
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,800
Ander can't.

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,199
Ander is meeting up with Omar,
Ander has to move house.

130
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,600
What now? Are you starting
a ballroom dancing course?

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm meeting my dad.

132
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
Well, shit! That's a new one!

133
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,839
But it's not one of the best.

134
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,720
Let's see if you can work on it a bit.

135
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,759
See you.

136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,679
What the fuck is up with him?

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
-The whole divorce thing.
-No, it's not that.

138
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,559
Lu, can I bother you for a second?

139
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,759
GuzmÃ¡n, you never bother me.
You're not that important.

140
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,679
Just one question. Why did you invite
my parents to that charity dinner?

141
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,279
I still really like them.

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,159
-You should have asked me first.
-I don't have to ask you for permission.

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,840
Under normal circumstances, no.
But now that...

144
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,600
Now that we're not... Listen, I haven't
told them that we're not together.

145
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,399
-You haven't?
-No.

146
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,559
Okay. Why?

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,120
Because they like you, too. They'd be
worried about me. I'd have to explain.

148
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,879
-Now I have no time to talk to anyone.
-Sure.

149
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,519
Is it too late for you to invent an excuse
so that they won't go?

150
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
No.

151
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,440
Let's do something.

152
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,840
You're coming with me
to the charity dinner.

153
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,759
We'll pretend all night long.
And I won't tell the truth.

154
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
-What?
-You heard me.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,679
Since we're going to be together
all night, you'd better dress up.

156
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,840
Suit up, please. No checkered tank tops.

157
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay?

158
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,159
Okay.

159
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,559
Thanks. Really.

160
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,879
My pleasure.

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,519
I told you to put on
a small dinner with strangers

162
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,200
to earn a little bit of money
to pay your bills.

163
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,159
But Lu invited everyone.

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,879
-Even my mothers!
-I know.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,559
-Well, if it's about the money...
-It's not about the money!

166
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,240
-Why would it be about the money?
-You heard it.

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Money, they can spare.

168
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,840
But my mother is a magazine editor
and has told journalists about it.

169
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,639
They're going to cover the event
and take photos.

170
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,480
What if they find out about you?

171
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,759
I'll take the risk.

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,799
Because I don't have any other option.

173
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,159
If my mother doesn't get hired
by any houses around here,

174
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,399
we'll have to leave in a month, maybe two.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
I'll have to leave school.
I'll lose everything.

176
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,679
We're not just talking
about paying some bills here.

177
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,840
-I know.
-This is a lot of money.

178
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,240
-It's illegal.
-That's true.

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,279
But it could also be my future.

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,480
With that kind of money,

181
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,159
I could pay for a caregiver
for my grandfather,

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
I could go to a good university,
do a master's.

183
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,559
It would be just this once,
never again. I swear.

184
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,080
But it would change my life forever.

185
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,559
What can I do?

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,080
Hold my hand and tell me
that everything will be all right.

187
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,559
What's wrong?

188
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,840
It's not from Mom.

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,240
Dad is the one
that always says I'll get cold,

190
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,720
to put his coat on
because mine is useless.

191
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,039
You're right.

192
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,519
Dad asked me to lie and I did it,

193
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,080
because I'm the idiot
that does everything they say.

194
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,360
You know what?

195
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Not anymore.

196
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,759
-They want you to come back, Omar.
-And does that piss you off?

197
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,320
It doesn't matter what you do
to disappoint your parents

198
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,759
or how you make them suffer.

199
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,919
In the end, they forgive you.

200
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,600
So, screw the ones
who obey and make sacrifices.

201
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,000
Nadia, I'm not coming back.

202
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,639
And as for you,
all right, you work in the store,

203
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
but you're still going to school,

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,080
and it's not like
you had much of a social life.

205
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,279
What's the big sacrifice?

206
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,759
Maybe OmarÂ is a bit of a drama queen.

207
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
He's worried about me.

208
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,759
Does he have a reason to be?

209
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't know, Samu.

210
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,200
My mom is acting really weird lately.

211
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,960
If I don't answer my phone once,
I practically get court-martialed.

212
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,480
The chauffeur is my new shadow.
He carries a gun and everything.

213
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
It's like she's scared
someone might do something to me.

214
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,919
Should I tell her you can't do
the delivery tomorrow?

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,039
No.

216
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,039
But tell her it's the last one.

217
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
-Wake up.
-What?

218
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,120
Wake up.

219
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,720
Now...

220
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:57,639
What's up?

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,879
Hey! Where's your dad?

222
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,440
I told him I already had plans
with friends to study.

223
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
No fucking around.
We'll actually be studying.

224
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,320
Order some beer.

225
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,480
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

226
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,600
Pablo! Three beers, please.

227
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
The last time Samuel was seen
was at that charity event at the hotel.

228
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,879
Did you talk to him that night?

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
This is all your fault.

230
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
And your shitty investigation.

231
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
You know that, don't you?

232
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,360
We're just kids.

233
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,039
We play at being adults, but half the time
we don't know what we're doing.

234
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,240
We fall down because we know
that an adult will always pick us back up.

235
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,639
You were the adult in all of this.

236
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,480
And you failed us.

237
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
If you had caught the killer,
none of this would have happened.

238
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,080
You have fucked up all of our lives.

239
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,720
Every one of us!

240
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,559
Everyone is homophobic.
We're brought up that way.

241
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,799
But GuzmÃ¡n is a bit more.

242
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,919
What? Listen to me.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,639
All I said was you could have
at least warned me

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
so I could change the sheets,
motherfuckers.

245
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,960
-Who said we came in the bed?
-There you go. We're not that filthy.

246
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,480
Actually, we are.

247
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,440
We came in the cup you keep on the bedside
table for drinking out of at night.

248
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,399
How funny you are! No worries, we're even.

249
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,279
You wouldn't believe
what I've done in your house.

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,080
-Really?
-Such as?

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,720
Nothing.

252
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,679
But from now on, you'd better watch out.

253
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,759
Okay.

254
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,200
I've missed this.

255
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,840
If that bastard says anything about
you guys again, I'll smash his face in.

256
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,519
Who?

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,279
-Samuel.
-What has he been saying?

258
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,320
-Nothing. A load of bullshit.
-Come on, tell us.

259
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,960
-Are you sure you want to know?
-Yes, I am.

260
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,159
How do I tell you this?

261
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,720
That you killed my sister.

262
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,399
Really?

263
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,120
Couldn't he have made up anything else?

264
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
No, it's not a joke.
The son of a bitch says it seriously.

265
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,399
Fucking hell.

266
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,600
What do you want?

267
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,919
Right.

268
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,519
-Your phone.
-What for?

269
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,679
It's the only way of knowing
that you're not recording me.

270
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,080
It doesn't matter.
I could get a confession from you

271
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,079
saying that you killed Marina
with your own hands,

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,839
and they'd tell me the same shit.

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,359
That you don't fit the profile.

274
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,160
That's the way the world works,
in case you hadn't noticed, you idiot.

275
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,920
Why are you so angry?

276
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,839
-You tricked me.
-You've been tricking me from the start.

277
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,039
-And don't you hate me for that?
-No.

278
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,039
-Anyway, that's it. You won. Congrats.
-No.

279
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,960
-We have both lost.
-What have you lost?

280
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,400
You.

281
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,720
For a moment, I started to believe
something could happen between us.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Something real.

283
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,920
That we could trust one another,

284
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,799
go out to dinner like everyone else,

285
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,640
without having to hide every time.

286
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,759
Although, now and then, we'd stay here

287
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
so you could make me your macaroni.

288
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,599
Which, by the way, is disgusting.

289
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,480
I don't know...

290
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,519
I even thought for a moment
that we could forget about all this shit

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
and that we could have a future.

292
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,440
How stupid of me, huh?

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,599
Good evening. How are you?

294
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
Hey, good evening.

295
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
Are you really going to put on a show
because of GuzmÃ¡n?

296
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,960
After what happened with Nadia?

297
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,960
You said it. It happened.

298
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,440
You can go on holiday
to an exotic location,

299
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,240
but in the end, you always come back home.

300
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,200
Sure.

301
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,119
And GuzmÃ¡n and I...
will always be GuzmÃ¡n and I.

302
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,279
Good night.

303
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
At least put it on silent.

304
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,880
Omar is sleeping.

305
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,400
Poor kid, he only got back an hour ago.

306
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,440
Mom, I'm staying home today.
I have a really bad headache.

307
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,839
He's not answering.

308
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Polo.

309
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,319
-Do you know something about Ander?
-What?

310
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,599
-Do you know something about Ander?
-No idea.

311
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,839
Fucking great.

312
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,319
-Okay, let's see. Ambassador?
-Yes.

313
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
Me?

314
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,400
I talked to them this morning,
and they thought it was a great idea.

315
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
You are making a huge effort.
You deserve it.

316
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
Yes, okay, but you deserve it more.

317
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,119
Me, in the spotlight...

318
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,640
-I'm not good at public speaking.
-Come on!

319
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,279
You're really good at it.

320
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,440
You will have to give a little speech,
the interview and pose for some photos.

321
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,519
You don't mind, do you?

322
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,119
Of course! Let's see now.

323
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,720
But I am sorry
that you won't take any credit.

324
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,279
-You took care of it and...
-It's okay.

325
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,839
Are you sure you don't want
your mom to know?

326
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm sure, okay?
I'm going to finish my homework.

327
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

328
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
I wanted to ask you a huge favor.

329
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,039
I want to surprise my bestie, Cayetana,
and I need her mom's phone number.

330
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,720
Could you help me, please?

331
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,640
I love your glasses! They are wonderful.

332
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,519
-Thanks.
-They look so good on you.

333
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,160
Phone number.

334
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,720
Shit...

335
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,279
Want some?

336
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,039
Better than last time?

337
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,480
That wouldn't be too hard.

338
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,880
Next time, you'll be amazed.

339
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,640
The first thing we do is
remove the determinant from the matrix.

340
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,119
-Nadia...
-But if it's not a square matrix--

341
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,440
-Nadia.
-What?

342
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,279
I'm here.

343
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,680
Hi.

344
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,480
Do I disgust you so much?

345
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,799
Is that question part of the exam?

346
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,119
You can't even look me in the eye.

347
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,640
But you don't mind giving me lessons
as long as I'm still paying you.

348
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,599
I guess
your moral high ground has a price.

349
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,359
But I'm the one that's fucked up.

350
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,359
Lu has always been by my side.

351
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,400
She is everything to me.

352
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,759
-And she feels the same way about--
-Seriously, Valerio. We're here to study.

353
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,799
I don't want to know any more, okay?

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,559
Shit, Ander!

355
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,559
You can't blame someone for how they feel.

356
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,720
I'll be right back. Keep studying.

357
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,279
Sure.

358
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,559
Hi, GuzmÃ¡n. Are you okay?

359
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,920
-Fucking hell...
-What?

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Nadia, don't give me any more
of the "I'm your friend," bullshit,

361
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,160
as if nothing ever happened.
I'm sick of it.

362
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,720
-Excuse me?
-Stop messing with me.

363
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,640
I don't want to mess with you.

364
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,240
Okay, then, try not messing with me
some other time. I have to train.

365
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,039
Okay, you're right.
I used an excuse to come over.

366
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,000
-There...
-But because I want to talk to you.

367
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,799
-Okay.
-GuzmÃ¡n!

368
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,400
I have to go get changed.

369
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,160
Look where I am
for you to take me seriously.

370
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,759
I will die if someone comes in here.

371
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,160
Great, I'm all ears.

372
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,599
I know that we're always on and off--

373
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
You're the one who's on and off.

374
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,680
Yes, of course,
as if you had always been sure.

375
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,599
What are you doing?

376
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,519
You open your heart
and I'll open my shirt.

377
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,839
Stop it, come on. I can't concentrate.

378
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,759
There is nothing new to see down here.

379
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,839
So...

380
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,240
You were saying
we're always on and off. Go on.

381
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,960
Nadia...

382
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,720
If you think leaving Lu and turning up
at your store is not being sure,

383
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,319
tell me, what have you done
to show me that you are?

384
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,240
Apart from coming in here...

385
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,519
I'm trying.

386
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,240
Then try harder.

387
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,559
Shit...

388
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,519
Nadia, this is not a good place
to have sex.

389
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,119
Some people love watching.

390
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,160
-Hey.
-Hi.

391
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,839
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

392
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,279
What? What's wrong?

393
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,559
No, no... I know this silence.

394
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,039
It's the one that comes
before you run away.

395
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,400
No...

396
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Not this time.

397
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,119
Are you sure?

398
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
I am.

399
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,240
And your family?

400
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,559
Compared to my brother and sister,

401
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,400
me being with a Christian isn't that bad.

402
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,440
That's true.

403
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,200
After last night, I feel sick. Don't you?

404
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,599
GuzmÃ¡n doesn't believe Samuel.

405
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,799
The only way to change opinion
is if you keep--

406
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,759
If I keep what?

407
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,680
Feeling like shit every second
and every minute of every day?

408
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,599
-I'm only asking you to--
-I can't!

409
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,240
I can't lie to his face.

410
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,559
All right. Tell him the truth.

411
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,559
Tell him the truth.

412
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
Do you know what the truth is?

413
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,160
You've been lying to him for months.

414
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
Do you think he will forgive you?

415
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,599
You'll be dead to him.

416
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,799
I will end up in prison,
and GuzmÃ¡n will have no friends left.

417
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,079
And for what?

418
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,799
So that you can keep a clear conscience?

419
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,000
Because Samuel's brother doesn't need it.

420
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,559
Right now, he's probably
drinking piÃ±a coladas in the Caribbean.

421
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,640
Ander, look at me.

422
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,599
Hold on.

423
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,400
Hold on a little longer.
Just a little longer.

424
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
All this will pass.

425
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,079
And we will go back to how we were.

426
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
That's what GuzmÃ¡n
has been wanting for months,

427
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,799
for everything to go back to how it was.

428
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,839
Hi.

429
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,039
There it is.

430
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,279
Thank you, handsome.

431
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,599
By the way...

432
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,240
Rebeka already told me.

433
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,000
If you're going to quit working for me
because of that boy from the club,

434
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,759
you have nothing to worry about.

435
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,839
I already talked to him.

436
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,839
I'll leave them here on the bar.

437
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,680
Hey, where's Marcos?
I'm doing everything here by myself.

438
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,000
Haven't you heard?

439
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,640
No... What?

440
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,920
He got beaten up.

441
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,039
They don't know why, and he can't say.
He's still unconscious in the hospital.

442
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,319
Fucking hell. It was Sandra.
Or someone who works for her. I'm sure.

443
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,880
Fucking hell, Samuel.
What if his friends want revenge?

444
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,599
These people know where you live.

445
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,720
I'll call you later.

446
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,079
Shit!

447
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Come on, pick up.
Pick up the phone, damn it!

448
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,440
The number you are calling
is switched off--

449
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,359
Fuck!

450
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,759
Mom!

451
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,960
-What's wrong?
-Shit...

452
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,039
You could have picked up the phone!

453
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,839
Sorry, I didn't realize...

454
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,240
You must have called me
when I was talking to the police.

455
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,319
They rang the buzzer downstairs
and said it was the mailman.

456
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,920
And I looked out the window
and saw some guys that looked like...

457
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,559
Well, as though they gave out beatings,
not letters.

458
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,759
Of course, I didn't let them in,

459
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,559
but they wouldn't leave
until I said I was calling the police.

460
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,680
They came for your brother, I'm sure.

461
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,400
He can't even leave us in peace
when he's a thousand kilometers away.

462
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,000
How was your day?

463
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,519
Samuel?

464
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,359
Samuel, I'm talking to you!

465
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,119
-I'll be back later.
-Later?

466
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll be back later!

467
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,039
Great.

468
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,640
Thank you.

469
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,880
She'll give the speech later.
But leave it centered for later, okay?

470
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
Tell the DJ to keep it smooth.

471
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,440
-Okay. I'll tell him right away.
-Okay. Thanks.

472
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,839
You good?

473
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,000
Good.

474
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,839
Yeah, great.

475
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,799
GuzmÃ¡n went back
to that exotic location today.

476
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,960
Maybe he wants to move there forever.

477
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,319
Dad...

478
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
It's very nice.

479
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,279
What is?

480
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,400
The hijab.

481
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,720
When did you buy it?

482
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,319
It was a gift.

483
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,400
Really? From who?

484
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,960
A friend.

485
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,720
Go down to the shop.
Your mother has to make dinner.

486
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,119
You have to come round for dinner.
We've barely seen you lately.

487
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,400
I know...
The exam period is always complicated.

488
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,079
You know I'm really hardworking.

489
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,240
Well, it's over now.

490
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,680
What are you doing for Christmas?
Come to Asturias!

491
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,559
-Yes, come to Asturias.
-That's right.

492
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,440
All my family is coming from Mexico.

493
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,519
-My brother and my father are here so--
-Lu.

494
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure, darling.

495
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,759
-Yes?
-Please... Thanks.

496
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,160
How he looks after me.

497
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,559
-Hey! Where've you been?
-Hey.

498
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,920
Sorry, man.

499
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,079
I've been running back and forth between
the bathroom and my bed all the morning.

500
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,039
And are you all right now?

501
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,239
Much better.

502
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,320
So...

503
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm glad you came.

504
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,400
So? How is it going?

505
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,880
-Oh, my God...
-What?

506
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,679
-It's unbelievable.
-Is it going well?

507
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,840
How are you doing?

508
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,760
And how is the fundraising going?

509
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,800
Better than I could have ever dreamed.

510
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,800
It's going well.
Are you having a good time?

511
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,639
We are. It's very admirable,
what you're doing.

512
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,920
It's much more than that. It's amazing,
how she's managed all this...

513
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
Hello?

514
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,480
Yes?

515
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:00,639
Hello, this morning
I received a call from this number.

516
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,719
Yes? I don't know, who's speaking?

517
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,639
Victoria.

518
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,239
Well, I work in domestic service.

519
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,239
Maybe someone gave you my number

520
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,599
because you wanted me
to clean your house or something or...

521
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,599
What?

522
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,280
Are you Cayetana's mother?

523
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,920
Lu! Shit... What's going on?
Have you seen a ghost?

524
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,559
Come with me.

525
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,079
How could I not have figured this out?

526
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,000
She has thousands of followers
on Instagram! How did she...

527
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,199
The Burberry she brought the other day
was a dupe?

528
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
She must have bought them.

529
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,119
With what money?
She's the fucking cleaner's daughter.

530
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,079
Fucking hell...

531
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,119
Lu...

532
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,880
What account are the guests' donations
being paid into?

533
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,039
Holy cow.

534
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,480
All these people are here because of me.

535
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,920
Not because of her.
I'll teach her what I'm capable of...

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
-Fucking bitch.
-Listen to me. Don't.

537
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,440
Listen. Don't make a scene.
It'd be a scandal and not just for her.

538
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,559
Calm down, wait till the party is over.

539
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,280
Tomorrow you can discreetly see
how people can get their money back.

540
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,639
For now, you need
to keep up appearances, okay?

541
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,119
I'd forgotten what it felt like
to have you worry about me.

542
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,679
Let's go.

543
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,559
-Where are you going?
-Fuck's sake.

544
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm on the list.

545
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,639
Come on... You invited him?

546
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,320
Me? Why?

547
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,480
I know what's going on
between you guys, Carla.

548
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,360
Do you really think I'm so naÃ¯ve?

549
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,719
I don't know, ask your friend Cayetana.

550
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,559
-You're not on the list.
-I must be. I know Cayetana Grajera.

551
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,480
What are you doing?

552
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,519
-What's he doing here?
-You tell me.

553
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,559
Tell him to leave. I'm sick of him!

554
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,599
Did you know
he's been talking shit to GuzmÃ¡n?

555
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,039
And now he suspects us!

556
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,280
He's doing what?

557
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,800
Carla?

558
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,079
Carla...

559
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,960
-He's with me. Don't worry.
-Shit!

560
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,559
What are you doing here?
You have to leave now.

561
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,559
Where's Rebeka?

562
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,079
Leave right now. I'm asking you, please.

563
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,119
"Please"? And why are you so concerned?

564
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,039
Samuel...

565
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,760
So what?
This whole thing is for poor children?

566
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm the one at risk all the time.

567
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
Okay, yes, I did tell her about it.

568
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,239
Because I wanted her to swear on her life
that nothing would happen to you.

569
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,280
And that guy ended up in hospital
because of you.

570
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,599
You've been watching too many movies.

571
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,519
Now you're the one who doesn't want
to see what's right under your nose.

572
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,199
What do we care that the guy got
a good beating? Maybe he deserved it.

573
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,559
He'll want to pay us back in kind.

574
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,280
And I don't have bodyguards,
a bulletproof car or a security system.

575
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,599
You said
there was no danger in all of this!

576
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,639
If something happens
to my mother, to Omar or to me...

577
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,480
-What?
-It all will be your fault!

578
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,280
Azucena, where's the inspector?
I need to talk to her.

579
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,760
-They have arrested someone, Omar.
-Who?

580
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,280
Polo, it's all done.

581
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,960
I've got enough for everything.

582
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,280
This is crazy!

583
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm happy for you.

584
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,159
-So happy.
-Cayetana.

585
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:27,599
Can we finish this now?

586
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,199
This has been a huge success.

587
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,639
I couldn't have done it without you.
Oh, my God!

588
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,280
Stop saying that, please.

589
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,000
-I'm being serious, I love you!
-Excuse me.

590
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,800
Weren't you going to give a speech, Lu?

591
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,039
-Only if you want.
-No...

592
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,760
Come on, girl, if you promised,
don't snub Cayetana.

593
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,400
I don't have anything prepared.

594
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,679
It'll be my pleasure.

595
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,679
Hello?

596
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,400
Good evening.

597
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,559
Well...

598
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:12,400
Thank you sincerely
for being here tonight.

599
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,440
Thank you for your kindness,
from the bottom of my heart.

600
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,280
It's hard to believe that there are still
good people in the world who we can trust.

601
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,239
And thank you especially
to a wonderful woman...

602
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,159
A generous and very special friend.

603
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:31,119
Cayetana, please, let's give her a hand.

604
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,119
No, no... Please, don't.

605
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,360
Thank you.

606
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,199
And a fucking liar.

607
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,960
Does this NGO even exist?

608
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,679
It must be as false as your stories
about trips around the world...

609
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,519
Your house.

610
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,239
Your friendship.

611
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,880
Your Ralph Lauren dress.
I don't know who you stole that from.

612
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,679
-Lu, please--
-And your followers on Instagram.

613
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
Your whole life is a fucking lie.

614
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,679
Yes, Cayetana is the daughter
of a house cleaner.

615
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,719
I really believed her.

616
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,519
Well done.

617
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,400
Unbelievable.

618
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,159
It was all a big lie.

619
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:35,639
Don't worry, she'll give you
your money back, I'll make sure of that.

620
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,719
Great night. I'm sick of it.
Sick of pretending.

621
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,079
Putting on a fake smile all night long,

622
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,840
pretending that everything was all right.

623
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,239
But nothing is all right.

624
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,760
Especially with GuzmÃ¡n.

625
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,679
We are finished.

626
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,079
I'm sorry, Laura. I really tried.

627
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,159
But it didn't work out.

628
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,159
It was too hard.

629
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,679
Because your sweet boy
cheated on me with a Bedouin girl.

630
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,320
Yes, he cheated on me. Can you believe it?

631
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,760
I don't know how I do it,
but I always end up betrayed

632
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:40,719
and disappointed by the very people
that I have fully supported. Right, Carla?

633
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,159
But I'm done.

634
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,400
You are all mistaken if you think...

635
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,239
you can take me for a fool
and get away with it.

636
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:58,960
Because that won't happen.

637
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,519
So now I want to toast

638
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:04,000
to this wonderful night.

639
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,480
Carla is fucking Samuel.

640
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,440
What?

641
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,400
Cheers.

642
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,519
Don't be long. Go to bed soon.

643
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,719
Dad...

644
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,480
Yes, my dear?

645
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,639
I didn't tell you the truth earlier.

646
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:01,559
What?

647
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,199
The hijab.

648
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,480
It's not from a friend.

649
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,519
And I want to be honest with you.

650
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,920
I don't want to hide anything.
I don't want to have to hide.

651
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,119
What are you talking about?

652
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
This hijab...

653
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,519
HEY DARLING, IT'S LU.
THIS MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU.

654
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:24,239
What's going on, Nadia?

655
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,360
Nothing, Dad. Nothing.

656
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,880
Good night.

657
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,119
What do you mean, "nothing"?

658
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,559
Don't be long. Go to bed soon.

659
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,280
IT'S POSTED ON THE INTERNET.

660
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,039
THE WHOLE SCHOOL WILL HAVE SEEN IT BY NOW.

661
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,800
Are you leaving?

662
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,599
Yes, there's not much to do here anymore.

663
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,280
I'm sorry. What a mess.

664
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Don't worry. I knew this would happen.

665
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,360
The truth always comes out
in the end, right?

666
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,079
Let's go.

667
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,360
Ander.

668
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,039
What?

669
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,440
Look me in the eye.

670
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:35,559
What?

671
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:39,679
Did Polo kill Marina?

672
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,159
What are you saying?

673
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,840
Ander, for crying out loud, look me
in the eye and answer this question.

674
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,480
Did Polo kill Marina?

675
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:08,639
No.

676
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Of course not.

677
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,320
Shit, okay.

678
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,239
I'm sorry.

679
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,400
Fucking hell...

680
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,320
Sorry, man.
Please, don't think I'm crazy.

681
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,360
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I had to ask. I couldn't help it anymore.

682
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,719
Please, don't tell Polo about this.

683
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,039
Can I trust you?

684
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:47,079
Of course.

685
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,880
Well...

686
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,039
Pick up...

687
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,960
Samuel, pick up.

688
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,199
Fuck.

689
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,480
