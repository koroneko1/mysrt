‎ ‎I don't call the shots!

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.460
‎You're the superhero
‎who captures the akumas.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.100
‎I'm just the cunning,
‎ultra-charming Cat Noir!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.020
‎Right. You have it easy!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.580
‎Easy? That's 'cause I make it look easy!

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.300
‎As cunning as you might be,
‎that prank you pulled

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.980
‎almost made my Lucky Charm fail!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.700
‎Do you know why Master Fu gave you
‎the ladybug Miraculous instead of me?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.260
‎Because it requires someone
‎with a sense of responsibility?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.220
‎No. Because you don't have
‎a sense of humor!

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.180
‎Pff! Whatever!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.980
‎Look, it's no big deal.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.620
‎You have so many other great qualities!

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.060
‎I'm just in charge of humor!

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.020
‎You'd better get going before
‎you lose your clown costume!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.740
‎Miss you already, Bugaboo!

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.500
‎-Don't call me--
‎-See? I was right!

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.540
‎Don't you want to be a model any more?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.900
‎Yeah, but no one will ever pick me.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.300
‎Did you discuss things with Marinette?

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.860
‎I don't want to bother her.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.980
‎You're really pretty, Jul.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.620
‎I'm sure she'd love
‎to have you as her model.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.580
‎You've got to follow your dreams in life.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.980
‎Don't let them pass you by!

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.940
‎You were made for this. Go for it!

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.300
‎Mrs. Mendeleiev wasn't in today.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.260
‎What should we do?
‎We're out an hour early.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.380
‎We should use this extra time
‎to make that video

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.620
‎for Marinette's soon-to-be-website!

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
‎-Yeah!
‎-Good idea!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.860
‎Remember I asked you guys to think about

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.740
‎modeling Marinette's designs? Any takers?

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.860
‎I... I'd like to do it!

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980
‎Juleka?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.220
‎ ‎I've never seen
‎the top half of your face before!

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.700
‎ ‎It really suits you!

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.300
‎Oh, it's just a barrette. I just...

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.220
‎-We've got our model!

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.900
‎Hey!
‎We're gonna need a technical director.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.460
‎Someone who knows his way
‎around fashion shoots...

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.660
‎Don't even think about it!
‎If he's in my house, in my room,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.380
‎I'll be a complete mess!

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.460
‎No, you won't! You'll be in your element.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.860
‎It's the perfect chance
‎for you to get close.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.860
‎No, I... Alya no!

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.020
‎Could you help out with a fashion shoot?

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.540
‎I'd love to Alya,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.660
‎but I have to get home,
‎or else my father...

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.980
‎I know, but you were supposed to be
‎in Mrs Mendeleiev's class,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.220
‎and since she's not here,
‎you don't have to be home

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.900
‎for an entire hour.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.460
‎Your dad won't know any different.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.900
‎She's got a point!

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.940
‎Oh! OK, then!

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.140
‎Oh, no!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.460
‎This is totally your chance
‎to ask him to the movies!

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500
‎Alix, could you shine the light
‎on Juleka's shoulders, please?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.540
‎I want her to stand out.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.980
‎Does that work for you, Marinette?

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.220
‎Huh? Uh... sure. You're perfect!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.780
‎-I mean... it's perfect!
‎-This one.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.220
‎It'll complement the suit.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.020
‎I thought the same thing, Madrien!

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.220
‎Adrien!

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.420
‎How about a smile for the camera, Juleka?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.740
‎Uh, I don't think
‎this is such a good idea, you guys.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.060
‎Is something wrong?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.740
‎It was really cool of you
‎to agree to be my model,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.300
‎but I can tell
‎you're not comfortable about it.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.620
‎Decide fast. We've less than an hour
‎before Adrien must go.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
‎That's OK, maybe we can do it
‎some other day, if my father lets me.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.980
‎Would you prefer
‎if someone stand in for you?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.500
‎This is something I should do myself.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.860
‎These are my designs and--

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.020
‎Of course! Awesome idea, Marinette!

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.780
‎The coolest thing about your designs
‎is they work well with guys and girls.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.980
‎A guy, a girl... same suits...

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.860
‎What do you think, Adrien? Are you in?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.060
‎If it helps.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.820
‎See? This is gonna be awesome!
‎Give Marinette your suit.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.780
‎Marinette, grab a suit for Adrien!

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.500
‎Here are your accessories,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.460
‎created by the one and only
‎Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.260
‎Just bought you some extra time
‎to ask him out!

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.780
‎-You're welcome!

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.500
‎ I...

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.060
‎-Don't do that, Marinette!
‎-It won't be for long, Tikki.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.860
‎Besides, you'll hold on to them for me.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.180
‎-I hope you're kidding!
‎-It won't be for long, Plagg.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.220
‎Besides, you'll be nearby.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.300
‎Oh!

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.060
‎-Whoa!
‎-You look so beautiful!

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.540
‎-It's uber-perfect!
‎-Looks like we're ready!

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.380
‎-Are you OK, Marinette?
‎-Yeah, he's too hot!

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.820
‎I mean, I'm overheating in here,
‎aren't you?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.100
‎OK! Change of plan.
‎We're gonna take the shoot outside!

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.380
‎-‎ Come on, let's go!

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.540
‎-New environment!

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.940
‎It'll be easier to breathe outside.
‎You can do it!

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.420
‎-What's the matter, Juleka?
‎-I... I'd rather not come.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.780
‎-What? Why not?
‎-Nothing, I...

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860
‎-I'll stay with you.
‎-No, don't worry. Please, go.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.820
‎-Tired and need to study and...
‎-Are you sure?

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.060
‎Girls! We've only got 30 minutes left!

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.980
‎OK, then, make yourself at home.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.540
‎See you in a bit!

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.340
‎I was so lame!

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.340
‎I ruined everything! As usual...

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.620
‎Yet again, my young prey fails
‎to be the centre of attention.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.980
‎Nathalie, I need Mayura

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.540
‎to give this negative
‎emotion a new dimension.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.980
‎Duusuu, spread my feathers!

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.340
‎Fly away, little akuma, and evilise her!

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.580
‎Fly away, beautiful amok,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.380
‎and enhance and hone that frustration!

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.460
‎To the Eiffel Tower, please!

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.820
‎-Thanks for fetching us!

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.860
‎We've got a little time
‎before school's officially over.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.220
‎I'm doing this to help my friends out.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500
‎ ‎Please!

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.420
‎Reflekta, I am Hawk Moth.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.340
‎I'm giving you the power to make
‎people look just like you again,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.460
‎so that everyone will notice you.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.140
‎Reflekta, I am Mayura.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.340
‎To help you succeed,
‎you'll be assisted by Reflekdoll.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.420
‎She'll be entirely under your control.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.980
‎And in return, of course,

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.260
‎you must get hold of Ladybug
‎and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.940
‎Hawk Moth, Mayura,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.540
‎you can count on me.
‎I will succeed this time!

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.620
‎ ‎What's that?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.620
‎ ‎Ha!

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.260
‎Ha!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.580
‎-Don't leave, my friends!

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.420
‎You're the very people
‎I've been looking for!

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.660
‎I've got something special for your video!

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.300
‎I'll show you what it feels like to be me!

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.380
‎I'm sorry.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.580
‎I should have stayed with you!

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.420
‎Juleka is no more. I am Reflekta!

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.620
‎Everyone always forgets about
‎Juleka anyway!

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.740
‎Tikki... spots on!

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.700
‎Tikki... oh, no!

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.220
‎Plagg, claws out! Plagg?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.100
‎This is our lucky day, Sugarcube.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.420
‎A miracle in the making!

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.140
‎Now we can enjoy a nice aged snack

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.180
‎while we wait for them
‎to finish their film!

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.340
‎Ew!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.780
‎Huh?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.300
‎-Hide in the car!
‎-What about you?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.660
‎I'll, uh...

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.500
‎Marinette! You stole my limelight!

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.540
‎I was supposed to be the star of the film!

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.940
‎But you told me you didn't want to be!

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.740
‎You didn't let me explain!

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.740
‎Perhaps you'll understand me better
‎now that you're in my shoes!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.340
‎Nobody can escape me!

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.700
‎Oh, no! This is terrible, Plagg!

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.660
‎How are we going to find our owners?

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.260
‎Everybody looks exactly the same!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.540
‎We have to find the Miraculouses first!

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.140
‎Paris is doomed
‎without Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.300
‎Got it!

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.220
‎Stay focused, Sugarcube!
‎Everything will be all right!

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.420
‎Rose! Where are you, my BFF?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.420
‎Come to me. We'll be like
‎twin sisters for ever and ever!

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.980
‎-There you are!

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.380
‎Cat Noir! Cat Noir!

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.820
‎Cat Noir!

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.260
‎ Plagg?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.500
‎You're not...

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.540
‎What are you doing here?
‎Has Cat Noir lost his Miraculous?

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.020
‎Have you seen Tikki?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.780
‎It's a long story, Marinette.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.660
‎Whatever! There's no time!

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.420
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.260
‎Yes!

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.980
‎ ‎Plagg! Plagg!

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.500
‎Marinette!

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.940
‎- ‎Plagg! Plagg!
‎-You are Cat Noir, correct?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.660
‎And that over there is... Ladybug?

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.580
‎There's been a little mix-up.
‎I'm Tikki, pleased to meet you!

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.100
‎Well, Tikki, spots on!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.460
‎Well, Milady Noire, looks like
‎you'll play the easy part today!

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.100
‎Not so sure about that!

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.500
‎Looks like we'll be taking on
‎two opponents, with each other's powers!

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.420
‎Stay focused, Mr. Bug!
‎Use the yo-yo as a shield!

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.220
‎Ow!

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.300
‎They've swapped their Miraculouses!

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.540
‎And they're struggling with their powers!

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.220
‎Make the most of it, Reflekta!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.140
‎Their Miraculouses are within your reach!

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.020
‎Yes, Hawk Moth!

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.980
‎Just my luck.
‎I'll have to capture two akumas!

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.180
‎No! One akuma and one amok!

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.340
‎Reflekta's been reakumatised,
‎but that giant doll is a Sentimonster,

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.940
‎created by the Peacock Miraculous!

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.700
‎OK, so we have to find
‎the akumatised object and the amok!

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.460
‎Can you manage or should we switch back?

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.780
‎I'm totally capable of doing it!

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.020
‎-I just need to use my Lucky--
‎-No, wait!

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.060
‎-Why did you do that?
‎-It's too early!

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.540
‎-You don't know enough about her!
‎-Watch out!

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.420
‎It's Reflekta controlling a giant doll!

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.220
‎But you don't know
‎where the akuma and amok are!

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.180
‎The akuma's probably
‎in the same place as before,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.380
‎in her bracelet!

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.020
‎Maybe. We're gonna have to check that!

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.940
‎ ‎If I could just get my hands
‎on a mirror,

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.660
‎I could reflect her beam back at her!

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.180
‎That's not how it works.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.860
‎-The Lucky Charm

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.180
‎doesn't give you what you want!

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.700
‎We'll see about that! Watch and learn!

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.300
‎Lucky Charm!

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.420
‎-A mirror?
‎-Beginner's luck!

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.100
‎You're just jealous of my mastery,
‎that's all!

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.860
‎-Very effective, Mr. Bug!
‎-But I thought...

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.740
‎The Lucky Charm doesn't just give you
‎an object to defeat the villain with.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.340
‎You have to figure out exactly
‎how to use it to win the battle!

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.020
‎Using your head!

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420
‎Now that you've used up your Lucky Charm,

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.740
‎you've only got a few minutes left

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.780
‎before you transform back, Bugaboy!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.820
‎Why don't you try helping me
‎instead of making fun of me?

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.140
‎Doesn't Bugaboy have a sense of humor?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.380
‎ ‎Sounds like you're wearing
‎the clown costume now!

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.220
‎You bet! I am the cunning,
‎funny and ultra-charming Lady Noire!

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.340
‎Watch and learn!

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.340
‎Cataclysm!

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.460
‎-What's happening?
‎-You think that's normal?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.260
‎Dunno. I've never cataclysmed
‎a Sentimonster before.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.500
‎It's as if the cataclysm
‎was like a bee sting on a bull.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.060
‎It riled it up
‎without actually wounding it!

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.580
‎We don't have much time
‎before we transform back.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.420
‎We still don't know where the amok is.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.260
‎ ‎No, Reflekdoll! Stop!

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.740
‎She-Cat Noir, Bug Boy, help me!

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.700
‎So, you like playing with dolls?

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.500
‎Hey! You stole my line!

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.100
‎-Should I retrieve the amok?
‎-No, definitely not.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.300
‎Chaos can prove a good ally.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.980
‎These costumes look ridiculous on you!

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.900
‎I'm going to redo your wardrobe!

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.340
‎You could at least
‎show a bit of gratitude!

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.220
‎Besides, I think we look
‎pretty good in these costumes!

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.180
‎Don't forget to capture the akuma!

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.740
‎I've always wanted to do this!

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.940
‎Playtime's over, little akuma.
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.300
‎Gotcha!

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.740
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.660
‎Oh, well, whatever.
‎I'll just fix everything back up anyway!

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.300
‎-Mira--
‎-Let's stop Reflekdoll from destroying

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.260
‎anything else
‎before we go around repairing everything.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.580
‎OK, I admit it.
‎It's not easy being a super ladybug!

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.100
‎And I admit that I like
‎wearing your costume.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.260
‎It's a lot lighter on the shoulders!

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.380
‎I could never do this without you.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.380
‎Reflekta was controlling
‎the doll from inside its eye.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.380
‎We'll have to find the object
‎containing the amok.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.220
‎But how can we do that
‎without getting hit by its beam?

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.780
‎Why don't we just figure out
‎how to use this mirror?

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.420
‎You're a simple, straightforward guy.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.980
‎Thanks for the "simple" part!

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.500
‎While I always tend to come up
‎with convoluted plans.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.340
‎Not to say "surreal!"

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.580
‎Of course! Simple and straightforward!

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.780
‎See that panel on the back of its head?

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.300
‎That's how we're gonna get in!

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.420
‎-And all we need is a--
‎-A screwdriver!

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.860
‎-Or a coin!
‎-That's right!

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.980
‎-Or something big and round like a coin!
‎-Mmm-hmm.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.140
‎I'd have just asked
‎for a huge coin if I'd known!

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.460
‎Sure, but you can never know in advance.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.100
‎-The stick shift is a hairclip!
‎-You're the best, milady!

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.620
‎Time to de-evilise! Gotcha!

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.100
‎Bye-bye, little feather!

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.140
‎Miraculous... Mister Bug!

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.500
‎ ‎Pound it!

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.500
‎ ‎We failed yet again!

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.420
‎But there are two of us now.
‎We're much stronger.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.180
‎And we will win in the end.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.540
‎Duusuu, fall my feathers!

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.140
‎Nooroo, dark wings fall.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.460
‎-Yahoo! That was awesome!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.820
‎No, it wasn't awesome at all!

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.860
‎Are you OK, Miss Nathalie?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.020
‎Everything's fine. She's just tired.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.540
‎-Yahoo!
‎-Nathalie needs peace and quiet.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.300
‎Duusuu, let her rest.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.820
‎Yes, of course! Sorry.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.620
‎Honestly, I understand why you never have
‎any time to make jokes.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.300
‎We both have our roles, huh, Bugaboy?

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.860
‎Spots off!

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.820
‎See you again soon, Tikki!

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.300
‎Goodbye, Adrien.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.740
‎Claws in!

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.900
‎Bye-bye, Plagg. That was really awesome!

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.220
‎Sure was! No better way to escape

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.020
‎the boredom of daily life!

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.140
‎You can count on me, Plagg.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.100
‎I'll never take off my Miraculous again.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.660
‎I'm not cut out to be Ladybug,
‎that's for sure!

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.340
‎I was so afraid I'd lost you forever.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.140
‎I'm so happy to have you back!

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.540
‎Girls!

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.780
‎-Are you OK?
‎-I'm so sorry, Juleka.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.700
‎I should've realized
‎how important this was for you.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.340
‎Do you wanna give it another try?

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.940
‎Yeah, totally. Awesome!

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.940
‎Do you still have any time left, Adrien?

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.300
‎It's important!

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.260
‎ ‎Please!

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.300
‎ ‎Yeah!
