1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Thanks for dropping us off.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,420
What about you?

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,860
Do you want me to say it that much?

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,600
I want it…

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,560
this way.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,200
I will do everything for you to forgive me.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,620
I really like you.

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,920
Let's talk about that later.

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,700
Techno!

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,620
Give me more time, Kla.

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,180
How come you're here?

12
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,260
Thanks for dropping me off.

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,300
Why are you still here?

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,180
I told you.

15
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,360
I don't want just a simple “thank you.”

16
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,520
What do you want?

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,700
Hit on you.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,160
Why are you still here?

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,120
I told you.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,760
I don't want just a simple “thank you.”

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,680
This time, I won't let you kiss me.

22
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,320
Now I know.

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,440
You're teasing me.

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,520
I’m not.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,120
Well...

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,280
What do you want?

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Hit on you.

Where is it?

49
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,940
Can, what are you finding?

50
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,760
When did I lose it?

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,480
It’s not here.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,520
What’s wrong with you?

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
I’m so dead.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,720
What? Are you going to die soon?

55
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,320
My only property.

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,480
I don’t think you have to worry about that.

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
You’ve got nothing.

58
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Job!

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,200
I do! It’s my phone!

60
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,420
But right now, I don’t know where it is

61
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,580
I couldn’t find it in my bag either!

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,060
I haven't completed making all the payments with my mom.

63
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,760
How can I play games now?

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
Have you tried to call your phone yet?

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,440
You’re so smart.

66
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,600
Someone picks up.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,220
What is she saying?

68
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,660
She says…

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Sorry, there is no acknowledgment from your requested number.

70
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,940
Just let it go

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
If your phone is turned off like this,

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
then someone probably stole it already.

73
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,380
Job!

74
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,220
Calm down.

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,100
I’m thinking of a way to help you now.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Can you remember where you've been today?

77
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,200
I still used it when I came out of the house.

78
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,440
And then…

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,840
Tin!

80
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,680
I’m going to the international college building now.

81
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,120
Hey!

82
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,400
Can!

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
What about your bag?

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,940
I have to keep it for him, right?

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,700
Why there’re so many things?

86
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,100
Excuse me.

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,900
Do you know Tin?

88
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,560
He’s tall.

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,920
Do you know Tin?

90
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,000
He has fair skin

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,140
and tall.

92
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,260
Hey guys.

93
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,540
Do you know Tin?

94
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,260
He’s tall and he walks like this.

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,740
You don’t know him?

96
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,240
He’s fair-skinned and tall.

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,680
His eyes are like this.

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,020
He’s quite arrogant.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,540
He has class in this building.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,520
He’s very tall and fair-skinned.

101
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,940
Why can’t you guys help me?

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,980
Excuse me.

103
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,580
Do you know a guy named Tin?

104
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,680
He’s tall, handsome, and arrogant. Is that right?

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
You know him?

106
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,860
Of course.

107
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,880
Where is he now?

108
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,280
We don’t know.

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
Don’t be sad.

110
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,700
I’ll ask someone in the group chat.

111
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,440
What group chat?

112
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,020
A handsome guy like him definitely has a fan club group.

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
Fan club.

114
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,860
He left already.

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,240
That means I won’t see him today.

116
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,560
Don’t be sad.

117
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,620
He has class in the afternoon.

118
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,920
He’ll come back.

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,340
You’re the cutest!

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,500
Thank you so much!

121
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,520
He’s so cute!

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Where is he?

123
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,580
I should have asked for his number.

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,660
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,140
Tin!

126
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,380
Clumsy.

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Where were you?

128
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,220
Do you know that I’ve been looking for you?

129
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,060
I waited for so long. They said you will come back in the afternoon.

130
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,800
Do you know what time is it now? It’s already 3 PM.

131
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,780
You were looking for me?

132
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,560
Why are you smiling?

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,720
♪I don't know what this feeling is♪

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,980
Dirty.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,700
What’s wrong with you?

136
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,760
I’m not dirty.

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
I take a shower every day.

138
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,800
But…

139
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,680
I’m just not that clean.

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,000
See?

141
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,880
I’m clean now.

142
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,140
Why were you looking for me?

143
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,460
Oh right!

144
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,520
Have you seen my phone?

145
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,300
Your phone.

146
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,300
Huh?

147
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,540
You forgot it in my car.

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,320
I didn’t see it.

149
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,360
It dropped when I opened the door.

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,900
It just dropped from the car.

151
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,060
How come it looks badly damaged?

152
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,000
It was crushed by a ten-wheeled truck.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,040
A ten-wheeled truck!

154
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,920
My son…

155
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,020
I never thought you'd leave so soon.

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,040
I never thought that we’d spent only eight months,

157
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
ten days, and twenty-eight hours together.

158
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,660
There’re only twenty-four hours in a day.

159
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,640
Be quiet!

160
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,720
For you.

161
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,760
Don’t bother me!

162
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,400
I’m in mourning for my son.

163
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,980
This is for you.

164
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,580
A new phone.

165
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,480
I bought it for you.

166
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,020
Tin!

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,700
I told you before.

168
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,720
You can’t buy me with money.

169
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,660
Just keep it.

170
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,960
I don’t want it.

171
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,100
Can!

172
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,620
Wait!

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,180
Can.

174
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,760
Wait.

175
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,780
Can.

176
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,100
Can.

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,020
What did I do wrong?

178
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,780
Let me go.

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,820
No.

180
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,740
We need to talk.

181
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,000
I don’t want to talk to a guy who throws money at other people.

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,040
When did I do that to you?

183
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,040
You just bought me a new phone.

184
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,260
That’s how you solve the problem?

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,420
Huh?

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,880
Are you not going to say sorry to me at all?

187
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,200
Do you think money can solve every problem?

188
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,680
I want to repay for what I did.

189
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
I don’t want it.

190
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
I broke your phone,

191
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,180
so I have to repay you with a new one.

192
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,440
But you didn't mean to drop it.

193
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,160
I don’t know how you’re raised.

194
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,260
But all I want from you is to say sorry.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,260
You can’t say that?

196
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,340
Just say sorry!

197
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,240
Just that?

198
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes.

199
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,360
That’s all.

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,460
Sorry.

201
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,100
Say it again.

202
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,820
I’m sorry.

203
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,720
That’s it.

204
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,220
Keep in mind that

205
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,360
if you do something wrong, you have to say sorry.

206
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,500
That’s what my mom taught me.

207
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,300
I forgive you

208
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,780
for breaking my phone

209
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,760
and throwing money at me.

210
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,560
I didn’t mean to do that.

211
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,800
But you bought…

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,740
I just want your number.

213
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,280
I want your phone number.

214
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,240
So, I broke your phone.

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
Your new phone already has my number.

216
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,840
As for your new number,

217
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,000
I already saved it.

218
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,160
Did you buy me a new phone

219
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,120
just because of that?

220
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,880
I told you.

221
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,520
What did you tell me?

222
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,900
I can’t remember.

223
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,820
I’m stupid.

224
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,880
Can you tell me again?

225
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,980
I will hit on you.

226
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,800
That’s why I want your number.

227
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,220
An arrogant guy like you

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,740
bought me a phone

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,980
because you want my number?

230
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,460
That’s the only way I can think of.

231
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Fine.

232
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,680
I’ll take it.

233
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,500
Are you giving it to me or not?

234
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,360
Give it to me.

235
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,580
But

236
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,760
I'll pay you back.

237
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,460
I don’t want to owe you anything.

238
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,980
Why are you smiling?

239
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,600
Let’s go back inside the café.

240
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,260
I haven’t finished my iced cocoa.

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
Why is he not picking up?

242
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,920
Let me have some.

243
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,040
Bro,

244
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,400
you can eat it but don’t steal the code.

245
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,320
It's under the tray.

246
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,180
I won’t.

247
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,680
What’s the matter?

248
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,900
Why you serious?

249
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,920
Can won’t pick up the phone.

250
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,580
Oh!

251
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,560
Can just changed his phone.

252
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,200
Oh!

253
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,520
That’s right.

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,920
He told me that he wanted to change a new phone.

255
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,200
But he doesn’t have enough money.

256
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,020
He has enough money now?

257
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,140
And why did he have to change his number too?

258
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,720
You're right.

259
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,400
Maybe someone bought him a new phone.

260
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,100
Just like me.

261
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,300
I just bought a new phone for that pretty nurse.

262
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,180
Okay…

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,900
Techno!

264
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,560
About that conversation.

265
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,940
Who’s the guy that wants you again?

266
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,460
We're talking about Can.

267
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,140
How come it's about me now?

268
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,820
Come on.

269
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,180
You have to tell me about this.

270
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,800
Tell me now.

271
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,920
I can’t talk.

272
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,720
I’m chewing.

273
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,440
I can’t talk right now.

274
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Damn.

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,960
Why can’t he share his secret with me?

276
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,000
Damn, I ran out of items in the game.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,860
But I can redeem code and claim it right now.

278
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,300
Can.

279
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,040
Why are you here so early?

280
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,880
Techno.

281
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,620
What?

282
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,720
Help me.

283
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,240
What is it?

284
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
I can’t figure it out.

285
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,140
I’m serious. The nurse that I met has such fair skin.

286
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,640
Job

287
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,820
Her eyes are so big like she’s wearing big-eye contact lenses.

288
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,260
Champ, don’t just listen to him. Look at me here.

289
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,160
Can!

290
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,380
The reason I join the team because she likes an athlete.

291
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,360
Dude, look at me.

292
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,640
Help me first.

293
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,480
I’m dying.

294
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,320
What’s wrong with you?

295
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
Techno.

296
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,700
What?

297
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,000
What if someone hits on you?

298
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,500
What are you going to do?

299
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,700
How am I supposed to know?

300
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,820
He never hits on me.

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,720
Before I realized that, we already did it.

302
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,020
Dude,

303
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,280
I saw a guy from the English program.

304
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,260
He’s waiting at the entrance.

305
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,300
Who is he?

306
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,960
I don’t know.

307
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,820
But I know he’s from the English program.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
He seems arrogant.

309
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,800
He’s fair-skinned.

310
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,040
He doesn’t talk to anyone.

311
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,100
Can!

312
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,860
Why is he in such a hurry?

313
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,060
Wait a minute, bro.

314
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,720
Huh?

315
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,880
Who did you...

316
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
sleep with again?

317
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,080
Something fishy.

318
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,420
Well...

319
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,300
I think...

320
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,900
It’s time to practice now. I’ll go get changed.

321
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,540
See you!

322
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,180
Techno, why are you running away?

323
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,700
Since when did he become like this?

324
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,260
That was quick.

325
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,720
Let’s go to practice.

326
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's go.

327
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,060
What are you doing here?

328
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,660
I’m here to score some points.

329
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,640
What points?

330
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,580
Football?

331
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,380
But you don't play football.

332
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,360
I know!

333
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,140
You’re here to score points with my captain.

334
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,540
Our team is full already.

335
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,980
We don’t want more member.

336
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,000
You know what I mean.

337
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,160
I don’t know.

338
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,080
I'm stupid. I don’t understand what you mean.

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,920
You’re blushing.

340
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,540
Who’s blushing?

341
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,080
I’m not shy at all.

342
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,800
If you say so.

343
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,860
I bought this for you.

344
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,580
I know

345
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,280
that money can’t buy you.

346
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
But this is just snacks.

347
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,200
You can accept it, right?

348
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,340
If just snacks…

349
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,160
They all look so yummy!

350
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,040
Look at this.

351
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,220
Lucky me.

352
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,040
Can.

353
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,180
Your payment.

354
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,400
I told you already.

355
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,720
I’m here to score points with you.

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,860
He kissed me again!

357
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,700
And why is my heart beating so fast?

358
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,600
But this looks yummy!

359
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,880
Look at this!

360
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,920
Which one should I eat first?

361
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,680
There're so many things.

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,180
I choose everything by myself.

363
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,700
I hope that you will like it, Techno.

364
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,580
If you like hot and spicy, then eat Bento.

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,620
But if you like it mild, then drink Jele Vita Bead.

366
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,500
I miss you.

367
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,820
I know that you don’t want to see me right now.

368
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,500
But I do miss you.

369
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,580
Crazy kid!

370
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,500
(Thanks for the phone. I’ll definitely pay you back.)

371
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Hello.

372
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
Why are you calling me?

373
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,020
It’s easier to talk.

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,220
Texting is not hard, either.

375
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,760
I almost finished typing.

376
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,500
Do you like your new phone?

377
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,500
I like it so much! It’s much faster than my old one.

378
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,280
It’s so good for gaming too.

379
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,340
I don’t know if it’s good luck or bad luck

380
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,640
that you accidentally dropped my phone.

381
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,480
Right.

382
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,940
What a good accident.

383
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
Lucky me that you let me pay in installments.

384
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,260
I don’t have that much money to pay in one go.

385
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,300
Actually, you're a good person.

386
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,940
Am I good enough to hit on you?

387
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,960
Can.

388
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
I don’t know.

389
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,540
Just tell me yes or no.

390
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,700
I said I don’t know.

391
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,100
All I know is that…

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,160
I don’t get goosebumps when you hit on me.

393
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,980
I'm really going to win you over then.

394
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,700
I don’t know!

395
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I’m sleepy. I will hang up now.

396
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,720
I'm really going to win him over now.

397
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,480
Ae

398
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
I’m going to a convenient store. You want to come?

399
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,080
I’ll go too.

400
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,700
Hello, Tar.

401
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,800
Hello, Tum.

402
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,540
How are you?

403
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Well...

404
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,520
I’m doing well. My school just started,

405
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,720
so I’m a little busy these days.

406
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,740
How about you?

407
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm fine.

408
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,680
I’ve been thinking about...

409
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,320
what kinds of songs I should write.

410
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,180
Writing songs?

411
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,580
You become an artist now?

412
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,300
About your song, any progress on that?

413
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,580
I still don’t know what I should write.

414
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,900
I have no idea.

415
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,960
What about love song? I think many people will like it.

416
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,820
Love song?

417
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,820
I don’t know.

418
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,460
What are you doing now?

419
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,740
I’m working on my project.

420
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,640
I've been reading papers and articles for this project.

421
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,520
I'll go to take a shower after I finish.

422
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,020
How about you?

423
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,400
Is it getting colder over there?

424
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,840
It’s Thailand.

425
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,360
It’s as hot as ever.

426
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,760
If you have time,

427
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,280
please come to visit me.

428
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,720
By the way,

429
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,180
when are you coming back?

430
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,400
I’m not sure either.

431
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
But if I have a long holiday,

432
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,660
I will definitely go back to see you.

433
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,620
Tell our parents that I miss them so much.

434
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,920
You come back this time,

435
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,760
will I get to try your desserts?

436
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,620
Definitely!

437
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,740
This year, I already learn how to make desserts.

438
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,360
I think my skill probably has improved.

439
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,560
It's your holiday, right?

440
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,740
Yes.

441
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,000
Well...

442
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,540
I won’t bother you then.

443
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,960
Okay. I'll take a shower and go to bed.

444
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,160
Good night.

445
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,300
Okay.

446
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,100
Well then,

447
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,340
good night.

448
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,860
Dad.

449
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,360
I'm bored.

450
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,400
I told you to go with mom.

451
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,860
No, I don’t want to go.

452
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,420
Grandma’s always nagging.

453
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,140
I don’t like it.

454
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,320
I want to stay here with you.

455
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,860
But you just said you’re bored.

456
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,860
Can you tell me a bedtime story?

457
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,900
I’m still working.

458
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,860
It’s already late. You should take a break.

459
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,120
You should stop working.

460
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,700
Break?

461
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,980
Does that mean I don’t have to tell you a story either?

462
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,020
No. You have to tell me a story.

463
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,860
Well…

464
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,480
How about...

465
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,160
a story of two brothers?

466
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,880
No. It doesn’t sound exciting.

467
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,900
How about...

468
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,380
a story of two brothers and a servant?

469
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,940
It doesn't seem fun.

470
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,040
Once upon a time,

471
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,720
there were two brothers.

472
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,100
The older one was a jealous kid

473
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,960
who wanted to revenge on everyone.

474
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,560
The younger one was a naughty kid

475
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
who was spoiled since young.

476
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
Actually, it's the older brother

477
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,180
who raised him that way.

478
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,040
So, no one would love him.

479
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,700
Until one day...

480
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,540
How dare you tell me what to do!

481
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,840
You're just a servant.

482
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,220
I can do what I want.

483
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,080
Tin.

484
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,040
That's not nice to say.

485
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,540
Tul won't like it if he hears you say that.

486
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm not saying it to Tul.

487
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,440
I talk like this

488
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,940
to only a servant like you.

489
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,620
You have no right to tell me what I can and can't do.

490
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,640
Do you understand?

491
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,800
Yes. I understand that I have no right.

492
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,960
Good. Now get out.

493
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,320
Rasa told me not to let you go out.

494
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,500
Get out!

495
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,920
I can't. Please wait for Tul to come back first.

496
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,600
Move!

497
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,680
I'll make them pay for what they did to Tul.

498
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,820
You can't do that.

499
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,740
Rasa told me to keep you out of trouble.

500
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,280
But those people insulted my brother.

501
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,420
I still can't let you go.

502
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,740
You should follow only Tul's orders,

503
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,760
not my mom's.

504
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,780
I will tell Tul about this.

505
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,760
Sure.

506
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,040
You can tell him whatever pleases you.

507
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,800
I didn't mean to do that.

508
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,960
What happened?

509
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,480
He...

510
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,020
He put himself in front of me.

511
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,580
I didn't do anything.

512
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,300
Shut up, Tin!

513
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,840
The older brother couldn't stand his spoiled brother anymore.

514
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,140
What happened after that?

515
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,040
Did the younger brother get punished?

516
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,760
Of course, he did.

517
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,260
Remember this.

518
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,440
Don't be naughty like that boy.

519
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm a good boy.

520
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,120
I swear that I'm a good boy.

521
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm not naughty like that younger brother.

522
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,940
That's right.

523
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,760
A naughty child will be punished.

524
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,880
A naughty child...

525
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,840
that no one wants.

526
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,660
Why don't you tell him

527
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,480
who made him become like that?

528
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,580
Who made that younger brother to lose all his friends?

529
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,300
Tell him that.

530
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,860
Dad.

531
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,900
Uncle Tin, don't hurt my dad.

532
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Listen to me.

533
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,640
Don't be like an older or younger brother.

534
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,160
Don't be a devil in disguise.

535
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,480
And don't be a stupid person

536
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,220
who gets fooled easily.

537
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,940
Do you understand that?

538
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,860
Yes.

539
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,180
Dad, Uncle Tin is so scary.

540
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,640
It's okay.

541
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,400
Uncle Tin is just tired.

542
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,960
Sit here.

543
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,320
Remember this.

544
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,320
Don't be like the two brothers.

545
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,320
Especially the older one.

546
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,260
There's a price he has to pay.

547
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,680
He's paying for it now.

548
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,520
Tul...

549
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,460
Did anything happen to you?

550
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,420
(Thanks for the snacks. So yummy!)

551
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,420
You call me again.

552
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,580
I haven't finished texting yet.

553
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,860
If I tell you something,

554
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,780
will you believe me?

555
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,420
Of course.

556
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,700
You're my friend.

557
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,200
I believe in everything you say.

558
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,640
I used to think that my brother

559
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,540
was everything to me.

560
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,900
He was all I got.

561
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
Whatever he said,

562
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,040
I would believe him.

563
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,620
He told me that

564
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,580
my parents hate me.

565
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,940
And I believed every word he said.

566
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,860
I believed all the lies he made.

567
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,140
He said he would help me

568
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,180
when I was accused of abusing drugs.

569
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
Huh? What?

570
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,780
I grew up to be a spoiled child,

571
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,840
a bad person.

572
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,440
And that spoiled child

573
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,140
was sent to study abroad.

574
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,100
I always went to the party

575
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,100
and hangout.

576
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,980
And then I was arrested

577
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,680
for abusing drugs.

578
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,860
But I didn't know before that it was a drug-fulled party.

579
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,220
I was all over the news.

580
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,580
I was on newspaper front pages.

581
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,700
"A rich kid who turns into drug addict

582
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,840
was arrested abroad."

583
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,920
My brother said that he would help me.

584
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,300
But it was him who was behind all this.

585
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,180
He hates me.

586
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,700
He wants me dead.

587
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,340
He wants to take everything away from me.

588
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,940
He hates me.

589
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,840
Tin, where are you?

590
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,260
What?

591
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,340
I'm asking, where's your house? I will go to you now.

592
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,660
I'll punch your brother in the face.

593
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,000
Where are you? Tell me!

594
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,420
Can.

595
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,480
Can I go to see you?

596
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,080
Why not?

597
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,680
Gucci.

598
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,100
Do you think he will be okay?

599
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,720
You actually believe me, right?

600
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,360
Yes.

601
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,160
I believe you.

602
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,420
I despise your brother now.

603
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,060
I'll hit him in the face when I meet him.

604
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,560
So, this is his son.

605
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,820
What's up?

606
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,660
Are you a bad person like your dad?

607
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,680
Don't insult my dad. He's a good person.

608
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,060
He has a great personality.

609
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,540
Maybe he's evil.

610
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,400
My good boy, what did you do today?

611
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,240
I was fighting with Uncle Tin's friend and I won.

612
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,520
He said you're a bad person.

613
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,860
Search about Tin's friend, Can, for me.

614
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,220
I want to know who is Tin's important person.

615
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,780
I hope you won't be angry.
