&lrm;-Of course we can.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.820
&lrm;[Chloe sighs]

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.300
&lrm;I hope.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.500
&lrm;[panting]

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.220
&lrm;Adrien? Chloe?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.460
&lrm;[she groans]
&lrm;I bet they've gone somewhere fun.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.900
&lrm;And now I'm here all alone
&lrm;without Adrien.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.180
&lrm;Snap out of it.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.460
&lrm;Let's just focus on getting
&lrm;Mr. Stone his glasses, OK?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.460
&lrm;-Jagged Stone?
&lrm;-What?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.420
&lrm;Look into the lens.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.420
&lrm;I'll get them to Mr. Stone.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.540
&lrm;Can't you deliver them now?

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.740
&lrm;He's... resting.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.620
&lrm;Who likes having
&lrm;his belly scratched?

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.700
&lrm;Daddy's little Fang?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.340
&lrm;OK, no problem,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.580
&lrm;Just trying to do
&lrm;the job right this time.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.700
&lrm;-Got it.
&lrm;-Thank... you.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.140
&lrm;I hope Mr. Stone likes them.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.260
&lrm;Hard work always pays off.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.500
&lrm;Who are you?

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.900
&lrm;Look into the lens.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.100
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.100
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
&lrm;[panting]

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.020
&lrm;Hey there,
&lrm;time for your photo shoot.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.820
&lrm;How did you get in here?
&lrm;What photo shoot?

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.420
&lrm;Fang, attack!

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.100
&lrm;[panting]

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.460
&lrm;See you later, alligator.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.340
&lrm;What? Fang? Fang!

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.100
&lrm;Who are you?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.260
&lrm;I'm Pixelator,
&lrm;your biggest fan, Mr. Stone.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.380
&lrm;Can I call you Jagged?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.420
&lrm;-No!
&lrm;-I want to immortalize you, Jagged.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.860
&lrm;I'll be your one and only fan.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.820
&lrm;You will belong to me for eternity.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.220
&lrm;Now, look into the lens.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.700
&lrm;So you're Ladybug.
&lrm;I've heard such pathetic

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.260
&lrm;things about you.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.940
&lrm;Look into the lens.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.420
&lrm;[he groans]

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.940
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.740
&lrm;[Jagged Stone yells]

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.380
&lrm;[angry groan]
&lrm;Where did they go?

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.740
&lrm;If you want Jagged,
&lrm;you must find Ladybug.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.620
&lrm;I don't have time
&lrm;to deal with this Ladybug.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.780
&lrm;Yes you do.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.820
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;Plenty of time!</i>

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.060
&lrm;OK, OK.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.260
&lrm;[Pixelator]
<i>&lrm;Tell me what to do.</i>

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.420
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;I demand an excellent photo</i>

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.340
&lrm;of Ladybug with her Miraculous.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.660
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
<i>&lrm;I want those powers!</i>

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.100
<i>&lrm;So listen very carefully.</i>

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.300
&lrm;I can't stay here, I'm performing.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.260
&lrm;You'll get to do your gig.
&lrm;You'll even wear awesome shades.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.380
&lrm;[She chuckles]

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.700
&lrm;While I catch Pixelator, stay here.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860
&lrm;No-one would think to look here.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.900
&lrm;Ladybug, is this safe?

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.380
&lrm;This is a school.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.180
&lrm;Yes, Pixelator would never imagine
&lrm;his idol would hang out at school.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.460
&lrm;I mean... isn't school awesome?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.980
&lrm;This is ridiculous.
&lrm;I don't have time for this.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.700
&lrm;First, I get hijacked
&lrm;by this crazed fan,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.860
&lrm;then, I'm attacked
&lrm;by a super-weirdo...

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.260
&lrm;Wait, what do you know
&lrm;about this crazed fan?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.980
&lrm;He's come to every one
&lrm;of my shows this year.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.180
&lrm;He's sent me stacks of letters,
&lrm;gone through my trash,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.540
&lrm;he even followed my mother
&lrm;to her weekly bingo night.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.380
&lrm;-How creepy.
&lrm;-Not really.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.180
&lrm;It's just a bunch
&lrm;of elderly ladies having fun.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.420
&lrm;[She groans]

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.980
&lrm;Vincent... Asa.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.140
&lrm;Got his address.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.260
&lrm;You're not leaving me here, are you?

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.660
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;isn't... school awesome?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.100
&lrm;Daddy! Daddy!

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.460
&lrm;Plagg, I've gotta find
&lrm;some way to transform.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.060
&lrm;Come on, what's the rush?

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.020
&lrm;[Angry sigh]

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.780
&lrm;Fine, if you insist.
&lrm;At least find me some cheese.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.860
&lrm;I'm gonna see
&lrm;if there's a way out.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.860
&lrm;Don't go anywhere,
&lrm;could be dangerous.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.060
&lrm;Dangerous?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.660
&lrm;Not scared, are you?

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.060
&lrm;Scared? <i>&lrm;Moi</i>&lrm;? As if. No way.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.460

&lrm;[Screeching]

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.940
&lrm;The Champs-Elysées... perfect.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.980
&lrm;May the photo shoot begin.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.740
&lrm;Amateur.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.340
&lrm;This isn't creepy at all.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.820
&lrm;What?

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.500
&lrm;[Chloe screams]

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.060
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.820
&lrm;What are you two doing in there?

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.660
&lrm;Ladybug, remember me?
&lrm;Your biggest fan.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.740
&lrm;Please get us out of here.
&lrm;It's terrible in here.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.260
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;only when you're not around.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.460
&lrm;[Man]
&lrm;Over here, Ladybug.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.700
&lrm;[Woman]
&lrm;Help, Ladybug.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.020
&lrm;Help!

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.140
&lrm;What happened?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.780
&lrm;It's terrible.
&lrm;This man, he... took a photo of us

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.820
&lrm;and we ended up trapped in here.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.700
&lrm;While innocently strolling
&lrm;the Champs-Elysées.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.820
&lrm;I sure hope
&lrm;Cat Noir's there already.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.340
&lrm;Excuse me, sir. Sir?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.620
&lrm;Care for an interview
&lrm;to spread the villain's voice?

&lrm;This is terrible.

&lrm;I've gotta do what Pixelator says.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.940
&lrm;Surely you can't be serious?
&lrm;It's dangerous out there.

&lrm;Who cares?

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.020
&lrm;Jagged Stone can't turn down
&lrm;a TV appearance.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.860
&lrm;Imagine what it would do
&lrm;for my career?

&lrm;You have no choice.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.140
&lrm;Get out of here, Mr. Stone!

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.620
&lrm;It's me you wanted
&lrm;all this time, right?

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.220
&lrm;Well, here I am, in the flesh.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.380
&lrm;Look into the lens.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.820
&lrm;Wait, wrong side.
&lrm;This isn't my best angle.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.500
&lrm;No, wait, the lightings wrong.
&lrm;Does my nose look big?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.020
&lrm;This is better.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.820
&lrm;Hurry up, already!

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.620
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.620
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;A powder compact?

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.020
&lrm;-I think I'm ready.
&lrm;-Stop moving!

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.140
&lrm;Look into the lens!

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.540
&lrm;Don't do it, Mr. Stone!

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.580
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.380
&lrm;Yes!

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.300
&lrm;[Pixelator]
&lrm;Come on,

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.940
&lrm;open your eyes.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.980
&lrm;Batter up!

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.540
&lrm;What?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.380
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;How did...

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.540
&lrm;Next time, I assure you,
&lrm;it won't be a photo finish.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.820
&lrm;I won't stop Ladybug.
&lrm;I'll destroy you!

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.060
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.500
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.140
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.580
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.780
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.060
&lrm;[Gasping]
&lrm;What happened?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.340
&lrm;Where am I?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.980
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Pound it!

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.220
&lrm;Thank you for this
&lrm;work-experience day, Mr. Bourgeois.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.340
&lrm;I'm sure we'll all remember it
&lrm;for a long time.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.700
&lrm;So will I.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.020
&lrm;[Discreet coughing]
&lrm;I almost forgot.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.940
&lrm;Jagged Stone's giving
&lrm;a concert tonight.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.620
&lrm;I'm giving tickets to those
&lrm;who showed the most effort.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.580
&lrm;Ri... diculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.340
&lrm;Good evening, Paris!

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.020
&lrm;It's my first live concert... ever.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.620
&lrm;It's amazing!

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.020
&lrm;Yeah, amazing.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.460
&lrm;This song is for
&lrm;the girl who saved my life,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.300
&lrm;this one's for you, Ladybug.
