1
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,599
OF COURSE I KILLED MARINA.
DID YOU STILL DOUBT IT?

2
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,359
SHE WAS STILL ALIVE WHEN I LEFT. 
POOR THING. I SHOULD'VE HIT HER HARDER.

3
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,200
"She was still alive when I left.
Poor thing.

4
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,079
I should've hit her harder."

5
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,159
This is a crime. It's harassment.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
What if I told my parents
to pay for a study program?

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,480
Would you still think it's a crime?

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,920
-What are you trying to achieve?
-We want him out.

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,079
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HER.
I HAD NOTHING AGAINST MARINA.

10
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,319
IT COULD'VE BEEN YOU.

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,639
Hey...

12
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,639
You OK?

13
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,319
Leave me alone.

14
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
-Polo.
-Hey.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
-What the hell are you doing?
-He needs to be alone, okay?

16
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,039
And I need you to leave me alone.

17
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,360
-He's got the balls to come here?
-Forget him, please, Valerio.

18
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,080
OK? It's not worth it.

19
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,039
Polo, honey. What happened? You're early.

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,280
We have an exam first thing tomorrow,
and I have a lot to study.

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
What exam?

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
-It's...
-Polo.

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,159
The principal called this morning.

24
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,400
She told us about the Twitter account.
Why didn't you tell us?

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,719
So you won't look at me like they do.

26
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,360
They deactivated the account.

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,039
Yes, Mom, one account's
been deactivated. One!

28
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,759
As if that would do anything.

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,199
I don't want to go back.

30
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,719
Seriously.

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
You'd be proving them right.

32
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,159
You have to be stronger.

33
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,919
Be a man, son.

34
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
You know what I mean.

35
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,120
Well...

36
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,800
if it isn't Las Encinas' own Bill Gates.

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
How about skipping practice
and studying together?

38
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,600
Hey, I'm talking to you, partner.

39
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,360
OK. My place in an hour?

40
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,519
OK.

41
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Ciao.

42
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,160
Thanks for the lift.

43
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,480
I just want to meet your parents.

44
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,160
Fine...

45
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,560
But hopefully in this lifetime.

46
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,839
Hi, Mom.

47
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,240
What's up?

48
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,920
Are you OK?

49
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,920
Is Dad all right?

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,480
I found this university brochure
with your things this morning.

51
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,079
Dad...

52
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,800
Dad.

53
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,079
Look, Dad...

54
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,600
This program is a great opportunity.

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
My only opportunity...
What other options do I have?

56
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,519
All alone there? 

57
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,439
You're just a girl.

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,639
She wouldn't be all alone.

59
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,399
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, too.

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,639
-I'm Malick, Nadia's friend.
-What are you doing?

61
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Next year,
I'll be studying in New York too,

62
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,759
and... I'd be happy to take care of her.

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,519
My dad studied at that university
and speaks highly of it.

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,439
After that, he diversified
his grandfather's gold mine business.

65
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,879
Now he has
the biggest telecommunications company

66
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,839
in Africa.

67
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,439
It's a huge opportunity.

68
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,639
Why didn't you tell us about him?

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,839
I actually wanted to come here myself...

70
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,360
and...

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,560
ask permission to take Nadia
to the Madrid mosque.

72
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,839
I go every week,
and it's a pity she can't go more often.

73
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,759
OK.

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,319
What happened?

75
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,160
Nothing bad.

76
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,439
Nothing bad?
Since when do you have good news?

77
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,000
Would you mind coming to the station
with me, please?

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,720
The prosecutor on your brother's case
seems willing to drop the charges.

79
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,279
He could come back... as a free man.

80
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,399
Your mother, too.

81
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,160
-They wouldn't have to hide anymore.
-What do you mean, "seems willing"?

82
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,680
He has... doubts, due to the lack
of evidence against Nano, but...

83
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,160
I believe we can convince him.

84
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,319
You "believe"?

85
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,000
We went to the same school.
He sat next to me.

86
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,600
-We've been friends ever since.
-Right...

87
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,079
That's how it works?
Sketchy deals among friends?

88
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,040
Power isn't fair... but for once,
you can use it in your favor.

89
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,240
We only ask one thing of you...

90
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
We've been monitoring
Sandra López Gallego for a while,

91
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,839
your friend's mother.

92
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,560
We know you've run some errands for her,
but that's no use to us at all.

93
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,319
We need evidence.

94
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,000
We need someone who can enter
her house without arousing suspicion

95
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,800
to plant a small listening device.

96
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,759
I'm not doing it.

97
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,319
-If it's because of your friend--
-Her name is Rebeka.

98
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,920
Think about Nano...

99
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,759
your mother...

100
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,279
your family.

101
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,040
Think about it.

102
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,319
Are you OK, honey?

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,320
Yeah.

104
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,799
Tell me if you need anything.

105
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,720
I ONLY USED MY GIRLFRIEND
SO I COULD FUCK CHRISTIAN.

106
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,759
YES, MURDERERS HAVE A HEART TOO.

107
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,759
Another tweet.

108
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,639
Your friends are really something.

109
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,519
Samuel isn't a bad person.

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
-And neither is Guzmán.
-Right.

111
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,240
He can't be if you went out with him.

112
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,360
You know...

113
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,120
he's like you, but Christian.

114
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,519
You think you're knights in shining armor 
who have to save me.

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,519
I don't need to be taken care of.

116
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,559
Excuse me?

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,879
I wasn't planning to.

118
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, please...

119
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,279
It's true I'll be in New York
next year and everything,

120
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,799
but... you don't have to see me
if you don't want.

121
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,279
I only said that to convince your dad.

122
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,759
Okay...

123
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,960
So much for Allah's perfect son!
You lied to my family?

124
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,720
Thanks to that, you'll follow your dreams,
and they won't worry about it.

125
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
It's not so sinful, is it?

126
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,960
So... you decide
what's sinful and what isn't.

127
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,480
I take certain liberties.

128
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
I stray a little
to come back with more gusto.

129
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
What liberties?

130
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,279
If you want to know,
come to the Silicon Valley party.

131
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,399
No. My parent's won't let me go to clubs.

132
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,039
They will
if you're with Allah's perfect son.

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,440
-Where the hell were you?
-Fuck!

134
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,879
-Sorry, my phone died.
-Really?

135
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,360
Well, you read the messages I sent you.

136
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,440
Look, Samu... I don't know what's wrong,
but I can guess.

137
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,000
I wasn't born yesterday.

138
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,120
If you want to be a marquis,
tell me to fuck off and stop wasting time.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
You met up with her again.

140
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,000
-I was at the police station.
-No way.

141
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,159
Yeah, about my brother. Same old shit.

142
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,720
Sorry.

143
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm sorry. I'm losing it.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,919
I feel insecure around you
for some reason.

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
Me, who would've guessed?

146
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,519
What can I do to fix it?

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,559
I don't know...

148
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,840
You could come and stick your tongue
down my throat, for example.

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Let's hit the books.

150
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,960
Were you serious about studying?

151
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,240
-Sure.
-Since when do you want to study?

152
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,759
Since I don't want to end up like my mom,
up to her eyes in shit.

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,399
That can't end well.

154
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,799
So...

155
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,279
responding to messages again?

156
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,440
-It's Omar.
-What's going on?

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,039
Well, well...
What're we celebrating here?

158
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,759
It's a private party, freak.

159
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,559
This have anything to do
with those messages?

160
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,960
-Don't you have a line of coke to snort?
-Is that an invitation? I love it.

161
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,399
An invitation to leave.

162
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,600
This is my house too,
just so you all know, OK?

163
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,000
We just want to talk privately
for a moment.

164
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,080
OK.

165
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,639
-Have a drink. Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.

166
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Can we finally end this fucking charade?

167
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,799
You need to stop this.

168
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,799
We owe it to Marina.

169
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
That's not true.

170
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,639
You're thinking of yourselves, not her,
because you need revenge.

171
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,320
No, we don't need revenge.

172
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,840
But we won't let a murderer
just go on with his life.

173
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,799
Life is too short, you know.

174
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,759
-It's not worth wasting.
-What the fuck do you know about life?

175
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,279
-Why do you keep protecting him?
-Because Polo...

176
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,840
tried to kill himself.

177
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,399
Holy shit, Las Encinas... 

178
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,120
I told him I'd tell on him...
if he didn't turn himself in...

179
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,039
and he almost killed himself.

180
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,559
Are you saying this to get me
to forgive him or forgive you?

181
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
-Guzmán.
-Listen to me...

182
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,399
He deserves everything
that's happening to him.

183
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,679
I hope one day you get
what you deserve too.

184
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,679
Are we done?

185
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,720
There'll be a photo-call, over 100 guests,

186
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,879
and the best catering in Madrid...

187
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,919
It's not every day 
your company goes public, is it?

188
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,200
What color will you wear?

189
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Why?

190
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,039
-Are you buying a tie to match?
-No.

191
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,759
A car.

192
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Is that all I am to you?
An accessory that matches your new car?

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,519
You know...

194
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,919
those movies where the fat kid
with the sweaty hands

195
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,919
never gets invited to the party...

196
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,480
or to anything really?

197
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,600
Well, that's me.

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,679
Used to be me.

199
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
And now... it's my party.

200
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,720
I decide who's invited or not...

201
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,240
and I'm taking
the most wonderful girl in the world.

202
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,399
I just want everything to be perfect.

203
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,799
You're the centerpiece of it all,

204
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,279
so all the accessories have to match you.

205
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,000
Tell me what you want...

206
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,720
anything...

207
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,480
and it's yours.

208
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,159
Yeray, what I don't have can't be bought
with money.

209
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,759
Well...

210
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,080
-Thanks for driving me home.
-That's OK.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,080
Good night.

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
Wait!

213
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,120
What time should I pick you up tomorrow?

214
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
Yeray, I don't know 
if I can go after all.

215
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,080
Why not? I mean...

216
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,159
Who's that?

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My dad.

218
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,080
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

219
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm Yeray.

220
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,919
-Carla's classmate.
-I know who you are.

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,679
I saw you in the latest issue
of Forbes. Impressive!

222
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,559
Congratulations on your IPO.

223
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,639
We're throwing a party tomorrow.

224
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,679
I was just telling Carla...

225
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,360
Hey... why don't you and your wife
come with her?

226
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,759
Of course.

227
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,039
We'd be delighted.

228
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
We'll be there.

229
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,480
Pleased to meet you.

230
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,039
What's the uniform for?
You have chemo today.

231
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,679
I'm not going.

232
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,559
What?

233
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm not doing chemo.

234
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,320
Not worth it. You saw the chances.

235
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,960
Ander, we talked about this.

236
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,279
I know we did...

237
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,000
but I'm fed up...

238
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,799
with this "strong and optimistic" crap.

239
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,080
All this "fight until the end,
keep smiling" stuff.

240
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,960
Imagine the fucking pressure.

241
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,600
I'm not well.

242
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,080
I don't have the strength.

243
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't make me feel bad about that too.

244
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,119
-I just want to be by your side.
-I want you by my side too.

245
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,759
But with my decisions, not yours.

246
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,680
Look, Polo isn't here.

247
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,880
...of the collective unconscious.

248
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,200
Maybe something happened to him.

249
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,279
-I wish.
-What could've happened?

250
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,640
He's scared shitless, that's all.

251
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,400
Samu.

252
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,599
I thought up our next tweet.

253
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,039
We'll let everyone know
that Polo attempted suicide.

254
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,640
-Guzmán, man...
-What?

255
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,160
It's his sister, Samuel.

256
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,599
I don't know what I'd do
if anyone touched my family.

257
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,200
What if we wait a little?

258
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,240
-Maybe this was enough.
-Why do you think that?

259
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,319
Guzmán, Samuel, are you following me?

260
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,519
Come on.

261
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,119
Let's say heroism is a choice.

262
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,599
Polo, you have a visitor. Cayetana.

263
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,000
Nothing. You should go.

264
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,799
OK... Just let me try something.

265
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,480
What are you doing?

266
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Please... just let me.

267
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,240
Polo, it's me.

268
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,039
Polo...

269
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,240
Go to school, go on.

270
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,000
Andrea...

271
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,039
let's let them talk, OK?

272
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
We'll be in the living room
if you need anything.

273
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
OK, thanks.

274
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,200
Thank you.

275
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,119
-Let's forget about Polo, okay?
-A bottle of champagne, please.

276
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,680
-Don't let that come between us.
-Just get away from me, OK?

277
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Here you are, guys.

278
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,160
Hello, sweetheart!

279
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:46,880
Where's Mom?

280
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,599
In bed with a stomachache.

281
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,960
Go get changed. 

282
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,559
I want to be early.

283
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,759
-I'm not going.
-What?

284
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,400
Why not?

285
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,720
Why should I?

286
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm not going to embarrass myself
looking for investors

287
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,599
to save the wineries.

288
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,480
Know what Yeray ordered to drink
with dinner?

289
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,279
Coca-Cola.

290
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,440
He has no clue about wine,
nor does he want to.

291
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,759
I don't know. I mean...

292
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,119
he seemed... very interested.

293
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm not going to play along with you.

294
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,920
-Carla...
-I'd rather stay in and look after Mom.

295
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
-I'm trying to look after her too.
-Really?

296
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,359
Yes. She's not ill.

297
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,680
She's devastated.

298
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,839
She just found out 
we're on the verge of bankruptcy.

299
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,160
So...

300
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,119
if you want to take care of her...

301
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,480
you know what to do.

302
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,279
Well, well...

303
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,599
Don't you look elegant.

304
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,279
Come here. Give me a kiss.

305
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,240
Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

306
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,880
You had us fucking scared.

307
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,079
You almost got me killed.

308
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,039
Is this how you talk
to your future mother-in-law?

309
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,799
We're off to a bad start.

310
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,440
You're playing with fire.

311
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,880
The thugs, the police...

312
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,880
Why don't you stop?

313
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,039
Samuel... you're a good kid.

314
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,720
Thanks.

315
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,079
That's not a compliment.

316
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,559
Tell me, where has that gotten you?

317
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,119
You live in a dump,
you work for a pittance,

318
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,119
and let's not even mention your brother.

319
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,240
So I should become an asshole?

320
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,480
You need to do what's best
for you and your family.

321
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,799
And if others get hurt along the way...
Tough shit.

322
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,279
And if that makes me an asshole...
so be it.

323
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,039
As for you, you'll see.

324
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,440
So, where's being a good kid gotten you?

325
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,759
Yeray... Congratulations!

326
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,839
Wow.

327
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,839
I wasn't expecting to see you.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,759
Carla convinced me.
She really wanted to come.

329
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,799
Well... that's not what she told me.

330
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,400
Well, excuse her.
I don't know where her head is lately.

331
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,160
Why don't you come by the winery one day,
and we'll make it up to you?

332
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,680
You might be interested.

333
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,880
We're looking for investors.
I'd like to tell you all about it.

334
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,799
Sure.

335
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm sorry, but they're waiting for me.

336
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,759
-Enjoy the party.
-OK.

337
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,119
Yeray.

338
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,720
You know the only good thing
about being poor?

339
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,720
People approach you for who you really are
and not for your money.

340
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,559
-Yeray--
-Just in case it happens to you.

341
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,640
I guess the family wine business
isn't going so well?

342
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,519
It's true.

343
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,039
Your money made me change my mind.

344
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,880
-How romantic.
-But you know why?

345
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,279
You made it all by yourself.

346
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,640
No help, no cheating.

347
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,000
No desperate parents asking for favors
and making a fool of you at a party.

348
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,319
Yeah...

349
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,759
What do you like most about me?

350
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,200
My face?

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,079
My body?

352
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,920
My last name?

353
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,000
I can't take credit for any of it.

354
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,720
But everything you have,
you earned yourself.

355
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,160
Now, that's sexy.

356
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,759
Hey. Everything OK?

357
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,880
All good.

358
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,759
Holy shit.
Is this a club or a retirement home?

359
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm running to the bathroom for a sec.

360
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,559
-How are you?
-Fine.

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,279
-I'm sorry.
-What?

362
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,200
When you saved Polo's ass,
I thought you were a coward.

363
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,680
But, no, you were brave.

364
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,400
You did what you had to
to protect your family...

365
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,680
even if you had to pay a very high price.

366
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,920
I get it now.

367
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,400
I didn't sacrifice much.

368
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,519
You lost Lu...

369
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,039
you lost Guzmán, and you lost me.

370
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,720
I knew you for like five minutes.

371
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,720
In five months, you'll be gone,

372
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,079
and in five years,
I won't even remember your name.

373
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,559
Samu.

374
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,880
Damn. What's with the long faces?
What do you say we have a drink now, guys?

375
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,440
No fucking way.

376
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,119
Motherfucker.

377
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
-So much for "maybe that's enough," huh?
-Come on, guys.

378
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,640
Now it's time to go over to that bar
and get that drink.

379
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,039
Come on, let's move.

380
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,599
Let's calm down. It's all right.

381
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,559
Testing. Can you hear me?

382
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,839
Good evening, everyone. Thanks for coming.

383
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,160
It all started with an app
that's so great for finding a partner,

384
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,480
that none of our users last
more than five minutes.

385
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,920
-I know that was a bad joke...
-Hey, I'm with you.

386
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,000
So, it all started as a dating app...

387
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,759
and now... it's much more than that.

388
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,079
You're too nice for your own good.
And I'm an idiot for listening to you.

389
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,200
People here do whatever they want, Samu.

390
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,759
Fucking bullshit.

391
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:05,240
They want a comprehensive experience, 
they want to meet partners...

392
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,240
-Guzmán!
-I'm going to the bathroom.

393
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,960
...they want investors, 
even travel companions.

394
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:10,960
Our VIPs...

395
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,640
You're right.

396
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,359
Where the hell are you going?

397
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:20,960
Ready?

398
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,440
Ten, nine, eight,

399
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:29,119
seven, six, five, four,

400
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,359
three, two, one...

401
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,279
I want a gin and tonic. What about you?

402
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,359
You drink alcohol?

403
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,599
Don't tell your father... or mine.

404
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,359
OK. So are these your liberties?

405
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,440
Imagine you could choose 
three wild cards for tonight.

406
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,680
I've already chosen one: alcohol.

407
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:25,920
And you?

408
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,079
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

409
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,319
No need to be Allah's perfect children.

410
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,680
Sometimes it's enough
to be a good child... and you are.

411
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
Has anyone come up to you?

412
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,519
-If we leave, they win.
-And what do we gain?

413
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,559
What do we gain by staying here?

414
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Being looked at like zoo animals?

415
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,839
How are you two doing?

416
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,920
He brought it on himself.
Polo wanted to die.

417
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,440
No, that's not true.

418
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,640
-Please.
-No.

419
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,640
I'm begging you.
Don't tell anyone what happened. Please.

420
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,599
What do you want, Valerio?
Who sent you? Guzmán or Samuel?

421
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,000
What're you talking about? No one.

422
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,359
It's not like that.

423
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,599
I'm not one for obeying orders,
and I don't like bullies either.

424
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,400
-Fine.
-I don't like how they look at you.

425
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,759
Why's that?

426
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
I was looked at like that
my whole life.

427
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,880
You don't have to hang out with us
out of pity.

428
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,559
Who said pity? 

429
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,279
I'm here because... you guys
are the most interesting couple here.

430
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,920
-Sure.
-Who?

431
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,720
I mean... you're talking about us?

432
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,640
Yes, Polo.

433
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,079
And yes, I know everything.

434
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,759
Your threesome with Christian...

435
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,559
which also really turned me on.

436
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,920
Do you know why?

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,519
Because you're different.

438
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,880
And you, young lady...

439
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,400
A top fraudster who fooled us for months.

440
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,119
-Give her a big hand!
-No need, thanks.

441
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,640
You are...

442
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
Wow!

443
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,480
You are fascinating.

444
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,599
Much more so than when you were
just another dull rich girl.

445
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,559
OK, Valerio,
but... I'm not as fascinating as you.

446
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,279
I mean... you've snorted
your family's entire fortune.

447
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,359
Exactly!

448
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,359
Absolutely right.

449
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,880
How do you see it?
I think it's crystal clear.

450
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,319
We're unique.

451
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,599
Let's drink to that. Cheers.

452
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,640
I know how I want to spend my...

453
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,799
-my next wild card.
-Oh, really?

454
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
Surprise me.

455
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
I want to kiss you.

456
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,519
-No.
-No?

457
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,480
-No.
-No.

458
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,519
No problem. 

459
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,319
I'm going to kiss you.

460
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Damn! What a twist!

461
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,960
Forget it. Samuel isn't answering.
It's not...

462
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,240
What if we look for him
and throw our own party?

463
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,799
Hello?

464
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
No... I don't think so.

465
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,039
Guzmán.

466
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,359
-Go home.
-He should go.

467
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,319
Come on.

468
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,519
Excuse me. Do I know you?

469
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,839
Are we friends? I don't think so.

470
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,960
Then get out of my sight.

471
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,680
Get lost!

472
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,759
-Why don't you leave him alone?
-Shit, man... I don't feel sorry for him.

473
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,279
He's sick, for fuck's sake!

474
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,160
What do you mean, "sick"?

475
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,759
What did you say, Omar?

476
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,160
What's he got?

477
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,240
So you kept quiet about that too?

478
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
You told him?

479
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
-Sorry, Ander, I had to--
-I told you not to tell anyone!

480
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
It's my business!

481
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,880
What did I do
to deserve to be out of the loop?

482
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,199
Nothing.

483
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,719
You didn't do anything wrong.

484
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,320
In fact, you were right.

485
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,800
I kept Polo's secret,
and it's eating me up inside.

486
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,239
No way!

487
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,840
What?

488
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,199
That's why you don't want to do chemo?

489
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
You're not doing chemo?

490
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,079
Get out, Omar.

491
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,119
-Excuse me?
-Go away!

492
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:50,960
Ander.

493
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,519
Why don't you want the chemo?

494
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,280
Do you want to die?

495
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
You'll go to the hospital
even if I have to drag you.

496
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Whatever you might have done
has nothing to do with it.

497
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,079
Nobody deserves that.

498
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,159
Excuse me. A gin and tonic, please?

499
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,320
What's this? 

500
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
You didn't even take it off
to shower.

501
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,400
It's my wild card.

502
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,039
Your what?

503
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,679
Better you explain it to him.

504
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,519
This is my brother, Omar.

505
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,360
Malick, a friend.

506
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,800
I told Nadia that...

507
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,599
it's good to take a break from the rules

508
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,400
so you don't explode one day
and say, "To hell with it all."

509
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,599
Maybe that's the secret
to not ending up like me.

510
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,880
Omar exploded
and said, "To hell with it all."

511
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,559
He left home.

512
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,599
Why?

513
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,159
I don't get along with my father.

514
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,559
And he can't handle
having a queer son.

515
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,719
-I didn't know you were...
-Queer?

516
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,679
Yeah... I'm queer.

517
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,199
Any problem?

518
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,000
-No, of course not.
-Right.

519
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,119
Too much of a wild card for you, Malick?

520
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,159
Anyway, I have work to do.
I'm going back in.

521
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,239
Let's have one last drink.

522
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,280
-The last one?
-Yes, the last one.

523
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,920
-All right. The last one.
-OK?

524
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,599
-OK. Champagne. My favorite.
-Last one.

525
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,000
-Bartender! Bring one here.
-OK.

526
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,119
Last one.

527
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:55,880
Well...

528
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,639
-Do you like him?
-No.

529
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,079
-No, what?
-Easy.

530
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm just... glad someone
can bear to talk to me.

531
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,599
-Finally.
-It's fine if you like him.

532
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,480
I wouldn't mind if...

533
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,400
-I wouldn't mind...
-OK.

534
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,400
-...trying...
-Shut up.

535
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,599
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt,
but you're looking a bit shy.

536
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,719
-What's up?
-He does.

537
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,239
One last dance?

538
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,320
-Not me.
-The last one, come on!

539
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,679
But you guys go ahead.

540
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,119
Why do you care what they think?

541
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,119
I mean, Polo, you're not
what they think you are.

542
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,400
So now...

543
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,559
you're going to have fun
and have one last dance with us.

544
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,880
Last dance. Come on!

545
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,320
There's a new tweet.

546
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,280
STOP STARING AT ME.
BEING A MURDERER ISN'T EASY.

547
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,760
I EVEN TRIED TO KILL MYSELF.

548
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,719
Polo.

549
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,360
-Guzmán.
-It wasn't me.

550
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Who did it, then?

551
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,679
What do you want?

552
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,559
You have a thing for going missing, 
don't you?

553
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,000
Samuel...

554
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,239
-You don't want to be with me.
-It's not that.

555
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:16,119
I was overwhelmed by the situation,
that’s all.

556
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,679
I'm sorry.

557
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,679
Shit.

558
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,519
I thought I'd bagged
the one good guy in the class.

559
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm really sorry.

560
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
Can I stay over tonight?

561
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,119
Fine.

562
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,199
As long as we don't sleep. 

563
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,760
Come on, let's go.

564
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,599
-I'm going to the kitchen to get a drink.
-OK. There's water in the fridge.

565
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,599
Polo.

566
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:54,159
We read that stuff...
on Twitter... about...

567
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,840
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,199
No... We're sorry.

569
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,360
We shouldn't have forced you 
to go to school. You were right. 

570
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,719
We'll do whatever you say.

571
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,519
Whatever you want.

572
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,519
All I want is to disappear.

573
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,360
Get away from here.

574
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,840
OK, then...

575
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,920
We'll look for a new school abroad.

576
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,320
We have friends in London.

577
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,480
You can finish the school year there,
if you want. 

578
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,280
Yes.

579
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,639
You're leaving?

580
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,159
Thank you.

581
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,000
A lot.

582
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,239
Hey.

583
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,639
You're all set?

584
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,639
What're you doing here?

585
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,000
Nothing. I like hospital coffee.

586
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,119
It's with milk.

587
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,519
Thanks.

588
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,360
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?

589
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,480
You wanted to get rid of me?
You just fucked that up!

590
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:01,719
What the hell?

591
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,679
I want to leave, too.

592
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:05,920
I want out. I was going to leave!

593
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,039
But now I can’t get admitted anywhere.

594
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,840
You used a new account 
to forward the tweets to every school.

595
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,920
-No one wants to be involved with--
-A murderer.

596
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,760
With all this fucking shit. 

597
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:22,679
Happy?

598
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,239
No.

599
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,639
We didn't do it.

600
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,639
-You didn't?
-No.

601
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,440
Then who did?

602
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,320
Who?

603
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,960
FORENSICS

604
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,400
Cayetana...

605
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,440
Your turn.

606
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:33,480
YOU ARE THE OPPOSITE OF A MURDERER.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

607
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,119
Come with me.
