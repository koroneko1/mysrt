00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:30,160
YEAR 2004

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,399
I want to loan ten million baht.

3
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,439
Kid, you can deposit or withdraw
money at the front counters.

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to open a factory.

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,200
Kid, I have lots of
loan applications to review.

6
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,840
Let's do this, then.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,719
In one sentence,

8
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,120
tell me something
that will get my attention.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,200
ITTHIPAT KULAPONGVANICH

10
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,760
You don't have to care about
who I am or how old I am.

11
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,120
Just listen to me.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
My name is...

13
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,680
TOP, GIVE ME THE FIRE BLADE

14
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,560
I WANT TEN MILLION IN EXCHANGE

15
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,159
I made you guys set the paper margins

16
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,760
to 1.5 inches at the top and on the sides.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,400
Once the margins are set,

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,840
type the information you have

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,239
into MS Word.

20
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,680
Make sure you typed your name correctly.

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,039
Fix it now if it's wrong.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,199
Once you are done,

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,719
press "enter" or move down a row

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
and type your biography.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,960
SHIT, MAKE IT CHEAPER
I NEED IT TO KILL THE DRAGON

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,879
Make sure the information is correct.

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,719
FIND ME THE MONEY
OR GET THE SWORD YOURSELF

28
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,759
DAMN IT, YOU TOOK ALL THE ITEMS
ON THE MAP, HOW CAN I GET ANY?

29
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,240
JACK, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER
BIGTOE WANTS TO BUY SOMETHING

30
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,719
SHIT, REALLY?

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,719
...to let the computer know

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
that this file on MS Word

33
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,520
has a name.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,680
Next...

35
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,360
Put it on MS Word.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,479
Okay? Once you have a photo,

37
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,840
set its frame to any color you want.

38
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:10,159
Check out the picture and the information.

39
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,360
JACK, WHAT IS "SGD"?

40
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,199
It means "Singapore Dollar."

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
That's right.

42
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,280
It's 12,000 baht.

43
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,439
Weren't you worried about giving
your bank account to a stranger?

44
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,120
Not at all.

45
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,520
I've got the balls.

46
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,840
Crinum Lily

47
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,400
Is blossoming in the field

48
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,520
Grow me

49
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,039
Tuang.

50
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,039
May I borrow your bankbook?

51
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,319
BOONTUANG MAKMEESUK

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,240
Why do you want to borrow my bankbook?

53
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,840
Just let me borrow it.

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,199
I have 50,000 in my bank account.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,599
You only have 1,500.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,719
Let's see what will happen.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,719
Sweet!

58
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,600
Here you go.

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
Oh, my god.

60
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,199
I still have eight more dragon boots,

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,680
forty-three more shields,

62
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,160
forty more swords,
and seventeen more armors.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,279
This is...

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
awesome.

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,879
Mister.

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,920
What comes with the best model?

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,439
Mostly first class insurance.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Is that all?

69
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,879
If it's a down payment, then that's it.

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Where did you get so much cash?

71
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,240
I sell weapons.

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,079
ISSUE A VISITOR BADGE BEFORE ENTRY

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,560
You can't get in
without a parking sticker.

74
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,279
Here is your sticker.

75
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,160
RESERVED FOR THE SCHOOL DIRECTOR

76
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,160
Song, no more excuses.

77
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,199
You can go now.

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,959
Itthipat, give me your parents' numbers.

79
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,720
Come on, sir.

80
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,040
Please don't call them.

81
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
How about you deduct 40 merit points
and call it a day?

82
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,639
Please don't call them.

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,839
You don't have any points left.

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,639
How about this?

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,839
May I donate money
for the new neon sign for the school?

86
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,279
Are you trying to bribe me?

87
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,240
No, sir.

88
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,839
I just want to help our school

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,279
as much as I can.

90
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,079
This is what they call a bribe.

91
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,959
Why can't you be like your siblings?

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
They graduated

93
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,560
and found great jobs in China.

94
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,639
How will you earn a living, Itthipat?

95
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,560
ADMINISTRATION

96
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,680
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

97
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,560
The whole school knows.

98
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,560
But only you get to sit in the car.

99
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
As if.

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,120
We can't park here. Let's just go.

101
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,160
Here's a parking spot.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,240
You want noodles with extra crab, right?

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,079
Wait, Top!

104
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,600
To go, please.

105
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,879
Sure.

106
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,879
-How much?
-It's 280 baht.

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
Fuck you.

108
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,240
Top!

109
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,160
I got your favorite chestnuts too.

110
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, let's just go.

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
Tuang.

112
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,519
Is Dad home already?

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,039
-He came back this evening.
-Is he sleeping?

114
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
Yes. Is this your car?

115
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,919
Yes.

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
Tuang.

117
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,360
Move Dad's car back.

118
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,720
That should be enough room for mine.

119
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,679
Okay.

120
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,679
Top.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,080
Press the top button. Press it. Hurry!

122
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,679
If you spend money like this,

123
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,080
you will go broke one day.

124
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,759
Return your car tomorrow.

125
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,879
Be honest with me.

126
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
Are you betting on soccer games?

127
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,799
No.

128
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,120
I already told you,

129
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,639
I make money from online games.

130
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,720
Stop lying.

131
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,360
I already explained it,
but you just don't understand.

132
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,440
Top.

133
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,279
If you don't graduate,
you will be really sorry!

134
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,159
I'm warning you now.

135
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,799
All I want is for you

136
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,440
to study.

137
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,159
Can you not make us worry?

138
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,840
UNIVERSITY ADMISSION RESULTS OF 2003

139
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,559
EXAMINATION ID NUMBER

140
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,200
WE ARE SORRY TO SAY
THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCEPTED

141
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,840
Wow.

142
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,600
This is a whole new world.

143
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,879
The image is so clear.

144
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,159
There are

145
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
many new games.

146
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:25,559
You can watch movies too.

147
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,559
-Really?
-Yes.

148
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,200
But for movie lovers,

149
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,120
this one is better.

150
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
It's made in China.

151
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,519
It's only 800 baht.
It will get the job done.

152
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Get a new one if it breaks.

153
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,039
I see.

154
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,960
And

155
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
how much is

156
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,639
the PlayStation 2?

157
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,600
I can sell it to you

158
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,720
for 25,000.

159
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,399
How about 24,000?

160
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,559
Give me a discount.

161
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,600
Please don't haggle,
I barely marked it up.

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,759
Come on.

163
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,679
I haven't even looked around yet.

164
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,519
Fine.

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,240
I'll give you a 500-baht discount.

166
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,840
So it will be 24,500.

167
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,519
Are you okay with that?

168
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,080
What about this?

169
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,080
Don't give me a discount.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,720
I'll buy it for 25,000,

171
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,320
but give me the DVD player.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,080
No, I can't do that.

173
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,559
Eight hundred baht is too much.

174
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,960
I'll look around, then.

175
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,480
Wait. Fine, it's a deal.

176
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,559
Kid!

177
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Top.

178
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,639
Mom.

179
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you want to play games with me?

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,919
Wait.

181
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,679
How did the admission go?

182
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,679
I got accepted...

183
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,799
to a private university.

184
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,159
Private universities are good these days.

185
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,240
The tuition fee is around
50,000 to 60,000.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,919
It's not that expensive.

187
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,440
Please look after this client for me.

188
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,120
No problem, sir. I'll get going, then.

189
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,159
All right. Thanks.

190
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
Go to a community college.

191
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,159
Mom.

192
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
-A private--
-You didn't study hard.

193
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,559
So why are you complaining?

194
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,840
I will take care of it.

195
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,159
I have the money. I don't need yours.

196
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,080
Honey, what are we going to do about Top?

197
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,480
Let him go to a community college.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,639
How can he go to a community college?

199
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,240
How can he compete with others?

200
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,559
He might not graduate.

201
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,519
If he's going to work hard,
I wouldn't mind the cost.

202
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,399
You should understand how our son is.

203
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,919
You always spoil him.
No wonder he's a brat.

204
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,759
I won't allow it.
He'll go to a private university.

205
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,840
Does he know how bad the economy is now?

206
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,840
But his future is important too.

207
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,320
What?

208
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,559
You can't stop me now.

209
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,159
Hey, what's up?

210
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,759
Can you sell the DVD player
to me for 300 baht?

211
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,000
I want to buy them together.

212
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Come on, don't do that to me.

213
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,639
I got it for 800 baht.

214
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,840
Mister.

215
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,639
You were willing to sell the PlayStation 2
to me for 24,500, right?

216
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,080
I said I would pay 25,000 baht,

217
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,679
but you have to give me the DVD player.

218
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,120
You agreed to that deal.

219
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,440
That means you'll still make a profit
by selling the DVD player

220
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,559
for 500 baht.

221
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,559
Therefore, the cost of your DVD player

222
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,759
must be lower than 500 baht.

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,399
Wow.

224
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,960
You're a true businessman.

225
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,559
How many

226
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,279
are you planning to buy?

227
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,559
Fifty.

228
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,559
I thought you were going to buy
a thousand players.

229
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,039
All right.

230
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,919
The cheapest I can give you

231
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,360
is 500 baht each. Are you okay with that?

232
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,799
I see. So you're opening
a DVD player factory.

233
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
No.

234
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,000
This is just the beginning.

235
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,759
What? Just the beginning?

236
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,440
How much longer?

237
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,159
Can you please pay attention?

238
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,399
Are you done?

239
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,639
I haven't sent it yet.

240
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,320
All right. Make it short. Go on.

241
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Okay.

242
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,159
So Mom scolded me.

243
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,320
Why didn't you spend the money
on school supplies?

244
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,279
The image is clear.

245
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,399
It comes with a remote.

246
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,120
Now you will enjoy

247
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,960
watching your favorite movie even more.

248
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,279
Watch this.

249
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
What the hell?

250
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,399
My life went downhill.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
The DVD player broke.

252
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
How could you buy
a DVD player made in China?

253
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,879
Don't you know
that it only lasts for a few days?

254
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,159
It broke before I even sold any.
Give me new ones.

255
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,559
No exchanges. They have no warranty.

256
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,639
How come?

257
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,240
It's only 500 baht.

258
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,039
Just throw it away.

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,960
Why didn't you tell me before?

260
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,359
Only stupid people don't know it.

261
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
I can sue you, you know?

262
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,400
Go back to your mommy and daddy.

263
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,599
Take your shitty DVD players back!

264
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Shit.

265
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,920
This won't even cover half
of the money you ripped me off.

266
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,759
Dad.

267
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,319
I'm going home.

268
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,759
Do you want a ride?

269
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,599
Doing business

270
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,319
isn't as fun as playing online games.

271
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,119
I just think you should know.

272
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,440
I could have sold them all
if I wasn't conned.

273
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,319
Welcome to the real world.

274
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,960
When you lose, it can cost you everything.

275
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,839
Even adults can barely survive.

276
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,640
Kids are no exception to this reality.

277
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,440
I'm giving this to you

278
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,960
so you can study anywhere you want.

279
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,680
I am not one of your employees.

280
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,759
Let's start. All right.

281
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,599
The idea of our generation,

282
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,799
that we will study,
includes the product...

283
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
That was it.

284
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,759
I went back to school.

285
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,880
Hang on.

286
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,480
-Your dad gave you money. You declined.
-Yes.

287
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,160
How did you get the money for school?

288
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,960
Did you really go back to school?

289
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,920
Of course, I did.

290
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,200
How did you pay for your tuition?

291
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,839
You took your dad's money, right?

292
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,000
No, I really didn't take his money.

293
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,519
-Right? It came off.
-No.

294
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,519
-It came off.
-No.

295
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,799
Do you have an amulet to sell?

296
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,759
Do you have an amulet to sell?

297
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
Do you have an amulet to sell?

298
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,240
Mister.

299
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,039
I want to pawn an amulet.

300
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,880
Let me see it.

301
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,799
Here.

302
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
How much do you want?

303
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,640
I'll take...

304
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,160
a hundred thousand. That's it.

305
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,160
A hundred thousand?

306
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,559
Please, sir. Help me out.
It's for my tuition.

307
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,519
Fine.

308
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,559
A hundred thousand, it is.

309
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,440
I like to support people's education.

310
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,720
-The money is really for school, right?
-Of course.

311
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
All right.

312
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Here.

313
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,960
That was the first time I was in debt.

314
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,440
If you think you will be rich,
you will be rich.

315
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
If you think you will succeed,

316
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,599
you will succeed.

317
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,799
The company

318
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,400
used the Urban Forest Strategy plan

319
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,359
to become as successful

320
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,519
as they are today.

321
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,440
The Urban Forest Strategy plan

322
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,480
-consists of
-Fuck, Jack.

323
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,440
-creating relationships
-I can't do this. Let's leave.

324
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,799
-with our rural customers.
-No.

325
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,440
I'm a good student now.

326
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,880
Oh, please.
You're reading a soccer magazine.

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
But I'm listening to him.

328
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
I don't hear people
say "Bao Zheng" anymore.

329
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,079
Now, they only say "Bao." Our generation

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,920
pays attention to...

331
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
Top.

332
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,359
You know we are paying for
every second of class, right?

333
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,039
Here. Just hit the record button
for me, then.

334
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
I won't attend this class anymore.

335
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
I went back to school,

336
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,279
but I kept thinking about

337
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
what I could do
to get my dad's amulet back.

338
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,799
It's your turn.

339
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,319
Aod.

340
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,039
Those who can't follow the rules

341
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,880
will be punished.

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,079
Therefore,

343
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,039
all of you will do

344
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,319
public service

345
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,519
by picking up the trash
in front of this building

346
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,279
for the next three days.

347
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,519
You start today.

348
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,279
Now.

349
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,079
Right now.

350
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay.

351
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:27,559
Please proceed.

352
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,680
Make it slower. That was a bit too fast.

353
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,680
Okay.

354
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,599
And your voices were not balanced.

355
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,119
Oh, we forgot to warm up our voices.

356
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Hey.

357
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,720
How did you get here?

358
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,680
Why would you say that?

359
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,400
No, that's not what I meant.

360
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,640
Don't you have class today?

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,119
I have class, but you're not there.

362
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,920
I'd rather have you.

363
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,920
Well, you can't have me

364
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,599
because I have class.

365
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,920
Come on. Let's get some crab noodles.
I'm starving.

366
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:26,400
I can't. I have rehearsal tonight.

367
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,839
What?

368
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,519
We hardly ever get to meet.
Are you busy now too?

369
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,240
It's not that I'm busy,

370
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
you're just too free.

371
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,880
MUANG THONG THANI

372
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,319
You only need to invest 800,000 baht.

373
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,440
The admission fee of 400,000
will be waived. Today, you can...

374
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,720
Can I try them?

375
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,079
Yes, you can.

376
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,519
It's good.

377
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,039
-It's good.
-Is it good?

378
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,640
You can't miss this price.

379
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,359
You don't need to try it any longer.

380
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,599
We have a special promotion
for this event.

381
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,319
Three for a hundred.

382
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,720
Feel free to try it.

383
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,039
Please try our chestnuts.

384
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
-It's free.
-Can I try two?

385
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,400
Of course. Take some.

386
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,200
It's free.

387
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,000
Go ahead.

388
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,480
Hello, mister.

389
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,680
These chestnut baking machines
are on promotion. This way, please.

390
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:05,400
This machine

391
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,319
can control the temperature.

392
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,960
It can go from 150 to 180 degrees Celsius.

393
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,359
This way, the chestnuts will not explode.

394
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,519
And this mixing paddle
will mix the chestnuts

395
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,680
so that they are heated evenly.

396
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,720
We're the first company
to import it from Japan.

397
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,279
So if I buy this,

398
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
I'll be the first one, right?

399
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,279
Yes, you will.

400
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,480
How much is it?

401
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,799
It's very expensive.

402
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,759
I didn't ask if it was expensive.
I asked how much it costs.

403
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,559
What is this?

404
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,960
I'm going to sell chestnuts.

405
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,039
This machine automates the baking process

406
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,039
so I won't break my back.

407
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,960
How much did you pay for this?

408
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,440
They sold it for 500,000.

409
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,599
But I rented it for 50,000 baht.

410
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,920
You can buy one for 30,000

411
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,079
at the weekend market.

412
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,960
It's okay, honey.

413
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,799
What's done is done.

414
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,759
I dreamed about Guan Yin last night.

415
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,400
She carried something black in her hand.

416
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,160
It must be a good sign.

417
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,240
Everything on the whiteboard
will be on the exam.

418
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,640
If you have any questions

419
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,559
or if there's something
you don't understand,

420
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,440
please ask me now.

421
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,079
Are there any questions?

422
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,920
Mister.

423
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,160
Why must you soak the chestnuts?

424
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,200
So I can tell which ones are spoiled
and which are not.

425
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Really?

426
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,720
How can you tell?

427
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,960
The floating ones are spoiled.

428
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,519
The sinking ones are still good.

429
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,240
Then what will you do?

430
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,440
I'll roast them.

431
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,000
And then what?

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,079
Pay up.

433
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,079
When trying to gather economic data

434
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,039
 to analyze a business,

435
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,799
you should gather information
from various sources.

436
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,839
What would you like?

437
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,119
Wow.

438
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,839
Your chestnuts have the best smell
around here.

439
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,519
What type of coffee do you use?

440
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,039
Try it yourself.

441
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,119
There will be a ten-point quiz
at the end of class.

442
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,720
The questions require a lot of details.

443
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,519
In my opinion,

444
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,039
you must understand this thoroughly

445
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,279
before you can graduate from this faculty.

446
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,960
Sweet chestnuts!

447
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,359
Hello.

448
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,240
-Get them here.
-How much is one box?

449
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,680
Only 280 baht.

450
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,279
-I'll take one.
-Wait a second.

451
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,039
Shit.

452
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,559
Am I going to die?

453
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:04,960
Tuang.

454
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,880
Please try my chestnuts.

455
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,960
What does that face mean?

456
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,680
Mom, try it.

457
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,119
I think it's delicious.

458
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,720
Everything is ready.

459
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,839
Everyone has already signed it.

460
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,359
Here, read it.

461
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,519
Okay.

462
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,759
I'll head back now.

463
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,519
The chestnuts are good.
Did you buy them in Chinatown?

464
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,359
No, Top is roasting them here.

465
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,079
He wants to sell chestnuts.

466
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Your son works very hard.

467
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,559
He wants to be a Tao Kae Noi.

468
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,519
SHOP'S NAME: TAO KAE NOI CHESTNUT

469
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,160
Here, it's the last spot.

470
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Do you want it?

471
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,759
-Right here?
-Yes.

472
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
What would you like?

473
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,759
One spicy salad.

474
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,440
-How spicy?
-A little spicy.

475
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,359
-Do you want sauce on the side?
-Make it a large.

476
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,160
A lot of veggies?

477
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,319
One second.

478
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,599
Thirty baht.

479
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,839
TAO KAE NOI CHESTNUT

480
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,799
Come on, Top. We're almost there.

481
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,599
Shit.

482
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,319
I'm not cut out for this work.

483
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,079
What's that for?

484
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,400
Your mom told me to put it here.

485
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,360
Come on.

486
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,360
The chestnuts will sell themselves.

487
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,239
We don't need any superstitions.

488
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,679
Did we sell 600 grams?

489
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,639
Did you fall asleep?

490
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,239
No, I didn't, Top.

491
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,039
Thank you.

492
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,039
Four sticks? Please line up.

493
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,559
-Please line up.
-Did you do that?

494
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,280
Dancing meatballs. Four sticks?

495
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
-I did. I yelled too.
-The meatballs are hot and yummy.

496
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,400
But I can't beat her voice.

497
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,239
Her voice is so loud and sweet.

498
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,400
Tuang, this is not American Idol.

499
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,800
We're here to sell.

500
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
We need to be repetitive

501
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and loud.

502
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:07,960
Is that so?

503
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,119
Yes. Let's do it.

504
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,280
All right, then.

505
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,599
-Here we go.
-Yes.

506
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,239
Line up, please.

507
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,400
Hang on, Pretty Face.

508
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,079
Chestnuts!

509
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,400
Get your chestnuts here.

510
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,800
-Tuang.
-Chestnuts.

511
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,239
-Hot chestnuts.
-Hot chestnuts!

512
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,039
-Hot chestnuts.
-Yes.

513
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,199
They taste good.

514
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,760
-That's good.
-Tasty chestnuts.

515
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,960
-Good.
-This way! Chestnuts!

516
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,480
Chestnuts!

517
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,960
-Get your chestnuts here.
-Tell them it's from Chinatown.

518
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,760
These chestnuts

519
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,400
taste just like the ones in Chinatown.

520
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,639
They're the same.

521
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,199
Call them over with your hands too.

522
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,719
-Chestnuts! This way.
-Yes.

523
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,559
-Get your chestnuts here.
-That's good.

524
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,159
Tasty chestnuts over here.

525
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,320
They taste like the ones in Chinatown.
Chestnuts.

526
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,039
Very delicious chestnuts.

527
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,480
Hello. Everyone, gather round.

528
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,039
Today's special deal is for shorts.

529
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,639
Buy three and get one for free.
Buy five and get two for free.

530
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,960
Buy more and get more free stuff.

531
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,840
Come on. Gather round.

532
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,880
This way.

533
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,920
The promotion is only for today.

534
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,360
You won't get it tomorrow.

535
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
-Shirts for 69 and 96 baht.
-Come on.

536
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,760
Short sleeves for 69
and long sleeves for 96.

537
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,880
Come on, everyone.

538
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,079
This way, please.
Sixty baht for every item.

539
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,400
It's the cheapest price on the planet.

540
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,920
Choose your shirts here.

541
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,760
Our shirts are unisex.

542
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,360
-We have all sizes.
-Top.

543
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,320
-Please stop by.
-Do you want a shirt?

544
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,639
No.

545
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,440
It's perfect for the beach.

546
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,400
If you don't buy one today,
it won't be on sale tomorrow.

547
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
I don't get it.

548
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,960
You're the actress.
Why must you do the shopping?

549
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,639
I'm just helping out.

550
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,360
Are you getting paid?

551
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,039
Of course not. It's for the drama club.

552
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,920
How much are the tickets?

553
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,719
Why are you asking all these questions?

554
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,960
It doesn't seem worth it.

555
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,880
I don't care if it's worth it or not.

556
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,440
I want to do it.

557
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,079
For what?

558
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,679
I like it.

559
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,679
Is that all?

560
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
I don't know. I think

561
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,079
it's weird to not get paid
for your hard work.

562
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,599
I'm not tired. If you are, just go home.

563
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,719
Hang on, Lin.

564
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,920
Top.

565
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840
Business isn't good today.

566
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,159
What? Speak louder. I can't hear you.

567
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,599
Business isn't good today.

568
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,320
Other shops are packed.

569
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,800
But I don't know why no one visits ours.

570
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,599
Did you yell the way I told you to?

571
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,440
I did. I yelled the whole time.

572
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,119
I need your help here.

573
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,639
So what do you want me to do?

574
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,360
I don't know what else to do.

575
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,280
I'll call you back, Tuang.

576
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,360
Next time,
if you need to talk on the phone,

577
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,400
don't bother coming.

578
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,559
Don't be like that.

579
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,880
It was important.

580
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,760
I was talking to Tuang. See?

581
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,559
Call back the number.

582
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,320
I can't. It was from a public phone.

583
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
That's a convenient excuse.

584
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,840
Don't let me find out.

585
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,360
It's the truth.

586
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,760
How can I make you believe me?

587
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,639
Let's go home.

588
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,639
I'm going to the restroom.
Please hold these for me.

589
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,159
Bubbles, anyone? Bubbles.

590
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,599
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,440
Please donate your spare change
to help rural children.

592
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,960
Help rural children.

593
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:13,719
-Help the children.
-Help the children.

594
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,840
Please donate.

595
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,039
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

596
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,920
Help rural children.

597
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
Please donate your spare change
to help rural children.

598
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,280
Thank you.

599
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,719
We volunteer to help those in need.

600
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,559
1. FREE GIFTS 2. DISCOUNTS 3. CHARITY

601
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,360
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

602
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,840
Goodwill fundraising
looks like an easy way to raise money.

603
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,519
You've never done it
so don't talk that way.

604
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,840
Hey, I'm genuinely impressed.

605
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,199
It's so damn smart to wait
in front of the restroom for change.

606
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,719
It's a great location.

607
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,559
The location...

608
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,679
LOCATION

609
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,760
Sir.

610
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,760
I would like to move my store here.

611
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,119
The area is all taken.

612
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,800
I'll close the shop, then.

613
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,199
It's useless to sell in the parking lot.

614
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:32,920
If you close before your contract is up,
we won't refund your deposit.

615
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,760
You can't be serious, right?

616
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,760
Yes. Didn't you read the contract?

617
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,719
Hold on.

618
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,840
Hey, can you check

619
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,119
if there's any booth moving out
from A Zone?

620
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,159
All right. One booth will move out
at the end of the month.

621
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,239
Are you interested?

622
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,559
But you must sign the contract today.

623
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I think

624
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,639
you should ask your parents first.

625
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,960
If you were me, would you take it?

626
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,960
This is a prime location. Trust me.

627
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,199
I'm all for it.

628
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,039
The rental fee is 24,000 baht, right?

629
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,519
You'll earn that back in no time.

630
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,400
280 BAHT PER KILOGRAM

631
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,480
This place is haunted.

632
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,039
It's still too early to tell.

633
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,280
Whose phone is ringing?
Please turn it off.

634
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,519
Professor, may I pick up the phone?

635
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,639
No, you may not.

636
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,039
If you do, I will have to report
that you cheated.

637
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,039
Turn off your mobile phone now.

638
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,599
Top, come back here.

639
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,880
This is a mandatory subject.

640
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,880
What did you say?

641
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,039
Make it hot.

642
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,400
One kilo of hot chestnuts, please.

643
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,960
Okay. All good things take time.

644
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,800
All delicious things take time.

645
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,039
Hang on. Please wait.
It will heat up soon.

646
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,880
Here.

647
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Hang on.

648
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,960
This machine heats up fast.
Don't go anywhere.

649
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,000
All right.

650
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,639
Okay.

651
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:56,440
-Three hundred baht.
-Three hundred baht,

652
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:58,280
-so here's 20 back.
-Yes.

653
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,159
-Tuang.
-Hang on. It's ready.

654
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,480
Let's open more branches.

655
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,480
Hey.

656
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,159
Slow down, Top. This is our first day.

657
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:09,199
Listen.

658
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,039
We are selling like crazy
on our first day.

659
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,719
If we sell two sacks a day,
we'll have 4,000 baht.

660
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,480
That's 120,000 a month.

661
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,360
And if we have ten branches,

662
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,360
wow,

663
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,199
we'll get 1.2 million each month.

664
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,079
Shall we do it? What do you think?

665
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,360
I don't think we should.

666
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,960
Can we handle them all?

667
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,400
-I think we should do it.
-What?

668
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,679
Why did you ask me, then?

669
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,079
Mister.

670
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,159
Put it next to that one.

671
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,880
Okay. Move it a bit, just a little.

672
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:43,639
All right. That's good.

673
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,360
Please sign here.

674
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,360
Mister, I'll meet you at the other branch.

675
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,280
All right.

676
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,760
-Set the temperature at 120 Celsius.
-At 120 Celsius.

677
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,159
Roast two kilograms each time.

678
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,400
Don't put too many pebbles

679
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:02,960
-because it won't mix well.
-I see.

680
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:03,960
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

681
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,079
Okay. You can start now.

682
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,840
Keep these chestnuts in place.

683
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,360
Are we still dating?

684
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,440
Who told you?

685
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,639
Why did I have to hear it
from someone else?

686
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,039
Have I ever hidden anything from you?

687
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,800
If you knew that I was selling chestnuts,

688
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,559
what would you have said?

689
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,760
Are you ashamed?

690
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,239
What kind of person do you think I am?

691
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,039
I'm worried about you.

692
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,760
Don't put your future at risk.

693
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,880
Go back to school.

694
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,760
Fuck you, Jack. Why did you tell Lin?

695
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,760
Shithead, it wasn't me.

696
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:55,960
You disappeared.

697
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,480
Lin called me.
She thought you were cheating on her.

698
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,920
So I said I had no idea.

699
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,719
Then she called your mom.

700
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,599
Will you come back to school?

701
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,239
Your booth is causing damage.

702
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:11,960
Can you see that?

703
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,880
The smoke is turning the ceiling yellow.

704
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,519
Please get it fixed.

705
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,440
Of course, there would be smoke
from roasting chestnuts.

706
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,679
It is a violation of your rental contract.

707
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,159
If you can't fix this,

708
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,480
we'll have to cancel your contract.

709
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,920
Cancel my contract?

710
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,239
I'm sorry.

711
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,519
You can't do that.

712
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,039
Do you have a way to fix it?

713
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,400
Yes, I do.

714
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:56,840
Hey.

715
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,159
Hey.

716
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,719
You can't paint it now.

717
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,199
It's bothering customers.
Paint it after the mall closes.

718
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:07,519
Mom.

719
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,440
Hold it well. It's shaking.

720
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,400
I am. I thought it was steady.

721
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,480
It's almost midnight.

722
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,119
If you weren't here,
I would have finished already.

723
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,519
Are you tired? Can I do it for you?

724
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,199
Mom, you're not helping.

725
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,239
Mister, time's up. You have to leave now.

726
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,480
Sir.

727
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,320
Please give me a bit more time.

728
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,920
It's not done yet.

729
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,719
But your request form
only allows you to stay until midnight.

730
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,760
Sir.

731
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:53,760
Please give me more time.

732
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,320
I can't. Your time is up.

733
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:58,920
If my boss sees you,

734
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:00,519
I'll get in trouble.

735
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,159
Here.

736
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,400
Are you his mother?

737
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:24,559
Yes.

738
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,119
Please discipline your son.

739
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:34,320
Take all your things
and exit that way, please.

740
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,360
Please stop, Top. That's enough.

741
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:56,000
No, I will finish it tomorrow.

742
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,760
-There's time.
-No, there isn't.

743
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,559
Go get your passport tomorrow.

744
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:10,199
We'll move to China
at the end of the month

745
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,039
to stay with your brother and sister.

746
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,679
We are in debt, aren't we?

747
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:33,719
Why doesn't anyone tell me anything?

748
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,760
You don't need to know.
It's not your concern.

749
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:46,159
How much debt are we in?

750
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,639
Mom, tell me, how much?

751
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,880
Don't worry.

752
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,800
My chestnut business is going well.

753
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,679
I only need
to finish painting the ceiling.

754
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,039
Come with us.

755
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,400
At least we can be together.

756
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,760
Please.

757
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,639
Excuse me, please look at the camera.

758
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:57,400
Get ready.

759
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,000
Hey.

760
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,079
Mom.

761
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,159
I am not going.

762
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,000
-I will stay here and study.
-Go back and take your photo.

763
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,840
You wanted to pay me to study, right?

764
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,280
I'm ready to be your employee now, Dad.

765
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,679
Fine.

766
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,960
Stay if you want.

767
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
I'll wait for you inside.

768
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,880
You should stop

769
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,320
with the chestnuts.

770
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,599
Go back to school.

771
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,239
Top.

772
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,079
I'm sorry that...

773
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:47,159
I need you to move out your booths.

774
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,320
Every branch?

775
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,960
All of them.

776
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,840
My boss really can't allow it.

777
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:54,519
I'm truly sorry.

778
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:05,440
Mister.

779
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:08,360
The paint is dripping
on my store's lucky charm.

780
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,239
You ruined my spiritual altar.

781
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,320
My glasses have stains too.

782
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,039
Please take responsibility.

783
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,440
Look.

784
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,360
Yes. How can I sell them like this?

785
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,320
CENTRAL BANKRUPTCY COURT

786
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,320
WE WILL HAVE TO SEIZE YOUR HOUSE AND LAND

787
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:20,639
I really like the backdrop.

788
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,920
-Yes, it's gorgeous.
-I agree.

789
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,880
They made it so well.
When you take pictures...

790
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,239
I really want to see it.

791
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,679
I'm scared that our year will...

792
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,760
And other people will...

793
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:46,599
What's wrong with you?

794
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,960
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

795
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,239
Hey, Top.

796
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,239
Top, what's wrong?

797
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,920
Top.

798
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,440
Forget about the chestnuts.

799
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,039
Top.

800
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:22,480
Go back to school.

801
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,719
Your high school diploma

802
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,360
won't get you anywhere.

803
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,760
Please, Top.

804
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:31,119
Please.

805
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,159
I will help you.

806
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,119
Fine.

807
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,280
Do you promise?

808
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,199
Yes.

809
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,159
Let's go to Chinatown, then.

810
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,840
It's been a while.
I miss the crab noodles.

811
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,559
The traffic is bad
and there is no parking.

812
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:52,239
No problem.

813
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,800
I can wait. I just came back
from a trip with my family.

814
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,840
Look. I brought back some fried seaweed.

815
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,679
It must be really good.
You even brought it back.

816
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
You're crazy.

817
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,960
Just drive. I'll feed you some.

818
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,280
If you tell me
you tried frying the seaweed,

819
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,719
I'll go to lunch right now.

820
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,199
Yes. Here are my scars from the oil.

821
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,400
Damn.

822
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,880
At first, I bought some seaweed
from another province.

823
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,559
But I was unlucky,

824
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,199
it all went stale within a week.

825
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,840
Wow. You are indeed unlucky.

826
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,440
It got worse.

827
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:25,119
When I asked
if they could do something about it,

828
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,719
they said they didn't know how.

829
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,719
I begged them for three days.

830
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,239
But they didn't care.

831
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:31,599
We ended up arguing.

832
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,519
What happened next?

833
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,480
Don't tell me
you got your butt kicked again.

834
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:35,880
I did the butt kicking this time.

835
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,559
-Yes, they deserved it.
-Right?

836
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,880
-Right.
-Yes!

837
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,639
In the end, I had to fry it myself.

838
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,039
So how did you solve the problem?
Even they couldn't do it.

839
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,760
Kasetsart University could.

840
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:50,039
HEAD OF FOOD PROCESSING
AND MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT

841
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,400
You're not a student here.

842
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,840
How did you get her to help?

843
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,440
You don't have to care about
who I am or how old I am.

844
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,840
Just listen to me first.

845
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,519
My name is

846
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,719
Itthipat

847
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,159
Kulapongvanich.

848
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,599
So I told the professor

849
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,440
the same story I told you.

850
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,599
Here's some tissue, Professor.

851
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,679
There's oil in your fried seaweed,

852
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,159
just like this rice crackers.

853
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,639
It will oxidize and cause it to go stale.

854
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
The solution is vacuum packaging.

855
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,320
Look.

856
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:55,239
The vacuum keeps oxygen out of the bag.

857
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,760
So, your seaweed is crispy, right?

858
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,880
-Yes.
-So, it can break.

859
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,039
We must put nitrogen in there instead.

860
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:04,719
It will prolong the shelf-life by far.

861
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,800
I see.

862
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:08,079
There.

863
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:10,960
See? That's it.

864
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,920
So I just need to buy this machine, right?

865
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,519
Yes, that's right.

866
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,039
Now it is up to you to find a way
to make it delicious.

867
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:34,559
Go.

868
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,440
Is this all we got for those machines?

869
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,559
Each box costs 10,000 baht.

870
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,719
Wow.

871
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:24,280
Why is it bitter?

872
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,239
I guess it's burnt.

873
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,320
Yes, that's enough.

874
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:56,320
Why is it so soggy?

875
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,079
Maybe it has too much oil.

876
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:01,440
Damn it.

877
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,800
Tuang.

878
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,760
Let's eat.

879
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,559
What should we do?

880
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:18,800
We're running out.

881
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,679
We can get more.

882
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,719
We can probably get
five or six more boxes.

883
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,400
-Top.
-Yes?

884
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:55,199
I don't want to do this anymore.

885
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,440
I wasted 100,000 baht worth of seaweed.

886
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,559
I don't want to waste any more money.

887
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:07,920
Just because you've wasted 100,000 baht,

888
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,760
doesn't mean you should give up now.

889
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,920
Please don't make me waste anymore.

890
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,039
Please.

891
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,360
I'm begging you.

892
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,920
Waste some more.

893
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,039
A lot more.

894
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,119
I believe

895
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:27,840
that you can get it back for me.

896
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,360
Hello, are you here yet?

897
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,000
What are you talking about?

898
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,480
The university admission.

899
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:57,440
Oh, my god. Wait for me there.

900
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:03,519
UNIVERSITY ADMISSION

901
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,800
You already forgot everything?

902
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:12,800
DOCUMENTS VERIFICATION

903
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:14,480
I have to check...

904
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:36,360
Come on, Tuang. It's all or nothing.

905
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,360
Let's fry some more seaweed.

906
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,239
Tuang!

907
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,920
You've reached the voicemail system.

908
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,439
Please leave a message...

909
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,560
You've reached the voicemail system.

910
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,760
Please leave a message...

911
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:00,279
How are you?

912
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,119
I'm okay.

913
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,960
I can go home in a few days.

914
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:09,119
I guess you can eat now, right?

915
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,039
Yes. I already ate the congee

916
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,199
the nurse gave me. I ate it all up.

917
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:22,319
Oh, you asked

918
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,520
because you want me
to taste your seaweed, right?

919
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,560
That's right.

920
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,720
I wonder what I've ever done to you.

921
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,159
Please taste it.

922
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,319
Is it that delicious?

923
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,319
No.

924
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,439
My tongue is still numb.

925
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,119
Can you taste it now?

926
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,520
How did you do it?

927
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,760
-Two bags, please.
-Two bags?

928
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,880
Can you give me a discount?

929
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,079
No, I really can't.

930
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,319
It's very difficult for the divers
to get the seaweed.

931
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,920
They had to fight off sharks

932
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,760
and giant octopuses.

933
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,520
-See?
-You're funny.

934
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,439
They're selling well.

935
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,720
Selling is fun when you do it.

936
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,760
-One of these.
-Yes, of course.

937
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,840
Hang on.

938
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,439
Two bags, please.

939
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:45,359
Here.

940
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,279
It's guaranteed to be delicious.

941
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:50,640
-I'm sure you'll come back.
-Is this your son?

942
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,840
Oh, he's my nephew.

943
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,159
Two bags, please.

944
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:57,319
Two bags will be 160 baht.

945
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:00,319
-I'll get one bag.
-All right. Hang on.

946
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,439
-That'll be 160 baht. No change needed.
-Yes.

947
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,880
Thank you.

948
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,479
-I don't need a bag.
-Wait for the change.

949
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,680
-No bag.
-No bag?

950
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,119
-Your change.
-Stop global warming.

951
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:09,079
ONE MILLION A YEAR

952
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:11,000
Here's your 20 baht.

953
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:12,760
-No bag.
-It shouldn't be too hard.

954
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,359
Here. It's guaranteed.

955
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,640
One bag? There are two of you, though.

956
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,199
MOM

957
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,079
Here. I'm sure you'll fight for it.

958
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:23,159
Hello.

959
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:25,039
Hello, Top. How are you?

960
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,800
I'm good.

961
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,680
Are you in class?

962
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,840
Well...

963
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,159
I'm not.

964
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:35,479
I don't have class today.

965
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
I can talk.

966
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:38,399
There's nothing much.

967
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,119
I just want to wish you a happy birthday.

968
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,640
That's right.

969
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,760
It's my birthday.

970
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,439
Are you that forgetful now?

971
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,399
Happy birthday again.

972
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:53,920
Study hard.

973
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,600
You win some,

974
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:58,600
you lose some.

975
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:00,520
But remember

976
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,000
to take care of yourself.

977
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:04,319
Make sure you get enough sleep.

978
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:07,399
Thank you, Mom.

979
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:10,199
Hang on.

980
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,640
Dad wants to talk to you.

981
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,199
ONE MILLION A YEAR

982
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:19,479
Hello, Dad.

983
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:22,279
Top.

984
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,960
Listen to me.

985
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,359
Study hard this semester.

986
01:12:29,319 --> 01:12:30,520
Next semester,

987
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:32,640
you can transfer here.

988
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,119
I checked out a university for you.

989
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,840
I'll send you

990
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,079
the plane ticket.

991
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:45,239
Dad.

992
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Can you tell me the truth about the debt?

993
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:54,199
Be honest with me.

994
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,119
How much is it?

995
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,800
It's 40 million.

996
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,319
Have you ever felt so small?

997
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
FOR SALE, PROPERTY OF THE BANK

998
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:34,199
If you think you will be rich,
you will be rich.

999
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,640
If you think you will succeed,
you will succeed

1000
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:40,640
because you'll be
thinking without the box.

1001
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,520
Thinking without the box

1002
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,239
is more powerful
than thinking outside the box

1003
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,560
because each person
has a different kind of box.

1004
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:23,640
Today,

1005
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,960
the Urban Forest Strategy plan

1006
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,359
consists of creating relationships

1007
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:31,640
-with our rural customers.
-No.

1008
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,199
-I'm a good student now.
-We use it

1009
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:34,119
with many products.

1010
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:36,840
Oh, please.
You're reading a soccer magazine.

1011
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,079
But I'm listening to him.

1012
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:41,720
I don't hear people
say "Bao Zheng" anymore.

1013
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,920
Now, they only say "Bao."

1014
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,439
Our generation pays attention to

1015
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,840
 rural customers...

1016
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,319
Would you like dumplings
or buns with that?

1017
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,840
One Cheese Bite, please.

1018
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,800
We ran out. Do you want something else?

1019
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:00,960
Never mind, then.

1020
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,119
One Cheese Bite, please.

1021
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:52,720
If you think you will be rich,
you will be rich.

1022
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,600
If you think you will succeed,

1023
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,319
-you will succeed.
-It's been years.

1024
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,439
Rich, my ass. It's all bullshit.

1025
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,159
...Urban Forest Strategy plan

1026
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,600
to become as successful...

1027
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,680
Thank you.

1028
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,520
The Urban Forest Strategy plan

1029
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,680
consists of

1030
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,319
creating relationships

1031
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,359
-with our rural customers.
-No.

1032
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:14,680
-I'm a good student now.
-We use it with many products.

1033
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,319
Oh, please.
You're reading a soccer magazine.

1034
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,319
But I'm listening to him.

1035
01:18:19,399 --> 01:18:22,319
I don't hear people
say "Bao Zheng" anymore.

1036
01:18:22,439 --> 01:18:23,439
Now, they only say "Bao."

1037
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,399
Our generation pays attention to

1038
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:28,079
-rural customers.
-Top.

1039
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,239
You know we are paying for
every second of class, right?

1040
01:18:30,319 --> 01:18:32,479
Here. Just hit the record button
for me, then.

1041
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,880
In order to use the Urban Forest Strategy

1042
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,239
with true knowledge and understanding,

1043
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:40,560
-The Urban Forest Strategy.
-it would be very good

1044
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,159
if you understand

1045
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,720
-All over the country.
-the strategy first.

1046
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,600
It would be useful.

1047
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,760
Hello.

1048
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:00,920
I would like to sell my product
in 7-Eleven. What should I do?

1049
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:03,880
I would like to sell my product
in 7-Eleven. What should I do?

1050
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:29,960
From where?

1051
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:32,600
Magnum Banana Sticky Rice

1052
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,680
proudly presents

1053
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,119
the perfect balance

1054
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,159
of Western and Eastern culture.

1055
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,760
Just think of it as a Thai-fusion snack.

1056
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,000
It's easy to eat.

1057
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:46,039
Let's try again.

1058
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:49,319
Magnum Banana Sticky Rice

1059
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:51,600
proudly presents

1060
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,039
the perfect balance

1061
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:56,199
of Western and Eastern culture.

1062
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,199
It's easy to eat.
Your hands won't get messy.

1063
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,359
Just think of it as a Thai-fusion snack.

1064
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,880
I'd like to use the Urban Forest Strategy
that 7-Eleven uses now.

1065
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,199
Since 7-Eleven has branches
all over the country,

1066
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:08,079
lots of people will see my product.

1067
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:10,800
The strategy that 7-Eleven uses

1068
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,119
suits my product well.

1069
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:14,119
And if my company and your company

1070
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:15,520
work together,

1071
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,039
I believe we will have

1072
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,800
a good future together.

1073
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:20,439
I believe

1074
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,079
we'll have a good future together.

1075
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:34,960
All done. Thank you very much.

1076
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,199
Thank you.

1077
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:44,359
Excuse me,
didn't you come with your father?

1078
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:48,399
He wasn't my father.

1079
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:52,439
I have an appointment with Pu at 9 a.m.

1080
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,039
But I haven't been called yet.

1081
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,720
Have you given your name
to the front desk?

1082
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:57,720
What?

1083
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,199
Was I supposed to do that?

1084
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,319
Of course. Otherwise,
how would I know that you arrived?

1085
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:06,439
Then,

1086
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,560
my name is Itthipat.

1087
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:10,479
Let me check. Please wait.

1088
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,680
Young man, Pu's in a meeting.

1089
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,319
Would you like to leave a note?

1090
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,880
No, thank you.

1091
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,000
It was my fault. I'll wait for her.

1092
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,560
Hello, this is CP Company.

1093
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,439
Who is this?

1094
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,640
All right. Please hold on.

1095
01:21:45,159 --> 01:21:46,399
Hello.

1096
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:52,319
Hello, this is CP Company.

1097
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:54,640
How may I help you?

1098
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,479
Pu, this is Itthipat.

1099
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,000
Did he send his assistant here?

1100
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:06,159
No, this is Itthipat himself.

1101
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,760
Hello, Itthipat. I'm Pu.

1102
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,279
-Hello.
-Hello.

1103
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:15,159
I have another meeting at 5:10 p.m.

1104
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:17,199
So please leave your product with me

1105
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,960
and I will take a look later.

1106
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,000
May I have ten minutes of your time?

1107
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:23,199
I'd like to present the product myself.

1108
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,119
Okay, go ahead.

1109
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,279
So let me tell you about my product.

1110
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,159
My product is fried seaweed.

1111
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:32,319
Itthipat, can I see your product?

1112
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:35,039
Sure.

1113
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:41,239
Here you go.

1114
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,760
I'd like to use the Urban Forest Strategy

1115
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,520
that 7-Eleven uses now.

1116
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,640
Since 7-Eleven has branches
all over the country,

1117
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,640
lots of people will see my product.

1118
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,079
I believe that this strategy--

1119
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,359
Your product isn't ready.

1120
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:00,479
How come?

1121
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,399
The packaging design won't make it.

1122
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,640
The size is also too big for our shelves.

1123
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,319
What is your retail price?

1124
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:13,479
It's not that expensive. Only 80 baht.

1125
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,600
That's expensive.

1126
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,520
We are a convenience store.

1127
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,039
Eighty baht won't be convenient anymore.

1128
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,119
I am sorry.

1129
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,279
-Pu.
-Yes?

1130
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,760
Don't you want to try some first?

1131
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,439
That's all right. It would be a waste.

1132
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:32,840
Okay, we're done here.

1133
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:35,800
By the way,

1134
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,359
the Urban Forest Strategy

1135
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:39,640
is when you start from the countryside,

1136
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,479
then make your way into a big city.

1137
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,159
I think you misunderstood the strategy.

1138
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,640
Top.

1139
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,680
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

1140
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,800
I'm breaking my promise.

1141
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:13,800
I won't go to university anymore.

1142
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,720
Still, you should talk to me.

1143
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,720
Why did you turn off your phone?

1144
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,960
If I told you I quit school,

1145
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,840
what would you do?

1146
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:31,800
I know you want to help your parents,

1147
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,880
but what you can do

1148
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:36,880
is to graduate.

1149
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,680
You don't think I can do this, do you?

1150
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,479
That's why you want me back in school.

1151
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,479
I don't want you to struggle

1152
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,319
or risk losing everything.

1153
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:56,000
If you actually believed in me,

1154
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:57,920
you wouldn't be saying this.

1155
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,000
If it's about money,

1156
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:02,479
I can ask my parents for help.

1157
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,159
I haven't hit rock bottom yet.

1158
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,000
I don't need your help.

1159
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,000
That's not what I meant, Top.

1160
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,720
Top, that's not

1161
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,119
-what I meant.
-I can make it work.

1162
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,359
It will work, do you hear me?

1163
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:15,800
Top, come back and talk to me.

1164
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,520
Don't go, Top.

1165
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,199
Top.

1166
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:23,640
Top!

1167
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,000
Top, am I so wrong for worrying about you?

1168
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:29,319
You should go home.

1169
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,800
Come back and talk to me.

1170
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,720
Top!

1171
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,159
Top, come back.

1172
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,840
Tuang.

1173
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,439
Can I sleep with you tonight?

1174
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:00,039
Sure.

1175
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,840
Tuang.

1176
01:27:27,479 --> 01:27:29,119
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1177
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:34,680
She loves me.

1178
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,159
She's worried about me.

1179
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:46,760
But I chased her away.

1180
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,359
Don't cry, Top.

1181
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,920
Mister.

1182
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:06,279
Can you design a package
that looks like these?

1183
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,199
What is the concept of your product?

1184
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,680
I want it to be for youngsters,
Korean Pop style.

1185
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:14,640
The brand's name is

1186
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:16,199
Jay Chou.

1187
01:28:16,279 --> 01:28:18,520
Jay Chou is a Taiwanese singer.

1188
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,520
Really?

1189
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,319
Isn't he Korean?

1190
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:22,640
No.

1191
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:26,359
I think "Tao Kae Noi"

1192
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:27,760
is already a good name.

1193
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:30,840
Doesn't it sound old

1194
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:32,560
because of the meaning?

1195
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,840
Listen.

1196
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,119
It's up to the designer to decide that.

1197
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,680
I'm Itthipat.

1198
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,439
I'd like to make an appointment with Pu.
I have a product to present to her.

1199
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,680
Did you make an appointment?

1200
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:56,119
The thing is,

1201
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:58,159
I just finished re-designing
the packaging this morning.

1202
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,159
I want Pu to see it right away.

1203
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,359
Pu has appointments all day.

1204
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,920
That's okay. I can wait.

1205
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,279
Hello.

1206
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:46,520
Okay. Do you want to send a fax?

1207
01:29:52,039 --> 01:29:53,239
Hello.

1208
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:16,399
Excuse me.

1209
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,800
I'm leaving.

1210
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:19,000
I understand now.

1211
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,560
Pu didn't really
have appointments, did she?

1212
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,079
TAO KAE NOI

1213
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,520
Mister.

1214
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:41,359
Have you eaten yet?

1215
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,880
Not yet.

1216
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:51,119
Here.

1217
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:55,640
-Wait.
-No.

1218
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,560
Hello. You guys are here.

1219
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:02,199
Where's Itthipat?

1220
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:03,680
He went home.

1221
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:04,920
I see.

1222
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:30,720
Hello, Mom.

1223
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:32,119
What's up?

1224
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:35,479
What are you doing?

1225
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,960
Can I talk to you?

1226
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,159
Yes, you can.

1227
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,079
Is something wrong?

1228
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,840
No.

1229
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,159
I just felt like talking to you.

1230
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:57,119
How's school?

1231
01:32:57,279 --> 01:32:58,520
Your grades from last semester

1232
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,920
must be out now.

1233
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:01,279
How are they?

1234
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,159
What is this?

1235
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,960
A boy gave them to me.

1236
01:33:09,159 --> 01:33:10,159
Hey.

1237
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,039
It's seaweed.

1238
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,720
Can I take some?

1239
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,960
Go ahead.

1240
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,159
-See you later.
-Okay.

1241
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:19,720
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

1242
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,119
I stepped on it.

1243
01:33:27,319 --> 01:33:29,039
My grades are not so good.

1244
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,920
That's all right.

1245
01:33:31,479 --> 01:33:32,720
I'm just happy

1246
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:34,359
that you're in school.

1247
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:39,039
My beautiful Oum,

1248
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,800
I...

1249
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,279
bought you some seaweed
since you might be tired from work.

1250
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,159
I studied hard for it.

1251
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,720
I was too confident in myself.

1252
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:58,000
Maybe I'm just stupid.

1253
01:33:58,079 --> 01:33:59,560
-Take it.
-What is it?

1254
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,760
-Eat the rest too. It's good.
-All right.

1255
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,840
-I can eat it, right?
-Yes.

1256
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,920
The board concluded
not to accept any more products.

1257
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,640
It's like every door has been shut.

1258
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:11,439
Top.

1259
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,279
Don't give up.

1260
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,600
Your grades

1261
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,159
are a small problem.

1262
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,199
You will face

1263
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,119
bigger problems in life.

1264
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,960
Oum, I have a meeting outside.

1265
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:31,880
Yes, ma'am.

1266
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:43,279
Hello, Dang. Isn't your shift over yet?

1267
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:45,520
-It will be soon.
-I see.

1268
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:54,439
So...

1269
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,359
my product passed, right?

1270
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:58,319
Yes.

1271
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,640
Congratulations.

1272
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,399
You're the youngest business owner

1273
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:02,920
that I've ever met.

1274
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,439
Are you working with your family?

1275
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:05,920
Yes.

1276
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,720
I am working at home.

1277
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,840
Next, you will have to deliver
your product to our 3,000 branches.

1278
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:15,960
Altogether, that will be 72,000 bags.

1279
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:16,960
How many again?

1280
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:18,439
Seventy-two thousand bags.

1281
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:20,520
And one month from now,

1282
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,319
we will have the GMP inspection
at your factory.

1283
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:25,520
I see.

1284
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:27,359
The GMP...

1285
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:29,239
All right.

1286
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,720
After your factory is GMP-certified,

1287
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,239
after two weeks, it will be delivery time.

1288
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:36,119
If your total stock's shelf-life

1289
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:38,560
is less than 80 days
from the manufacture date,

1290
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,239
we won't let you pass.

1291
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,960
I see.

1292
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:44,079
Okay.

1293
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:53,880
GMP stands for

1294
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,880
Good Manufacturing Practices.

1295
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:02,840
Seventy-two thousand bags.

1296
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,960
Tuang,

1297
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:08,760
how can a 19-year-old kid like me

1298
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,359
get the money to open a factory?

1299
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,159
Are you 19?

1300
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,720
Yes.

1301
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:21,640
LAND DEED

1302
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,239
DATE OF BIRTH: 24 NOV 1984

1303
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,600
Top.

1304
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,359
I really respect you.

1305
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,800
I like

1306
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,039
that you're a fighter.

1307
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,039
But you're only 19.

1308
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:48,920
I can't loan you money.
You're not old enough.

1309
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,840
You only graduated from high school.

1310
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:56,039
Your family has 40 million baht in debt.

1311
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,039
Your buildings are ready
to be auctioned off for sale.

1312
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,920
Your parents aren't here.

1313
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:11,199
I am sorry.

1314
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:20,920
But everything you've done,

1315
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:22,840
I think it's amazing.

1316
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:28,439
You're still young.

1317
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,640
Go get your degree.

1318
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:07,920
Are you ready?

1319
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:14,640
All done.

1320
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:21,600
BUY AND SELL ALL TYPES OF CARS

1321
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:48,760
-Count it.
-Okay.

1322
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,399
TO ITTHIPAT KULAPONGVANICH

1323
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:21,920
The head is slightly tiled.

1324
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,119
-He must be muscular
-Okay.

1325
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,920
-and has three bases.
-Okay.

1326
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:29,279
The amulet must not be bent or crooked.

1327
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:30,520
-All right.
-Okay.

1328
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,840
On the back,

1329
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:34,119
it could be a flat back

1330
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,680
or a pattern of betel nuts.

1331
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,840
It's made from shell cement.

1332
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:41,119
-Shell cement?
-Yes, it's mixed with other powders.

1333
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,840
Hey, kid. Long time no see.

1334
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:48,680
Have you got a new amulet to sell?

1335
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,640
No, I want to buy it back.

1336
01:39:55,399 --> 01:39:56,399
Which one?

1337
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,760
That one.

1338
01:39:58,119 --> 01:39:59,079
Hey.

1339
01:39:59,479 --> 01:40:01,319
This one is now worth a few million baht.

1340
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,000
Do you have that kind of money?

1341
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:05,560
I pawned it for only 100,000 baht.

1342
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,159
How did the price go up?

1343
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:09,960
This amulet has always been traded
for millions of baht.

1344
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,039
Give me my dad's amulet back!

1345
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:21,159
Talk nicely.

1346
01:40:21,239 --> 01:40:23,199
It's mine. It's on my neck, can't you see?

1347
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:24,680
-I said it's my dad's!
-Hey.

1348
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,520
-What the hell?
-I said it's my dad's!

1349
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:27,760
This fucking kid.

1350
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:31,520
I'll shoot you right now.
Get out of my sight.

1351
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:33,000
Go.

1352
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:34,960
You were stupid to sell it to me
for 100,000 baht.

1353
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:36,399
Did I scam you?

1354
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,840
Get out.

1355
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,439
Asshole!

1356
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:50,640
FOR SALE, PROPERTY OF THE BANK

1357
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,239
This is our factory.

1358
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,880
That's right.

1359
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:02,319
I forgot we had this building.

1360
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:07,760
I remembered it

1361
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:09,520
when that banker mentioned it.

1362
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:17,039
Including the labor cost,
it would be around 1 million baht.

1363
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:23,399
Can I pay for some of it now?

1364
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,760
Normally, we need 50 percent upfront,
and then we start working.

1365
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,880
If you don't pay up,

1366
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:30,880
I'll throw you in jail.

1367
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,119
TAO KAE NOI

1368
01:42:33,159 --> 01:42:34,960
-What time?
-Three p.m., right?

1369
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:05,520
Tua.

1370
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:14,239
Tuang.

1371
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,359
What should we do

1372
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,720
if this doesn't work out as well?

1373
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,279
Don't worry about it too much.

1374
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:23,960
Nobody knows.

1375
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,399
Sometimes,

1376
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,720
I feel like I don't think hard enough.

1377
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,720
That's good.

1378
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:36,840
You wouldn't be here
if you thought too much.

1379
01:45:57,079 --> 01:45:59,439
TAO KAE NOI FACTORY

1380
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:06,239
TO PU, FROM ITTHIPAT
TAO KAE NOI

1381
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,920
TAO KAE NOI FACTORY

1382
01:46:36,439 --> 01:46:37,520
Hello, Pu.

1383
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,640
Hello.

1384
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:40,640
This is Ton from the QA department.

1385
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,560
He will check your factory today.

1386
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,560
This is just the front
of your factory, right?

1387
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,640
No.

1388
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:50,439
This is the whole factory. This way.

1389
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,640
Just bribe them.

1390
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:06,880
We won't make it.

1391
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:10,239
No, Tuang.

1392
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,600
I don't want anyone
to blame my parents again.

1393
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,000
You must believe me this time.

1394
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:17,439
I've seen it before.

1395
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,760
Even when things look ready,

1396
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,239
without the money, it's no good.

1397
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,600
I'm sorry.

1398
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,560
I forgot to tell you
the paint's still wet.

1399
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:29,159
I see.

1400
01:47:58,039 --> 01:47:59,039
To be honest,

1401
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,359
your factory
isn't up to standard, Itthipat.

1402
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,399
What are some examples?

1403
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,079
Look at that.

1404
01:48:06,359 --> 01:48:07,880
The lights have no cover.

1405
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,279
Dust can fall into your food.

1406
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:13,359
We take hygiene
during production very seriously.

1407
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,720
Pu.

1408
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:19,800
I'll get it fixed right away.

1409
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,199
-Chart.
-Yes.

1410
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:24,159
Please get someone to cover the lights.

1411
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:25,880
All right.

1412
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:54,079
-You can use this tissue.
-That's okay.

1413
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,560
I'll cover the lights right away.

1414
01:49:00,359 --> 01:49:01,239
So...

1415
01:49:02,199 --> 01:49:03,640
will we know the result today?

1416
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,359
Itthipat,

1417
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,359
there are many things
that are below standard.

1418
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:08,920
The lights aren't covered,

1419
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,560
the sewage pipe isn't covered,

1420
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,520
the sink must be turned on

1421
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,319
by pressing a lever with your foot.

1422
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:16,640
Otherwise,

1423
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,239
you will re-infect

1424
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:20,239
your hands with germs.

1425
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:21,840
You're also using the wrong alcohol.

1426
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:26,239
This is for cleaning wounds,
which is dangerous.

1427
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:28,479
You should use ethyl alcohol only.

1428
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,640
We will go back and make our decision.

1429
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,319
I will let you know again by fax.

1430
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,560
We have to go.

1431
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:00,239
Goodbye.

1432
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:16,359
It's okay.

1433
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,920
You did your best.

1434
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:22,319
We must prepare for packing and delivery.

1435
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,960
We don't even know the result yet.

1436
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:28,239
If we wait,
we won't make it in time for delivery.

1437
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:29,640
I see.

1438
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:32,000
THE RESULT OF THE INSPECTION IS

1439
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,520
Shit! The ink just had to run out now!

1440
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,640
I can't read it, Tuang. What should I do?

1441
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,840
Go look in the sunlight.

1442
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:05,279
PASSED

1443
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:09,439
We passed!

1444
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,479
Top.

1445
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,000
Top, wake up.

1446
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,399
Hurry. We're almost done
loading the boxes.

1447
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,680
Hurry.

1448
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:29,920
Be careful.

1449
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:41,920
Speed it up.

1450
01:52:44,319 --> 01:52:46,279
Line them up nicely.

1451
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:47,920
You can go when you're done.

1452
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,039
Hurry. Time's up.

1453
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:52,520
Come on. Bring more. Hurry.

1454
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,960
Thank you, Tuang.

1455
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:02,119
Everything I have is on the line.

1456
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:07,039
If this doesn't work out,

1457
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,680
we will really have nothing left.

1458
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:16,079
And I will quit.

1459
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:20,960
I'll stop being stubborn.

1460
01:53:22,359 --> 01:53:23,520
I promise.

1461
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:05,359
Excuse me.

1462
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,279
I'm Itthipat from Tao Kae Noi.

1463
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:12,319
Mister.

1464
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,960
Why are you here now?

1465
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,680
Your scheduled time was an hour ago.

1466
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,880
Sir,

1467
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:19,640
please.

1468
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:21,920
We're just a bit late.

1469
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,600
Listen.

1470
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,159
Everyone always says that.

1471
01:55:25,239 --> 01:55:26,960
If I let you go,

1472
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,920
I'll have to let everyone else go.

1473
01:55:29,319 --> 01:55:31,239
And your time is up.

1474
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,439
I'm begging you, please.

1475
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:36,920
This is really important to me.

1476
01:55:37,319 --> 01:55:39,399
I just finished packing
at 5 a.m. in the morning.

1477
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:50,319
Fine.

1478
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,720
Just hurry up.

1479
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,720
You're next. Get ready.

1480
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:54,840
-All right.
-Okay.

1481
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:55,920
Thank you so much.

1482
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:58,039
Kid.

1483
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,520
Yes?

1484
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:03,239
Do you want to wipe your nose?

1485
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,920
Thank you so much.

1486
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:17,560
You can go in. He let us in.

1487
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,079
Okay. Back up the car.

1488
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,920
Do you want to speak to Mom?

1489
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:05,960
No.

1490
01:57:12,439 --> 01:57:13,359
Dad.

1491
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,640
You and Mom can come home now.

1492
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:24,880
Top.

1493
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,560
Are you tired?

1494
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,000
TWO YEARS AFTER SUPPLYING
TAO KAE NOI TO 7-ELEVEN,

1495
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,279
TOP PAID OFF
HIS FAMILY'S DEBT OF 40 MILLION BAHT

1496
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:11,279
HE STILL LIVES IN THE SAME HOUSE
WITH HIS PARENTS

1497
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:24,359
How's it going, Top?

1498
01:58:24,439 --> 01:58:26,680
-I'd like to loan 400 million baht.
-No problem.

1499
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,880
