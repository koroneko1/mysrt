1
00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:56.760
Help!

2
00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.359
Who are you?

3
00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.079
Please don't hurt me.

4
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.599
UNIVERSITY SPORTS COMPLEX

5
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.199
Aya and Brave are so cute.

6
00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.520
Yes, they look so sweet together.

7
00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.680
Thank you.

8
00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.840
Can I take your photo?

9
00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.319
-Sure.
-Sure.

10
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.719
-Can you take our photo?
-Sure.

11
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.879
Thank you.

12
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.280
When you post on Instagram or Facebook,
don't forget to tag me.

13
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.439
I'd like to see photos from everyone.

14
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.400
Thank you.

15
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:19.759
I heard that lately,
you two have been getting really close.

16
00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.639
What is the true nature
of your relationship?

17
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.040
Are you still just friends,

18
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120
or are you…

19
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.680
Boyfriends?

20
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.120
Can we just leave it at that?

21
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.279
I just want to keep it between us.

22
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.480
Just joking.

23
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.399
Oh, you're just joking?

24
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.839
I almost wanted it to be true.

25
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.240
Don't listen to him.

26
00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.120
I'm getting the creeps
just thinking about it.

27
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.360
We still like girls.

28
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.519
Girls who look handsome?

29
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.480
I think our relationship is…

30
00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.399
pretty clear.

31
00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.560
It's clear that nothing is going on.

32
00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.000
Can I take a photo?

33
00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.360
-Sure.
-Come here.

34
00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.920
-Come here.
-Let's go.

35
00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:09.759
-Thank you.
-Of course.

36
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.839
Cheers, guys!

37
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.879
Hey, clap your hands.

38
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.519
Keep it up. That was perfect.

39
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.199
-Yes.
-So I won't have to complain.

40
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.279
-I love it.
-Oh, wow.

41
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.560
You have a lot of fans, don't you?

42
00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.160
Shit!

43
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.839
This photo of you and Brave
is so adorable.

44
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.319
So damn cute.

45
00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:41.439
And so fake.

46
00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.399
Yes, it's not as real
as your and Nat's photo, right?

47
00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.560
Enough, I'm getting goosebumps.

48
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.000
Aya.

49
00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.480
There, look.

50
00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.279
Kin, why did you make me look at her?

51
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.800
She'll come after me.

52
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.000
She is so damn weird.

53
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.160
Whenever she sees you,

54
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.680
she acts all weird.

55
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.399
She keeps staring at you.

56
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.240
I've heard
that she tried out for our team.

57
00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.920
But all the positions were filled.

58
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.360
So she went to beg Justin and Min

59
00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.759
to let her join as staff.

60
00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.000
Or the real reason she joined the club

61
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.399
was so she could stalk you?

62
00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.160
Shit, Brave.

63
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.959
You better protect your girlfriend.

64
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.000
-Shit, it cut my lips.
-You're making shit up.

65
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.439
I think she's just a fan.

66
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.480
Aya has many female fans anyway.

67
00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.639
I don't care. She can stare all she wants

68
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.399
as long as she keeps her distance.

69
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.560
The other day I saw Praewa
practicing dancing in the club room.

70
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.000
The dance routine was exactly like Aya's.

71
00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.639
She's so determined.

72
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.519
So much so that I feel sorry for her.

73
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.120
I think that it's creepy.

74
00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.240
If someone admired me and did that,

75
00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.639
I wouldn't be okay with it.

76
00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.639
At least she leaves Aya alone,
doesn't she?

77
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.840
If you keep making fun of her,

78
00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.919
it's like you're giving her
more attention.

79
00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.720
What a good guy.

80
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.679
I'm just saying.
I'm not making fun of her.

81
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.159
-I'm sorry, Brave. Let me clean that up.
-It's all right.

82
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.279
Go find something to clean the floor with.

83
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480
I'm going to practice.

84
00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.480
Damn, you were quick.

85
00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:19.720
How do you think Aya will react

86
00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:20.919
if she sees this?

87
00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:24.799
Asshole.

88
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.960
All right, focus.

89
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.559
Five, six, seven, let's go.

90
00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:35.080
-One, two.
-Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

91
00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.639
One, two, three, four,

92
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.080
five, six, seven, eight, one,

93
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:42.320
two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, one.

94
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.919
Okay, take a ten-minute break.

95
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.840
Yes.

96
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.639
Why don't we practice?

97
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.080
You said you got goosebumps,
but you keep creating a buzz.

98
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.919
We're not creating a buzz.

99
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.600
We always do this.

100
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960
What the hell is this?

101
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.639
It hurts.

102
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.279
What are you looking at?

103
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.679
Wow, who drew this?

104
00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.559
It's so beautiful.

105
00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:55.799
Oh, I've been trying to figure out
who it looks like.

106
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.960
It's you.

107
00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.960
Look, it's your face.

108
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.000
Isn't it, Nat?

109
00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.559
It really looks like you.

110
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.039
Agreed.

111
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.399
Who drew this?

112
00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:08.840
Praewa.

113
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.440
I saw that she left it here.

114
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.080
Is she drawing you

115
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.840
for some kind of weird shit?

116
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.960
Not funny.

117
00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:25.240
You told me to watch my back.

118
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.120
But your fans are actually more creepy.

119
00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:30.320
I saw Khaimook

120
00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.240
holding these dolls

121
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.600
that looked like you and Nat.

122
00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.080
Trust me.

123
00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:36.960
Khaimook might be weird.

124
00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:40.360
But I think she's harmless, unlike Praewa.

125
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.159
Right.

126
00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.320
Jiewliew, what are you doing here?

127
00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:38.879
When will you go to bed?

128
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.360
The light from your laptop
is keeping me up. I can't sleep.

129
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.840
It's late, go to bed already.

130
00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.600
You startled me!

131
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.919
I can't sleep. The light is too bright.

132
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.080
Turn off the light.

133
00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:51.039
Fine, all right!

134
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.320
I was scared as hell.

135
00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:04.919
Let's go to bed.

136
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.000
What's that fucking noise?

137
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.440
What's happening?

138
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.919
Shit.

139
00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:18.039
What are you looking at, Nat?

140
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.480
Dan, check this out.

141
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.519
It's black magic.

142
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.159
They say last night
was a major Buddhist holy day.

143
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.200
People with black magic
would have to let it out.

144
00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:30.000
And this guy was unlucky.

145
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.000
He was struck by one of those.

146
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.279
Scary shit.

147
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.240
Lilin, are you okay?

148
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.840
You look so pale.

149
00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:43.120
I just have a headache.

150
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.039
Let's go, Dan.
The professor should be there by now.

151
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.960
Okay.

152
00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:51.559
Hey, don't forget
Aya's birthday party tonight.

153
00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.000
Yes, okay.

154
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.320
-See you.
-See you.

155
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.360
Nice photos.

156
00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:06.000
The lighting is so pretty. Look.

157
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.679
Too bad you have to practice.

158
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.440
Otherwise, the whole gang
would have been there.

159
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.279
There's nothing on Facebook

160
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.039
that compares to what's on my phone.

161
00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:22.960
Damn, how could I miss this?

162
00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.399
What is this?

163
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.279
Hey.

164
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:43.159
Tell me what this is.

165
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.200
Calm down.

166
00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:48.720
Listen, we got that from another friend.

167
00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.919
At first, I wanted to ask you.

168
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.080
But we thought you had seen it
and were just not making a fuss about it.

169
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.960
It's my boyfriend in the photo.

170
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.879
How did you think I would react?

171
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.279
Come on.

172
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.679
-Calm down.
-Take it back.

173
00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.679
Delete the pictures from your phone.

174
00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:05.680
Don't keep that disgusting shit
on your phone.

175
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.960
I don't mind

176
00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:09.519
if she messes with me,

177
00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.039
but not with my boyfriend.

178
00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.920
Shit. Calm down, Aya.

179
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.200
Aya.

180
00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:05.319
Aya, wait!

181
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.160
Aya!

182
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.359
Aya! Wait for me.

183
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.960
Damn! Like Siamese twins.

184
00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:17.119
Aya, why are you mad at me?

185
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.039
Do you still have to ask?

186
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.119
Why am I mad at you?

187
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.279
Aren't you tired

188
00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.920
of trying so hard?

189
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.720
Trying to do what?

190
00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:33.759
Trying to be me.

191
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:36.400
I never said anything,

192
00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.960
so you think you can do whatever you want?

193
00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:42.000
You do your hair like mine

194
00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.839
and wear makeup to look better.

195
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.119
It's not like that.
I'm not trying to copy you, Aya.

196
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:51.319
I just admire you.

197
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.440
I don't think anything like that.

198
00:18:58.759 --> 00:18:59.759
I see.

199
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.759
Maybe you don't want to be me.

200
00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:05.480
You just…

201
00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:07.119
want my guy.

202
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.680
No, Aya. It's not like that.

203
00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:11.920
Hey, calm down, just calm down.

204
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
Chill, come on.

205
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.359
Mark my words.

206
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.079
Get it through your thick skull!

207
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.440
Someone like you, even in the next life…

208
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.279
you could never be like me.

209
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720
Hi, Jus.

210
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720
Hey, you drank it all?

211
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.839
Hello.

212
00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:33.359
Happy birthday.

213
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.480
Thank you.

214
00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:35.640
Here's your gift.

215
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720
Thank you.

216
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.160
-Thank you.
-I hope you'll like it.

217
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240
Of course.

218
00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:42.279
-This is from me.
-Thank you.

219
00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:43.920
What did you get me?

220
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.160
It's a surprise.

221
00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.799
Thank you.

222
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.000
Sorry I didn't tell you.

223
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.319
Praewa asked if she could tag along.

224
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.119
It's all right.

225
00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:09.720
Happy birthday, Aya.

226
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.720
What are you waiting for? Come on.

227
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.039
Come here.

228
00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.640
Kin, will you get him a drink?

229
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.799
-Come on.
-Come on.

230
00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.920
-Just got here.
-Where have you been?

231
00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:29.279
Wow, good job.

232
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.400
Ready, guys? Let's party!

233
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.160
Dance. Spin around.

234
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.839
Dance. You like dancing, don't you?

235
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.440
Give it up for Praewa!

236
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.759
Dance, keep dancing.

237
00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:20.960
Keep dancing. Come on. Keep dancing.

238
00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:27.720
Come on.

239
00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.880
Dance.

240
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.960
Hey, I'll take Lin upstairs.

241
00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.000
She's wasted.

242
00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:43.359
Okay.

243
00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:45.880
Hey, tough girl.

244
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.640
Always a lightweight.

245
00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:49.400
Take care of her, Aya.

246
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.400
Sure.

247
00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.319
Be right back.

248
00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:12.640
Drink more.

249
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.559
Dance harder, keep dancing.

250
00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:02.799
Hey.

251
00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.000
How would you rate her, Kat?

252
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.119
You're such a player.

253
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.640
You are right.

254
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.759
I did her good.

255
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.720
I'll send you the clip.

256
00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.799
All right, be quick.

257
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.960
Interested?

258
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.000
By the way,

259
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.400
how would you rate Praewa?

260
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.240
Apart from her being weird,

261
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:47.160
her body

262
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.039
is quite nice.

263
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.839
I agree.

264
00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:55.200
Let's drink.

265
00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:02.720
Shit.

266
00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:09.000
Who put the bow on you?

267
00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:09.920
Come here.

268
00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:13.240
Come on. Come to Daddy.

269
00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:31.559
Where is everybody?

270
00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:33.319
Am I the last to wake up?

271
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.079
Yes, they are all gone.

272
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.720
Shit, I can't remember anything.

273
00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:43.240
I don't know when I passed out.

274
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240
What happened to you?

275
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.680
Well…

276
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.119
maybe I walked into the door.

277
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.559
I can't remember much.

278
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.720
Where's your girlfriend?

279
00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:03.200
Still in bed?

280
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.319
Upstairs, in bed.

281
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.680
So she's still not up.

282
00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:11.720
What did you guys do?

283
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.079
Are you sure you want to know?

284
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.680
Bring it on.

285
00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.319
It better be good

286
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.799
since you built it up so much.

287
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.759
Damn!

288
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.319
MOM

289
00:26:57.319 --> 00:26:58.200
Hello?

290
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.799
Yes.

291
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.000
Why? Is everything all right?

292
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.920
Okay, see you in the evening.

293
00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:21.000
Yes.

294
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.680
Okay.

295
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.440
One, two, three, four,

296
00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:40.480
five, six, seven, eight.

297
00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.480
One, two, three, four,

298
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.480
five, six, seven, eight.

299
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.160
How are you?

300
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.799
Working hard, huh? Here.

301
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.920
Thanks.

302
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.880
Keep it up.

303
00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.960
-Professor Pat, hi.
-Hello.

304
00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:01.440
-Hi.
-I thought you wouldn't come in today.

305
00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:03.599
You seem busy. Exams are coming up too.

306
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.119
Why don't you take a break
like the others?

307
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.200
You'll be too tired.

308
00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:09.960
And you are already better than everyone.

309
00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:11.640
That's right.

310
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720
She is the favorite
to take the center position.

311
00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:14.960
That's you.

312
00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.880
Stop arguing. Both of you girls are good.

313
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.000
Thank you.

314
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.240
This period will be tough.

315
00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:23.440
-Yes.
-Keep it up, everyone.

316
00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:33.880
What's wrong?

317
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.720
Something bad happened.

318
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.279
All right.

319
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.839
I'll see you tonight.

320
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.799
Okay?

321
00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:07.200
You asshole.

322
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.119
Hey, hang on.

323
00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:14.640
-What's wrong with you?
-I should be the one asking you that.

324
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.039
What the hell did you do?

325
00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:17.440
What the hell is going on?

326
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.279
Shit.

327
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.599
How could you do this, Nat?

328
00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:35.480
Brave, calm down.

329
00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.119
I know nothing about this.

330
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.319
Don't tell me to calm down.

331
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.920
I trusted you.

332
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.400
And I only sent it to you.

333
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.079
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

334
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.480
I really don't know.

335
00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:49.119
We are friends.

336
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.359
How could I betray you?

337
00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:55.039
I know.

338
00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.839
Those clips were on my phone
which I lost yesterday.

339
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.839
Whoever took the phone
must have sent them.

340
00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:05.920
Shit, who is it?

341
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.839
Mr. Harin Wisetchaithanas,

342
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.440
sophomore student
of the Faculty of Engineering,

343
00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:16.440
please meet Professor Pat at the office
of the Division of Student Affairs.

344
00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:21.359
Nat, you have to come with me.

345
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.319
DIVISION OF STUDENT AFFAIRS

346
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.799
Why are you looking at me?
Do you think it's me in the clip?

347
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:08.960
I don't know.

348
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.160
Don't think that I didn't notice

349
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.559
that you were flirting with Brave.

350
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640
Wait a second.

351
00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:23.920
Brave is my friend.

352
00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:27.119
You are also my friend.
Why would I do that?

353
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.839
I'd be such a shitty friend if I did that.

354
00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:32.599
I think you should calm down.

355
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.160
Wait until you've talked
to your boyfriend first.

356
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.880
There he is.

357
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.480
Who is she?

358
00:32:46.039 --> 00:32:47.680
Who is that bitch?

359
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.599
So you're not going to tell me?

360
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.920
You're going to let me find out myself?

361
00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.680
HAVE YOU SEEN PRAEWA'S CLIP?
IT STARTED WITH THIS PIC.

362
00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.440
#PWIS

363
00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:17.720
#PWIS #PRAEWAISASLUT #SAVEAYA

364
00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.240
-Hey.
-I read it.

365
00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:20.519
Hey, look at this.

366
00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:21.960
Go to the Cheer Club's page.

367
00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:23.079
-What?
-Hurry up.

368
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.240
-Why?
-The Cheer Club's page.

369
00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:25.480
Nun!

370
00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:26.599
Come here.

371
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.160
Go to the Cheer Club's page.

372
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.039
Go to the Cheer Club's page.
Watch the clip.

373
00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:32.079
It's definitely her.

374
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.200
Watch the clip.

375
00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.200
Gosh.

376
00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.920
Go to the Cheer Club's page.

377
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.440
She seems shy and quiet.

378
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:39.000
-She's actually a bitch.
-Gosh.

379
00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:40.519
It looks like her.

380
00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:42.039
-I think it's her.
-She seems so shy.

381
00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:43.880
She's a bitch on the inside.

382
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.640
Watch it.

383
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.400
I already shared it.

384
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.240
UNIFORM MAKES HER LOOK
LIKE A GOOD GIRL

385
00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:52.119
What?

386
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.799
-Give me the phone charger.
-No.

387
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.359
I'm going to share it too.

388
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:06.440
SHE'S A SLUT #PWIS #PRAEWAISASLUT

389
00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:15.519
#PWIS

390
00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.400
WHAT A BITCH
WHAT A SHAMELESS BITCH #PWIS

391
00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.800
I WANT TO SEE MORE. WHERE IS THE LINK?

392
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.360
UNIFORM MAKES HER LOOK LIKE
A GOOD GIRL. A GOOD GIRL GONE BAD.

393
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440
LINK TO THE FULL CLIP.

394
00:34:26.519 --> 00:34:28.280
GOT IT. I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

395
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.199
GIVE ME THE LINK.

396
00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:34.440
UNIFORM MAKES HER LOOK LIKE…

397
00:34:34.519 --> 00:34:37.079
WHAT A BITCH #PWIS #PRAEWAISASLUT 

398
00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.320
I'll be back.

399
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.960
Professor Pat.

400
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.239
You've seen all these crazy rumors, right?

401
00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:57.280
It's not me in the clip.

402
00:34:58.039 --> 00:35:00.440
They're spreading lies about me.
You've got to help me.

403
00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:03.840
Praewa, calm yourself down.

404
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.079
It's really not me in the clip.

405
00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:10.760
I'm not even close to Brave.

406
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.440
If you are still hysterical,

407
00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:15.760
whatever excuse or reason
you can come up with,

408
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.119
nobody will believe you.

409
00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:20.159
Besides,

410
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.000
Harin came to confess everything.

411
00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:26.119
Confess what?

412
00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:28.840
I told you it wasn't me!

413
00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:32.599
Whatever you say, no one will believe you.

414
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.440
Unless you can find evidence

415
00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:37.639
to prove your innocence.

416
00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.639
And as the adviser for the Cheer Club,

417
00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:44.760
I won't let anyone or anything bad

418
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.239
ruin the reputation
and the future of the club.

419
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.360
Are we clear?

420
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.840
I have an errand to run.

421
00:36:08.679 --> 00:36:09.639
Brave!

422
00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:12.360
You have to tell everyone the truth.

423
00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.079
What's wrong with you?

424
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:20.199
You know it's not me in that clip.

425
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.679
Why are you doing this to me?

426
00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.000
You have to tell everyone the truth!

427
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.519
What are you talking about? What nonsense.

428
00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:30.840
Brave!

429
00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:32.599
Hey.

430
00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:48.519
Praewa, are you okay?

431
00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:36.599
Praewa, what the fuck is wrong with you?

432
00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:38.360
Why did you hook up with my boyfriend?

433
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.639
No, Aya. I'm not the girl in the clip.

434
00:37:49.039 --> 00:37:49.920
Kin, hold her.

435
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.199
I'll slap the sluttiness out of you!

436
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.480
You want to be me, huh?

437
00:37:58.559 --> 00:38:00.199
You want to be me, right?

438
00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:02.199
Please don't hurt me!

439
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.519
Why are you just standing there? Hold her!

440
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.159
Come here.

441
00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:13.800
Ping, I didn't do it! Help me!

442
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.920
Ping!

443
00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:18.760
You want to be me, huh?

444
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.880
Ping!

445
00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:30.079
You want to be me, huh?

446
00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:30.880
ASA SAMAKKEE FOUNDATION

447
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.920
Miss?

448
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.400
Jeez, look at her.

449
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.000
Miss?

450
00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:39.360
Bring a stretcher.

451
00:39:40.519 --> 00:39:41.559
She's in bad shape.

452
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.119
Miss?

453
00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:55.480
Hurry up.

454
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.199
One, two, three.

455
00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:12.519
Don't struggle.

456
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.920
She's having a seizure.

457
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.760
Hey, this is strange.

458
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.320
Why is she having a seizure?

459
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.840
-What's wrong with her?
-What's wrong?

460
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.800
This is not good.

461
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.239
-Is she going to die?
-What's wrong?

462
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.159
-What's wrong with her?
-Let's go.

463
00:42:39.159 --> 00:42:40.000
Mom!

464
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.119
Mom.

465
00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.639
Mom.

466
00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:50.920
Mom, help me.

467
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.519
Mom, please help me.

468
00:43:59.519 --> 00:44:00.400
Mom.

469
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.599
Mom.

470
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.599
Mom, help me.
