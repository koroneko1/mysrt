1
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,280
Did you team up
with his family to bring him here

2
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,759
and shield him
from the rumors in his country?

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,759
What rumors?

4
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:36,880
What?

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,479
Nothing.

6
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,840
Is there something I should know?
Care to maybe enlighten me?

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,600
-No, nothing.
-Where's Mencía?

8
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,280
She won't pick up.
I've texted and called a thousand times.

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,640
She's not even here?

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,319
I expressly asked you to make sure
this kind of thing didn't happen.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm sorry, but I can't keep an eye on her
24 hours a day.

12
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,400
We can stop if you need to.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,719
I want you to feel comfortable.

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,719
So you don't get the wrong idea,
this… is our last time doing this.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,840
See what happens.

16
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,400
Yes, Mom.

17
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,439
Benjamín said he'd be here
with his three kids.

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,319
They'll be in my class.

19
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't worry.

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,599
Thanks. I love you.

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,919
Let's talk tomorrow.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,120
It's a pleasure to meet you in person.

23
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,319
The pleasure is mine. Welcome.

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
I'll introduce you to my children.
Patrick.

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
-Hello. How are you?
-A pleasure.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,240
-The pleasure's mine.
-Ariadna.

27
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,800
Hello.

28
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,080
How are you?

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,639
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,199
Her blood alcohol content
is three milligrams.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,639
And if she's not used to drinking…

32
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,000
Did she fall, or did someone push her?

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,719
Well, we actually don't know for sure.

34
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,360
These first 48 hours will be
the most critical for your daughter.

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,599
Phillipe Florian von Triesenberg

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,439
is the second youngest heir in Europe.

37
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,639
-He opened le Bal two years ago.
-Wow. Hmm.

38
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,919
-The debutante ball in Paris.
-Hmm.

39
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,000
-You know?
-No.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,759
But above all, I mean, come on.
Isn't he so pretty?

41
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Not only is he a babe, he's a fashion icon

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
and a patron
of all the best international designers.

43
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,560
And I bet you didn't know
he's fluent in four languages.

44
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,560
He grew up
in the best boarding schools here,

45
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,759
in the UK,
and Switzerland, so he's super elegant.

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
He's handsome,

47
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,080
and he's got royal and commoner,
French and Spanish blood.

48
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,199
It's in his blood.

49
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,680
Let me see if I'm right.

50
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,120
Are you putting together
some animated fantasy in your head

51
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,240
where this dude, this Florence,
is gonna make you a famous designer

52
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,520
and give you some kind
of royal happily ever after?

53
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,400
Florian, not Florence. And no.
I just wanted to share this information.

54
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,120
Great. I'd like to share that you'd
better get your helmet on, Cinderella.

55
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,759
You're in for a head-on collision, kid.

56
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,800
That's why they set up the gate
and the cameras?

57
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,959
Because this guy's coming to study here?

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,519
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,879
And the measures
aren't gonna stop there either.

60
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,360
Look. A better picture of him.

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,079
-Gee, thanks.
-I'll be right back.

62
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,959
So, this necktie is a choice. Okay.

63
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,639
What's goin' on?

64
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,439
You have a minute?

65
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,240
What do you want?

66
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,399
Sweet-talk me into convincing my dad
to remove the cameras?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
No.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,319
I came to tell you I'm sorry.

69
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,720
-It wasn't all a game. I promise.
-What part wasn't?

70
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
I really enjoyed
our walk around the reservoir.

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Walk? I remember you calling it a date.

72
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,759
Okay, our date.

73
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,879
So, the date was real, then?

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,319
And what else was real?

75
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
-The connection between us.
-Yeah, I thought it was real too.

76
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,240
-The laughs about my guinea pig.
-Your girlfriend?

77
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,399
My girlfriend is very real.

78
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm really sorry.

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm gonna let this slide…

80
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,720
but don't have a connection

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,839
with anyone else
as long as you have a girlfriend.

82
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,360
Okay?

83
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,279
Okay.

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,399
It's a deal.

85
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,360
Hey, there's been a weird vibe
between you and Ari ever since the date.

86
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,160
Flirty banter at the pool, talking alone,

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,399
staring deep into each other's eyes.
It's all a little--

88
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
We had a misunderstanding,
but that's cleared up.

89
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,560
Aren't you going to try
to get together with her?

90
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,920
Samuel, I have a girlfriend.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
-Oh, all right. Wasn't sure there.
-What's the matter? You into her?

92
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,720
Who, me? No way. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hit on her or anything.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Oh, okay, all right.

94
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,519
"Oh, okay, all right," what?

95
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,199
Would you lose it
if I did make a move on her?

96
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,399
No, I don't give a shit.

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
-Good, 'cause you have a girlfriend.
-Yeah.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
-But I'm saying this for you, not for me.
-What?

99
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,399
I say this as a friend.
You're out of your league with her.

100
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,959
Oh, I see what you're doing.

101
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,120
You're either jealous, or you've gone back
to being the classist prick you were.

102
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,279
Look, I'm saying this
to protect you, okay?

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
I know you got a taste of a marquise,
but be real,

104
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,639
Carla was the best you're gonna do.

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,360
Ari isn't just out of your orbit.
She's fucking Pluto.

106
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,199
You're Earth. Understand?

107
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,360
-Like fucking Pluto, huh?
-Yeah.

108
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,399
Okay.

109
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,639
Come on. Don't be pissed at me.

110
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,079
Where were you last night?

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,199
Out.

112
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,800
Can I at least ask who with?

113
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,319
A friend of mine.

114
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,439
Okay. Which friend?

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,839
Benjamín, I'm leaving.

116
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,079
Otherwise, I'll be late for class,
and you'll get upset with me.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,079
Mencía. Mencía!

118
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,360
Uh, excuse me.

119
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,319
Yes?

120
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,839
It's saying, "Criminal record"?

121
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
Which part don't you understand,
"criminal" or "record"?

122
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,600
Because they're both
pretty common words, Parrilla.

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,839
No, I got that part.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,759
What I don't understand
is why they're asking about our personal

125
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,199
and immediate family's records.

126
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,720
Isn't that private information?

127
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,920
Hmm. Actually,
in your case and your mother's case,

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
that info's public and well known.

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,319
You can leave it blank.

130
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,079
The Principality of Triesen

131
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,320
is asking for information
about their heir's classmates, not me.

132
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
Though it doesn't seem unreasonable
that they would want to assess

133
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
who is taking classes
and sharing this space with him.

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Right?

135
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
Rebe.

136
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,600
Are you all right?

137
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,399
Fuckin' peachy.

138
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,279
Come on.
Stop stressing yourself out about it.

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Are you serious right now?
He's kicking people out.

140
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,600
That's not exactly what he said.

141
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,639
Cool. Shut up. I wasn't talking to you.

142
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
-Okay.
-You said it yourself.

143
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,600
This dude pretends to be polite,
but he came here looking for blood.

144
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,320
Who will be the first to go, huh?
Go ahead.

145
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,159
My mom spent last semester in the clink.
I was dealing with stuff here.

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,840
We're two for the price of one
for that son of a bitch Benjamín.

147
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay, I get
that we wanna blame those around us

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,679
rather than accepting responsibility
for our mistakes,

149
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,600
but in this case, as you all heard,

150
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,799
this is the royal house's decision,
not my father's.

151
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,639
Don't worry, Rebeka. You're not
the only family with criminal records.

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
Take Samuel's brother.

153
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,600
What about your dad?

154
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,720
Did you forget? Though he's rich,
they know him by name at the precinct.

155
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,240
Right now, as far as the royals
and Benjamín are concerned,

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,679
you and I are no different, dude.

157
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,320
Same level of total bullshit.

158
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,519
PEEP INTO THE CLASSROOM.

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,679
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,879
Rebe.

161
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,039
I really like you.

162
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,080
And… I have this sneaking suspicion
that you like me too.

163
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,200
So I don't understand why you keep
running away from me like that.

164
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,399
And what makes you think
I like you in that way? Hmm?

165
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,039
Well, I mean,
for starters, the last time I…

166
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,480
I did this to you…

167
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,960
…it also took you a while to pull away.

168
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,080
Look, I'm sorry,
but I just don't…

169
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,320
You need to get out of here.

170
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,759
The room needs to be searched
top to bottom.

171
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,039
So, tell me.
Has the world ended since I kissed you?

172
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,200
Huh? Tell me.

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,879
Has anything changed regarding
the way things were just five minutes ago?

174
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,440
Your dad's face. Now he's got
a reason to kick me to the curb.

175
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,039
Okay, so now you're gonna use my dad
as an excuse to avoid dealing with this?

176
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,279
Mencía, please drop it.
Let's just go about our separate ways.

177
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,159
It's really not that hard. No.
Could you just do me this favor?

178
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,200
We'd better not go near her,

179
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,120
'cause her shock waves
might blow us right into next week.

180
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,240
-They have a little something going on?
-Sure seems like it.

181
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,840
Think Rebeka went off on her
just 'cause she's a girl?

182
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,840
-No, she's not like that.
-That's not it.

183
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,320
I know what the problem is.
I mean, I can imagine.

184
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,879
Why don't you ask her
to the Lake Club for dinner tonight

185
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,159
so I can talk with her?

186
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,759
Because if I ask her,
she'll tell me to go fuck myself.

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,679
Dad says when you disappear all night,
it's 'cause you're off with Rebeka.

188
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
Oh, well,
if Benjamín says it, then it must be true.

189
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,200
And he also says that

190
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360
she pays for you.

191
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,600
Mencía, do you know
where Rebeka gets that money from?

192
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,799
From the ATM.

193
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,840
Exactly like you.

194
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah.

195
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,240
Benjamín caught us kissing earlier.

196
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,679
Got a problem with that?

197
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,480
Are you serious?

198
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
'Kay, so you're a lesbian now, or what?

199
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
Who cares?

200
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm really not into labeling myself.
Not in what I do or what I feel.

201
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,759
-I don't know. You get what I mean?
-Sure.

202
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,679
That you're a bit of an attention whore.

203
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,080
Mencía, I, um… I hope you understand
I'm not gonna let you get with this girl.

204
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,279
Rebeka's bad news.

205
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,039
REBE, SORRY TO BE A PAIN. CAN WE TALK?

206
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

207
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,879
-Hey, a message from Mencía.
-The hell are you doin'?

208
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,039
HI, ARMANDO.

209
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,639
MAYBE WE COULD MEET ONE MORE TIME.
IF YOU WANT TO.

210
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,519
Fuck. Nadia pushed our video call back
another hour.

211
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,039
Why am I always the one who has to adapt?

212
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Sometimes I think I'm the only one
who's making an effort here.

213
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,039
It's cool. I'll just be here,
slowly losing my mind.

214
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,200
Come on. Chill out, dude.
I mean, you guys are cool, though, right?

215
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,720
We're fine. Thanks, Omar.

216
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,399
Shit, the only way we see each other
in a bar is if you visit us at work.

217
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,519
-Things have changed this school year.
-I almost miss the old days.

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,919
Well, actually,
I'm still serving you guys drinks,

219
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,279
so I haven't really noticed
a difference personally, but…

220
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,159
You know what we should do?

221
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,120
Do like before and throw a real banger.

222
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,080
-All right. Please.
-Yes. So, what's the overall… vibe?

223
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,799
-High-class or low-class?
-This will be strictly for us old-timers.

224
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,399
We can have the party
at our house, right?

225
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,399
Although,
why are we only inviting the old-timers?

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,879
Who do you want to invite?

227
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,279
Who do you not want to?

228
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,799
-Well, Benjamín's kids, for one.
-Yeah. No, Benjamín's kids are out.

229
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,200
See? So now I'm curious
who it was you wanted to invite to it.

230
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
Ooh!

231
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,279
-Samuel, just the old-timers. No one else.
-All right. Okay.

232
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,039
Hey, have you seen the lake?

233
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,720
I haven't, but it's not like
my life depended on it, either.

234
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,279
It's beautiful. Come on. Check it out,
and I'll go and meet you in five minutes.

235
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,879
Great. Just what I needed.

236
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,120
-Move, or you're in the water.
-Not until you hear me out.

237
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,960
-We've been like this for several months.
-And that's not long enough.

238
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,320
I know I really hurt you,

239
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,159
but how can I make things go back
to the way they were before with us?

240
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Look at me.

241
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,960
Okay.

242
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,080
Anything else? Whatever you want.

243
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,480
Okay, look, Samuel.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What do you think?
That with a couple hugs and kisses

245
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,120
and "I'm sorry,"
everything's gonna be the way it was?

246
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,000
I already know you're sorry.
No shit. You goddamn better be sorry.

247
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,720
Then please, just tell me what to do.

248
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,919
Don't do anything.
You did more than enough.

249
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,799
You've royally fucked me.
You lied to and humiliated me, dude.

250
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,840
What else could you do to me?

251
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,200
So after all of this, it's up to me,
and not you, whether we can be friends.

252
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,240
Okay.

253
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,000
Is there more
to this besties heart-to-heart chat,

254
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,160
or are we done here? Okay, then.

255
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm just askin'
that you don't shut yourself off

256
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,799
from other people.

257
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,599
Just 'cause I'm a dick and fucked you over
doesn't mean everyone else will too.

258
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Hello.

259
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,680
You're new here, honey.

260
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,960
Mm, yeah. I don't come here much.

261
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,279
He looks familiar. He a friend of yours?

262
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,440
He regularly comes here…
with girls like you.

263
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
What do you mean, "like me"?

264
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,039
Aren't you a bit young
to be doing this, sweetheart?

265
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,680
Doing what, exactly?

266
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Look, lady, you've no fucking clue
what's going on between us.

267
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,960
Of course I know, dear.
I'm sure it's an awesome hourly rate.

268
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,079
At least I hope it's awesome
because young skin is worth twice as much.

269
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,200
Although, I've always felt like experience
should be worth more, but…

270
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Get your hands off me.

271
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,640
I just hope you know what you're doing,
if you really think you're so grown up.

272
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,960
-Is the little guy still sleeping?
-Shh, I'm tryin' to concentrate.

273
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,079
Omar, could we talk for a sec?

274
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,839
Great. Just what I needed.
A verbal play-by-play.

275
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Well, it's just that…
well, sex isn't just shoving it in.

276
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,039
-Oh, it's not?
-No.

277
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,839
What do you mean?

278
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
It's about skin.

279
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,079
And wordplay.

280
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,799
Mm… and… fantasies.

281
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,440
What are these fantasies of yours?

282
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,880
Well, the other day,
with Patrick, he… made a move.

283
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
I thought you said all you did was dance.

284
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,119
Well, you know. The usual horsing around.

285
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Sure, the usual stuff.

286
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,200
-'Cause that's the norm.
-Shut up and listen.

287
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,839
At one point during the night,
we were super high.

288
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
We were dancing,
sweating, rubbing against each other.

289
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,759
And he started kissing me over my clothes.

290
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,279
He said, "It's not cheating
if your clothes are on."

291
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,400
I let him for a sec.

292
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,400
Then I stopped him because of the guilt.

293
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,559
You felt guilty 'cause he made you horny?

294
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,960
-Can I be honest with you?
-I mean, yeah. We're always honest.

295
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,039
Not horny.

296
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,920
Horny as hell.

297
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,279
And he wouldn't stop. I kept saying,
"Stop, stop," but he kept having his way.

298
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,960
He started kissing me all over my neck

299
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,880
and then very slowly working his way down.

300
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
And when he got down to my fly,

301
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,400
I could feel his breath.

302
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,119
A hard-on? What does that mean?

303
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,599
What?

304
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,240
Phillipe?

305
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

306
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,480
Oh. It's just… how's your shoulder?

307
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,079
That's fine. Leave her.

308
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,359
-Recover from that accident?
-I did.

309
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,119
-Yeah?
-I'm fine. It was nothing.

310
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
-Oh.
-Thanks.

311
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,160
That accident.

312
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm sorry for straight-up jumping you,
like, phew.

313
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
I just had to say hi to you.

314
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,000
If… If I didn't, I wouldn't have…

315
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,400
I wouldn't have slept for,
I don't know, weeks.

316
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,920
Um, Cayetana. An honor.

317
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,720
Enchanté. And keeping you up
at night's the last thing I want to do.

318
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,880
I was told people in Spain
give each other two kisses on the cheek.

319
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah, we do.
But are you allowed to do that?

320
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,519
-Of course. Nice to meet you.
-Yeah?

321
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,279
-Phillipe?
-Nice to meet you.

322
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,319
-Welcome to Las Encinas.
-Thank you.

323
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,119
Cayetana, I'm so glad you're here.

324
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,480
Someone spilled coffee
in the computer lab, and it's gross.

325
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,880
Can you go clean it up?

326
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,519
Um…

327
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,200
Was the cleaning lady bothering you?

328
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,400
Uh, no. Not at all.
I was just introducing myself to everyone.

329
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,720
Employees included.

330
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,440
Au revoir.

331
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,319
Cayetana.

332
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
Trust me. I get the concept that,

333
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,240
for a cleaning lady,
one day becoming a princess

334
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,559
is as alluring as honey is to flies.

335
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:18,000
But remember,
honey isn't meant for the donkey's mouth.

336
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,200
Don't go after someone who isn't for you.

337
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,119
Ciao.

338
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,599
Ciao.

339
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,599
Did they throw her in there on purpose?

340
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,480
Who was it?

341
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,680
They don't know a thing.

342
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:50,160
Or they don't want us to know anything.

343
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
Are you okay?

344
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm gonna…
uh, splash my face with water.

345
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,680
-He turns you on. Admit it.
-Jesus. No, he doesn't.

346
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,119
See?

347
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,359
All right. Ander, he's attractive.
Anyone can see that.

348
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,119
I didn't get hard 'cause he turns me on.
I got hard 'cause he turned you on.

349
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,440
So, yes, I mean, I guess it turns me on,
imagining you being turned on by him.

350
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,839
So fine, that's true.

351
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Yeah, you see how fantasies work?

352
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah.

353
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,759
Let's get in the shower.

354
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,960
So, if you're turned on by Patrick,

355
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,920
and maybe it turns me on
that he turns you on…

356
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,839
What? Ask him to join us?

357
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,799
I mean, if we establish
it would still always be you and me

358
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,119
with another person.

359
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
Like a couples' deal. That's all.

360
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,839
-Oh, now it's your turn getting a hard-on.
-Well, of course.

361
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,839
I mean, as long as we promise each other
it stays me and you, then…

362
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,480
We'll always stay us.

363
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,240
-How the hell do we pop the question?
-I don't know. Just try asking the guy.

364
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,880
People must do it all the time.

365
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Boys,
I need you to vacate this area.

366
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,200
Come on.

367
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,759
Why, Dad? Uh, I mean, Benjamín.

368
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,920
It'll only be for 15 minutes,
so out you go, please.

369
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,680
Come on.

370
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,599
I wonder if this guy's balls
are as blue as his blood.

371
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,440
Okay, let me get this straight.
Your father kicked us out of the showers

372
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,160
so the fucking little prince can be
by himself?

373
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
Hey. Go complain to Benjamín.

374
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,759
I'm out here half-naked,
just like the rest of you.

375
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,920
I think that was a bit over-the-top.

376
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,599
Look, I can't take credit for it.

377
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,119
That was all your father.

378
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,599
You serious?

379
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,079
Can I ask what you're doing out here?

380
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,839
We thought if His Royal Douchiness
is too good to share the showers

381
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,519
with all of our plebeian asses,
he probably won't want to share the class.

382
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,839
Maybe it's not the poor dude's fault.
Maybe it's his parents, or…

383
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,160
I… I mean,
it's probably hard being royalty.

384
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
So now you're taking his side
just to suck up to Ari?

385
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,079
No.
I know what it's like to be shat on

386
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,799
for having less than everyone.
We're shitting on him for having more.

387
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,279
Jesus, Samuel,
you're so quick to sell out.

388
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,079
-What do you mean? I'm not selling out--
-Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

389
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,599
You're really bustin' my balls, man.

390
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,039
I am? I wonder why.

391
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,599
-Don't test my patience. Okay? Bye now.
-Unbunch your panties.

392
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,359
Yeah?

393
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,960
Two cocky guys fighting over you.

394
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,400
They're fighting over Phillipe.

395
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,079
Um… uh, I don't know.
Am I allowed to look you in the eyes or…?

396
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,559
I'm just a cleaning lady.
I get it if His Highness doesn't want his,

397
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,960
um, cool friends to see him
with the janitor.

398
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:47,880
Hmm?

399
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,279
Oh, you don't have any.

400
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,400
But actually, I'm thinking of starting
a special little club

401
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,359
for everyone getting the silent treatment
at this school.

402
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,200
-Oh yeah? And who would be in it?
-You.

403
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,680
Me, depending on the day.

404
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:09,400
Well, this club doesn't sound very fun.

405
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,039
-No?
-How do I quit?

406
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,440
Hmm. It's complicated.

407
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,160
Well, to start,
you'd have to win over the club's founder.

408
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
That would be me.

409
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,359
And second, you'd need to tone down

410
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
that royal cockiness
just a couple of notches.

411
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,440
I accept.

412
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,640
As long as you tone down
the groupie behavior

413
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
a couple notches as well.

414
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,279
Ouch.

415
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,319
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,359
The founder's kind of been
a lifelong fan of yours

417
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,519
and knows too much, honestly.

418
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,039
And now it feels
like she knows you personally.

419
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:44,119
Look, if you want, we can start over.

420
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,359
Yes, that's better. Let's do it.

421
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,240
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

422
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,079
-I'm Phillipe.
-Cayetana.

423
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,400
Although, um, I was told people in Spain
give each other two kisses on the cheek.

424
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,519
Yeah.

425
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,880
Enchanté.

426
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,400
I mean, half the planet would kill
to have Phillipe von Triesenberg

427
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,319
at their party.

428
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,920
What happened to old-timers only?

429
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,480
Guys, the only thing Phillipe wants

430
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,119
is the same as any normal person,
rich or poor.

431
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,480
He just wants to fit in.

432
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,039
Can he come or not?

433
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,000
-Sure, invite him. Why not?
-Yeah?

434
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,559
Awesome.

435
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,599
Ari!

436
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,640
You comin' tonight?

437
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,119
-Where?
-There's a party at my place.

438
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,119
Okay.

439
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,640
Hmm. You won't like it.

440
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,519
-It's not on-brand for you.
-Guzmán.

441
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,640
I've been to humble homes before.

442
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:55,480
Yeah, but it's not the house.
It's the theme.

443
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,599
What theme?

444
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,400
To celebrate that us OGs
don't mind sharing everything,

445
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
including the showers,
unlike the little prince,

446
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,119
we're gonna have a party, and it's, uh,

447
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
a good old towel party.

448
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,519
-What do you mean?
-No, shut up. That's cool.

449
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,000
Each person
is only allowed to bring one towel.

450
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,279
And to be honest, I don't see the prince
or you being into it.

451
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,559
What? No way. Phillipe doesn't mind
getting undressed in front of whoever.

452
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,680
The thing
with the showers was imposed on him.

453
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,640
Well, I'm bringing my best towel.

454
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,279
Unless you don't want me there,
'cause I get the feeling you don't.

455
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,400
Me? No, it's good.
Since you're officially invited now.

456
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,759
So, there's no possible reason
you wouldn't want me there, right?

457
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,119
-None at all.
-Great.

458
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,440
-Thanks, Samuel.
-Don't mention it.

459
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,960
-See you there.
-That's right.

460
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,799
Mencía.

461
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,240
We'd love for you to come to a party
at my house tonight. Are you up for it?

462
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,079
Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you.

463
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,079
You got it.

464
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,319
It's on me. What do you want?

465
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,000
-Let's do shots.
-Right now?

466
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,200
Of course. To warm things up.

467
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,319
Go big or go home.
You go this full-out on everything, or…?

468
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
After spending two years in bed,
unable to move,

469
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm not really someone who sits around
waiting for things to just happen.

470
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,240
I see what I want, go for it, and get it.

471
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,920
Cheers to us.

472
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,000
-Ugh, that's nasty.
-Ugh.

473
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,519
All right, I'm going to the john.
You've got a better way with words.

474
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,839
So, what were you saying earlier?

475
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,640
You go after what you want,
and you always get it?

476
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,559
I want it all.

477
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,319
Like, all the time.

478
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,039
You mean you want everyone all the time?

479
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,680
A slight difference there.

480
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,920
Listen, don't get it twisted here.

481
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,759
The libertine lifestyle
and partying doesn't make me happy.

482
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,599
What I actually want
is something really… worthwhile, you know?

483
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,519
But that feels practically impossible.

484
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Why's that?

485
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,240
Okay, well, assuming your soulmate
hasn't already died or not been born yet,

486
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,279
the possibilities of finding them
are one in 10,000 lifetimes.

487
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,119
Honestly,
I don't buy the whole soulmates thing.

488
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,240
It means just a marketing gimmick to me.
But sure, all right. I'll humor you.

489
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,960
So, what do you call you and Ander, then?

490
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,200
Pfft.

491
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
I mean, call it whatever you want.

492
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,759
But, uh…

493
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,519
…you know when you fuck somebody
and look 'em in the eyes,

494
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,519
and in that moment,
time stands still?

495
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,319
And for five seconds,
you get this feeling.

496
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,680
There's nothing else but them.

497
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,360
And you can't help yourself but to smile.

498
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,639
Of course you know it.

499
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,760
Because you got to have that
with each other in this lifetime.

500
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Hey. Welcome.

501
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,360
-Hi.
-Come in.

502
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,840
Check it out. That there's the bathroom.
And my room, in case you want to change.

503
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,079
-You want a drink?
-What?

504
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,360
-Do you want a drink?
-I don't drink alcohol.

505
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,559
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

506
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,039
Ari. Come on. Get your towel and drink up.

507
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,519
-Patrick, I don't drink. You know that.
-Yeah, except for when you do.

508
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,559
Come on. I want Ira to come to the party.
She's awesome.

509
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,480
Who is Ira?

510
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,519
She's like your cool alter ego
when you're drunk. Your dark side.

511
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,679
Ari, Ira.

512
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,559
That's the dream team.

513
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:19,920
Hey there.

514
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,719
Here, come on. Let's summon Ira.

515
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,079
Okay, I'll have a little,
but just 'cause my mouth is dry.

516
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,559
Sure, whatever.

517
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:36,400
Unfortunately, there's no garbagemen
here for your amusement this time.

518
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,519
Garbagemen who?

519
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:42,360
About seven in the morning?
It was August, in Biarritz.

520
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,559
Want me to show you the video?

521
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,920
-No.
-I figured.

522
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,639
I came up with the towel party idea.

523
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,760
-Hi.
-And I said, "Why not?"

524
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,559
Hello. How you doing?

525
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,239
I'm great. How are you tonight?

526
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
I'm great.

527
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,760
I have an idea. Wanna dance?

528
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,280
Or chitchat a bit?

529
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,679
Or chitchat while dancing?

530
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,800
Excuse me.

531
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,519
-Is Nadia your girlfriend?
-Yeah.

532
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,880
-Oh.
-Hey. How are you, sweetie?

533
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,079
Mm, are you naked right now?

534
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,320
No, I'm wearing a towel.

535
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,679
Hi. Look.

536
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,920
We're dressed in towels
at your brother's house.

537
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
He's having a party.

538
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,639
There they are.

539
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,840
And that girl is?

540
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,400
Oh, she's one of the new kids here.
They just joined our class.

541
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,119
Guzmán, I can barely hear you.
Can you please find a quieter spot?

542
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,400
You can't hear me? Wait, one minute.

543
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,800
Are you just gonna stare at me,
or are you gonna come out and say it?

544
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,360
-Do I really look that bad in a towel?
-Not at all. You look fuckin' awesome.

545
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,760
It's just that,
once it gets to be this late,

546
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
between the hot outfits
and the buzz, well…

547
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,159
-What do you expect?
-What?

548
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,079
Well, so…
It's just… we wanted to ask you if, uh…

549
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,400
-What?
-Let's see.

550
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,159
Mm, well, would you like to, um,

551
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,119
join us to… uh, to, like,

552
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,000
Go on a… a night out?

553
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,960
-No.
-A party?

554
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,760
I mean, to like…

555
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,079
You mean a three-way?

556
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,920
Yes.

557
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,079
Well, why didn't you just come out
and say that?

558
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,440
'Cause of what you said earlier.
That now you're looking to settle down.

559
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
The thing about the five seconds

560
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,239
versus going around,
having meaningless sex.

561
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,280
This late and dressed in a towel?
Now is not when you settle down.

562
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,119
So, to your room?

563
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,320
Now? Already?

564
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,599
Come on.

565
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,159
-I think we should talk.
-Hold on.

566
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,159
Oof.

567
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,519
Nadia, are you seriously
gonna get mad at me for partying?

568
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,960
You're in New York.
You can do what you want,

569
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,079
and I'm fine with that.

570
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,559
Well, I'm not angry or anything.

571
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,960
It's just that I'm here studying,
and you're--

572
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,679
And I'm partying. Say it.

573
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,679
Look, um…
I mean, don't you realize that

574
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,119
this only goes to show
that our lives are like night and day?

575
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,320
Like, literally.

576
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,079
Does this seem like a normal,

577
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,159
healthy relationship
that's going somewhere to you?

578
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,280
Yes.

579
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,280
To me, it does. Yeah.

580
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,880
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
But, really, I'm very sorry.

581
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,800
I… I just have a lot of baggage.
A shit ton.

582
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,079
Just packed full of… of insecurities,
full of fears, full of--

583
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,800
Shh.

584
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,280
It… It's hot,
but it bums me out just a smidge

585
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,360
when you keep shutting me up like that.
Just sayin'.

586
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,360
I want you to forget your fears, okay?

587
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,320
Like, I'm in a towel.
I can't be that scary.

588
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,960
Yes, queens! Bravo, bravo, bravo!
Long live love. I'm so here for it!

589
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,199
Oh, Mencía, I'm so over the moon for you.
Honestly, girl. It's true.

590
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm just so glad to see you super happy
and, like, content.

591
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,119
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! Ah…
You deserve the absolute best, honey.

592
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,440
And so do you, Rebeka.

593
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:17,480
Mwah!

594
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,840
What are you doin'?

595
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:28,719
I'm making an executive decision.

596
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,199
No more looking
for the perfect place and time.

597
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,440
The place is here.

598
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,559
The time is now.

599
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:34,519
I thought you didn't drink.

600
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,480
Funny, and I thought
you didn't undress in public

601
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,760
'cause your nipples
are too fancy and royal.

602
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,800
-Oh.
-Oh, fuck.

603
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,719
Who's that hunk over there?

604
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,639
He's in our class, I think.

605
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,960
-Really?
-Pretty sure this is his party.

606
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,840
Oh yeah, he opened the door for me.

607
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,199
-Hi.
-Hi there. How are you?

608
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,199
-Great, how are you?
-I'm great now.

609
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,519
Oh, I'm so glad.

610
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,039
I didn't think you'd come.

611
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,679
-Why not?
-Because we're not part of the same class.

612
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,000
What do you mean?

613
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,280
Phillipe just told me we were.
You are messing with me.

614
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,239
No.
We're not part of the same social class.

615
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,239
Not like our school.

616
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, all right. I get you.

617
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,280
Well, when I drink,
I forget all about stupid old class.

618
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,480
-Really?
-Yeah. In every sense of the word.

619
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,960
-Yeah.
-Because "class" is super polysemic.

620
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:30,880
And polysyllabic.

621
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,119
So, when I drink, I forget every last bit.

622
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,800
-Mm.
-That's why I don't drink.

623
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,599
I get the feeling
she prefers waiters to princes.

624
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,719
-Tough break.
-It's possible.

625
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,880
-I know.
-Mm-hmm.

626
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,840
-Wanna dance with me?
-Sure.

627
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,159
Come on, then.

628
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,960
I really admire what you do.

629
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,639
But why? What have I done in my life
to make you admire me?

630
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,039
Shit, where do I start?

631
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,480
You can wear whatever you want,
but you gamble on young designers

632
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,719
who normally get zero exposure,
and you give them just that.

633
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, that's it.
Who was your seed designer?

634
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:06,920
Huh?

635
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Those of us who like fashion

636
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,320
all have that one special designer
who planted that first seed.

637
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,159
For example, mine is Silvio Alessandro--

638
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,679
…de la Guardia. Sadelagu.

639
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,280
-You're kidding me. He's yours as well?
-Of course.

640
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,679
What's the matter?

641
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,840
You're used to smiling and all the girls
falling at your feet, aren't you?

642
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,400
Well, just maybe,
that tactic won't work with me.

643
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,320
Sure.
Let me see if I get this right, okay?

644
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,800
What you want is to play it cool
and reject me

645
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,840
so that eventually,
I'll end up falling in love with you.

646
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,159
-Oh.
-I can tell you how that tactic ends.

647
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:46,400
Badly, right?

648
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:49,039
Best scenario, you are in the friend zone.

649
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,599
Oof. Friend zone?

650
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:51,960
-Mm-hmm.
-Fatal.

651
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:54,800
-Isn't it?
-We don't like the friend zone at all.

652
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,480
-We don't like it?
-No.

653
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,880
-Here's the problem.
-What?

654
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,039
I wanna kiss you, but I won't
take advantage of a drunk girl.

655
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,440
-Are you drunk right now?
-No.

656
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,440
-You're not?
-No.

657
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,639
-Then I'll kiss you.
-Okay.

658
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,239
Nadia.

659
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,320
Hi.

660
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,800
Hey, listen.

661
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,679
I've been thinking.

662
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
And you're right.

663
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,480
We're in over our heads,
and we can't get them above water.

664
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,280
It doesn't make any sense to keep trying.

665
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,719
Let's give each other
a couple days to think it over, okay?

666
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,519
Okay. That would be good. Get some rest.

667
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh no, the garbagemen.

668
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,639
Now the alcohol's out of your system,
you've remembered class again.

669
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,000
What? What class? You mean at school?

670
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,159
Uh, no, I don't… I don't drink.

671
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,519
I don't know what alcohol
you're talking about.

672
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,440
Don't worry.
I'm good at staying in the background.

673
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,679
It's where I live.

674
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,639
I don't want anyone
to get expelled because of me.

675
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:59,480
No one should pay for their family's sins
because of who my family is.

676
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,840
It's a matter of control and security.

677
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,480
My family didn't ask for even half
of the measures you put in place.

678
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,079
Besides, I've had the chance
to meet my classmates,

679
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:30,000
and I feel welcome.

680
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,280
I don't see any danger in them.

681
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:34,480
Very well.

682
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,440
Which measures should I get rid of?

683
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,559
The cameras, perhaps?

684
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,559
No, not the cameras.

685
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,880
I'd prefer it if you kept them.
