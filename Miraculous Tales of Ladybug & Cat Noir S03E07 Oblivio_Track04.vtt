‎What happened? Who are you?

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.220
‎I'm... uh, I... I don't know.
‎I don't remember my own name!

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.180
‎Me neither.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.820
‎Looks like you and I
‎were at the same costume party!

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.340
‎Why is that flashing?

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.460
‎And your earrings too!
‎We must shop at the same store!

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.020
‎-Are we supposed to know each other?
‎-I'd be surprised if we weren't.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.500
‎Aaah! There are giant bugs!
‎Mice? Bug-mice?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.100
‎Wow! I am starving right now!

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.660
‎Hi there! What are you exactly?
‎Genies, like the one in the lamp?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.940
‎If I'm a genie, where's my lamp?
‎Besides, where am I? And who are you?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.020
‎-What was that thing doing in my earring?
‎-I'm not a "thing," I'm...

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.740
‎ I don't know what I am!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.700
‎But I do know that I'm very hungry!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.780
‎-Aw, poor little... ‎no thing‎.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.660
‎OK, we're gonna keep our cool here.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.340
‎We've all lost our memories and
‎we don't know why, but we'll find out!

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.980
‎What is it this time?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.100
‎-We can't stay here!
‎-Couldn't agree more!

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.820
‎-Perhaps we should help them?
‎-I'm not going anywhere until I know

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.980
‎what smells so good in that boy's shirt!

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340
‎We seem to be exceptional beings,
‎unlike them!

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.500
‎Thank you!

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.700
‎Let's get outta here!

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.300
‎-The exit is blocked.
‎-We'll have to find another way out.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.540
‎-Fast!
‎-Over there!

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.140
‎OK! We're stuck in a building, with
‎amnesia, being chased by a... a thing

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.180
‎that's got it in for us big time!

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.380
‎Not to the mention the creatures who
‎appeared when our costumes disappeared!

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.740
‎Uh, excuse me,
‎but the creatures are hungry.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.940
‎Would you mind opening up your shirt
‎to see what smells so good?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.140
‎Camembert?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.900
‎It's the most beautiful thing
‎I've ever seen!

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.780
‎-Will this do?
‎-Mmm! Thank you!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.980
‎Marinette!
‎My name is Marinette Dupain-Cheng.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.700
‎Pleased to meet you, Marinette.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.380
‎-Adrien Agreste.
‎-Super nice to meet you too, Adrien.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.340
‎Of course! We've still got our phones!

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.060
‎Brilliant!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.820
‎Is yours locked too?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.460
‎The thing's coming this way!

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.820
‎We need to find
‎a way out of this building!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.460
‎And we will! Until then...

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.780
‎-What do we do?
‎-Shh!

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.260
‎Argh! We will get you.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.100
‎Wow! You seem to always have
‎the right idea at the right time!

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.820
‎I hope you're right!

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.140
‎Aaah!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.660
‎-Sorry.
‎-Sorry.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.020
‎-OK, I suggest we go upstairs.
‎-But there's no way out up there!

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.580
‎We'll get trapped again!

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.220
‎We can hide out here
‎while we signal for help!

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.420
‎Good idea!

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.580
‎No handle! And the glass is tinted!
‎They won't be able to see us!

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.860
‎The phone lines are down. If only
‎I could remember how to unlock this.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.140
‎Wait!

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.540
‎Nice work, Marinette!

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.500
‎Uh-oh! But who should we call?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.580
‎-I'm almost out of battery!
‎-Me too. We should call our parents first.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.420
‎Gabriel Agreste. Probably... my dad.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.100
<i>‎This is my voicemail. To leave a message,</i>
<i>‎please call my secretary.</i>

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.940
‎Let's hope you have better luck.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.580
‎Agreste... ‎Césaire‎... ‎Couphène‎...
‎Dupain-Cheng Sabine!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.700
<i>‎Marinette, are you OK?</i>
<i>‎They're saying Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.180
<i>‎are battling a villain</i>
<i>‎at Montparnasse Tower!</i>

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.420
<i>‎Isn't that</i>
<i>‎where you were going today?</i>

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.940
‎-Cat Noir and Ladybug?
<i>‎-Marinette? Is everything OK?</i>

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.900
<i>‎-Where are you?</i>
‎-Uh, sure, Mom! Everything's OK!

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.620
‎I'm with my friends. Safe! Don't worry!

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.580
<i>‎I'm so relieved. Whatever you do, stay</i>
<i>‎there until the villain's been defeated!</i>

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.180
‎Sure, Mom, I will! Love you!

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.380
‎-Why didn't you ask her for help?
‎-I have both good and bad news.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.340
‎The good news is there are superheroes
‎here that will stop that supervillain.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.260
‎The bad news is... we're the superheroes
‎and that thing that's chasing us

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.620
‎is the supervillain we are supposed to
‎defeat with superpowers we no longer have!

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.740
‎Nobody? We must have missed something!

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.140
‎They have to be inside the building,
‎Oblivio.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.580
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir can't have escaped.
‎Retrace your steps.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.260
‎They must have transformed back by now,
‎and with their memories erased,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.420
‎you won't have any trouble
‎getting their Miraculous!

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.500
‎If my own mother doesn't know I'm Ladybug,
‎then nobody must know!

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.460
‎What about us? Do you think we know?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.620
‎Hmm.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.940
‎I feel like we're more
‎than just a superhero team.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.900
‎Do you think we're...

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.740
‎-Looks like it.
‎-We must have told each other everything.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.740
‎I couldn't hide my identity
‎from the girl I love.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.300
‎So, if we're the superheroes,
‎then what are they?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.700
‎I have no idea.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.180
‎You can't just leave.
‎We have to help them!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.980
‎We don't even know who we are
‎or who they are!

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.500
‎And I don't want to help out
‎a couple of strangers!

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.420
‎You may not remember,
‎but you know this about yourself.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.580
‎You're a selfish being and a total coward!

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.820
‎Me? A coward? I am not a coward!
‎I... I'm a free spirit!

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.660
‎So don't come if you don't want to,
‎but I'm outta here!

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.260
‎-Did he go to get help?
‎-I don't think we should hold our breath!

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.620
‎Ladybug? Cat Noir? We know you're in here!
‎You won't get away this time!

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.780
‎You remember your BFF Oblivio, don't you?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.940
‎Don't tell us you've... forgotten us!
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.380
‎I'm not convinced that this monster
‎is really our best friend.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.700
‎One thing's for sure,
‎if we're superheroes,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.980
‎he can't find out our secret identities.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.820
‎How about some kind of diversion? We get
‎out of here and take the emergency stairs!

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.580
‎Sorry, I need this.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.460
‎I'll call you. Then when he comes,
‎we make a run for it.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.140
‎I'll use the tape to pull your phone back.
‎Ready?

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.180
‎No wonder I fell in love with you!

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.660
‎Ah-ah! Gotcha! You shouldn't have
‎"forgotten" to switch off your phone!

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.660
‎No!

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.100
‎You're trying to fool Oblivio again!
‎But it's not gonna work this time!

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.060
‎Or perhaps we give you too much credit.
‎Ha, ha, ha!

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.140
‎You saved our lives! Thank you!

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.660
‎Let's go back where we were.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.540
‎It's the last place
‎he'll think of looking for us.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.580
‎Pff... a coward? Me? Whatever!

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.940
‎Huh? Huh? Adrien?

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.380
‎I may not remember my own name,
‎but I know for a fact that I'm brave!

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.020
‎I... I am...

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.620
‎This is called psychological harassment!

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.980
‎-Sorry, your phone's out of juice.
‎-No worries.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.980
‎We're doing pretty well
‎even without powers.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.540
‎It's true. You two make
‎a very effective couple!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.500
‎Yes, but if we want a real shot
‎at defeating this villain,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.740
‎we must become
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir again!

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.580
‎Maybe we can gather hints
‎by watching some news footage

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.220
‎to see what happened
‎before he erased our memories!

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.340
<i>‎-Hey! Do something!</i>
<i>‎-What do you want me to do?</i>

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.260
<i>‎-I don't know. You're the cop!</i>
<i>‎-I am?</i>

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.900
<i>‎-Nadia, you're on the air.</i>
<i>‎-Me? What do I do?</i>

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.340
<i>‎Uh... Don't be bemused,</i>
<i>‎it's just the news.</i>

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.380
<i>‎Since early this afternoon,</i>
<i>‎a supervillain by the name of Oblivio</i>

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.260
<i>‎has been erasing the memories</i>
<i>‎of everyone he meets.</i>

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.940
<i>‎Ladybug and Cat Noir are tracking</i>
<i>‎him down in Montparnasse Tower.</i>

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.060
‎Right now, he's the one tracking us down!

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.460
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir are toying with you,
‎Oblivio. If you can't find them...

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.140
‎Then we'll flush them out of hiding,
‎Hawk Moth!

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.700
<i>‎Looks like Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
<i>‎are struggling today!</i>

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.340
<i>‎And stop calling us a couple!</i>

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.380
‎We don't exactly look lovey-dovey!

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.940
‎Probably a regular fight,
‎like all couples have!

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.180
<i>‎The battle against Oblivio continues.</i>
<i>‎Oh, no! Cat Noir has been hit!</i>

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.420
<i>‎But Ladybug pulls him out of danger.</i>

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.340
<i>‎-What is she doing? Ladybug is down too!</i>
‎-The drawing!

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.020
‎There was a drawing on the elevator wall!
‎I remember now. It was a turtle.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.380
‎I saw it when I was looking
‎for my mom's number.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.660
‎-There it is!
‎-You left yourself a message! So smart!

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.860
‎Mmm.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.340
<i>‎-Hello?</i>
‎-Mr Turtle?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.140
<i>‎Marinette? Is there a problem?</i>

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.060
‎Listen,
‎I can't remember who I am or who you are.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.420
‎Oblivio has erased my memory.
‎But I think I'm supposed to call you!

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.900
<i>‎You did the right thing!</i>

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.100
<i>‎-Is Cat Noir with you?</i>
‎-Yeah... Well, Adrien, actually.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.340
<i>‎You two know</i>
<i>‎your true identities then?</i>

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.380
‎-We're not supposed to?
<i>‎-That's OK.</i>

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.340
<i>‎The Miraculous Ladybugs</i>
<i>‎will repair everything anyway!</i>

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.420
‎We've figured out we're superheroes, but
‎we don't know how to get back to that.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.780
‎Mr Turtle! You'll have to tell us quick.
‎I'm almost out of battery!

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.900
<i>‎Are your kwamis with you?</i>

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.100
‎If you mean the flying creatures,
‎then the red one is with us!

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.820
<i>‎OK, listen carefully. The red kwami's name</i>
<i>‎is Tikki. She gives you your powers.</i>

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.340
<i>‎Say "Tikki, spots on"</i>
<i>‎and you'll transform into Ladybug.</i>

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.220
<i>‎You'll find an emergency</i>
<i>‎user's guide in your Bugphone.</i>

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.780
<i>‎Adrien, your kwami's the black one.</i>
<i>‎His name is Plagg.</i>

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.380
<i>‎Tell him, "Plagg, claws out"</i>
<i>‎and you'll become Cat Noir again.</i>

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.980
<i>‎The rest is in your Catphone.</i>

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.740
‎But... my kwami took off!

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.140
‎You won't be able to transform
‎without him --

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.180
‎You're a selfish being,
‎and a total coward!

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.220
‎I am not a coward!
‎And I'm not selfish either!

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.140
‎But... maybe this Adrien boy
‎has some yummy camembert left!

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.020
‎Ladybug! Cat Noir! If you don't come out
‎of hiding and give us your Miraculous,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.180
‎this giant bubble's gonna erase the
‎memories of every single person in Paris!

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.700
‎It's time to bring Ladybug back!

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.780
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.060
‎Yeah!

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.660
‎Wow! It was amazing!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.420
‎Thanks!
‎But I don't feel like a superhero at all!

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.460
‎You've already proven that you are one,
‎with or without a costume!

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.060
‎OK. There seems to be
‎a kind of button here.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.580
‎User's guide?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.540
‎Yoyo's features. Capturing the akuma,
‎one-time power, "Lucky Charm?"

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.260
‎Well... Aaah!

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.220
‎What am I supposed to do with this?
‎Make tea?

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.180
‎-Maybe it's part of a puzzle or riddle.
‎-You're right.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.540
‎It must be just one part of the solution,
‎but how am I going to find<i>‎ the</i>‎ solution?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.020
‎Don't worry. You always have the right
‎idea at the right time! You got this!

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.860
‎It's time for action!

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.260
‎Marinette! I want to fight beside you.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.940
‎If we're a couple,
‎then we'll be stronger together!

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.620
‎But you don't have your kwami
‎or your superpowers!

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.420
‎And without your costume, the villain
‎would know your true identity!

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.140
‎But most of all, I wouldn't want
‎anything to happen to you!

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.260
‎I'm starting to understand
‎how much you mean to me, Adrien.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.180
‎Please, stay there.
‎Ladybug is here to protect you.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.900
‎Wow! I don't need any memory
‎to know that I love that girl!

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.220
‎"The Miraculous enhances
‎all physical abilities."

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.860
‎That will come in handy!

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.980
‎It looks like Ladybug has gotten
‎her powers back, but not her memory.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.020
‎Seize her Miraculous, Oblivio!

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.980
‎Wahoo! Ha, ha!
‎Super-agility is super awesome!

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.940
‎Aaah!

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.820
‎Aaah!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.060
‎Ha, ha!
‎You've forgotten your reflexes, huh?

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.380
‎Now we'll make sure you forget everything
‎else, including your Miraculous!

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.140
‎Attacking a lady on the ground!
‎Did you forget your manners?

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.300
‎Adr‎--

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.980
‎So, can I be of any help in any way?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.380
‎-Plagg?
‎-Plagg? So that's my name? Plagg?

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.780
‎Yeah! And you got here
‎just at the right time!

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.380
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.020
‎What's that?

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.060
‎Hey! Pretty cool, right?

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.780
‎Very cool, but try not to lose
‎your memory again!

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.620
‎Hmm. Stick's features.
‎Superpower... Cata--

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.900
‎Stop!
‎It'll trigger it if you say it out loud!

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.260
‎-And it says it can only be used once.
‎-What does your power do, exactly?

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.380
‎-I can destroy anything I touch!
‎-Then stay away from me.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.780
‎-That's not gonna be easy, my... lady!
‎-Ha, ha!

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.300
‎Seems like you've forgotten about
‎your last defeat! Oh, how silly of us!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.580
‎-Of course you have!
‎-We won't stand a chance

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.180
‎-until we stop him from firing at us!
‎-Of course!

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.380
‎His left hand is different
‎from his body!

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.980
‎-That must be where the akuma is hiding!
‎-I've no idea what the ‎hakuna‎matata‎ is,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.220
‎but I trust you! So what's the plan?

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.660
‎Can you get him
‎to forget about me for a while?

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.860
‎I'm on it! Hey, you!
‎Wanna play cat and mouse with me?

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.780
‎The first one who tags the other wins!

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.380
‎-What in the-- ?
‎-Cat Noir, now!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.900
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.940
‎No more evildoing for you, little akuma!

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.700
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:40.980
‎Gotcha!

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.420
‎Bye, little butterfly!

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.620
‎Wow! So this villain was both these guys?

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.980
‎-What do we do about that?
‎-This is where my other power comes in.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.780
‎It fixes everything back
‎to how it was originally!

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.340
‎Wait. Do you think
‎we'll remember all this afterwards?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.860
‎Apparently, my Miraculous reverts
‎everything. So I'm guessing we won't.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.220
‎All right, then.
‎With your permission, milady.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.220
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.380
‎Uh, Ladybug? Cat Noir?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.340
‎You haven't seen a villain
‎named Oblivio, have you?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.140
‎-You've defeated it already, dude!
‎-Actually, he was us!

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.540
‎-Oh, OK.
‎-Oh, OK.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.620
‎Pound it?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.620
‎Pound it!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.660
‎We do make a good couple, don't you think?
‎Otherwise we wouldn't have won again.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.300
‎Ugh! We're a "team," not a "couple"!

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.340
‎Don't start that again! I've already told
‎you that I'm in love with another boy!

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.820
‎Besides, your "charming kitty act"
‎was the reason we got distracted

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.460
‎and got into all this trouble
‎in the first place! Laugh all you want!

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.540
‎Hey! What are you doing?

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.580
‎Everyone saw that? This is a disaster!
‎What on Earth happened?

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.180
‎Well, we'd make a good-looking couple!

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.540
‎We're meant for each other, milady.
‎You're the only one who doesn't see it!

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.820
‎This conversation is not over!

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.260
‎I won't soon forget this,
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.700
‎The love you both secretly have
‎for each other will be your downfall!

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.260
‎Right, so... Nino and I wanted to say
‎we're sorry for what happened today.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.900
‎Were you two Oblivio?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.780
‎Why erase everyone's memory?

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.100
‎Remember when we visited the tower?

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.860
‎We went and hid, to play Super Pinguino.
‎But Miss Bustier caught us...

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.460
‎And you make fun of us for playing
‎that game, saying it wasn't our age...

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.300
‎-We were embarrassed at getting caught!
‎-That's when we got akumatised!

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.100
‎Next time, just make sure you play at home
‎and not on school field trips.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.380
‎-Understood?
‎-Yes, Miss Bustier. We're sorry again.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.700
‎It's no biggie! ‎Juleka‎ and I
‎often play Super Pinguino together!

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.620
‎Everybody loves that game, you know.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.980
‎-You know, sometimes even Chloé and I --
‎-Hey!

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.220
‎I haven't played it yet, but it looks fun!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.300
‎All you need is to find the right partner.
‎Right, Marinette?

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.540
‎I don't believe it! I actually kissed
‎Cat Noir! How could this have happened?

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.700
‎Who knows? Maybe you still have
‎things to learn about him?

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.460
‎I can't believe it, Plagg.
‎She finally fell in love with me,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.740
‎-and I've forgotten all about it!
‎-You're right, that's really unlucky.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.380
‎You know what? It doesn't matter.
‎If it happened once, it can happen again!

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.500
‎At least now I know
‎my dream can come true.
