1
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Can you take me to see him?

2
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,719
I have to ask him something.

3
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,280
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy.

4
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
He wants him to do the job he loves

5
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,599
and be surrounded by good people.

6
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,719
…You meet someone better than me,

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,919
someone you are happier with,

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,960
and isn't a burden like me?

9
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,280
Will you leave me for him?

10
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,960
Did you bring me here

11
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,360
for a particular reason?

12
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,599
Each of us is a unique flower.

13
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,800
You are a special flower

14
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,960
that belongs to me.

15
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,159
Tofu.

16
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm glad I get to love you.

17
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,680
If death parts us one day

18
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,520
and a miracle brings us back together,

19
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,520
would we fall in love again?

20
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,759
If I died

21
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,039
and came back as a ghost,

22
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,400
would you run from me?

23
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,039
I wouldn't run even if you were ugly.

24
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
I see.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,719
I should come back all handsome,

26
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,800
so you would fall for me first.

27
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,759
Is something wrong, Nut?

28
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm fine.

29
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
To me,

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
the fact that we are together

31
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,879
is a dream come true.

32
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,479
Luck doesn't come by often.

33
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,039
You are being too modest.

34
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm being ambitious.

35
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
I just don't want us to part ways.

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,600
What are you doing?

37
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,800
Well, I'm taking a photo as proof.

38
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,399
You promised to love me and only me.

39
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,759
Stop it.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
Stop it, Tarn.

41
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,519
I'm sorry, Nut.

42
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,800
I didn't know how to tell you.

43
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
The person you recognized…

44
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,600
Was it really Tarn?

45
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,319
Yes.

46
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,800
I just found out

47
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,920
that Prib knows him too.

48
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,959
We came here together yesterday.

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,199
Yesterday?

50
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,079
You recognized Tarn.

51
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,399
You knew who he was.

52
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,439
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,879
And you still asked me those questions.

54
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,639
You know,

55
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,319
I wasn't delighted at all when you said

56
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,600
you recognized him.

57
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,040
I was scared.

58
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,399
I was scared that if I brought you to him,

59
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,959
I would lose you.

60
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,160
But if I held you back,

61
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,160
you would be hurt.

62
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,759
I hurt your feelings again.

64
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,839
I'm really sorry.

65
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,040
You didn't hurt me.

66
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,319
I was just surprised.

67
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,720
I thought of him…

68
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,439
but I didn't expect to see him
in that condition.

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,319
I didn't think

70
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
that you guys…

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,199
would know each other.

72
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Aren't you happy

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
to see him again?

74
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,879
I never thought

75
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,720
about how I would feel
if I ever saw him again.

76
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,320
But just now,

77
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,039
when I saw him…

78
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,600
I realized that he wasn't just…

79
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,039
Just on your mind.

80
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,600
You miss him.

81
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,919
Do you still love Tatarn?

82
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
I don't know.

83
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,879
But I really love you, Tofu.

84
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
Thank you.

85
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,480
It's really funny.

86
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,799
How can the two people I love

87
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,840
know each other?

88
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,639
Why did you have to see Tarn?

89
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,799
Why do you know each other?

90
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,080
AN OLD STORY RETOLD…
AFTER A LONG WHILE

91
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,720
Tofu told you all about it, didn't he?

92
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm sorry

93
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,240
for causing trouble
and hurting your and Tofu's feelings.

94
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't know if a miracle
will happen or not.

95
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
All I can do is hope.

96
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,799
If a miracle happens,

97
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,120
that would be good.

98
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,159
But if it doesn't…

99
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Do you still love Tatarn?

100
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,879
I don't know.

101
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,120
But I really love you, Tofu.

102
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
Don't worry about it.

103
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,639
They used to date after all.

104
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
Nut is just showing his support.

105
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Mr. Saen.

106
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Jan.

107
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,200
I can't believe we all know each other.

108
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,960
People say it's a small world.

109
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,480
Everyone is family.

110
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,600
We are either related by blood

111
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,159
or by sex.

112
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,480
Stay quiet if you have nothing to say.

113
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,799
I was just making a joke.

114
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,279
You came all this way to make a joke.

115
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,399
You must have a lot of time on your hands.

116
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,559
Yes, I do.

117
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,720
I went to see Saen
after I collected the rent.

118
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,120
If I had known
you wanted to join our trip,

119
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,039
I would have invited you.

120
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,320
A trip with me wouldn't be as fun
as a trip with your gay…

121
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,120
I mean, your family.

122
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,919
Na must be really happy

123
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,559
that her son

124
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,200
and his friend took her on a trip.

125
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,480
Yes.

126
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,480
I was going to visit you with my mom.

127
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,200
You didn't have much time
to talk last time.

128
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,080
You guys get along really well.

129
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,600
She would be happy to see you.

130
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,600
Right, Tofu?

131
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes.

132
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Why don't you invite Na over for dinner?

133
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,919
-We can have a long conversation.
-No.

134
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,679
I'm sure their schedule is packed.

135
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Why not? Are you afraid of something?

136
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,399
Don't you want to see an old friend?

137
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,759
Sure.

138
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
It has been a while
since we ate as a family.

139
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,759
If you and Tofu hadn't visited Tarn,

140
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,720
we wouldn't be having
a meal together like this.

141
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,039
Did you say Tarn?

142
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,799
Tarn, the guy Tofu recognized,

143
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,559
is Jan's nephew.

144
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't know how close Tarn and Tofu were.

145
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,879
I hope

146
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,679
it is not what I think it is.

147
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,679
Everyone.

148
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,159
The food is here.

149
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
Let's all eat.

150
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,200
The food here is great.

151
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,759
My dad takes me here often.

152
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,759
Jan, do you happen to know

153
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,759
how close

154
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,600
Tarn and I were?

155
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,120
I don't know.

156
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,759
If I had known you,

157
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,080
I would have recognized you
from the beginning.

158
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,360
Tarn's mouth often got him in trouble,

159
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
so we weren't really close.

160
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,559
All I remember is

161
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,039
when he was in high school in Bangkok,

162
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,759
he got called into the principal's office.

163
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,480
I don't know what happened back then.

164
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,000
But I kind of

165
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,120
have an idea now.

166
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,159
I wonder whose toes
he stepped on this time.

167
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
That person put him in a coma.

168
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,720
We'll have to wait for him to wake up

169
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,240
to find out whose toes he stepped on.

170
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,480
Tarn wouldn't get involved

171
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,000
for no reason.

172
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,879
You seem to know a lot about him.

173
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,320
You must have been close.

174
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,320
If that's true,

175
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,480
I hope someone here doesn't mind.

176
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,840
It's none of your business.

177
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,639
Just eat.

178
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,759
Tarn and I used to be close.

179
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,399
We were a couple.

180
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,879
But right now,

181
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,879
Tofu and I

182
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,759
are a couple.

183
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,799
You finally came out.

184
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually, I don't feel
the need to announce

185
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,240
what I am

186
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,440
and who I'm dating.

187
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,000
But if you really want to know,

188
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,440
I can tell you.

189
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
It's not something
to be embarrassed about.

190
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,839
We are just like a heterosexual couple.

191
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,319
We live in the same house,

192
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000
spend time together,

193
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,200
and sleep together.

194
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,599
I think it's more embarrassing

195
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,200
to pretend to have a perfect relationship

196
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,720
when it's far from the truth.

197
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,680
I'm surprised

198
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,599
at how honest you're being.

199
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,799
The fact that you're okay with this

200
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,920
proves you are quite ignorant.

201
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
That's not true.

202
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,720
The ignorant one

203
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,279
is the person judging other people.

204
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,039
Is it wrong that some people
can't accept it?

205
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,440
No, it's not.

206
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,079
Whether someone can accept it or not,

207
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,119
it's their problem.

208
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,920
Everyone has rights.

209
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,519
I just realized

210
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,240
that you're not just a screenwriter,

211
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,559
but you are a human rights activist too.

212
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,599
Anyone can show interest in human rights.

213
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,720
It's up to us whether we care or not.

214
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,079
People have been paying attention

215
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,880
to human rights and equality.

216
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,960
You don't have to be an LGBTQ+

217
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,519
in order to fight for their rights.

218
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,279
You don't have to be a disabled person

219
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,039
in order to fight for their rights.

220
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,359
Your voice

221
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
can help other people.

222
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,680
I understand you need principle and reason
to talk to kids these days.

223
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,640
I might be old-fashioned,

224
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,039
but I will try to understand
your point of view.

225
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,799
People from my days

226
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,160
would call you guys "faggots,"

227
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,119
but people nowadays would probably say

228
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,519
you are just two people in love.

229
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,519
A genderless love.

230
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,680
Something like that, right?

231
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,480
Everybody has a gender.

232
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,119
You can be any gender you wish to be.

233
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,160
And every gender is equal.

234
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,559
The term "genderless love"

235
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
might sound romantic to you,

236
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,200
but it shows how
you do not accept our identities.

237
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,559
Specifying one's gender

238
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,000
is a way to show respect.

239
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,960
If you still don't get it,

240
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,960
I would be happy to explain it

241
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,039
when you are free.

242
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,079
There are many things

243
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,079
we need to discuss.

244
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
Got it?

245
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,160
Sajjaree.

246
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,119
Stop it, Jan.

247
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,759
-What?
-Come with me.

248
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,200
What is it?

249
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,559
I'm going to the toilet.

250
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,319
I'll go with you.

251
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:06,920
It's okay.

252
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,640
I can go alone. Please enjoy the meal.

253
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,480
This family gathering

254
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
is so damn heartwarming.

255
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,319
What is it? Let me go.

256
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Stop it.

257
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
-Listen.
-Let go.

258
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,359
Why did you do that?

259
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
Do what?

260
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,160
You asked Nut about his personal life

261
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,599
and made him uncomfortable.

262
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,799
What good did it do?

263
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,599
Did it make your life better?

264
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,559
-They were rude to me first.
-Stop it.

265
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't be silly.

266
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,960
You invited them to scold you.

267
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,720
-So why are you upset?
-Saen.

268
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,319
Do you think I don't know why you're here?

269
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,519
Enough with the stupid jealousy.

270
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,680
It's embarrassing.

271
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,039
If you can't do it for your sake,

272
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:18,799
then do it for the sake
of your so-called husband.

273
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,240
Aren't you hungry?

274
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,200
You keep staring at the food.

275
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,279
We are at a very famous restaurant.

276
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,319
We can't just sit here.

277
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,519
All right, I'll start the meal.

278
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,119
You guys go ahead and eat.

279
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm going to check on Mom.

280
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:54,720
Nut.

281
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,000
Wait.

282
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,880
Nut.

283
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,480
Are you still upset with Jan?

284
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
There's no point in being upset.

285
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,839
We can't stop people's thoughts.

286
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,880
So let's focus on being happy.

287
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm sorry

288
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,400
about what I said to Jan.

289
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,640
I should have asked you first.

290
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,440
But we really are a couple.

291
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,319
Nut.

292
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Tofu.

293
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,319
Are you okay?

294
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,079
Do you want to leave?

295
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,640
Are you leaving?

296
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,720
Yes.

297
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,079
This trip must be tiring her out.

298
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm taking her back to the hotel.

299
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:04,480
Do you want to see a doctor?
I can take you.

300
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,319
What's the rush?

301
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,519
We haven't finished eating.

302
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,279
Jan.

303
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,799
Enough.

304
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
What's wrong?

305
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,640
Are you afraid people

306
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,279
might find out about you guys?

307
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,000
Jan.

308
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,000
You are obviously concerned about her.

309
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,480
So why hide it?

310
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,799
Since we have many witnesses here,

311
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,480
just announce your relationship.

312
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,240
What are you saying?

313
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,599
Ask your mom

314
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,160
why your dad used to call you

315
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,799
-a bastard.
-Stop it.

316
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,559
What are you saying?

317
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm saying the truth.

318
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
You are worried about Na and her son.

319
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,720
-Admit you're her lover and his father.
-What?

320
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,440
That's nonsense.

321
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,279
Nonsense?

322
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
How is it nonsense?

323
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,240
What were you guys doing
behind my back then?

324
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,960
When she ran here
after fighting with her husband,

325
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,839
you came to comfort her.

326
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,319
What was your wife supposed to think?

327
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,240
About what Jan said,

328
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,119
is it true?

329
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,759
You ran away from the house

330
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
to see Uncle Saen
like Dad said, didn't you?

331
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,799
Your mom is gone.

332
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,279
She's with your dad.

333
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,880
She packed up her bag
and went to see your uncle.

334
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,000
She would never do that.

335
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,359
I already checked.

336
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,160
She isn't with her relatives

337
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,480
or her friends.

338
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,359
Who else can she be with, if not Saen?

339
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,960
Your mom and your uncle
have been in love for a long time.

340
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Although she's mine,
they've been cheating behind my back.

341
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,799
That scum

342
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,559
is a weak loser.

343
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,599
That's why his son is such a fragile homo.

344
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,839
You are too weak to be my son.

345
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,160
You are a bastard.

346
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,599
Did you go to Chiang Mai?

347
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Do you and Uncle Saen
still love each other?

348
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Am I really a bastard like Dad said?

349
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,559
Don't say that.

350
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,640
It's not what you think.

351
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,960
I don't want to.

352
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,119
But Dad used to call me that.

353
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,799
He made me feel like I wasn't his child.

354
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,720
The man in her heart

355
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,440
is you.

356
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,519
It's my fault.

357
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Your dad misunderstood because of me.

358
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,880
I left a scar on his heart.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,279
I admit

360
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,680
that I couldn't move on from her.

361
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,960
But I respected your mom's decision.

362
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
I tried to forget about her

363
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,440
because I loved both of them.

364
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,319
Saen.

365
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,079
I'm sorry I missed the morning ceremony.

366
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
Congratulations.

367
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,920
I wish you happiness

368
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,359
and to have a baby soon.

369
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
Thank you.

370
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,799
I'm sorry we are late.

371
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,160
I hope we are not too late

372
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,119
to congratulate both of you.

373
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,799
I watched your mom and Sib from afar

374
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,440
and found out they had you.

375
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,559
I thought your mom and I
could never be together ever.

376
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,880
That's why I married Jan.

377
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,079
Your dad was very happy
when you were born.

378
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,759
I was happy to hold my nephew too.

379
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,079
We became close again.

380
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,279
Saen.

381
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,279
There, there.

382
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,319
Can you hold him

383
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,240
for a second?

384
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,720
I will be back.

385
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,960
But little did I know that our closeness

386
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,920
was making Sib paranoid.

387
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,440
His paranoia destroyed everything.

388
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:13,880
He would turn

389
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,839
small issues into a big deal

390
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:19,200
and connect unrelated stuff.

391
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,359
The situation became worse.

392
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:49,519
CONGRATULATIONS. I WISH YOU HAPPINESS.
BEAR ME A NEPHEW SOON. FROM SAEN.

393
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,519
What are you doing?

394
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,960
Nothing.

395
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,400
-Then why were you looking at it?
-Sib.

396
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,359
Do you miss him?

397
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,880
Is it that bad to live with me?

398
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,440
-I haven't said a word.
-You haven't said a word,

399
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,599
but your actions send a clear message.

400
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,839
Don't start a fight.

401
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,680
I'm already worried about our son.

402
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,319
He's your responsibility.

403
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,759
How on earth did you raise him
to be like that?

404
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,160
Is it all my fault?

405
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,759
Both of us raised him together.

406
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,359
Raising our son is your job, not mine.

407
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,880
My job is to work and earn money.

408
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,480
You are the reason he's like this.

409
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,039
If it wasn't your fault,

410
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,880
I would blame it on his father's DNA.

411
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,079
What do you mean?

412
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,480
Do you think I don't know

413
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,319
that you and Saen are still in love?

414
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,079
You guys were rubbing it

415
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,559
in my face.

416
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,119
What happens when I'm away?

417
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,720
-Are you saying Saen and I--
-Am I wrong?

418
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,440
Every time he visits,

419
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,640
you look happier to see him than me.

420
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,359
Is this blanket

421
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,200
something to remember him by?

422
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,920
No, honey.

423
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,039
If I'm wrong,

424
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,920
there's no need to keep it then.

425
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,720
-No.
-Why do you have it?

426
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,200
-Tell me.
-No.

427
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,279
I shouldn't have married you.

428
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
Give it to me.

429
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,759
-No.
-What are you doing?

430
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,000
-Do you love him?
-What?

431
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,599
-Don't do it.
-Do you love him?

432
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
No.

433
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,680
No.

434
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,039
Don't do this.

435
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,799
Sib claimed to have loved her.

436
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,599
Yet he would hurt

437
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,559
the woman he loved whenever she upset him.

438
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,920
How could humans
hurt each other so easily?

439
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,039
Did you fight with Dad…

440
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,119
because of me?

441
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
No.

442
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,279
It wasn't you.

443
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,799
The problem was between me and your dad.

444
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,799
Why did you run away to see Uncle?

445
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,640
I didn't mean to go see him.

446
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,440
I had nowhere to go.

447
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,279
I needed somewhere…

448
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,279
to clear my head.

449
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,079
I didn't expect to see Saen there.

450
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,039
Na.

451
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,159
Why are you here?

452
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Wait.

453
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,519
Did Sib hurt you?

454
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,199
What happened?

455
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,159
He…

456
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,480
He can't accept
the fact that our son is gay.

457
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Saen told me on that day

458
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,679
that it wasn't anyone's fault

459
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,920
being like this.

460
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,440
The problem wasn't my bad motherhood.

461
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,119
You weren't wrong.

462
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,960
It was just how you were.

463
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,679
He told me to love you the way you were.

464
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,719
I thought it would be best to pretend
as if nothing happened

465
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,559
to protect our family.

466
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,639
I thought time would heal our situation.

467
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,159
But with certain things,

468
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,280
time

469
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
only makes them worse.

470
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,639
If I had been stronger…

471
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,199
and talked to you then…

472
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,719
we would have reached an understanding.

473
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,079
That's why you stopped visiting.

474
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,400
You avoided problems with Dad…

475
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,480
and Jan, didn't you?

476
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Love can be destroyed easily

477
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,280
without trust.

478
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,159
I can't blame everything on Jan.

479
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,440
It's partly my fault

480
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,480
for agreeing to marry her
in return for favors.

481
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,440
Despite everything,

482
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,199
you made the right choice

483
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,199
standing up for yourself

484
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,719
and your relationships.

485
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,800
Maintaining a stable relationship

486
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,960
isn't easy.

487
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,400
As long as you guys are happy,

488
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,679
you have my support.

489
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,599
Can't you sleep?

490
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,079
You too, right?

491
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,559
Something is on my mind.

492
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,039
What's on your mind, Tofu?

493
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,280
Can you tell me?

494
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,039
I'm thinking of a way

495
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,519
to put you to sleep.

496
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,119
You always worry about me.

497
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,119
Just worry about yourself.

498
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,960
You are all

499
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,159
I can think about.

500
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,760
I know

501
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,880
that I made you

502
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,320
uncomfortable today.

503
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
I just couldn't control myself.

504
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,679
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,519
It's okay.

506
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm glad you can be yourself

507
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,239
whenever you are with me.

508
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,119
If something is troubling you,

509
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,320
I'll be the one to ease your mind.

510
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,199
I had a long day.

512
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,039
TOFU HAS SENT YOU A PHOTO

513
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,679
TOFU HAS SENT YOU A PHOTO

514
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,039
TOFU

515
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,880
TOFU

516
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,000
You didn't wake me up.

517
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,719
But I knew you couldn't have gone far

518
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,800
in your pajamas.

519
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,800
Where could I go?

520
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,760
I told you

521
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,679
that my heart is yours.

522
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
I'm sorry

523
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,360
for acting silly yesterday.

524
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:05,159
I knew

525
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,920
that you were hurt

526
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,519
and troubled as well.

527
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,519
You are right.

528
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,360
I haven't forgotten Tarn.

529
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,559
It's like I told you before.

530
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,079
Tarn was my first love.

531
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,760
He made me discover who I am

532
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,719
and taught me to love myself.

533
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:42,719
I've been feeling guilty…

534
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,960
about the way we broke up.

535
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,000
I was scared

536
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,920
that the person you saw

537
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,800
might be your past lover.

538
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,440
But it's worse.

539
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:07,760
The person you saw

540
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,800
turned out to be Tarn.

541
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm scared

542
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,679
you might be more than acquaintances.

543
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,000
I want him to get better.

544
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,760
But if he gets better

545
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,920
and it turns out

546
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,840
that you two used to be lovers,

547
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,000
I would be very selfish

548
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,079
to keep you with me.

549
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:48,920
You don't want to lose me, do you?

550
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,079
Tarn

551
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,760
made me discover myself.

552
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,480
But you…

553
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,599
taught me how to love again.

554
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,320
Good people like you and Tarn

555
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,519
shouldn't suffer because of me.

556
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:16,679
It's impossible

557
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,480
for me and Tarn

558
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,559
to be an item in the past.

559
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,400
The only person I love

560
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,119
is you.

561
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,239
Whether it's him

562
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,440
or anyone else,

563
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,880
no one can make me as happy as you do.

564
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:52,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

565
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm glad

566
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:57,599
you are smiling.

567
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:02,840
Sometimes, I wonder

568
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,800
where you came from.

569
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:07,920
How can you warm my heart this much?

570
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,519
Your family raised you well.

571
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Who knows,

572
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,320
maybe I came from another planet.

573
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,599
Even your mom said

574
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,840
I'm a Little Prince who fell from the sky.

575
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,599
You can't believe her.

576
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Although you haven't gotten
your memory back,

577
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
don't worry.

578
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,840
I'll help you find your family.

579
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,159
Will you let me stay with you

580
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,559
if I don't want to leave?

581
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,559
When you get your memory back,

582
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,320
you might be able to get by without me.

583
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,559
Don't sulk.

584
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:34,639
I'll help you.

585
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:39,159
I'm curious.

586
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:40,880
If you and Tarn

587
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
weren't an item,

588
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,719
then how were you

589
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
connected?

590
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,039
If you really knew Tarn,

591
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,840
maybe you came here.

592
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:48,119
Something here

593
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,199
might trigger your memory.

594
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:55,559
Let's go inside.

595
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,039
This is the first time
I'm learning about you

596
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,440
from your place.

597
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,280
No wonder

598
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,760
you've been in Nut's heart all this time.

599
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:54,000
Do you like it?

600
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,960
It's cute.

601
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,840
Like you.

602
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,880
How is it like me?

603
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,920
Well,

604
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,199
you're covered in spines,

605
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,519
always protecting yourself.

606
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,320
You can endure extreme conditions,

607
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,679
but deep down,

608
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:20,719
you need someone to take care of you.

609
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,559
Aren't you afraid

610
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
of the spines?

611
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,559
No.

612
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:31,679
Despite the spines,

613
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,440
you're still cute.

614
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,719
When I found that photo,

615
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:23,679
I took a picture of it,

616
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,119
hoping to find Tarn's first love.

617
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,719
Tarn often told me about his first love,

618
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:35,960
but he never said who it was.

619
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,440
Tarn probably didn't want to trouble you.

620
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,079
It made Tarn happy

621
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,559
to see you happy.

622
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,119
What are you doing?

623
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,639
Well, I'm taking a photo as proof.

624
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,880
You promised to love me and only me.

625
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,480
Stop it.

626
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,239
Prib.

627
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,480
Can you take me to Tarn's bedroom?

628
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,719
I used to envy you.

629
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:55,079
But I promise to envy you less.

630
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:57,880
I want you to wake up soon.

631
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,280
I can't bear seeing Nut sad anymore.

632
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:04,679
I'm dying to know

633
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,760
how a teddy bear like me
turned into a human.

634
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,519
Did you say a teddy bear
turned into a human?

635
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,800
Who's talking to me?

636
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,840
Did a teddy bear really turn into a human?

637
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,280
How is that possible?

638
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,519
It's true.

639
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,639
I don't know how it happened.

640
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
I think it has something
to do with Tatarn.

641
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,239
Tarn?

642
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,880
Yes.

643
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,679
But he can't tell me anything right now

644
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:51,760
because he was assaulted.

645
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,960
Do you happen to know

646
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,480
what happened to him?

647
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,320
The incident happened here.

648
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:04,639
Here?

649
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,280
Did you see the attacker?

650
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,880
I didn't see anyone.

651
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,119
But I heard Tatarn

652
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:13,880
arguing with a man.

653
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,760
I'm not going to back down.

654
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,679
I heard a vase shatter.

655
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,440
Then I heard a lot of people
coming inside the house

656
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
before everything fell quiet.

657
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,639
I don't know who they were.

658
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,679
The last person who came
to clean up the scene

659
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,960
missed a spot.

660
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,559
What do you mean?

661
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,239
It's from the vase.

662
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,920
Did the attacker

663
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,039
hit Tatarn in the head with the vase?

664
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,519
I'm not sure.

665
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,760
But I'm certain that the last person

666
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,760
who came inside

667
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,280
was a woman.

668
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:44,039
A woman?

669
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,360
Is anyone inside the house?
Come out this instant.

670
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,519
It's her.

671
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,559
It was her voice.

672
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,760
What did you say?

673
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,360
You…

674
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,840
What are you doing here?

675
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,239
Who gave you permission?

676
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,719
I did.

677
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:08,719
Saen.

678
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,559
Thank you for letting me

679
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,599
bring Tofu here, Uncle Saen.

680
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,719
You are welcome.

681
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,519
Mr. Anik called me.

682
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,400
It's a shame we can't help Tofu.

683
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,079
There's no link between Tofu and Tatarn.

684
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,880
You made up a theory

685
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,880
and came to search someone's house

686
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,000
when the owner's relative
doesn't welcome you.

687
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:35,079
Why don't you want us here?

688
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,039
This house is beautiful.

689
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,960
Are you hiding something from us?

690
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,719
This house is full of expensive artwork.

691
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,760
I'm Tarn's only relative.

692
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,039
With him in the hospital,

693
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:52,159
Saen and I need
to watch this house for him.

694
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:54,960
I will be held responsible
if anything goes missing.

695
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,800
Did you agree to look after it

696
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,519
to offer help

697
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,840
or for something in return?

698
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,280
Nut.

699
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:07,920
Isn't your mom at the hotel?

700
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,960
You should check on her.

701
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:11,239
I'll lock up the house.

702
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,840
We should go

703
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,480
before something goes missing.

704
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,480
Hey.

705
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,199
-Listen to her.
-Stop.

706
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:24,920
Teddy.

707
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,840
The voices I heard that day

708
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,639
belong to these two people.

709
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,920
You must find Tarn's attackers.

710
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,519
How could you let them inside the house?

711
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:05,599
I had no choice.

712
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,880
The officer called to ask for a favor.

713
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,599
I couldn't trigger his suspicion.

714
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,519
Did you see the way
they were looking at us?

715
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:13,920
Do you really think

716
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,400
they came here to get Tofu's memory back?

717
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:41,519
TATARN KLAIANANT

718
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,639
AN ARTIST WHOSE VOICE IS HEARD THROUGH ART

719
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,360
Tarn, the guy Tofu recognized,

720
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,079
is Jan's nephew.

721
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:52,719
My name is Tatarn.

722
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,960
I just came back from Japan.

723
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Tatarn…

724
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:10,920
Mom.

725
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:13,519
Is something wrong?

726
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,079
No.

727
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:26,559
Are you free later?

728
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,079
Where do you want to go?

729
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:32,280
I want to visit him.

730
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:14,599
Who are you here to see?

731
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:15,920
Hello.

732
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,559
I'm here to see Nut.

733
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,559
-Thank you.
-No problem.

734
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:27,880
It's a shame Nut is out of town.

735
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,599
You came here for nothing.

736
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:31,960
It's fine.

737
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,800
I thought you were my student.

738
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:37,000
Are you Nut's friend?

739
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:38,519
Yes.

740
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:40,639
What's your name?

741
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,719
My name is Tatarn.

742
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,159
I've returned from Japan.

743
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,159
I heard Nut moved here.

744
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:51,320
I have something to give him.

745
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,599
Here it is.

746
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:57,880
I drew it myself.

747
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,239
-Really?
-Yes.

748
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,079
Wow, it's adorable.

749
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:14,760
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE BY YOUR SIDE

750
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:18,719
"It's nice to have someone by your side."

751
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,800
Right, honey?

752
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,239
I'll give this to Nut

753
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,400
when he returns.

754
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,719
Thank you so much.

755
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,920
By the way,

756
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:40,159
are you here alone?

757
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:41,960
What are you talking about?

758
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:44,800
I'm here with Nut's father

759
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,599
and Kuenchai.

760
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:55,760
Nut's father?

761
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:03,079
Mom.

762
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,000
Why did you want to see Tarn?

763
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,880
He came to our house.

764
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,159
When?

765
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,920
I don't remember.

766
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,840
But it was after we moved
to the new house.

767
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,880
He brought

768
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:37,119
the book…

769
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,519
Your favorite book.

770
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:44,679
He brought it for you.

771
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,000
Kuenchai.

772
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,280
I've got snacks.

773
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,639
Do you want some?

774
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:54,960
Do you want some? Come.

775
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,039
Show me a jump.

776
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,039
Jump for me.

777
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:00,599
Jump!

778
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:01,679
Jump! Oh, no.

779
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,280
-No.
-Hey.

780
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,199
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

781
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,519
That was a pounce. Oops.

782
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,320
Is this your book?

783
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:35,000
What?

784
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:36,679
It's yours.

785
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,719
This isn't mine.

786
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:42,079
It's yours.

787
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,000
You should put it away.

788
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,599
THE PERSON WHO ALWAYS LOOKS AT YOU

789
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,920
THANK YOU

790
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,960
EVERY DAY WITH YOU

791
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,840
I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN OUR DAYS TOGETHER

792
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,360
THANK YOU

793
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:47,519
Tarn brought me that book.

794
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,039
Why didn't you tell me?

795
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:54,119
You always forget the important stuff.

796
01:05:58,039 --> 01:05:59,159
I've been sick.

797
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:03,239
I don't remember who gave you the book.

798
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,320
You weren't around much back then,
so I forgot.

799
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,119
I'm sorry.

800
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
Nut.

801
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,159
If you leave now,

802
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,119
you'll hurt her feelings.

803
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,639
Don't you think I'm hurt too?

804
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:35,800
I know you're hurt as well.

805
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:52,599
You should know

806
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:54,760
how disappointed,

807
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,880
sad,

808
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,880
and upset I am.

809
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,639
But I'm angrier at my fate than my mom.

810
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:05,119
How would my life be like

811
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:07,039
if she had told me?

812
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,760
Nut would be really happy

813
01:07:12,679 --> 01:07:15,119
to have Tatarn next to him now,

814
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,079
instead of me.

815
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,360
No one knows

816
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,360
whether you would be happy or sad.

817
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,400
You might think

818
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,280
that you guys would be together now.

819
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,039
But don't forget

820
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,039
your mom was sick,
and she was conservative

821
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:32,760
two years ago.

822
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,519
Your relationship with Tarn
would be a secret

823
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,639
unlike your relationship with Tofu now.

824
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,239
Tofu.

825
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,000
Everything requires good timing.

826
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,360
Two years ago,

827
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,039
Tarn's timing was wrong.

828
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,360
That's why they broke up.

829
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,639
On the other hand,

830
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:56,039
you walked into Nut's life
at the perfect time.

831
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:00,599
But Tatarn is back in the picture now.

832
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,400
Is it possible that
this is the right timing

833
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,639
for them to reunite?

834
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,079
Being afraid of the future

835
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,639
is as bad as wanting to fix the past.

836
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:17,199
You should live

837
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:19,399
in the present.

838
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,199
You should use the time to worry
about your loved ones' feelings.

839
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,399
You are confusing Tofu

840
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,199
by expressing countless concerns
toward your ex-boyfriend.

841
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,800
I was looking for you.

842
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:57,479
Me too.

843
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,760
I know

844
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,279
it's hard to accept

845
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:06,520
that you had almost crossed paths with him

846
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,880
and could have gotten back together,

847
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:14,039
but your sick mom took away the chance.

848
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,239
I don't mind the situation.

849
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,119
I'm just regretful.

850
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,520
If I had met him back then,

851
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:25,640
I could have apologized.

852
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:28,279
But now,

853
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,279
I might not get a chance to apologize.

854
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,279
He might not wake up

855
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,319
to watch the series I produced.

856
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,640
I'm sure he's going to wake up.

857
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,560
You worked really hard on it.

858
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,640
Who knows,

859
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,840
a miracle might happen.

860
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,119
Give me a hug.

861
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,199
Are you hungry?

862
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:12,600
My stomach didn't growl.

863
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:14,239
It wasn't mine.

864
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,319
It was mine.

865
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:21,960
-You.
-Hey.

866
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:24,840
Your stomach growled really loud.
Why don't you eat something?

867
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,239
Wait.

868
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,560
Didn't we just eat?

869
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,479
It took a lot of energy to get them

870
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,239
to make up.

871
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,800
Shall we go eat?

872
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,640
-Yes.
-Let's go.

873
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,000
Let me get my mom.

874
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,039
This meal is on Nut then.

875
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:51,159
He made up with his boyfriend after all.

876
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:53,479
-Yes!
-Yes!

877
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,960
Yes!

878
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,000
-Let's go, Tofu.
-All right.

879
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,840
We're getting a free meal. Let's go.

880
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:01,520
Come on.

881
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,760
Mom.

882
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,479
Mom.

883
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,119
Let's grab some food.

884
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:18,279
Mrs. Na.

885
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:23,119
Mom.

886
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,760
Mom.

887
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:29,479
Let's eat.

888
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,520
Mrs. Na.

889
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,760
Mom.

890
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,319
Mrs. Na.

891
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,560
Mom.

892
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,119
Mom.

893
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,720
Nut.

894
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:23,079
-Gen, have you seen my mom?
-What?

895
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,840
-Your mom?
-She's missing.

896
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,039
Nut.

897
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:31,880
Nut.

898
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:34,000
-I'll check the front.
-Okay.

899
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:34,960
See you.

900
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:36,199
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

901
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:38,039
Have you seen the guest from Room 202?

902
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:39,640
She's tall and thin.

903
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,880
Around 50 years old.

904
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,640
She's wearing a blue shirt
with grey pants.

905
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,199
Yes, she left the hotel
about half an hour ago.

906
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,840
Can we help you with anything?

907
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,840
Can you check the security footage?

908
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,880
Of course.

909
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:06,119
How did it go?

910
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:07,960
She walked out by herself

911
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:09,439
without her wallet or phone.

912
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,079
Where did she go?

913
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:16,159
Maybe she's taking a walk.

914
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,079
Is she that mad at me?

915
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,680
Maybe she wants to be alone
to think things over.

916
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,359
Calm down.

917
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,640
How about we look for her?

918
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,680
I told the hotel to call us

919
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,279
if she comes back.

920
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:32,560
She just left.

921
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,079
She couldn't have gone far.

922
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,960
We should look for her in the city.

923
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:38,880
Let's go.

924
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,199
Come on.

925
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:41,119
Come, Tofu.

926
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,520
Excuse me.

927
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:12,439
Have you seen this woman?

928
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,159
Yes, I saw her near the river.

929
01:16:17,479 --> 01:16:18,399
Thank you.

930
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:19,319
Let's go, Tofu.

931
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:48,359
-Mom.
-Mrs. Na.

932
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,880
I'm sorry.

933
01:16:57,439 --> 01:16:58,439
Let's keep going.

934
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,399
Excuse me.

935
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:33,560
I…

936
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:35,039
How can I help you?

937
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:38,439
I want to go to…

938
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:41,319
Where are you going?

939
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,720
Are you here alone?

940
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,079
Why don't you call a relative
to pick you up?

941
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,439
I didn't bring my phone.

942
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,720
In that case,

943
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,520
shall I take you home?

944
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,920
Where do you live?

945
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,359
Someone brought her here
after finding her near the river.

946
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,760
She said she's here
with her son named Nut and Tofu.

947
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:18,880
I thought of you.

948
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,279
I totally forgot about you.

949
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:24,520
Unbelievable.

950
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,760
You didn't think of your father
who's a cop.

951
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,439
I didn't know

952
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,439
he was your father.

953
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,319
It's such a small world.

954
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:35,920
Mom.

955
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:37,960
How did you end up there?

956
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,720
Nut.

957
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,439
Why don't we talk at the hotel?

958
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,560
Nut.

959
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,319
Can we talk?

960
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:21,920
Your mom said

961
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,159
she suddenly lost her memory

962
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,239
while taking a walk.

963
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:29,960
She forgot where she was,
so she kept walking.

964
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:34,880
The person who found her
also said she seemed strange.

965
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,239
She sounded confused.

966
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:38,720
She couldn't answer her.

967
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:41,960
I think something is wrong with her.

968
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,359
You should talk to your mom
to see what the problem is.

969
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,439
I will, sir.

970
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:53,920
Thank you so much.

971
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,920
The reason you left…

972
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:08,319
you weren't mad, right?

973
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:12,880
Was there another reason?

974
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,560
How long has this been happening?

975
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,239
I don't know.

976
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,359
I feel strange.

977
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,159
I…

978
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:25,439
I'm getting very forgetful, Nut.

979
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,479
I forget…

980
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:36,279
what I'm going to do.

981
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,359
I forget

982
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:43,840
what I've done.

983
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,840
I forget days.

984
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,279
I forget people's names.

985
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,920
Sometimes, I forget

986
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,760
what I want to say.

987
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,279
I went to see the doctor.

988
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,640
Dr. Kanya examined me.

989
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:27,399
She said…

990
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,119
I'm showing symptoms of…

991
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,079
Alzheimer's.

992
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,359
I'm sorry, Nut.

993
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,680
It's okay, Mom.

994
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:04,600
The truth is she has been
showing signs for a while.

995
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:08,640
I didn't think much of them.

996
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,800
These three, please.

997
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,600
Didn't I just buy some last week?

998
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:18,359
Why have we run out?

999
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,479
Your mom has been feeding Kuenchai
a lot more often.

1000
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,680
Some days she feeds him several times.

1001
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:31,760
I'm a horrible son.

1002
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,279
You've been working hard.

1003
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:51,880
You've got a lot on your mind.

1004
01:24:54,359 --> 01:24:55,560
On the other hand,

1005
01:24:57,479 --> 01:24:59,119
it's my job to take care of her.

1006
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,239
I've been with her the whole time.

1007
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,560
I saw her abnormalities.

1008
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,920
Did I already feed you?

1009
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,760
Kuenchai, come and eat.

1010
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:26,760
You already gave him his food.

1011
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,279
Did I?

1012
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:40,760
Are you looking for something?

1013
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,680
I'm looking for the fruit knife.

1014
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,439
I don't know where I put it.

1015
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,119
I didn't suspect a thing.

1016
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,399
I'm sorry, Nut.

1017
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:11,920
Why is this happening?

1018
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,640
Everything was getting better.

1019
01:26:19,159 --> 01:26:21,039
Our family was about to be happy.

1020
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,119
Don't I deserve

1021
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,479
to be happy?

1022
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:43,840
Don't blame yourself.

1023
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:48,119
No one is to blame here.

1024
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,640
Since your mom is already sick,

1025
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,960
why don't we find a way to help her?

1026
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:06,760
This disease

1027
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,279
can't be cured.

1028
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,880
Soon…

1029
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:15,720
she will forget you,

1030
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,159
me,

1031
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,079
and even herself.

1032
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,840
Let's come up with a way

1033
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:47,159
to take care of her

1034
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:52,079
before she forgets everything.

1035
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,720
Who do you suspect?

1036
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,079
Tofu.

1037
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:15,560
He could have been in the house that day
and saw the whole thing.

1038
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,600
If you don't want
a twisted, tormented life like mine,

1039
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:21,920
you'll have to live mindfully.

1040
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:25,279
Correct your mistakes while you still can.

1041
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,439
One person lost his memory.

1042
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,000
Another person is losing hers.

1043
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,159
Who knows?

1044
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,000
I might remember something soon.

1045
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,279
You've been doing a great job.

1046
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:46,560
Don't blame yourself.

1047
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,600
You did great.

1048
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:50,960
