1
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,375
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,500
My name is Kobori.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:41,208
I came to Thailand in 1941

4
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:47,000
at the beginning of World War II
as a dockyard engineer,

5
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,083
to send supplies and support to Burma.

6
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,541
At the time, Japanese-Thai Army relations

7
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,708
were filled with a great suspicion

8
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,208
because we first wanted
only to pass through Thailand.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,666
The given order was that

10
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,000
if Thailand resisted, we would occupy.

11
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,000
But when Thailand yielded,

12
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,958
then the Japanese Army headquarters
in Thailand

13
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,541
would have to protect Thailand instead.

14
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:23,500
My duties included commanding the Japanese
Army to be able to stay with Thais.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,583
This was a very delicate issue.

16
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,583
When the war started, there were

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,791
many misunderstandings
between the Japanese and Thai armies.

18
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,458
I didn't know whether an attempt
to fix a broken glass

19
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,375
would be a worthless attempt.

20
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,333
Hey!

21
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,583
Miss. What are you looking at?

22
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,583
Can you speak English?

23
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,875
No.

24
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,083
I see. You cannot speak English.

25
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:09,916
"No."

26
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,250
Miss!

27
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,583
Miss!

28
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,500
Miss! Can you go home?

29
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,458
Already grown up. Can go home myself.

30
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,250
Goodbye.

31
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,958
Playmate? Am I your playmate?

32
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,375
Playmate?

33
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,625
Playmate.

34
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Goodbye, playmate.

35
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,750
Hey!

36
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,041
Hey!

37
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,041
Hello, playmate.

38
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,708
Miss!

39
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,875
Hello, playmate.

40
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,708
Playmate.

41
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,083
Ang, who is he?

42
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Do you know him?

43
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,750
Don't know, Mom.

44
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,750
I saw him calling you "playmate."

45
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,458
Who is he?

46
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,125
I can't say, Mom.

47
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,458
I want to investigate.

48
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,125
Investigate what?

49
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,958
How to get to the route of the rear dock?

50
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,000
Just walk.

51
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,375
Walk how?

52
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,833
Just walk as you normally walk.

53
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,083
Roger.

54
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,458
Please, stop!

55
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,416
Get out! Stop!

56
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,208
Get out now!

57
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,250
Please, stop!

58
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,833
Don't do it. Ang, don't do it.

59
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,166
Enough.

60
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,416
Stop it!

61
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,333
Gather!

62
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm sorry for this situation.

63
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,750
You think you Japanese soldiers
can do anything?

64
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,083
Speak slowly. I'm not good at Thai.

65
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,416
All problems were caused by my men.

66
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,791
I'll take responsibility.

67
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,333
How?

68
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,583
Enough! Enough!

69
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,458
Enough!

70
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,541
Apologize to her!

71
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,791
Yes, sir!

72
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,083
Straight!

73
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,000
We are very sorry!

74
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:38,541
We are very sorry!

75
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,458
We are very sorry!

76
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,041
We are very sorry!

77
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,375
We are very sorry!

78
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,833
We are very sorry!

79
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,083
Back to the base!

80
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,583
-Yes, sir!
-Go!

81
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,333
Just an apology?

82
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,583
I guarantee I'll "tri" my best to be fair.

83
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,541
It's pronounced "try".

84
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,708
Try.

85
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,333
Well...

86
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,083
I want some anti-malaria drugs.

87
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know what you're saying.

88
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,666
What do you want? Where does it hurt?

89
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,500
Mr. Engineer! Mr. Engineer!

90
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
Mr. Engineer! Mr. Engineer!

91
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,500
Could you please speak to the doctor?

92
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,791
Because I want

93
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
some anti-malaria drugs.

94
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:57,375
I've just gone to the health center
and was told it had run out.

95
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,916
But someone said
it's still available here.

96
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,875
I talked to the doctor,

97
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,083
but we couldn't understand each other.

98
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,041
So I would like your help, please.

99
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,958
I will double-check.
Are there many people who want the drug?

100
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,708
There are quite a few.

101
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,750
Excuse me!

102
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,958
Is anyone there?

103
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,125
Hello!

104
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,833
Is that the one?

105
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,208
She is cute.

106
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
Why are you here?

107
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,708
Hello.

108
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,791
We've heard that your grandma is unwell.

109
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
May I help?

110
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,625
No need to help. Won't be off the boil.

111
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,500
But now the vaccine is in short supply.

112
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,708
And it's needed by your grandma.

113
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,750
Who's that, honey?

114
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
Take nutritious food with the medicine,

115
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,833
such as milk or butter.

116
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,958
I can't understand Japanese well.

117
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,625
Oh, I see, sorry.

118
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,583
I can be your interpreter.

119
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,625
Hey,

120
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,583
I'll talk to her!

121
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,250
Nutritious food with the medicine,

122
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,791
such as milk or butter.

123
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,833
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,625
Take the drug
and nutritious food, milk, butter.

125
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,166
During the war,
it's difficult to find milk.

126
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,625
I can get it for you.

127
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,750
No, I don't want to trouble you.
We will get it ourselves.

128
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,875
Trouble? No. I'll get hold of it.

129
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,958
Hey, Azuma!

130
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,583
Milk and butter, okay?

131
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,250
Milk, milk!

132
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
Milk!

133
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,041
This is milk. Nutrition for Grandma.

134
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,500
I also brought some other necessary items.

135
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,166
Many thanks, young man. I'm about to cook.
Stay and eat with us.

136
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:19,166
Ang, tell him to have dinner with us.

137
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,291
My mother told me that

138
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,875
You should go home
because it gets dark soon.

139
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,541
What?

140
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,791
I just heard the word "dinner."
How come you translated it differently?

141
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:41,250
Mom, he's leaving now.
No need to cook for him.

142
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,583
Are you leaving?

143
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,791
Fine.

144
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,583
I'll take you there on my boat.

145
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,416
Don't worry.
I can walk through my home to the dock.

146
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,750
I'll take the boat there.

147
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,666
No worries. I don't want to trouble you.

148
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,416
I said I'll take the boat there.

149
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't worry.

150
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,291
Goodbye, Playmate.

151
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Fucking Jap!

152
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,625
Enough! Pol, Bua.

153
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,083
Enough. Please, stop.

154
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,708
I'll take you back on my boat.

155
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,708
How are you doing?

156
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,333
I'm lucky but I only have a little luck.

157
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,708
What's a little luck?

158
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,208
It's...

159
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,083
You knew that someone wanted me dead.

160
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,333
What about being lucky?

161
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,041
You don't want me dead.

162
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Where are you going?

163
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,041
Going to the dock.

164
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,666
Not hurting?

165
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,041
It's all right.

166
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,291
Teriyaki, teriyaki.

167
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,541
Hello, Mother.

168
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,541
Good afternoon.

169
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,541
Angsumalin is not here.

170
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
How are you doing?
Have you already recovered?

171
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,791
Much better now.

172
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,791
Today, we intend to cook

173
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,208
to pay you back for your help.

174
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,708
But it's not convenient at the dock.
Would you allow me to cook here?

175
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,916
What do you want to cook?

176
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,958
-Teriyaki.
-Teriyaki.

177
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,875
Teriyaki?

178
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,125
Mom, what are they doing?

179
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,041
They're cooking for us.

180
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,333
Allow me to borrow your kitchen.
We're cooking for you.

181
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,208
Young man, what's your name?

182
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,291
My name is Kobori.

183
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,083
Difficult to pronounce.

184
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,333
Let me call you Mali instead.

185
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
What does "Mali" mean?

186
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,916
Mali is the name of a flower.

187
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,541
What does "Angsumali" mean?

188
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,125
Mom.

189
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,750
It's Angsumalin.
Angsumalin means "the sun."

190
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,250
The sun?

191
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,458
What's the sun?

192
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,875
Ang, tell him.

193
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,583
I won't say.

194
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,875
Over there, the sun.

195
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh, sun or sunset?

196
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,833
I don't know. It's your language.

197
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,333
Enough, Mom.

198
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,583
You are Hideko, right?

199
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,250
Can I call you Hideko?

200
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,666
Hurry up and cook teriyaki. Get it done.

201
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,708
Hideko-san is hungry?
I will quickly cook it.

202
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,125
What is that noise?

203
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,333
What, Mom?

204
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,500
What is that noise?

205
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,041
Azuma!

206
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,125
An air raid. Please go back to the dock.

207
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,166
Understood.

208
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,666
We need to return to the dock.

209
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,708
-Hori.
-Thank you

210
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,750
Excuse us. Let's go.

211
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,666
Where're we going?

212
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,958
To the orchard, quick.

213
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,833
Quick, quick.

214
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,458
Wait here. Come sit here.

215
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:24,625
Quick.

216
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,541
Sit down. Sit down.

217
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:32,208
Sit down here. If there's any bombs,
duck down low. Understand?

218
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,166
Be strong.

219
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,000
I have to go back to the dock.

220
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,250
Don't go.

221
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,666
Hideko, you must be strong.

222
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,333
It's all right. Don't be scared.

223
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,958
Hideko, you have to stay strong.

224
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,708
Extinguish a fire!

225
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,791
Bring the carrier!

226
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,416
Brace yourselves!

227
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,916
How are you doing?

228
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,541
Is anyone here?

229
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,833
Good evening, how are you?

230
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:25,500
It's all right now. We're safe and sound.

231
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,333
What about you?
How are things at the dock?

232
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,708
Several boats got damaged.
Many people were injured.

233
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,583
I'm sorry.
In the end, we couldn't have teriyaki.

234
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,416
It's okay. Ang boiled it.
It was delicious.

235
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:42,958
I see.

236
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,541
Hideko.

237
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:51,625
Do you want to visit Japan after the war?

238
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,291
You could have authentic Japanese food.

239
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,750
I will not go there.

240
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,083
Why?

241
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,333
I'm waiting for someone here.

242
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,875
Has he joined the war?

243
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,625
Yes.

244
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:46,958
I'm sorry.

245
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:51,000
I hope you two will meet up after the war.

246
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,625
Go!

247
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,083
Go, hurry up!

248
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,208
What's happening?

249
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,500
A prisoner escaped last night.

250
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,291
People say he's hiding in this area.

251
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,666
We need to search every house.

252
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,791
Oh, no. He's not here.

253
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,041
Allow me.

254
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,583
What is it?

255
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,500
We need to search the house.
The escaped prisoner's around here.

256
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,708
You're saying I'm hiding the prisoner?

257
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,125
I'm sorry. I have to search.

258
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,166
Search upstairs!

259
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,333
Yes, sir!

260
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,541
Mr. Tobori.

261
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,500
Please come with us.

262
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,916
Need to search my room?

263
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,291
If you allow it.

264
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,000
If you dare, go ahead.

265
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,208
Allow me.

266
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,750
Why did you allow Japanese soldiers
to search my house?

267
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,458
It's the superior's order.

268
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,166
One prisoner, dead or alive,

269
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,958
the Japanese Army

270
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:41,833
will neither lose nor win.

271
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:54,791
For you...

272
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,416
I seem worthless.

273
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,708
My life is worth less than his, isn't it?

274
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,416
They dropped the bombs here.

275
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:14,166
Don't trade your family's lives
just to save his.

276
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,583
It's not that.

277
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:38,958
Is she coming?

278
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,833
Gather!

279
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
We move forward!

280
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes, sir.

281
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,000
You can get out now.

282
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,458
I got you into trouble.

283
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,833
I'm sure that Japanese man saw me.

284
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
What do you think he'll do?

285
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,458
Don't worry.
We'll take you to another place.

286
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,708
Why didn't they arrest me?

287
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,416
He loves you, right?

288
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,625
Follow me.

289
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,541
Ang, this way.

290
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,750
What are you doing here?

291
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,291
This is my home.

292
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,125
Wherever and whenever I go,
it's my own business.

293
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,958
I don't understand.

294
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,291
I came here

295
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:18,041
because I want to build a friendship
with everyone.

296
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,000
But why do you hate a friendship?

297
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,250
You are heartless.

298
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,416
I'm not.

299
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,583
No way!

300
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,875
A heart is not cold like this.

301
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,125
As a heart is tender than this.

302
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:40,833
That's enough.

303
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,791
Run! Quick!

304
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,500
Good.

305
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,125
Next!

306
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,708
You're all right. Don't worry.

307
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,958
You still have two arms and two legs.

308
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,458
Doctor. Thank you so much.

309
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:14,666
By tomorrow?

310
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:17,916
Your body is fine.

311
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:22,375
You feel quite distressed about Kogori.

312
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,125
People say...

313
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,041
You two are playing around
behind their back.

314
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,208
To go out with a Thai woman,
that is the worst thing.

315
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:39,791
What?

316
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,000
What do you mean?

317
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,416
Right. Get well soon!

318
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,291
Here is a letter from home.

319
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,125
The villagers are gossiping

320
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:03,583
about Kobori and Angsumalin
having a secret affair in the orchard.

321
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,166
No! No way.

322
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:24,583
I need to report this to your commander.

323
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,125
March forward!

324
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,708
To regain friendly relations
between our Imperial Army and Thailand,

325
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:44,833
we must have a wedding
ceremony to unite Japan and Thailand.

326
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,291
Yes, sir. I couldn't agree more.

327
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:16,750
Hello, Father.

328
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,000
Hello.

329
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:22,500
Haven't seen you for ages. I heard you got
into an accident. How are you feeling?

330
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:23,958
I'm okay now.

331
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,625
It's nice that you came,
so we could finally talk.

332
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,833
I also have something to discuss with you.
Or why else would I have come here?

333
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,708
If you're hot-tempered like this,

334
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,041
I think it's better we not talk.

335
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:54,833
Yesterday, headquarters called me
to a meeting with a Japanese commander.

336
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,750
So, I went.
Didn't think it would be a personal issue.

337
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:02,583
Upon arriving, I met a cultural ambassador
and journalists.

338
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:06,333
After a brief talk, they asked
for permission to marry our daughter.

339
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:09,708
My superior explained that it's a matter
of international affairs.

340
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,875
What does it mean?

341
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,583
And what did you reply?

342
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,666
I'm afraid to make a decision.

343
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,125
I'll talk to our daughter, then.

344
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,708
I'm sorry

345
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,416
for causing this to escalate.

346
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,333
Then, what?

347
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,083
What are you sorry for?

349
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,625
The grand relations between
Thailand and Japan

350
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,833
will grow even closer.

351
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:19,166
I'm not interested
in the relationship between the nations.

352
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,041
But I want to know...

353
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,083
what you think.

354
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,291
I hate you.

355
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,333
I hate you. Are you happy?

356
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,208
Even though I'll marry you,

357
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,750
I'll hate you.

358
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,208
Hideko.

359
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,458
Hoy no yossa
Hoy no hoy

360
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,541
When you sleep with an only child girl

361
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:15,541
You need to ask her parents first

362
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,833
Hoy no yossa
Hoy no hoy

363
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:23,083
When you sleep with a girl
with another sister

364
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,000
You need to sleep with
her old sister first

365
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:30,791
Hoy no yossa
Hoy no hoy

366
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,208
When you sleep with a girl
in someone's house

367
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:39,041
You mustn't make any noise

368
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,500
Don't enter. You can't enter.

369
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:57,750
-Can you speak Thai?
-Yes, I can.

370
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,916
First, you have to give us an envelope.

371
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,833
Envelope?

372
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,791
An envelope with money.
Then you can enter.

373
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,208
Hello.

374
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,916
Yes.

375
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,750
Hey, smile!

376
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,041
Pol, Bua.

377
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,291
What're you doing here?

378
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,458
I'm waiting for you.

379
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,541
If you've come to meet someone,
he's already left.

380
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,625
What do you mean?

381
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,875
Oh, Hideko.

382
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,208
I'm probably a fool to you again, right?

383
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:20,458
You probably don't hate me
because you're Thai.

384
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:24,625
But you hate me

385
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,166
because you're Rengokoku.

386
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,000
What's Rengokoku?

387
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,541
It's the Allies.

388
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,500
You shouldn't have worked today.

389
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:42,375
Today is our engagement day, Hideko.

390
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:44,833
Why?

391
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,041
You really made me sad, you know?

392
00:45:57,958 --> 00:46:00,750
But never mind. You've succeeded.

393
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,208
Apart from me, nobody knows.

394
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:12,041
The war is changing every day, Hideko.

395
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,041
Perhaps, I might not return.

396
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:20,458
The wedding might not happen.

397
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,333
That would be nice.

398
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,833
I knew you would say that.

399
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,916
If I died,

400
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,916
you would be very happy, wouldn't you?

401
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,166
Yes, I will wait for it.

402
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,666
I'm not afraid of dying.

403
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:46,916
Perhaps,

404
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,708
death might be the last thing
that makes me happy.

405
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,250
Good.

406
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:26,416
Take on your responsibility
as a soldier and as a man.

407
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:32,208
What you've done is exactly the same
as what our Imperial Army has done.

408
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,250
We must keep maintaining
friendly relations with Thailand.

409
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:44,083
Well, what a great joy your marriage is!

410
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,375
Right.

411
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,500
You can go home now.

412
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,041
Yes, sir!

413
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,791
"Attention now!

414
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:21,125
Message number one!
Our Imperial Army will reach Yangon soon.

415
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,000
Thanks to our troop's accomplishment
of their duty,

416
00:48:24,416 --> 00:48:26,541
our commander will be very satisfied.

417
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:29,125
Message number two!

418
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,333
Be proud of being in our Imperial Army

419
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:34,625
and continue performing your duty! Over!"

420
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:39,875
I'm sorry about the wedding.
I couldn't decline.

421
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:43,583
The Japanese might aim to hit me
with this issue.

422
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,333
Let it be.

423
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:50,000
They could force us only into the wedding.

424
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:54,875
The Japanese soldiers probably don't
understand the importance of love.

425
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:59,125
Love is equally important for everyone.

426
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,166
When I didn't known love,
I had opportunities.

427
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,625
Since I have known what love is,
I haven't had the opportunities.

428
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:26,375
Azuma! Go ahead without me!

429
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,416
Go!

430
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:30,166
Right.

431
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:38,791
Hideko!

432
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,750
Why're you standing here?

433
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,375
Why must you be here

434
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,333
when I need someone?

435
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,541
Why?

436
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,000
Why're you here?

437
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,125
And why must you be here now too?

438
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:04,500
We need to get away from the bridge now.

439
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,166
Let's go.

440
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,041
Come!

441
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,583
Leave me alone.

442
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,041
Hideko!

443
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,166
Hideko!

444
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,000
We need to get away from the bridge now.

445
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:29,666
Let me go.

446
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,333
Stay away from my life.

447
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:39,666
Go away!

448
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,916
We need to get away from the bridge now!

449
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:56,625
Go away!

450
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:28,750
Hideko, no! I'm not leaving you.

451
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,458
Vanguard...

452
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,625
Port, arms.

453
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,291
Present arms!

454
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:34,875
Order arms!

455
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,916
I can't return to the dock tonight.

456
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,583
If I do, others will know.

457
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,458
Please allow me to sleep here.

458
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,666
You can just place a blanket
wherever you want me to sleep.

459
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:04,541
Any corner is fine.

460
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,583
I'll wait outside.
So you can change clothes.

461
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:17,166
Hideko, you can trust me.

462
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,000
What's going on?

463
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:33,125
Ang, I need you to ask the Engineer.

464
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,791
I already told you to stay away from them.

465
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,375
You'll get into trouble.

466
00:59:44,416 --> 00:59:45,875
Do you have any idea?

467
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,708
Germany is my ally,

468
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:51,166
but it's your enemy.

469
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,333
If you got arrested, you and your family,

470
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,708
and the villagers here
would all be in trouble.

471
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,708
I'll help you.

472
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,833
But you have to promise me

473
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,625
that you won't get involved
with those two guys again.

474
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:16,458
-What are you searching for?
-Calm down!

475
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:19,750
-What did the fucking Jap come here for?
-To inspect.

476
01:00:22,875 --> 01:00:23,708
What's wrong?

477
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,833
Mr. Kobori, we'll search around here.

478
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,583
We received information
from the German army,

479
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:32,458
a secret agent is hiding here.

480
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:36,958
No. Not in my house or around here.

481
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,000
I'm certain that it was here.

482
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,041
Hideko.

483
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,708
Hideko.

484
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,791
Your consideration...

485
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,666
I appreciate it...

486
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,166
Cheers!

487
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:43,208
Cheers!

488
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,666
Be quiet!

489
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:48,791
Yeah.

490
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:57,416
Hideko!

491
01:01:58,625 --> 01:01:59,666
Do you know?

492
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,458
I've just betrayed my honor.

493
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,291
Betrayed the honor of my nation.

494
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:13,458
Just for you.

495
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:45,125
Hideko.

496
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:52,666
You're so drunk tonight. Sleep!

497
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:55,416
Hideko.

498
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:59,916
Why haven't you ever spoken nicely
to make me happy even once?

499
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:56,666
Let go.

500
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:57,750
Hideko.

501
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:01,041
I'm sorry.

502
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,458
You should leave this house.

503
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:17,041
I'll do you whatever you want me to do
to soothe your anger.

504
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,208
No need.

505
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,708
I pity myself.

506
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,375
Please move somewhere else.

507
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:32,458
-I beg you.
-Hideko.

508
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,416
Hey, Kobori.

509
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:08,250
Hey.

510
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,000
What's up?

511
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,833
Aren't you going home today?

512
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:26,333
I've got it!
You've had a fight with her or something!

513
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:31,041
Well...

514
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,708
Have you done something stupid
to make her angry?

515
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,416
Wake up!

516
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,375
The air raid siren!

517
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,125
Turn it off!

518
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,708
Turn off the light!

519
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,750
Turn off the light!

520
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,250
Air raid!

521
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,583
Ang!

522
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:29,250
Help Grandma downstairs, quick.

523
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,250
Have we forgotten anything?

524
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:32,375
No, let's go. Quick.

525
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,750
Hurry! Hurry up!

526
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:50,458
Hurry up!

527
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,583
Tobori! Where are you going?

528
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,500
I must go home.

529
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:44,416
Hideko.

530
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:46,041
Why are you still here?

531
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,041
I forgot to turn off the lights.

532
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,458
What about Mom and Grandma?

533
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,333
Already gone to the bunker.

534
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,458
Let's go to the bunker.

535
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,833
Let's go.

536
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:44,500
If possible,

537
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,541
I want to freeze this moment forever.

538
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,250
If you could keep the promise,

539
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,958
I would also give you a promise.

540
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,625
Hideko, I don't want anything in return.

541
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,666
But I'll give you one.

542
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:08,458
While you're here, I'll be good to you.

543
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,333
I know you're waiting for him
to come back.

544
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:18,791
And it won't be long.

545
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:24,500
But if it's your wish, I am pleased.

546
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,750
Even though the happy time is short,

547
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,666
I'll embrace it.

548
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:37,083
Today's memories will comfort me.

549
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:45,083
One day I will explain to you why.

550
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,208
No worries, Hideko.

551
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:53,166
Any explanation will hurt us even more.

552
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,250
You have your own reason.

553
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:03,291
I have my own heart and that's enough.

554
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,416
You have your own reason.

555
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,333
I have my own heart and that's enough.

556
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,750
If I die,

557
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,625
I'll take my loving heart with me.

558
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:26,875
When that day comes,

559
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,041
I will still be loving you.

560
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,458
Hideko.

561
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,833
Hideko.

562
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:01,291
Please say this.

563
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:07,500
I love you.

564
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:03,125
Hey, Kobori.

565
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,375
Head to army headquarters
to interpret urgently!

566
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,791
This is an order!

567
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:13,166
Understood, sir!

568
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,791
The traitors who parachuted
into Chainat province

569
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,708
were arrested and transported
to the capital city this morning.

570
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:52,791
"A foreign traitor

571
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,916
was arrested and transported
to the capital city this morning.

572
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,208
Thai police..."

573
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:03,333
The police are handing the traitors
over to the Japanese Army

574
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:06,583
for investigation as Japan had requested
of the Thai government.

575
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,041
Excuse us.

576
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,791
Why are you home so early?

577
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,583
I came to change clothes.

578
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:33,958
Don't worry about Pol and Bua.
They just came to visit us.

579
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,250
You'll be in trouble, Hideko.

580
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:41,083
It is best that they go home right now.

581
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:44,875
If the police see, you'll be
investigated and have problems.

582
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:46,583
Did the army want them arrested?

583
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:47,875
No.

584
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:51,250
But I don't want you to be involved
with them.

585
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,291
Perhaps, they were involved
in bombing the dock.

586
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,416
They wouldn't have done that.

587
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:58,750
How do you know?

588
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:06,541
Yesterday, the police arrested
three underground parachuted men.

589
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:08,791
What did you say?

590
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,125
We arrested three underground
parachuted men.

591
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:15,041
Two of them died.

592
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,000
Do you know where they came from?

593
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,208
I don't know.

594
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:23,583
You know, but you don't want to tell me.

595
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,083
Please, did they come from England?

596
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:29,875
England?

597
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:34,041
I've just learned that from you.

598
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:37,541
I don't know yet.

599
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,250
I'll have to be an interpreter
at the headquarters.

600
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,625
Would you please ask
if there is a man named Vanus?

601
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,416
Vanus?

602
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,958
So that means he'll come back.

603
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,375
You're waiting for him, aren't you?

604
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:10,375
I only want to know
if there's a man named Vanus.

605
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,291
I told you I don't know.

606
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:13,958
Could you ask about it?

607
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:16,791
Why? Is that something I should do?

608
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,041
Don't worry. I am safe.
Vanus

609
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:35,541
You can forget about what I begged you
to ask this afternoon.

610
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:42,625
You already know, don't you?

611
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,208
What do I know?

612
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:48,041
That one of the three
underground men is Vanus.

613
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,750
The Thai police asked us
to interrogate him today.

614
01:25:03,416 --> 01:25:04,750
You don't have to tell me.

615
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,958
I don't want to know your secret.

616
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:12,208
I don't need to tell you anyways, Hideko.

617
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:14,166
Because you had been informed.

618
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,041
You sneaked around and read my letter.

619
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,125
I didn't. Where did you leave it?

620
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,500
I always thought you were a gentleman.

621
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:34,666
But I was wrong.

622
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,958
The promise I made you,

623
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:40,583
I want to take it back.

624
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:44,666
Hideko.

625
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:48,000
-I can't explain this to you.
-Get out!

626
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:51,500
-Hideko, listen to me.
-Get out of my life now!

627
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,083
What's your name?

628
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:10,500
My name is Vanus.

629
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:12,875
My name is Vanus.

630
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:15,541
How come,

631
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,125
after the war had begun,

632
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:18,666
you didn't come back?

633
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:22,083
Why didn't you return
once the war had begun?

634
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:25,041
The routes were cut off.

635
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,791
Because I had no way to get back.

636
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:31,666
You, from where did you board the plane?

637
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:35,208
Where did you board the plane
before coming here?

638
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:36,791
I don't know what the place is called.

639
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:41,041
I don't really know where it was.

640
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,708
What is your objective in coming back?

641
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,333
Your objective...

642
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,875
What is it?

643
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,625
I came to see my lover.

644
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:58,875
For a person I love.

645
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,708
Who is that person you love?

646
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:10,375
Your lover.

647
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,833
Who is she?

648
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,416
In any words

649
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:21,833
I can't describe

650
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:26,708
how I feel now

651
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:31,750
That is, you

652
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:37,500
You'd understand

653
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:46,916
My heart
The voice of your heart

654
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,833
Please let me listen

655
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:59,625
No, I cannot

656
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:04,083
Even to listen to 

657
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:08,125
the voice of my heart

658
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:12,166
is not allowed

659
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:17,125
for me, right?

660
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,583
It's me.

661
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,708
Not the man you're waiting for.

662
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:39,750
I'm going to sleep at the dock. Just came
by for a shower and a change of clothes.

663
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:43,291
Not any longer.

664
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:46,791
You'll meet the person you love.

665
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:55,125
How was he?

666
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,375
I was just an interpreter.

667
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:08,708
My job was to translate
what the underground said.

668
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:12,583
And translate the questions from my side.

669
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,291
Could you help him?

670
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,625
I'm just a soldier.

671
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,791
I only take orders from my commanders.

672
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:29,000
I beg you.

673
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,500
Would you please help Vanus?

674
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,958
Why do I have to help him?

675
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,416
I can't tell you.

676
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,541
You must give me a reason first.

677
01:30:02,416 --> 01:30:05,041
Now your heart wants a reason, doesn't it?

678
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:08,958
Hideko.

679
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,833
-It's not--
-That's enough.

680
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,666
You used to tell me

681
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,208
that I have my own reasons.

682
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,041
You only have your heart. And it's enough.

683
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:30,416
You don't understand, Hideko.

684
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:34,166
I'm just a soldier. Just an interpreter.

685
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:35,708
There's nothing I can do.

686
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,375
I can't help you.

687
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,083
I can't explain it to you.

688
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,416
You know I am Japanese.

689
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:21,916
Hideko!

690
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:34,416
Stay still.

691
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:50,791
-How is she?
-She is fine.

692
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,208
Doctor Soma said Hideko is safe.

693
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,916
But she shouldn't move.

694
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:57,916
But she shouldn't move.

695
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:02,666
Because it's not good for her baby inside.

696
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,583
A baby?

697
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:05,666
Yes, that's right.

698
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:07,750
The baby?

699
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,541
Yes, it is.

700
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:13,291
She shouldn't move
because it could harm the baby inside.

701
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,750
The baby, congratulations!

702
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:32,125
Don't move for now.
You're going to have a baby.

703
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:04,708
The person she has been
waiting for is not me.

704
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:16,291
My time as promised is running out,
isn't it?

705
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:22,750
I'll have to leave. Now I'm working hard,

706
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,958
so everything is complete
before going to Burma.

707
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:31,958
Perhaps, it is long enough
to see the baby's face.

708
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:43,250
But if you don't want the baby
like you don't want me,

709
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,000
I'll send him to Japan.

710
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,916
I have told my parents in the letter

711
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,958
that they are getting a grandchild.

712
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,791
Uncle.

713
01:35:05,875 --> 01:35:07,666
I came here to say goodbye to you.

714
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:12,333
I'm going to go to Burma.

715
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,291
However...

716
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,208
I'm worried about my baby.

717
01:35:23,166 --> 01:35:24,166
If...

718
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,375
there aren't any Thai living there,

719
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:35,625
would you please
take my baby to my father and mother?

720
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:13,375
Kobori.

721
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:12,958
Angsumalin.

722
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:27,291
Angsumalin.

723
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:30,208
Vanus.

724
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:33,083
Vanus.

725
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,458
You managed to escape.

726
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:50,958
I didn't escape.

727
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:55,583
Thai people know that we are detained
by day to deceive the Japanese,

728
01:37:55,666 --> 01:38:00,083
but by night, we are released to work.
I have to get to Bangkok Noi tonight.

729
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,458
How are you doing?

730
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,375
I'm fine.

731
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,708
Do you miss me?

732
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:22,250
I do.

733
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,750
But, Vanus...

734
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:31,791
everything has changed.

735
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,875
-I'm sorry.
-No need to say.

736
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:40,458
Your dad told me all about the wedding.

737
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:49,166
He was my interpreter on the day
I was interrogated.

738
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:52,625
But I don't know if he knew who I was.

739
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:54,875
He knew.

740
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,708
He told me you were arrested.

741
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,625
Vanus.

742
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:11,416
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't keep the promise.

743
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:17,500
That's fine. Don't worry about it.

744
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,958
You should make a decision now.
If you want to love someone,

745
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,208
love him wholeheartedly.

746
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:28,083
Ignore other concerns.
Don't think about them.

747
01:39:30,458 --> 01:39:32,666
I came here so you could say it out loud.

748
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:35,583
And let yourself free.

749
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:55,791
Thank you.

750
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:06,416
Say it out loud. Believe me.
And you'll be free.

751
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,958
I'm leaving now.

752
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:35,125
Ang, where are you going?

753
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,750
I'm going to the dock.

754
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,250
Hideko.

755
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,041
That way!

756
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:32,541
Go!

757
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,916
Not that way!

758
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,333
Don't be scared.

759
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:25,916
Leave!

760
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:32,250
Hey, are you okay?

761
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:33,833
Is anyone injured?

762
01:44:35,583 --> 01:44:37,083
If you are, respond!

763
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:41,583
Is anyone injured! If you are, respond!

764
01:44:47,291 --> 01:44:48,500
Is anyone there?

765
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:58,625
Kobori!

766
01:44:59,291 --> 01:45:00,916
Wake up!

767
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:04,083
I'll get you out of there.

768
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:07,041
You'll be fine.

769
01:45:37,916 --> 01:45:41,666
I feel just gutted.

770
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:44,958
Gutted...

771
01:45:48,708 --> 01:45:52,333
I can't do anything for you.

772
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:57,083
A painkiller...

773
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:08,250
Azuma...

774
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:11,375
Painkillers...

775
01:46:14,166 --> 01:46:18,000
You use them for someone else...

776
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:23,583
Kobori...

777
01:46:28,458 --> 01:46:30,083
Kobori...

778
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:34,166
Go ahead to Yasukuni

779
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:37,750
and wait for me.

780
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:42,250
I'll be there soon!

781
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:58,000
See you again.

782
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:04,291
See you then.

783
01:47:41,041 --> 01:47:43,333
I wonder how it is at the dock.

784
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:56,166
Excuse me.

785
01:48:57,416 --> 01:48:58,625
Excuse me!

786
01:48:58,708 --> 01:48:59,541
Yes.

787
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:02,875
Is Mr. Kobori here?

788
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,375
No, he is not.

789
01:49:05,125 --> 01:49:07,458
Where did he go?

790
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:12,583
He left to get on a train
bound for Bangkok.

791
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:20,541
By night, we are released to work.

792
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:22,833
I have to get to Bangkok Noi tonight.

793
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:34,000
Doctor!

794
01:50:37,458 --> 01:50:38,583
Doctor!

795
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:41,541
Have you seen Mr. Kobori?

796
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:47,750
Anyway,

797
01:50:48,916 --> 01:50:50,250
we couldn't save him...

798
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,291
What do you mean?

799
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:57,833
For Kobori...

800
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:00,500
I couldn't do anything...

801
01:51:00,583 --> 01:51:01,958
Where's Kobori?

802
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:06,416
I couldn't do anything to save him.

803
01:51:07,416 --> 01:51:09,166
Where's Kobori?

804
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,375
I did my best.

805
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:12,500
But...

806
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:14,666
Where's Kobori?

807
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:15,875
I couldn't help him...

808
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:18,375
Where's Kobori?

809
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,750
I just couldn't help him...

810
01:51:26,416 --> 01:51:28,333
Where's Kobori?

811
01:52:13,875 --> 01:52:14,833
Kobori.

812
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:19,125
Kobori.

813
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:38,875
Kobori.

814
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:42,333
Where's Kobori?

815
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,500
Can anyone help?

816
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:29,500
Can anyone help?

817
01:53:31,125 --> 01:53:34,416
Doctor! Can anyone please help?

818
01:53:36,166 --> 01:53:37,791
Can anyone help?

819
01:53:39,458 --> 01:53:40,583
Doctor!

820
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,000
Can anyone please help?

821
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,791
-Hideko.
-Help!

822
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:47,958
Hideko.

823
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,541
Hideko.

824
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,833
Hideko.

825
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,291
Hideko.

826
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:09,375
I'm so glad to see your face.

827
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:14,666
You wait right here.
I'm going to get a doctor.

828
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:19,125
Nobody would come to the rescue.

829
01:54:22,875 --> 01:54:24,291
Someone will come to help.

830
01:54:25,541 --> 01:54:26,833
You'll be fine.

831
01:54:32,833 --> 01:54:34,875
Don't comfort me, Hideko.

832
01:54:34,958 --> 01:54:36,000
No.

833
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:39,666
We'll live together for a very long time.

834
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:47,750
Don't fool yourself, Hideko.

835
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:50,541
Now...

836
01:54:52,333 --> 01:54:53,875
I'm with you.

837
01:55:00,291 --> 01:55:01,125
Hideko!

838
01:55:03,375 --> 01:55:05,375
Could you smile for me?

839
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:12,958
You like my smile?

840
01:55:15,666 --> 01:55:18,791
There's nothing about you that I dislike.

841
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:30,250
That day,

842
01:55:32,208 --> 01:55:34,083
why didn't you accept my love?

843
01:55:38,166 --> 01:55:40,333
Not because
I've just realized I love you...

844
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:44,041
I realized that a long time ago.

845
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,416
But I'd promised someone
that I would wait for him.

846
01:55:51,666 --> 01:55:52,916
I understand.

847
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:58,958
All this time,

848
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:02,291
I tried not to love you.

849
01:56:07,916 --> 01:56:11,333
I know you tried not to love me.

850
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:17,250
I can't lose you.

851
01:56:20,291 --> 01:56:22,041
Nothing else matters.

852
01:56:24,791 --> 01:56:26,333
I only want to love you.

853
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:32,000
And you will have to love me too, Kobori.

854
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:47,791
I love you.

855
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,083
You love me, Hideko!

856
01:56:59,583 --> 01:57:00,916
Yes.

857
01:57:02,166 --> 01:57:04,708
Don't ask me how deeply.

858
01:57:08,291 --> 01:57:10,791
You're the first

859
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:12,666
and the last for me.

860
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,458
Keep talking.

861
01:57:20,458 --> 01:57:24,791
When our baby is born,
I want him to be like you.

862
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:32,958
I want our baby to be like you, too.

863
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,750
Because I like everything
about you, Hideko.

864
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:47,541
When he grows up, I'll pray

865
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:53,166
for him to live long
with someone he loves.

866
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:57,458
Yes.

867
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:02,583
May they live long together.

868
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:09,083
But you can rest assured, Hideko.

869
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,583
I'll be around.

870
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:17,250
My heart will be with you forever.

871
01:58:21,083 --> 01:58:23,708
My heart will also be with you forever.

872
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:32,083
My heart will be with you forever, Hideko.

873
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:37,583
My heart will also be with you forever.

874
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:44,583
Hideko!

875
01:58:46,916 --> 01:58:48,833
Why is the sky so dark?

876
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,708
I can no longer see your face.

877
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:09,041
I can no longer see your face, Hideko.

878
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:19,041
I'm right here.

879
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:24,958
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

880
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:27,958
I'm right here.

881
01:59:32,041 --> 01:59:35,125
I'll be up there,

882
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:37,208
always looking down on you from heaven.

883
01:59:38,958 --> 01:59:39,916
Hideko.

884
01:59:46,416 --> 01:59:48,958
I love you, Hideko.

885
01:59:58,333 --> 02:00:01,666
I love you.

886
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:08,875
I love you, Hideko.

887
02:00:12,958 --> 02:00:16,041
I love you, Hideko.

888
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:23,125
I love you.

889
02:00:59,416 --> 02:01:02,750
I love you...

890
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:11,125
I... love you...

891
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:18,666
I love you...

892
02:01:19,916 --> 02:01:24,625
I... love... you...

893
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:31,666
I love you...

894
02:01:33,541 --> 02:01:37,500
I love you...

895
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,000
I love you...

896
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:45,666
I love you...

897
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:51,416
I love you...

898
02:01:53,583 --> 02:01:54,791
You...

899
02:01:56,083 --> 02:01:58,666
I love you...
