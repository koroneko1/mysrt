00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.500

‎Uh... Something wrong, Lila?

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.260
‎No. I'm doing great!
‎It's just that Mum wants me to go with her

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.260
‎to this embassy function tonight, but
‎I've too much homework, and I'm so behind.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.820
‎I'll just have to tell her "No".
‎She'll be so upset.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.780
‎-Ah, yeah, bummer!
‎-Adrien said he'd help me,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.660
‎but I don't want to bother him with it.
‎He's probably forgotten anyway.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.780
‎He might think I've a crush on him,
‎like all those other girls

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.620
‎-who are constantly hanging all over him.
‎-Adrien's a great dude.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.780
‎I'm sure he won't mind!
‎I can put in a word for you, if you want!

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.100
‎You'd do that for me?
‎Oh, thanks, Nino, you're the best!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.300
‎No sweat!

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
‎-Hey, Adrien!
‎-Hi, Nino! What's up?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.380
‎Hey! Nino told me about your problem.
‎I can help, if you want.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.260
‎Really? You'd do that?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.380
‎You're such a great help.
‎You're saving my life, you know!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.140
‎No problem, Lila. Happy to help.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.140
‎-Marinette...
‎- I was so not spying on Lila,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.420
‎-I was just... tying my shoes!
‎-You've got nothing to worry about.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.380
‎Nino told me Lila said she doesn't
‎have the hots for Adrien!

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.300
‎Why don't we go to your place
‎to do our homework?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.340
‎It would be so much quieter, wouldn't it?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.060
‎-My father would never agree to that.
‎-I bet you I could change his mind!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.500
‎Marinette! Wait!

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.380
‎Pff! There's no way Adrien's bodyguard
‎will let her in the car.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.580
‎-Seriously?
‎-Don't tell me you're gonna follow them.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.340
‎Course not! I'm just gonna go...
‎to the swimming pool!

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.300
‎Hey, Juleka!
‎Can I borrow your bike? It's an emergency!

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.180
‎I guess.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.940
‎Marinette, you should just trust Adrien.
‎He knows Lila's a liar!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.020
‎I know, but if she keeps on lying like
‎she does, she'll end up hurting someone!

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.180
‎I refuse to let her hurt Adrien!

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.380
‎-What's the worst grade you ever got?
‎-An A- in math.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.580
‎Listen, Lila,
‎you should forget about this.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.220
‎My father can be harsh with anyone
‎he thinks is an intruder.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.460
‎We're not doing anything wrong.
‎Leave this to me.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.820
‎Aaah!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.900
‎I'm sorry Adrien,
‎but you know your father--

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.900
‎Excuse me, ma'am, but is there
‎any way I could ask him directly?

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.580
‎-Just in case?
‎-Mr Agreste is busy designing

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.180
‎-and must not be disturbed for any reason.
‎-I told you so.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.980
‎Oh, Adrien! I so wanted to help you
‎make up all the schoolwork you missed

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.260
‎due to all the modelling
‎you've been doing.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.780
‎What will your father think
‎if he finds out about your lower grades?

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.540
‎-Who will he blame?
‎-Adrien, have your grades gone down?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.700
‎He'd never tell you himself.
‎But when I saw Adrien crying the other day

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.820
‎because he only got an A-, I just felt
‎like I had to offer him my help.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.820
‎It would have taken half an hour.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.220
‎I understand.
‎You're only doing what you think is best.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.300
‎-I did what I could, Adrien. Good luck.
‎-Huh?

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.940
‎-If it's only half an hour...
‎-If you really insist, I'll do it.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.460
‎Seriously? How does she do that?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.460
‎-See? You never know until you ask nicely!
‎-You didn't asked nicely. You lied, Lila.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.220
‎You told me yourself that your A- in math
‎was your lowest grade, didn't you?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.300
‎Hey, Miss! You can't climb on that!
‎It's too dangerous.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.540
‎Could I borrow your ladder? The guy I love
‎is about to get scammed by a liar!

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.460
‎No. Firefighter's ladder is for<i>‎ real</i>
‎emergencies, not for spying on boys!

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.860
‎Especially without a helmet!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.780
‎Aw! Is this your mom?
‎You look so much like her!

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.140
‎I look a lot like my mom too, you know.
‎Isn't it crazy how much we have in common?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.300
‎And the lying girl's really that scheming?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.340
‎You really care about this boy, huh?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.620
‎This girl in red is pretty! Who is she?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.260
‎-That's Kagami. We take fencing together.
‎-She looks so nice!

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.100
‎You'll have to introduce us.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.660
‎Did you know I lived in Japan
‎for a few years?

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.220
‎Lila, didn't you want me to help
‎with your homework?

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.420
‎There. Perfectly safe to climb!

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.060
‎-There!
‎-Thank you!

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.220
‎Please don't tell me
‎you're still a fan of that... that...

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.660
‎Time's up, Adrien. Your father could
‎come out of his office any minute.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.380
‎I guess I won the bet!
‎How about a little souvenir photo?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.020
‎Feel free to ask
‎if you need any more help with your math!

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.940
‎Aaah!

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.260
‎We agreed on no cell phone
‎during practice, Kagami.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.260
‎-You can check when you're done.
‎-I'm sorry, Mother.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.300
‎Mr Gabriel Agreste! I am such an admirer
‎of your fashion designs!

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.340
‎This is the best day of my life!

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.580
‎I know how busy you are,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.660
‎so I won't take up any more of your time.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.380
‎Have a good evening!

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.220
‎-It's my fault, sir, I--
‎-In my office! Now!

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.220
‎I could take a photo right now and post it
‎online, but that would be too easy!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.100
‎-Tikki, spots--
‎-Don't even think about it!

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.700
‎Why are you so nice to that girl?
‎She lies with every breath

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.500
‎and snoops through your drawers!

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.660
‎You snoop through my drawers too, Plagg.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.820
‎Yeah, but we both know
‎I'm only looking for cheese.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.780
‎But she... well, we have no idea
‎what she's looking for!

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.900
‎Perhaps she's looking to be less lonely.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.860
‎One, two, three, four, five.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.780
‎What was that girl doing in my house?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.140
‎I decided it would be good for her
‎to help Adrien review his maths.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.340
‎I decide what's good for my son.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.700
‎It's not the first time
‎you've been fooled.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.020
‎-Do you want to take Adrien out of school?
‎-No.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.540
‎But I won't allow Adrien to be
‎influenced by the company he keeps!

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.300
‎On second thought, I think this photo
‎will help me get that young girl

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.500
‎away from my son once and for all.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.220
‎Such a tornado of negative emotions
‎surrounding such a meaningless photo.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.380
‎But the strongest anger isn't always
‎necessarily the noisiest one.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.900
‎Fly, my evil akuma, and unleash her anger!

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.540
‎Oni-Chan, I am Hawk Moth.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.700
‎I'm giving you the power
‎to track down Lila Rossi

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.820
‎and make sure she never gets close
‎to your loved one ever again.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.300
‎Adrien Agreste
‎is way too innocent to be wary of her.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.500
‎Of course, she'll persuade
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir to stop you

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.140
‎from accomplishing your duty.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.420
‎You must therefore
‎bring me their Miraculous,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.140
‎-to punish them for their naiveté.
‎-Yes, Hawk Moth!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.020
‎Adrien, I am Oni-Chan. You and I
‎were made for each other, Adrien.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.380
‎-Kagami?
‎-I will protect you

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.100
‎from anyone who tries to harm you.
‎I'll protect you from Lila.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.460
‎She's not dangerous! She craves attention!

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.140
‎She doesn't deserve your attention.
‎What she deserves is punishment!

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.300
‎Kagami, no!

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.700
‎-Can I transform now?
‎-Yes, Marinette!

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.260
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.060
‎Wow!
‎With all these girlfriends chasing you,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.380
‎it was only a matter of time
‎before they ended up fighting each other!

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.060
‎I don't have any girlfriend.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.780
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.220
‎Lila...

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.820
‎Lila Rossi.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.580
‎I forbid you to go anywhere near Adrien!

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.660
‎-Give up on him and I will spare you.
‎-Adrien? I don't know anyone named Adrien!

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.340
‎-Don't lie to me!
‎-I'm sorry, but I always get what I want!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.340
‎-It's not my fault!
‎-Well, this time,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.020
‎you'll have to give in,
‎or you'll really get it,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.700
‎whether you want it or not!

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.300
‎Shouldn't you ask the lucky guy
‎what he thinks?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.940
‎Hey! I'm just trying to help!

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.300
‎Come on! This way!

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.940
‎I don't need you, Ladybug! I was
‎perfectly capable of defending myself!

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.860
‎Besides, that ugly, horned girl
‎doesn't stand a chance with Adrien!

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.260
‎Aaah!

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.660
‎Are you really sure
‎I don't stand a chance?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.060
‎Back off!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.220
‎There's no use running.
‎Wherever you go, I'll find you!

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.860
‎Not before we've captured your akuma,
‎anyway!

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.540
‎-Huh?
‎-Please! Stop!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.300
‎Oh, officer!
‎I'm being followed by a supervillain

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.380
‎and Ladybug's failing miserably!
‎You alone can help me!

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.820
‎-Please protect me!
‎-Get in.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.260
‎I can protect you down at the precinct.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.300
‎The akuma must be in her bokken, Cat Noir.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.900
‎Not much I can do about
‎your forehead problem, though.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.540
‎What forehead problem?

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.260
‎Aaah! What is this disgusting thing?

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.220
‎What kind of a message is this?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.700
‎Aaah!

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.700
‎-What just happened?
‎-Where's my car?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.580
‎What happened to the young lady
‎with the horn on her head?

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.220
‎-The one being chased by the supervillain?
‎-Lila?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.100
‎Since when does she have a horn?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:33.180
‎Go ahead and run, as fast
‎and as far away as you can, Lila Rossi!

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.580
‎There!

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.940
‎-I feel like she's taunting us!
‎-She won't be laughing for long!

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.860
‎Help! There's a monster chasing me!

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.820
‎You have something on your forehead!

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.340
‎Oh! What a strange message.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.780
‎We've got her!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.260
‎Not again?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.180
‎So, you still think
‎you can get away from me?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.020
‎Honey? Huh?

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.340
‎Mo... Uh, Mrs Dupain-Cheng!

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.140
‎I was in the bakery
‎when this teenager with a horn came in!

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.500
‎-Lila!
‎-Oni-Chan must be there already.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.540
‎Stay here!

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.980
‎All you need to do is give up on Adrien,
‎and all this will stop!

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.020
‎Ahem! Nobody attacks customers
‎of the bakery! And where is my wife?

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.100
‎-Wait!
‎-Huh?

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.580
‎-Lila, are you OK?
‎-You're rushing to my rescue,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.860
‎after all those nasty things
‎I said to you?

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.220
‎I really misjudged you, Ladybug!
‎You're the only one who can help me!

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.260
‎I knew she'd wind up
‎liking you in the end!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.220
‎What kind of message is this?

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.060
‎Hey! Not cool! The girls
‎were just starting to get along!

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.740
‎Ladybug!

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.300
‎My wife answered the phone
‎and then, pouff, she disappeared,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.060
‎then that villain showed up,
‎and now you're here, and--

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.100
‎Don't worry. Your wife
‎is in a police car, safe and sound.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.300
‎The supervillain sends evil messages,
‎then swaps places with the person

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.380
‎who looks at them, and Lila's horn
‎acts as a kind of cell tower!

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.500
‎That's how the villain tracks her down!

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.340
‎I know how to defeat her now,
‎thanks to you!

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.460
‎Oh?

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.220
‎Give Adrien up!

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.820
‎And let you get
‎your monster paws on him? No way!

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.420
‎Adrien, Adrien, Adrien.
‎All the girls are fighting over him.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.820
‎No one's fighting over me! Yet I'm so much
‎more sophisti-"cat"-ed, funnier,

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.500
‎-and better dressed than him!
‎-How dare you compare yourself to Adrien,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.420
‎you cursed cat!
‎Adrien is perfection personified.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.060
‎He's the only one who's worthy of me,
‎and the only one I will ever love.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.100
‎What? Aaah!

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.420
‎What are you smiling at?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.100
‎Do you get it now?
‎I'll hunt you down wherever you go.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.700
‎Just give up on Adrien
‎and I'll stop tracking your every move.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.420
‎All right, I'll give up... on Adrien!

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.980
‎You're an awesome actress,
‎but you're lying.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.260
‎Your horn betrays you, see?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.140
‎It will only disappear
‎once you've sincerely given up on Adrien.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.740
‎But how could I possibly give Adrien up?
‎I love him so much!

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.540
‎It's too hard for me, honestly.
‎You can't ask me to do that!

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.940
‎The only thing that'd persuade me
‎to give him up

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.780
‎would be if you got rid of Ladybug for me.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.180
‎Hmm.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.820
‎This Lila girl is... astounding!

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.820
‎Lila! You all right?

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.780
‎If that's the only thing that will
‎make you give him up, I'll do it.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.500
‎Cat Noir! If anyone receives a text
‎message, you can't let them open it.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.460
‎That's how Oni-Chan teleports herself!

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.940
‎Oh! Cat Noir! It hurts so much!
‎I think I might have broken something.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.260
‎Milady, I have an emergency.
‎I won't be long!

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.460
‎-Are you sure she's not pulling your leg?
‎-She wouldn't do that.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.540
‎She really looks like she's in pain.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.180
‎Then I'm going to need
‎a helping hand here. Lucky charm!

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.060
‎Could you take this girl
‎to the nearest hospital, please?

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.260
‎You've been hosed, Ladybug.
‎Adrien will be mine now, forever!

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.620
‎-No!
‎-Yes! Take her Miraculous!

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.580
‎Back off!

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.420
‎Well, this is what happens
‎when you don't wear kneepads.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.780
‎-No! Don't look!
‎-What if it's an emergency?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.060
‎-Her leg's an emergency!
‎-Hmm.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.900
‎You're sure it's not her forehead?
‎Her leg looks fine!

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.300
‎You wanted me to leave Ladybug with
‎the villain? You hate Ladybug that much?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.980
‎Me? Of course not. Why would you say that?

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.220
‎Is it because she's been left alone
‎to fight Oni-Chan all by herself?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.020
‎What you just did is really terrible!
‎You should be ashamed of yourself!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.540
‎-Answer your phone, Mr Hessenpy!
‎-No! Don't do that!

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.700
‎-Yes! It's an emergency!
‎-Uh-oh!

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.340
‎Ladybug!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.180
‎Surprise, Oni-Chan!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.260
‎What am I doing here? And how
‎did you get all tied up like that?

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.780
‎These hoses are so strong, it once took us
‎two full hours to get a kid untangled!

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.940
‎Really?

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.380
‎Wait! I've got a plan!

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.980
‎Yes, Milady? It's the girl of my dreams!

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.740
‎Sure.
‎I'll bring her over to you right now!

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.660
‎Hey! Go easy! My leg!

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.820
‎-Need a helping paw, Milady?
‎-No, just a little phone call.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.980
‎No!

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.100
‎Cat Noir!

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.860
‎Cataclysm!

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.300
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.220
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.340
‎Gotcha!

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.300
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.300
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.140
‎Kagami.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.940
‎-Pound it!
‎-I'll take her home.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.860
‎Keep an eye on Lila,
‎she's as sly as a fox!

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.540
‎Your leg looks better.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.180
‎Oh, being around you superheroes
‎has toughened me up!

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.060
‎You'll be OK to go home by yourself, then.
‎You don't need me!

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.020
‎I think I was mistaken.
‎I shouldn't chase that girl away.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.980
‎She could make a very good ally.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.100
‎Hey, Adrien! Could you help me
‎with my homework after the school?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.340
‎You don't have Adrien under surveillance?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:48.020
‎I trust him, Alya. Adrien could never love
‎a girl like Lila. Not in a million years.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.700
‎I'm sorry. I've got fencing.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.860
‎Besides, you're light years ahead
‎when it comes to calculus.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.580
‎Actually, I have memory loss
‎after all this travelling I've done.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.900
‎I must learn everything
‎again from scratch!

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.260
‎Nathalie and my bodyguard
‎got reprimanded last time because of you.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.620
‎I'm sorry, Adrien.
‎Please! I didn't mean to.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.460
‎Lila, you can always count on me,
‎but not if you hurt the people I love.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220
‎Hello?

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.540
‎Congratulations.
‎You're at your best again.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.660
‎I'm only trying to be worthy of you.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.220
‎Thank you for inviting me here,
‎Mr Agreste!

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.500
‎You got into my house
‎without my authorisation,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:36.580
‎-by lying and manipulating my son.
‎-I only meant well. Adrien needed to talk.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.620
‎You do such a good job
‎of shielding him from bad influences

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.660
‎-that he actually feels very alone!
‎-Mmm-hmm.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.900
‎You're opening my eyes to a problem
‎I didn't even know existed.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.780
‎-What would you do in my position?
‎-I think he needs a friend his age.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.580
‎Someone who understands him, who can
‎protect him from negative influences.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.860
‎-Someone you can trust, too.
‎-You and I think the same way.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.220
‎See you again very soon, Lila.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.180
‎See you soon, Mr Agreste.
