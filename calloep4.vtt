[The smile you gave me, picturing from you on that day, stuck in my heart]

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:46.720
[Your voice on that day, just few words are all in my head.]

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.680
[You make me feel up in the air, waiting to see you all....]

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.500
What are you doing here at the chemistry building, physics guy?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
I think I should ask you instead.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920
What are you doing here at the chemistry building, mathematics guy?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.300
Anyway, you have drunk the skin food, haven't you?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.740
So you know?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.740
How about my pretty face?

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740
You're looking good.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.260
Many people have tried that skin food.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.280
The aura we can build in one sachet.
Many people have tried that skin food.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.280
The aura we can build in one sachet.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
How long does it take for you to sit here?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
I want to give Ion a thing.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
He's going to come with Atom but I'm in a hurry.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.400
Sure I can help.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400
I think they're so close apparently.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
Nothing happens.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.600
Anyway, how about you and Tan?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.820
Is there a thing you haven't told me?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820
Nothing at all!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
I have to go now.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
Please give it to him.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600
Sure.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.300
It's so tasty.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.800
Hi Lin.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.900
Hi Sine.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.240
What's up?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm going to summarize my lab sheet.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400
Are you looking for Ion?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
He asked me to buy a thing for him. So I brought it here.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.260
I see.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.660
I've seen the mathematics guy here at the chemistry building more often.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660
I saw Tan yesterday. Today Sine is here.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.380
You're so hot, chemistry girl.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.820
Are you looking for someone? Freshman?

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820
I can help you.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.880
Nope! You should find someone for yourself

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880
before you're losing your pheromones.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880
You're so mean!

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.320
Be humble. LOL.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.320
Your class will finish this afternoon. Will you go to the student affair building after finishing your class?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.320
Hmm, my class will finish around 3.30 pm.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.820
I may go there. Do you need help?

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.000
No thanks. You often stay at the student affair building late at night on Wednesday.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.980
I see.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.580
If you're free, please visit the chemistry building. I want to have Calculus tutoring like Tan did.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.440
Many chemistry students need help for Calculus.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.900
How about you, Lin? Have you learned Calculus tutoring with Teacher Tan?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
Seriously?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.140
I have to go now.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.140
I'm quite busy.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140
See you later.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.620
I'm just asking...

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820
Hey!

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.820
Why do you avoid me?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.580
No, I don't.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.780
You're lying! I know what you're going to do.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.960
What are you doing here?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.600
I'm waiting for you.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.220
Hmm...

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.220
Here is  your coffee.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.680
You used a formula as coffee's name again.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Why?

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.380
For you is fine for me.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380
You're tricky!

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.380
I did it from my heart.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.320
X^2 + Y^2 = 9

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.160
What a formula!

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
This morning, I came up with this formula for you.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
This formula is called "Dak Kae Khoen" (awkward prevention).

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.400
You're so cute whilst coffee mess!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400
What the hell you're talking about?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.300
That's what I see.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.200
Your class is going to start in 10 minutes. You should go now.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200
Shut up and go now.
Let's go

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200
Sine...

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.200
Are you shy?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200
Just go!

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.440
What's wrong? LOL

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.340
Why are you looking at me? Please hurry. I'm in a hurry

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.200
Is there anything else you'd like me to know about you?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200
What?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.820
Special event like tutoring at the last weekend. Please tell me.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.060
Nothing happened. I was at home.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.060
Really?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.060
Were you at home? You didn't go out for tutoring, did you?

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.480
Okay, you were at home.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.380
But whose house?

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.460
You're so interested in my story. How about you, Atom?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.460
About me?

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.460
Nothing special for me.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.460
I see.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.460
Please try to finish the report as soon as possible.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.460
We have to submit it before 1 pm.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.180
You also need to write a summary for Ion. You shouldn't miss the deadline.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.900
Lin, please help me.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.980
Sorry. You should do it.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.100
You're so close to him.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.420
It's not true. We're just friends.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.420
Stop talking.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.280
I've just finished the report.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.440
Atom, I have an urgent task to do.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.440
Please submit the report for me.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440
Sure, I will do it.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.440
Thank you so much.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.620
See you later.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.620
Okay. Bye.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.620
See you.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.980
You're really in a hurry.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.980
Yes.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.980
Bye
Bye bye.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.980
What's wrong with her?

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980
Actually she's a good friend.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.580
I want to go somewhere.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.840
The student affair building?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.000
Nope. Don't ask me anymore.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Sir Nueng's shop?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.840
No! Why do you have to ask?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.480
Come with me.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.760
Close friend like us can do like this.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.760
What are you doing?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.700
Tan...

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.860
Why? Are you shy?

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.860
No, I'm not.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.800
Let's go.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.320
It's normal for friends to do like this.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:19.340
[Your voice on that day, just few words are all in my head]

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:28.360
[You make me feel up in the air, waiting to see you all....]

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.760
I wonder why you take me back to the old school.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.760
But it's good.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
I haven't been back here until now.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.760
I'm feeling great.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.260
There's so many empty seats available but why?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.180
Can you remember the first day we met at Grade 7?

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.440
Your mother took you to the school and I had arrived.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.440
I heard a woman's voice.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.940
She shouted "Little boy!". Then I turned to her.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:08.760
Your mother was surprised and tried to speak Thai, English, Chinese to me.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.940
I remembered. When she knew that you were Thai, she asked you to take care of me.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.920
I think she's right to ask me to take care of her son.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.920
I don't think so.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.400
When she went back, you asked me to pay you for snacks and taking care cost.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.760
I protected you since Grade 7 to 12.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760
I knew.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:48.500
[Late at night, you sleep tight. But you don't know, right? Someone can't sleep tonight.]

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:59.540
[Inside somebody's heart, all the love for you. 
 The love that you'll never know...]

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.540
I want to play game now.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.820
[I hope one day you'll know.]

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.760
Let me lay down on you. I feel comfortable.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.760
What's wrong with you?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.820
You're so heavy.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.740
How come you told me like that?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.740
I'm playing game.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.200
What you need to do is just play the game.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.200
Take it easy.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.020
I think you don't take it easy.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.020
So we do.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.940
Pick up your phone, please.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.940
Hello.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:12.200
I think may be late at night.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.640
Yes, I will go.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640
Yes, only me.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.600
Okay, bye.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.020
Who called you?

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.020
Senior friend.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.020
Which senior friends?

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.780
Senior friend from our faculty.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.420
Someone that I don't know?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.420
There are many people that you don't know.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.420
You keep a secret.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.420
One day I will know.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.420
Anyway, I have to go home.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.420
I'm in a hurry.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.420
Why do you have to tell me?

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.700
You brought a thing in my car.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.080
And then?

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.080
I will take it back.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.500
I'm in a hurry. I have to go. See you at Sir Nueng's new cafe tonight.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.280
I will bring you a thing.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.400
Are you in a hurry?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.320
Yes, I'm. I must go now. See you then.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.320
So you're.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.420
Who is he who has called?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.620
Hello, Sir Nueng.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.160
Sine, keep things inside the shop.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.140
Has he arrived?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.240
He's on the way.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.920
He's often late as you already know.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.960
Here's his bag. I put it here. I have to store a cake.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.480
You've opened a new branch, haven't you?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.480
I think it's beautiful.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.140
Yes, I have. The old branch is still profitable.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.140
Newton - my son, loves that location.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.440
So I let him take care the old shop. That's it!

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.940
You hire Tan to work for you here as a part-time job, don't you?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:07.220
Since my new shop has many customers and the coffee is tasty, so I ask him to help.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.240
Anyway, he does not concentrate recently.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.340
He uses the mathematics formula as coffee's name. It's difficult for customer to order.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.340
I don't know what to do.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.600
What's wrong with him?

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.980
I don't know but you can guess. He's mathematics guy.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:37.860
Coffee vs Mathematics formula?????

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:46.400
What's happened? Why silence? You gossip about me?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.440
Sine, where is my stuff?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.800
What's topic?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.300
We're talking about your coffee's name from mathematics formula.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.440
Do you know the meaning of the formula?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.740
I know. It's linear equation.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.740
Stop! I know you're smart.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:24.060
Since you're smart, you will get rewards from me. 
You will be the first one in the world to try all my coffee's formulas.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.060
Poor you!

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.660
You're sleepless, Sine.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.820
This is just a gimmick for your coffee' shop.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:39.340
Try something new, do something new. If customers can answer, get a free coffee.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.060
Stop beating around the bush.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.060
You told me that you would come here early.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.060
But you came here late.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.860
I think you should ask him.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.700
Both of you're touchy!

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.700
No, I'm not!

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.560
Are you sure?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:17.700
Anyway, I think you look handsome lately?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.160
As usual I think.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.000
Are you falling in love?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.500
What! Say it again louder?

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.660
We're just three of us. Why do I have to say it louder?

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.000
Are you falling in LOVE recently?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.440
YES! I'm hitting on someone.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:56.400
Okay, bring the one here. I will help you check whether the one is good like someone around here.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.360
Tan...

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:11.500
I'm in the mood now. Bring me my guitar from the upstairs.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.500
Okay.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500
He's going now.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.920
Happy birthday.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.800
Happy birthday to you.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.160
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:19.940
Happy birthday to you...

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.740
This year you have two cakes.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.740
You're so lucky.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:49.920
I think I'm gonna ask persons who bought me cakes blow out the candles. Lin, Sine.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.580
I've changed my mind. I will do it.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.880
Thanks, Lin.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.880
You too, Sine.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.640
Tan...

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.420
Yes?

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.480
You're the luckiest one.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.480
You have two cakes in a day.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.480
It's so special.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.380
You have to put cakes in our mouth.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.380
I'm hungry. Please do it now.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.120
Wait a minute.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.520
I don't wanna eat candles.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.520
We can not eat these candles, can we?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.520
Here you are.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.380
Here are spoons.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.380
Three spoons, right?
Yes.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.380
You're the first one, Sir Nueng.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.000
Of course.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.060
This is for you, chocolate.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.060
Do you like it?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.400
Yummy!

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.660
Really?

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.660
YES!

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.660
Let me try.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.660
Now your turn, Lin.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.660
Here's for you.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.660
Lin, try this.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.660
Do you like it?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.660
It's an orange cake.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.660
Delicious?

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.660
Sine...

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.140
Which flavors?

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.140
Up to you.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.140
Chocolate.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.140
Do you like it?

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.140
Good!

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.140
Really?

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.140
Where did you buy this cake?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:43.240
Everyone. I have to go now.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.420
You have to go now? I haven't talked with you.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:59.000
I got about ten missed calls from my wife.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I should go now.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.060
Wishing you happiness!

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.060
Thank you so much. Drive back home safely. Bye.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.060
Please take care of my coffee shop.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.860
Sure.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.460
See you.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.200
It's such a long time for us to stay together like this.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.140
Since the faculty's sport activities, I think.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.240
I and Tan need to treat you to dinner.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.240
Sine, you're president of our batch.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:52.260
You lost a bet to Faculty of Chemistry for basketball.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.900
Tan and Sine, you have so many funny stories.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.900
Your stories always make me smile.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.840
I don't understand, Lin.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.840
I'm a funny person, don't you see?

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.520
I'm sure you will be happy when you stay with me.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.980
Lin, I have to go back now.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.980
I have to go back too.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.780
Wait, Lin. Your house is very near. I can see you off.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.440
You have to eat all cakes here before you leave.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.100
See you.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.920
Do you want me to see you off?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920
No thanks. Enjoy your time.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920
Okay.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.400
Let me know when you arrive your home.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.580
See you.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.580
Drive safely.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.580
Tan...

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.100
Yes?

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.100
What I said is true.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.100
About what?

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.400
About you and your close friend, Sine.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.660
When I know you're happy, I'm happy too.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.020
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.020
Let's talk something else.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.840
You want to to help you in Mathematics, don't you?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.900
Your examination is coming soon, right?

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.900
You're right. There are so many chemistry laboratory assignments.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.200
Poor you.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200
I'm losing my brain.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.700
If you are trained by Teacher Tan, I'm sure you will get grade A.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.180
Really?

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.180
Let's eat this cake.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:46.820
Don't worry. Trust me. I can help you.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.820
Do you like it?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.820
Try more for orange cake.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.820
Let's eat cherries.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.820
Be careful.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.360
Now I know...

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.520
Sine...

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.580
You're the value of Sine 90.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.580
You're my number one...

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.300
It's all in my head.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.880
Just like a song he sang for me.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.880
That's it...
