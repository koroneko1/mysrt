[gasps] How… How did you…

364
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,827
Threw my voice.

[groans] It's useless.

367
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,210
Hey.

368
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,213
Maybe you're just
too in your head about it.

369
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,551
You've been planning it for 15 years,
but nothing ever goes the way you plan it.

370
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,138
Sometimes you've just gotta
bust a move and find a new way.

You, you found the thread.

376
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,449
Thanks to you, brother. And the moon.

377
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,743
[Veruca] England will be ours.

378
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,747
And from there, we will build
the empire we've always deserved!

379
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,792
Blade, we'll only bring them to us
when you're ready.
