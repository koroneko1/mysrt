1
00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:03,164
- Come back and work for me.
- About going back and being your chef,

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,359
I don't think so.

3
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:07,928
So I have a new job vacancy for you.

4
00:00:08,096 --> 00:00:09,797
And it's only for you.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,737
(Partner Application Form)

6
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:15,304
Tan, I have changed.
I don't love you anymore.

7
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,667
This is all I can do for you.

8
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:42,739
Please take good care of yourself.

9
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,682
Stay with me a little longer.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,807
I want to talk to you.

11
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:13,805
Let me compose myself first.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,891
What are you going to talk to me about?

13
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:20,930
Because I don't want to mix
my feelings right now

14
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:23,367
if you're going to talk about work.

15
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,820
Oh, come on.

16
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,088
What I said the other day
that I don't have feelings for you,

17
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,456
Actually,

18
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,464
I didn't mean it.

19
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,979
I was just afraid
people will think that

20
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,510
I had to break up with him
because I cheated on him.

21
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,557
You don't have to care about
what people say.

22
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,745
And in fact,
it's just my unrequited love.

23
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:04,940
If there is anyone to blame,

24
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,721
the person should be me.

25
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,367
Why are you still waiting?

26
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,905
I don't think
I have given you any hope.

27
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,336
Because I care about you.

28
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,617
And it's frustrating to see you upset
because of him,

29
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,090
when I can treat you better.

30
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,346
I appreciate that.

31
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,346
You have made me realize

32
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,854
that my relationship with him is toxic,

33
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:52,729
and no matter how hard I try
to hold onto it,

34
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,185
I have to let it go eventually.

35
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,914
But I haven't done anything.

36
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,943
Yes, you have.

37
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,388
Oh, there's one more thing

38
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:14,791
I want to tell you.

39
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,021
I don't love him anymore.

40
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:22,599
The relationship between him
and me is over now.

41
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,474
Does that mean you are available?

42
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:34,624
And I can start hoping
for you to love me, right?

43
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,440
Hey, answer me.

44
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,452
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

45
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,173
- I can barely open my eyes.
- Teng!

46
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,184
I think I need a rest.
Let's talk later.

47
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:52,450
The restaurant is closed tomorrow,
and you can rest as much as you want.

48
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,882
Teng! Wake up and talk to me!

49
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,330
Fine, I'll be leaving then.

50
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:17,398
I'll ask you again
when I'm back to work.

51
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,917
If you don't have a plan for tomorrow,

52
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,930
Let's go on a trip together.

53
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,221
Let me know what time
you want me to pick you up.

54
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,436
Eh?

55
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,982
He's gone?

56
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,154
Gosh!

57
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,345
- What are you angling at?
- No, but you deserve this.

58
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:09,558
For pretending to be sleepy!
Now, answer me.

59
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,269
- Why pretend to be sleepy?
- I was really sleepy.

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,310
- No, you pretended so.
- But you also startled me.

61
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,849
How childish you are!

62
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:41,352
Hey!

63
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,235
Why do you come back here?
Didn't you have to rest?

64
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,727
I come to see you.

65
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:51,860
And I have something to show you.

66
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,190
Wait here.

67
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,425
What are these? Your collection?

68
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,652
I constantly bought new watches

69
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,707
because I thought I had lost them.
But I found each of them later.

70
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,231
So you have kept them all in here.

71
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,488
Your are quite forgetful, though.

72
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:39,043
Sometimes I'm too busy with work,
forgetting where I put things.

73
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,218
So this box is like
a Lost and Found department

74
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,358
where we store
the guest's left behind items.

75
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,724
Because they will look for it

76
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:57,897
until the find it if it means for them.

77
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,263
Seems like you are good
at finding things.

78
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,109
I thought I'd lost you, Poon.

79
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,406
Don't disappear from my life.

80
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,664
I don't think I can find
someone like you again.

81
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:09,802
I'm really sorry,

82
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:13,332
but I didn't know what to do.

83
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,088
I didn't have a job.

84
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,221
I didn't have money.

85
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,351
I didn't have a place to stay,

86
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,458
and you also pushed me away.

87
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,310
Actually,

88
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:38,563
I wanted to ask for your help,

89
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,737
but I acted opposingly
to what I thought.

90
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,671
I'm sorry too.

91
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,475
That I wasn't there for you
on your hardest day.

92
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,689
I've been through a lot

93
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,395
and I'm stronger now.

94
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:16,812
It's okay.

95
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:28,522
You will always have me by your side.

96
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,633
I will take care of you.

97
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,932
Hey, tell me.
Why are we at the joss house?

98
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,252
Well, you have had
a lot of tough recently.

99
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,869
And I want you to get some good things.

100
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,158
I make a wish for you too.

101
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,682
- You wish for me?
- Yeah.

102
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,599
What do you wish?

103
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,580
I wish for you to find someone
who sincerely and genuinely loves you.

104
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:30,713
Someone who will take care of you
and cherish you.

105
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,201
And most importantly,

106
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,109
he must be able to cook you food.

107
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,236
Oh...

108
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,791
With such qualifications,

109
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:41,661
I don't think he would exist.

110
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,549
Don't knock it till you try it.

111
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,765
If you find him, love him,
and he loves you back,

112
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,752
I will, let's see...

113
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,356
I will let you cut my topknot.

114
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:55,538
You said it yourself.

115
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:59,627
- I will cut it with my own hands.
- Not right now!

116
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:02,588
- You can't cut it right now!
- But you said it.

117
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:05,541
Yes, but not now. Can't you just wait?

118
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:09,338
What are you doing?

119
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:12,743
Don't tell me you can read a palm.

120
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,070
Yeah, I have studied some of it.

121
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:21,386
Fine, since we are here

122
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:23,795
relying on some supernatural,

123
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,186
Tell me about my future.

124
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:31,041
This is the line of life.

125
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,159
This is the line of heart.

126
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,496
And this is the line of relationship.

127
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,586
Your ex-boyfriend isn't your soulmate.

128
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,583
See? the line tears apart.

129
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:46,019
Hey, are you just saying it randomly?

130
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,574
No, I'm serious!

131
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,067
The line tells me
you have just met your soulmate.

132
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,532
Who?

133
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,779
I don't think I have met anyone.
Are you sure?

134
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,457
Yes, you have met him.

135
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,005
Only you just haven't realized.

136
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,384
You don't have to stand
this close to me.

137
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:25,663
Are you shortsighted?
Do you want to get eyeglasses?

138
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:29,767
I stand this close

139
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,419
because I want you to see me
and how frank I am.

140
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,660
Stop it. Let's go home.

141
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,869
Wait, can I borrow your pen?
The one you always have with you.

142
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,364
Why do you want it for?

143
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:55,527
Here.

144
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,086
Eh?

145
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:17,163
Beautiful, eh?

146
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,081
Seriously?

147
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,487
I think from now I have to call you
Mayom, the sorcerer.

148
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:30,741
I'll wait and see
if it will be as you said.

149
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,265
Of course.

150
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,328
I just recited the incantation on you.

151
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:43,198
You and I will be inseparable for life.

152
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:12,450
I don't know when Mr. Athip will find
a new head chef.

153
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:15,945
Tian, ​​I already know
who is going to be the head chef.

154
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,251
- Hey, is the soup ready?
- Yes, right away.

155
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,363
- Can I have some chilli?
- I'm working on it.

156
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:28,212
- Put in the carrots first.
- Please.

157
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,602
- Just a moment.
- Wait. I'm doing it as fast as I can.

158
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,248
Oh, but I didn't rush you at all.

159
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,235
Hello everyone.

160
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,938
- Hey, Poon
- Hello, Poon.

161
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
I miss you so much, Poon.

162
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,467
We have been waiting for you every day.

163
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,407
- I want you to come back.
- Yeah.

164
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:50,368
I miss you guys too.

165
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,456
Today I have a day off,
so I'm dropping by.

166
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,118
How are you doing?

167
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,570
You sacrificed yourself to protect us,

168
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,915
but we couldn't do anything for you.

169
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:08,605
Mr. Athip told me about how you guys
confessed to him,

170
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,438
so he understand me now.

171
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,076
Poon, tell us everything.

172
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:18,752
Because I heard that

173
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:21,819
you are working with Mayom now.

174
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,184
- How come you ended up working there?
- Right, tell us.

175
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:29,368
Firstly, I planned to sell Papaya Salad
at the stall in front of my house.

176
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:31,987
- But I...
- Hold on, Poon.

177
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:34,231
I have to check on the ingredients.

178
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:38,814
- But what?
- But the landlady,

179
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,611
- she has already sold...
- Oh gosh!

180
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:44,181
My goodness, Ping!

181
00:16:44,356 --> 00:16:46,056
I'll be right back.

182
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,720
Hey, what happened?

183
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:49,521
What she did?

184
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:54,653
Apparently, task delegations
didn't help at all, right?

185
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,756
I know.

186
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:02,046
At this point, we only take
each problem as it comes.

187
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:07,942
We really need a head chef,
and I don't know

188
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:11,892
when Mr Athip can find a new head chef.

189
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,922
- Pan, come over here.
- Alright.

190
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,359
What is it?

191
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:20,298
A new head chef?

192
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:22,592
Who should it be?

193
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:29,864
Peekaboo!

194
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,580
Welcome back, Poon!

195
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:35,321
Even if I know it's just a visiting.

196
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:38,099
- Hello, Taywich.
- Hello, Poon.

197
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,237
Are you jealous? Oh my, really?

198
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:51,360
I still remember how you guys
disliked each other, though.

199
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,958
By the way, I heard he even needed
to go to the hospital.

200
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:56,996
Oh, uh, it's my bad.

201
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:01,201
No, not yours, Poon. It's his.

202
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:03,753
I mean, was that the only way
you have come up with?

203
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:06,040
You didn't care about
your stomach at all.

204
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,591
Enough about us. How about you and Amy?

205
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:13,206
Hey, I'm rooting for you.

206
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,950
How come the topic is suddenly changed?

207
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,391
I'll pick her up from the airport
after this.

208
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:27,710
I think I almost win her heart,
though she plays hard to get.

209
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:31,473
- Hey Pong, isn't it ready?
- Wait. It's boiling now.

210
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:34,864
- Can I pass me a fish sauce?
- Put the pounded chilli in first.

211
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,288
Oh my, your kitchen is so chaotic.

212
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:39,421
Still can't find a head chef?

213
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,370
Hey, taste it.

214
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,211
- Is it good?
- You haven't added sugar, right?

215
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,820
- Ouch...
- Oh, my.

216
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:01,928
Oh my god, you tripped over again.

217
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,090
- Let's go.
- Sure.

218
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,818
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

219
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,888
Thank you so much for picking me up
from the airport

220
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:16,934
and taking me to my favourite
restaurant.

221
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,072
It's my pleasure, Amy.

222
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,220
How long will you stay in Bangkok
this time?

223
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:26,954
Why do you ask?

224
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:30,713
Because I will book a flight

225
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,589
and go to Chiang Mai with you.

226
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,464
Goofy.

227
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:41,582
Menu's here, Amy.

228
00:19:45,748 --> 00:19:50,304
Oh, I didn't know
they serve Papaya Salad now.

229
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,293
It looks appetizing.

230
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,421
Well, that's an old menu.

231
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:58,015
I'm sorry for that,
but we don't serve it anymore.

232
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,289
Oh, what a pity. It's actually
our favourite dish, you know.

233
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,828
- Yeah.
- Well, it's because...

234
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:08,140
we still can't find a replacement
for the old chef.

235
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,937
I know it has never been easy
to find a skilful chef.

236
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:15,139
But you are also skilful!

237
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:17,461
Otherwise, you wouldn't own
a restaurant.

238
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:21,237
It's just that I want to try
something new.

239
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,971
would you care for today's
recommended menu?

240
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:26,972
We have Fish Paneang Curry
and Scallop Spicy Salad.

241
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,001
- No, thank you.
- Alright.

242
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:32,804
I'd like to have
your all-time recommended menu.

243
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,670
Great!

244
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,265
- I'll cook it for you.
- Thanks, chef.

245
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:45,289
Here they come. Thank you.

246
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,125
- They look so good
- I know.

247
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:53,377
Hang on!

248
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,297
Let me help you.

249
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,940
I didn't take care of you at all
while you were there.

250
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:06,214
I must say I feel bad for him.

251
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,802
If only the competition rules
benefited his expertise a bit more,

252
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,797
I'm sure it would be more exciting.

253
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:31,797
Eh?

254
00:21:34,198 --> 00:21:36,970
Tay, what are you doing over there?

255
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,888
How come I have overlooked him?

256
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,902
Tian is going to have to pay us
some referral fee.

257
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:48,141
What do you mean?

258
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,722
You made me lunch?

259
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,416
Well, I'm hungry just right.

260
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,201
Hey, what are you doing?

261
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,501
What if other people see us?

262
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:34,086
So if we are somewhere more private,
 I can do it, right?

263
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,819
You can't neither way.

264
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,493
You have made me forget
what I wanted to say.

265
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:49,786
Take your time to recall it.
I won't be going anywhere.

266
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,201
Whoa.

267
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,526
Let's eat lunch, Athip.

268
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,633
Let me feed you.

269
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:32,287
Why does it take so long?

270
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:35,805
Because it's very hot.

271
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:39,580
Second thought, no.

272
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:49,316
I think it needs more flavours here.

273
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,827
I'll season it for you.

274
00:23:57,432 --> 00:23:58,732
Have a taste.

275
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,043
Is it spicy?

276
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:07,967
- Isn't it spicy?
- No.

277
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:11,338
Okay, if you find it delicious,
eat more.

278
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,067
I thought you said it isn't spicy.

279
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:26,395
It'd be great if you could cook for me
every day.

280
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:30,068
You know I can't.
I have to work at Teng Nueng's.

281
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:32,881
Aren't you going to change your mind?

282
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:36,791
I'd rather want you
to work here for me.

283
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:41,114
I already have my plan.

284
00:24:42,388 --> 00:24:44,706
After working with Teng Nueng,

285
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:49,268
I realize that
it isn't only about skills

286
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,926
but I have to gain
extensive experience too

287
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:55,713
if I want to own a restaurant.

288
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,964
You want to own a restaurant?

289
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:09,269
I've been dreaming about it
since I was a child.

290
00:25:10,062 --> 00:25:12,308
It has to be original and represent me.

291
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,139
A place where I can create
my own recipes and menus

292
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,580
that I can make a profit from.

293
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,940
I'm sure you can do it.

294
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:27,339
Oh, I remember now.

295
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:29,803
I was about to recommend
a new head chef to you.

296
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:31,444
Hey, Tian!

297
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:35,074
I know who is suitable to be your chef.

298
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,379
I mean the head chef.

299
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,246
Who?

300
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:40,293
- Chef Pipob!
- Chef Pipob!

301
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,340
Chef Pipob?

302
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,404
Do you want to talk to me?

303
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:14,012
Do you aware that I'm looking
for a new head chef?

304
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:20,312
I will ask my chef friends to see
if anyone wants the job.

305
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:23,249
Let's cut to the chest,

306
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,728
The person I'm interested in is you.

307
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,655
I have checked with my friends
whom you have worked for,

308
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:33,249
they all felt regret when you resigned.

309
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:39,340
I didn't get a promotion
after being a head chef for many years.

310
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:41,543
And my job was stuck like that.

311
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,340
So I decided to start my own business.

312
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:47,084
That's what I'm talking about.

313
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:51,903
I'm going to offer you a food
and beverage executive position.

314
00:26:53,449 --> 00:26:54,986
But I have one caveat here.

315
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:00,088
You will have to train my chefs to be
a new head chef within a half year.

316
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,648
An Executive, you say?

317
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:10,035
Yes, and it's a critical position
for the hotel.

318
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:13,317
But I believe that you can do it.

319
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,613
How about this restaurant?

320
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:25,114
I mean I built it from scratch.

321
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,873
To be honest,

322
00:27:29,055 --> 00:27:30,998
I kind of regret abandoning it.

323
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,983
I also have a solution
for your restaurant.

324
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,163
Hello, I have arrived.

325
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:50,652
Excuse me, are you looking for someone?

326
00:27:51,641 --> 00:27:53,736
I have an appointment with Mr. Athip.

327
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,977
- Hello, Pipob.
- Hello, Mr. Athip.

328
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,617
Pirada, this is Pipob.

329
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:05,899
Acting executive of the food
and beverage department.

330
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,869
Please come in, Pipob

331
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:24,295
Yes, Ping, I have to tell her.

332
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,243
Ping!

333
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,730
Really?

334
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:47,204
Really?

335
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:49,741
What?

336
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:52,846
Seriously?

337
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,320
Everyone, here is Chef Pipob,

338
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,482
Acting Executive of the Food
and Beverage Department.

339
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:34,063
He will start working with us

340
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,366
as the Head Chef of Thai Kitchen.

341
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,793
I'm pleased to meet
and work with you guys.

342
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:44,765
Next week, I will hold a welcome party
 for chef Pipob.

343
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:48,631
And you guys will be responsible
for the food at the party.

344
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,920
This is the first task you will work on
as a team.

345
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:55,381
- Acknowledged.
- Acknowledged.

346
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,876
So do your best.

347
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:27,410
See that box? Have a look at it
and tell me what's inside.

348
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:36,781
Thank you very much.

349
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:58,732
It's just a document from Tankhun.

350
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,081
He remains a restaurant partner,

351
00:31:02,803 --> 00:31:06,983
and I still need his signature
for financial purposes.

352
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,449
You don't have to explain it to me.

353
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,378
I trust you.

354
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,602
Well, I just want you to know.

355
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:18,443
So you can be sure
I have nothing hidden from you.

356
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:20,827
Well,

357
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:22,737
did you miss me this morning?

358
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:30,386
- Go on with your chilli paste there.
- Hey, come on!

359
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:32,261
Didn't you just say that...

360
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,299
Jeez.

361
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:37,123
Hey.

362
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:41,129
Are you here only to win his heart?

363
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:45,196
If I don't start now, then when?

364
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:49,628
Right, I hope you success soon.

365
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:53,853
Mayom.

366
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:56,424
Hey!

367
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:58,108
Listen to me!

368
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:02,114
There will be a welcome party
for the new head chef.

369
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:07,465
So is it Chef Pipob you mentioned?

370
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:12,523
Yeah, I think it fits him.

371
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,534
By the way, will you join the party?

372
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,067
I don't think so.

373
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:21,247
I mean, I don't work there anymore.

374
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:27,345
Mr Athip wants to thank you
and Teng Nueng for helping me.

375
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,981
So he asked me to invite you.

376
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,329
Hey...

377
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,800
Are you going or not?

378
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,958
Here I find you a reason
to invite Teng Nueng.

379
00:32:42,852 --> 00:32:44,052
Just ask him.

380
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:50,452
Fine, I will ask him then.

381
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:52,914
Good, man.

382
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,072
Take it to Chef Mayom.

383
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,856
You are so adorable today.

384
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:20,929
Thank you.

385
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,635
Oh, everybody is here.

386
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,459
Yeah!

387
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:31,334
So Tian really approached him,
and he agreed to take the position.

388
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,970
Amy, give me credit too.

389
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:39,121
I was the one who recommended
Chef Phipop to him.

390
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:41,200
Alright.

391
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:44,697
You are good at everything, Tay,
except for your own stuff.

392
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:49,481
I don't see you making any move.

393
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:55,885
Are you giving me a hint about us?

394
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:01,417
- I...
- Chef Phipop!

395
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:04,126
- Hello.
- Hi.

396
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:05,653
Congratulations.

397
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:07,556
- Do you remember me?
- Of course,

398
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:10,365
you are my regular customer.

399
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:15,151
So you won't be
at the restaurant anymore, right?

400
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:17,171
Well, kind of.

401
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:21,204
But isn't your restaurant on the rise?

402
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,488
So who's going to take care of it?

403
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:26,036
You have to ask Mr. Athip
regarding the matter.

404
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,147
If you don't mind,
I'll go take care of my guests.

405
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,275
- We don't mind.
- Please enjoy the party.

406
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,417
Sure, see you around.

407
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:35,685
- Hang on.
- Eh?

408
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:39,184
- Why ask Tian?
- Well, I don't know either.

409
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,833
- Don't you think it's weird?
- Of course, it is.

410
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:44,497
He didn't tell me anything.

411
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:47,864
- You don't know anything?
- No, I don't.

412
00:34:48,006 --> 00:34:49,528
- Amy, watch out!
- Ouch!

413
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:51,818
Hey, don't, Amy, don't.

414
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,700
- Ouch!
- Oh, does it hurt?

415
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:56,255
Yes, it hurts.

416
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:01,887
They just didn't look at
where they were going.

417
00:35:03,223 --> 00:35:05,770
You are dress-up,
so don't get cranky and ruin it.

418
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,754
- It hurts so bad.
- Let's go, Amy.

419
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,295
Let have a seat over there.

420
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,740
- Ouch.
- Does it still hurt?

421
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,669
- Yes.
- Be careful.

422
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,563
- Ouch!
- Oh, easy.

423
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:23,418
- Ouch!
- Oh, no, Amy

424
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:26,754
Why don't you wear comfortable shoes?

425
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:29,797
Well, this pair of shoes are beautiful.

426
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:31,237
Ouch...

427
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:35,903
Damn, it's hard to walk in the heels,
and now it's pinching my feet.

428
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:42,809
Hey.

429
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,450
What are you doing, Tay?

430
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:47,766
I'm embarrased.

431
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:52,288
Why are you embarrassed, Amy?
They all are our friends.

432
00:35:59,476 --> 00:36:00,676
Abracadabra!

433
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:04,783
Thank you, Tay.

434
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,046
- I'll do it.
- Here's the reason.

435
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:12,006
Your shoes are too big for you.

436
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,708
That's why you always trip over.

437
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:19,934
High heels will pinch your feet badly
if they are too fit,

438
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,645
but they complement your feet more
when sizing up.

439
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:26,684
I will buy you some shoes
that fit and make you beautiful.

440
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,396
Speaking of being more beautiful,

441
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,931
I always take you as I find you.

442
00:36:36,212 --> 00:36:38,694
Moerover,
you are already beautiful for me.

443
00:36:47,659 --> 00:36:49,270
Hey, Tay.

444
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:50,681
What are you going to do?

445
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,893
Isn't it too fast for us?

446
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:02,974
- Here.
- Aw.

447
00:37:03,768 --> 00:37:05,288
An ankle bracelet?

448
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,770
- Wow, it's so cute.
- Do you like it?

449
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,934
I know it fits you.

450
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,959
Thank you very much.

451
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:23,538
Don't kneel down next time.
Come here and sit properly.

452
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:29,950
Well, I bought you an anklet.

453
00:37:29,985 --> 00:37:31,664
So I have to put it on your ankle.

454
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:35,372
Do you want me to put it on your wrist?

455
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,185
or around a finger?

456
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,722
Are there anything
that is put on a finger?

457
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:46,971
Yes, of course.

458
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,023
Think about it, Amy.

459
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:53,167
Oh, you mean earrings?

460
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:02,104
How about this?

461
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:06,882
I will tell you if you
agree to be my girlfriend.

462
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,026
Hey, Tay.

463
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:12,438
Why do you squeeze in?
There is a lot of space there.

464
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:23,192
Will you be my girlfriend?

465
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:29,622
You acted so straightforwardly earlier,

466
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:33,919
but now you seem so crafty.

467
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,325
Move over. There is a lot of space.

468
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:40,891
I don't see why you have to squeeze in.

469
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:51,968
Please.

470
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:56,869
Come on, move over. Go over there, go!

471
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,277
Isn't the party is held at the pool?

472
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:07,159
Why are you here? It's about to start.

473
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:11,987
An urgent work comes up,
so I have to check the clip first.

474
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:16,339
Can you check it for me?
I need to check the file too.

475
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,167
I'll leave it to you then.

476
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,003
Hello! Welcome to the special episode
of Kin Kub Teng.

477
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,955
I'm not going to review any food today.

478
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:40,644
But I'm going to give a review
on a person.

479
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:45,137
Without further ado,
This is the meaning of his name

480
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:46,576
Tadah!

481
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,285
Star Gooseberry.

482
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:54,154
And it also implies his personality
because the first time I met him,

483
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:58,706
he was so harsh and astringent.

484
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,537
But he also has sweetness hidden.

485
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,011
This guy is very commitment

486
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,290
and doesn't easily give up.

487
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:19,370
even if he knows how things
will not be possible for him.

488
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:22,073
And he literally showed me that

489
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:25,011
if a person puts an effort
into doing something,

490
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:27,784
people will see it eventually.

491
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:30,777
Or at least, I can see
all of his efforts.

492
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:37,004
Usually, I'd give a star rating
when I do a food review, right?

493
00:40:37,387 --> 00:40:38,687
It applies for him too.

494
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:43,308
Let's see how many stars
he will receive.

495
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,954
I must say every time I was in danger,

496
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,132
or when I felt sad and crying,

497
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,371
he was always there for me,

498
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:56,699
accompanying me and taking care of me.

499
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,237
I think you better keep your mouth
to do something else.

500
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,834
Haven't you said you want stars
from me?

501
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:12,745
I'll teach you how to make it...

502
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:18,232
- I'll get even with you!
- Hey!

503
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,196
What are you doing?

504
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:23,591
Can you stop enchanting people?

505
00:41:27,523 --> 00:41:29,029
It's him again?

506
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,379
He aggrieved you again, right?

507
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:38,329
I'll make sure you will never
get a chance to reconcile with him.

508
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,119
Thank you

509
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:49,020
for giving a newcomer a chance.

510
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:54,452
He has been dedicating himself to me

511
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:57,921
but he never asks for anything
in return.

512
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:02,343
I can't believe such a person
really existed.

513
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,726
Judging from what he's done for me,

514
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:08,570
I'm sure that he is made for me.

515
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:28,273
Does it mean a full-star rating
reviewing me like this?

516
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,204
Just listen to it.

517
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:46,493
I hear it now.

518
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,334
What do you hear?

519
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:54,687
Will you be my partner?

520
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,665
Oh, the weather is refreshing.

521
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:50,706
Let's try this.

522
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:29,054
I want to be with you like this forever.

523
00:44:30,592 --> 00:44:32,132
How about the party?

524
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:35,943
Don't you have to welcome guests?

525
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:40,192
Yes, but before that...

526
00:44:45,169 --> 00:44:47,749
- Can you do something for me?
- Do what?

527
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:52,514
Do you see that box?

528
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,074
Have a look at it
and tell me what is inside.

529
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:00,861
Don't entice me, I'm not a kid anymore.

530
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,746
Don't be stubborn, boy.

531
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:07,789
Come on.

532
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:25,333
What is this?

533
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:37,037
Didn't you say you wish
to own a restaurant?

534
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,858
Please let me fulfill your wish here.

535
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,754
What are you playing at?

536
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:45,584
Don't joke around like this.

537
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:53,188
I already bought it from Pipob.

538
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:58,089
We can go check it out
and redecorate it together.

539
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:04,367
Hey,

540
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:07,836
isn't it a little bit too much?

541
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:33,236
I thought you said you aren't a kid.
Why are you crying now?

542
00:46:35,027 --> 00:46:36,227
Athip.

543
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:45,097
Let's make it

544
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,725
the first step of our life together.

545
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:53,611
From now on,
I'll always be by your side.

546
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:57,323
and take care of you.

547
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:00,659
I will never forget today

548
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:05,004
when you show me how much you love me.

549
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:10,085
Thank you, Athip.

550
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,389
For being everything to me.

551
00:47:55,552 --> 00:47:58,293
And next, let's meet...

552
00:47:58,304 --> 00:48:00,704
Our Thai chefs gang!

553
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:06,611
Chef Pipob,

554
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,030
we bring you a new chef suit.

555
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:13,225
- Put it on.
- Yes, put it on.

556
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,523
Put it on!

557
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:16,528
Okay, put your arm in.

558
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:18,165
Way to go!

559
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:19,721
Put it on, man.

560
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:23,943
Cool!

561
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:28,109
Yeah, that's way to go.

562
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,129
Let me see how cool you are.

563
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,620
Oh, wow! You are super cool!

564
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,959
How about we take a picture together?

565
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,970
Of course! Where shall we stand?

566
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:38,455
Come on, everyone.

567
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:39,704
Here's the spot for the beauty.

568
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:44,650
- Let me check the picture!
- Here.

569
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:47,243
Oh my god!

570
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:50,653
Look, it's Mayom!

571
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:56,431
Oh, man. I mean, your friend is a stud.

572
00:48:57,922 --> 00:49:00,755
Not a friend, he is my partner.

573
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:08,875
Wait, let's not forget
Poon and Mr Athip too.

574
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:19,378
Don't be too friendly
because I'm very possessive of you.

575
00:49:22,484 --> 00:49:24,584
I can't be friendly at the party too?

576
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,935
What's with you?

577
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:40,014
Go ahead.
I have nothing to hide from you anyway.

578
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,325
What are you doing?

579
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:51,054
Hello, everyone.

580
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:56,344
Thank you so much for watching,

581
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:59,470
and thank you for your support
on the channel.

582
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:02,889
Today I want to let everyone know

583
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,810
that Teng Nueng and I
are officially partners.

584
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:20,209
- You can't be any sweeter, Mayom.
- Seriously?

585
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:22,813
I don't see any reason to hide it.

586
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:24,958
Well, well, what's going on here?

587
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:27,146
Hey, Tian.

588
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:30,115
So how about you guys?

589
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:33,480
Oh, I'm delighted to tell you that

590
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:37,401
Amy and I are in relationship now.

591
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:42,149
Oh, no, you just broke my heart.

592
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,239
Don't worry, I still go
and see you like always

593
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,010
- She takes it serious, you know?
- How about us?

594
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:50,292
(I'm just kidding.)

595
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:58,348
The food is really delicious.
Let's go eat, everyone.

596
00:50:58,359 --> 00:50:59,759
Enjoyt it.

597
00:51:03,706 --> 00:51:05,786
- Do you know what is it called?
- Tell me.

598
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:26,505
...and thank you for your support
on the channel.

599
00:51:27,697 --> 00:51:30,474
Today I want to let everyone know

600
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:36,287
that Teng Nueng and I
are officially partners.

601
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:38,778
And  I will make sure

602
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:41,814
you will never get
to reconcile with him.

603
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:00,263
Now, it's time.

604
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:02,112
- Let's go.
- Okay.

605
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,656
After the redecoration,

606
00:53:26,914 --> 00:53:30,481
my restaurant,
The Spiciest by Chef Poon,

607
00:53:30,529 --> 00:53:32,292
is ready for business.

608
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:34,604
The guests I have invited today

609
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:37,932
have contributed a lot
to the restaurant.

610
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:40,857
Wow!

611
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:43,038
I have promised to buy you some shoes.

612
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:44,839
If it wasn't for Taywich's
recommendation,

613
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:48,638
I probably wouldn't have a chance
to be a chef at the PK Hotel.

614
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:53,081
And without Amy,

615
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:57,523
I wouldn't even know
how I actually feel about Athip.

616
00:53:58,529 --> 00:53:59,829
So cute!

617
00:54:00,723 --> 00:54:03,623
- Yes, you are so cute.
- I mean the shoes.

618
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,928
{\an8}(Share Transfer Contract -
This is what I can do for you.)

619
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:10,184
From a no-name Papaya Salad merchant,

620
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:15,246
I have gained reputations
because of Teng Nueng.

621
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,715
Mayom is a supportive friend

622
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,888
and adviser to me.

623
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:28,929
He lends a helping hand
every time I'm in trouble.

624
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:45,158
Chef Pipob, Ping, Pan, and Pong.

625
00:54:45,955 --> 00:54:47,635
I have learned a lot from them,

626
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,503
including some great recipes
and cooking tips.

627
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:55,222
And the most important thing
is the friendship between us.

628
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:59,033
Thank you for making me the chef
I am today.

629
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:10,771
I really can't figure out if Pirada isn't around,

630
00:55:11,657 --> 00:55:13,790
how Athip and I will end up.

631
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:22,078
Don't worry, I'm fine.

632
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,435
Oh, my, I forgot to introduce myself.

633
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:44,380
How is the cash register?

634
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:45,912
- Does it work?
- Yes, Poon.

635
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:48,151
- I have tested it three times already.
- Good.

636
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:50,403
Don't worry, Poon.
I will help him here.

637
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,614
Alright then,
I'll go take care of the guests.

638
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:55,994
Welcome to The Spiciest.

639
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:57,811
Sure.

640
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:08,292
They ordered Papaya Salad and...

641
00:56:11,627 --> 00:56:12,927
What are you angling at?

642
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:15,221
- Giving you a flower.
- It's not yours to give.

643
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:21,702
Thank you, everyone,
for being here today.

644
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,325
I'm looking forward to eating
your Papaya Salad, Poon.

645
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:27,728
And don't forget to make
a Mixed Fruit Spicy Salad for me.

646
00:56:28,307 --> 00:56:30,396
And the restaurant looks stunning too.

647
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:32,966
Oh, I'm not going
to disappoint you for sure.

648
00:56:33,154 --> 00:56:35,432
Wow, look at the menu!

649
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,096
You serve Soy Sauce Pickled Prawns
and Crab Roe too.

650
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:40,051
You also put my assorted omelette
on the menu.

651
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:44,707
Hey! Look at this!
My on demand instant noodles too!

652
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,769
Because you guys are my inspirations.

653
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,731
Oh, my god, I'm crying.

654
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:54,371
I will do the reviews for all dishes
you serve here.

655
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:55,860
Oh, thank you very much.

656
00:56:55,917 --> 00:57:00,217
I'm going to order Shrimp Chili Dip
to see if yours can compare to mine.

657
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:05,091
I'm sorry, mate. But I must say
mine is way better than yours.

658
00:57:06,995 --> 00:57:08,895
So please allow me to cook for you.

659
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,280
- Sure.
- Go it, Poon.

660
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:23,919
My friend wants to reserve
two more tables.

661
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:25,434
Oh, great!

662
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,613
But I'm afraid of making mistakes.

663
00:57:29,578 --> 00:57:30,911
I'm probably nervous.

664
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,973
Don't be. Now, relax
and take a deep breath.

665
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,919
I believe you can do it.

666
00:57:39,112 --> 00:57:40,312
Oh, right.

667
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:44,096
What is it?

668
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:58,002
It's already got a magic kiss on it,

669
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:01,438
and it will increase
the spiciness in you.

670
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,348
Congratulations, Poon.

671
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,589
Do your best.

672
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:18,961
If it wasn't for you,

673
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,932
I wouldn't have a restaurant like this.

674
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,180
You are part of it.

675
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:30,199
No, this restaurant is part of us.

676
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,110
- Now, it's time.  Let's go.
- Okay.

677
00:58:44,987 --> 00:58:47,220
(The Spiciest by Chef Poon)

678
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:04,066
The first and the last person

679
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,886
I want to thank most is Athip.

680
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,558
You want a fight, huh?

681
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:17,589
The person I hated
from the very first sight

682
00:59:20,542 --> 00:59:24,242
who have become the only person
I love now

683
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,040
and always.

684
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:37,972
Thank you for making me
the most fortunate person

685
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:41,109
who is loved by you.

686
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:45,084
My Tian.
