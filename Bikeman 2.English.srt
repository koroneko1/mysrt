1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,166
BIKEMAN 2

2
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,125
Wanna go have lunch? My treat.

3
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,166
So generous of you.

4
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,500
Of course.

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,000
Can I be your treat?

6
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,250
-I want pork barbeque.
-What?

7
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,166
You're not gonna answer that?

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,041
Well, let's eat first. Okay?

9
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:39,875
Okay.

10
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,916
-We need to get away from that truck!
-Why?

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,416
Come on! Go!

12
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,750
Why are we rushing? Who is that?

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,583
I'll tell you later! Go!

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,291
Father.

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,791
Where and when are you taking me
on your pilgrimage?

16
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,375
We'll travel next month
because it's an auspicious time.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,375
We'll walk northeast.

18
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,916
A new monk like you
should walk to meditate,

19
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,791
and nothing will alarm you.

20
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,375
Monks!

21
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,625
What the hell?

22
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,041
Father, I've seen monks
jumping across walls,

23
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,708
but never onto a truck.

24
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,291
How did you do that?

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,958
I don't know how I got up here.
Help me get down.

26
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:04,208
Such rash driving.
They'll get hit by a truck.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,916
That sounds like a truck.

28
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,833
-Put me down.
-Father.

29
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,875
Now do you know how we got up here?

30
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,375
Yes, sir.

31
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,583
I think we should start
our journey tomorrow.

32
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,625
What about the auspicious time?

33
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,541
We can't wait around
for another truck to hit us.

34
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,083
We'll die first.

35
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,791
So who was that?

36
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,416
-That's my dad.
-What?

37
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,333
Sakkarin, quick!

38
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,625
I'm trying!

39
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,458
Didn't you see my car?

40
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,208
Where the hell are you going?

41
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,125
Damn, you're as bald as me,

42
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,541
but you got a barcode-like
hairstyle going on.

43
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,916
Let me give you some advice.
Never wear a hat.

44
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,250
You'll get a rash. It's humiliating.

45
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,416
What do you want?

46
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,333
Don't talk to me like that.
I was a cop, you know?

47
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,208
Cobra-class, you know?

48
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,250
-No.
-Fine. Whatever.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,750
Come any closer, and I'll knock you down!

50
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,375
I'll beat you up. Don't you dare!

51
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,875
There you are. The cop is here.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,583
Sir, you don't have to stop me.

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,791
Stop you? I'm only here to see what's up.

54
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,375
Well, this guy ran into my car
that's parked here.

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,625
He didn't even apologize.
He was just going to leave.

56
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,166
-Where did you park?
-Right here.

57
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,958
You can't park here.

58
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,791
Shit. Did not expect that.

59
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,500
So what? Move the car
if you two want to fight.

60
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,291
If you won't move it, then go pay
the fine at the station.

61
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,666
-Move!
-Where are you going?

62
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,000
To the station!

63
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,125
Shit, that's twice you crossed the line.

64
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,166
Barcode, watch the back for me, will you?

65
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,166
So?

66
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know how some people
aren't close to their fathers?

67
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,541
I'm one of them.

68
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,791
My parents split up
when I was a little kid.

69
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,791
I lived with my mom in Ayutthaya.

70
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,625
When she died,
I had to move in with my dad.

71
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,583
I didn't stay home much during college

72
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,000
because I didn't want to see him.

73
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,500
That's why I don't really tell anyone
about him.

74
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,666
But then he came to Bangkok
and happened to see me.

75
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,083
He probably wanted to talk.
What a small world!

76
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,833
All of that
just because he wanted to talk?

77
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,083
What if we owed him money?
He would kill us.

78
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,333
Maybe.

79
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,875
Ae keeps sending me songs.

80
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,958
Stop texting me and sending me songs!

81
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,458
That's it!

82
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,625
Jai!

83
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,708
Jai!

84
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,375
Jai!

85
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,375
Hey, Sak.

86
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,041
-What's up?
-Where is Long?

87
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,583
-What's going on?
-A lot.

88
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,125
Damn. I'm out.

89
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,125
Hold up. Listen to me.

90
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,041
-What?
-Sit down.

91
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,291
Some drama?

92
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,875
Can't you just tell me later?
I'll get some food.

93
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,041
Sit down.

94
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,166
But I'm hungry!

95
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,875
Let me order you some food via Grab.

96
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,875
What?

97
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,375
-Chicken and rice, then? With soup?
-Sure.

98
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,875
Hey, you!

99
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,583
-Did you order the food?
-Yeah.

100
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,333
I knew it. This address was so familiar!

101
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,083
You deliver food now?

102
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:38,000
Of course! When there isn't much business
at the motorbike taxi stand,

103
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,875
I work as a Grab food driver.

104
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,833
So easy to apply, and you make good money.

105
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,875
Everyone is doing it.

106
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:46,833
How much?

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,083
It's 140 baht.

108
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,458
Your treat, then.

109
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,791
Son of a bitch.
I have to deliver and buy you food?

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,041
You're crazy!

111
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are you here, anyway?

112
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,041
Shouldn't she delete his number
if she's over him?

113
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:12,000
She still reads his texts.
Even though she complains, she looks sad.

114
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,708
Ae just texted me. He's so persistent.

115
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:22,541
"Hungry? Eaten anything yet?
If not, let's get something to eat."

116
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,000
Lame!

117
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,333
He doesn't even know
this is a break-up song.

118
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,708
Stupid men! So shallow! Men suck! Idiots!

119
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,916
Even though he's an asshole,
I still can't get over him in a day.

120
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,083
So you're not over him?

121
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,375
I see. That's why you're sad.

122
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,833
Not just sad. I'm annoyed, too.

123
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,750
Well, like I said, love,

124
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:58,125
it hurts people differently.

125
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,666
Hold on.
You're telling him to stop hoping?

126
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,375
No. Don't stop.

127
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,041
-Keep hoping.
-What?

128
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,708
Because...

129
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:17,000
you are more special than all of us.

130
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,666
Keep your chin up, Sak.

131
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,708
One day,

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,458
Joom

133
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,250
will see it.

134
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
Her name is Jai.

135
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,583
Well, she looks like a "Joom."

136
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,458
Jai. Why did you run away
from me yesterday?

137
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:50,041
Damn. If only I could stop being afraid
and learn how to drive again,

138
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,875
I would be able to drive
and deliver clothes farther.

139
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:58,125
But the course costs almost 5,000 baht.
So expensive, right, Mom?

140
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,958
See? Not even listening.

141
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,708
-Are you leaving for work?
-Yes, Mom.

142
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,375
Hello, everyone,

143
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,333
I'd like to introduce you
to the new generation of entrepreneurs.

144
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,041
Nora-singh!

145
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,625
-Hello.
-So smooth.

146
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,333
I have something really nice
to show you today.

147
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,583
It will make your life better.

148
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,458
Dad. Tell them.

149
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,458
Golden jewelry.
Real ones cost 20,000 baht.

150
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,750
This one costs 200 baht.

151
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,458
-Son.
-Yes.

152
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,000
-Convince them.
-Right away.

153
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,958
What's up with you two again?

154
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,500
You're so old-fashioned.

155
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,625
This is the latest way to make sales.
It's called a rap.

156
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,000
Isn't his dancing cute?

157
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,791
Shit, the tie doesn't go with it.

158
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,666
I was a street fighter
Fiercer than all, not a loser

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,041
Tell me your troubles

160
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,500
And I'll fix all your errors with my fists

161
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,166
But now I'm a new person
Throwing away all of my bad deeds

162
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,000
Now I'm selling jewelry, come look

163
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,625
Come see
You can touch them

164
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,958
Earrings, necklaces, bracelets
To make you look stunning

165
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,750
Turn heads, crowd amazed
They'll ask where you got them

166
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,083
They'll get jealous
Call you a rich thug

167
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,458
Miss, do you want some?

168
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:29,916
Why are you spitting so much?

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,041
Are you crazy?

170
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,916
Auntie didn't say anything.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,958
Her spits did sync
with every beat, though.

172
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,291
When did you start chewing that?

173
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,291
-None of your business.
-What?

174
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,166
Stop it.

175
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,958
So you ran away from me
because you quit your job?

176
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,166
When did you quit the bank?

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,791
About two weeks ago.

178
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

179
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,333
-I want to study to become a pilot.
-A pilot?

180
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,750
Do you think it's that easy
to become a pilot?

181
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
I let you come to Bangkok.

182
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,000
That doesn't mean
you can decide things on your own.

183
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,416
Got a boyfriend?

184
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:23,750
Why?

185
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,250
My friends have kids.
It'd be nice if you met them.

186
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,583
They have good jobs.

187
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,833
I'm an adult now.
I can choose my own boyfriend.

188
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,500
Doesn't mean you'll choose a good one.

189
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,625
-But--
-No "but."

190
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,875
-But I have a boyfriend.
-What?

191
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,083
Who is he?

192
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,458
You don't know him.

193
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,083
-I want to see him.
-What?

194
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,291
Bring his whole family,
so I can meet them all at once.

195
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,750
-But--
-That's it.

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,208
Is it the guy with the motorbike?

197
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,041
Sorry.

198
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,041
Something wrong, Jai?

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,833
So... she doesn't want to be
controlled by her dad,

200
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,916
so she lied about dating me,

201
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,541
and so he wants to meet our family.

202
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,166
What? The whole family?

203
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,875
Yes. Can we go?

204
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,041
What's her father like?

205
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
He's very strict.

206
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:03,750
At work, he's in charge of workers 
blowing up rocks at the mine.

207
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,208
And he likes to shoot for fun.

208
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,291
Sounds like this guy needs to meet me.

209
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,791
I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

210
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,625
Sak, you're about to lie again,

211
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,416
and you're asking
everyone to lie with you.

212
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,125
You can do what you want. I'm out.

213
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,166
Suree.

214
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
-Suree.
-What?

215
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,625
What now?

216
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,583
What's the problem?

217
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,708
Your dad doesn't know who's in his family.

218
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,541
Hello.

219
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,583
-Hello.
-Hello.

220
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,416
Everyone, this is
Uncle Term and Uncle Mee.

221
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,458
-My dad's assistants.
-Yes.

222
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,708
All here? Let's go.

223
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,958
-You forgot something?
-No, Dad.

224
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,625
It's good that you're here.
Can you talk to your dad?

225
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,916
Tell him not to get involved
in risky business.

226
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,750
What business?

227
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,041
I don't want to say it.
You should go ask him yourself.

228
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,416
If both of you can't even say it,
how do you think I'll bring it up?

229
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,541
You're his daughter. We're just employees.

230
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,208
He'll listen to you.

231
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,458
Let's go. The car is over here.

232
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,291
-Really?
-Yes.

233
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,333
-Sak didn't really want to go.
-Yeah.

234
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:59,000
But Jai said,
if things go wrong there, he can leave.

235
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,541
It's much better than letting her dad
come and meet him here.

236
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,166
We have to help him, then.

237
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,291
Hello?

238
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,875
I get that you want to help,
but don't you have to work?

239
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,291
Fine.

240
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,875
I'll send you the address.

241
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,708
Okay?

242
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,625
-Don't tell me those guys--
-Yeah.

243
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,500
Where is Dad now?

244
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,208
There.

245
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,000
He's shooting the birds
that like to shit around here.

246
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,291
Is that right?

247
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,916
Hello.

248
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,708
This is my boyfriend.

249
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,708
I don't believe it.

250
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,833
What a coincidence.

251
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,666
Well, today's coincidence
is not like that day's incident.

252
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,250
Nora-singh, say hello.

253
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,000
You don't have to give him
any respect. Just say hi.

254
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,708
Why are you grinding your teeth?

255
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,750
The vibes are turning bad around here.

256
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,500
Are you all here?

257
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,291
Yes. Expecting anyone else?

258
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,666
Well, two more will be joining us
in the afternoon.

259
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,500
Let's get some drinks, then.

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,500
Thank you for coming.

261
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,458
I'd like to get to know all of you,

262
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,458
especially...

263
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,666
Welcome.

264
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,291
Is there something going on here?

265
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,458
I'll tell you later.

266
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,666
Today is gonna be super fun.

267
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,541
He'll want to question both of us.

268
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,958
You need to know how to impress him.

269
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,750
Don't mess it up. Otherwise...

270
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
we are screwed!

271
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,916
Sit down.

272
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,250
-Why do you like each other?
-Who are you asking?

273
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,625
Both of you.

274
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,375
You go first.

275
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,125
I think he'll ask

276
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,916
why we like each other.

277
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,000
And I'll tell him it's because you are...

278
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,625
...a nice person, a family guy,
and he also has a stable job.

279
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,541
You?

280
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,958
Why do you like my daughter?

281
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,666
What should I say?

282
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,583
Just say anything.

283
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,208
But you should be prepared.

284
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,250
And...

285
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,375
don't let him know
you're my fake boyfriend. Got it?

286
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,541
So what?

287
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,208
What makes you like her?
Because she's cute?

288
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,250
Or pretty and petite?

289
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,916
Or because she's sexy,
playful, and friendly?

290
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
I like her butt.

291
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,458
All I could remember
from our childhood is...

292
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,875
Jai's butt.

293
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,666
We were in the same class.

294
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,666
And she always ran very fast in PE.

295
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,791
I could never catch up.

296
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,625
And all I saw was her butt.

297
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,583
But after I got to know her,

298
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,833
it wasn't just that.

299
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,208
She is very kind.

300
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,083
Even though she's a klutz,

301
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,583
and it's funny how
she always walks into stuff,

302
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,916
she makes people happy
when they spend time with her.

303
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
She likes to help people.

304
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,375
If she hadn't tutored me,

305
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,958
I wouldn't have been able
to work in a bank like I do today.

306
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,041
Whatever I have achieved today is because

307
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,625
she helped me.

308
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,291
And...

309
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,791
I'd like to make her happy

310
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:20,208
in the same way that she makes me happy.

311
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,666
That sounds incredible.

312
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,666
But it's too much.

313
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,041
Unrealistic.

314
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,625
Mom, do you remember
when you first met me?

315
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,125
You told Sak's dad you didn't like me.

316
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:48,750
You thought I wasn't a hardworking person
because I was a singer,

317
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,000
and he'd end up
taking care of me when we got old.

318
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,416
Look at how things turned out.
Your son decided to die first.

319
00:21:55,625 --> 00:22:00,333
And I've been taking care of
both you and Sak ever since.

320
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:07,791
It proves that you cannot judge someone
so quickly. Am I right?

321
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:08,833
Sure.

322
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,000
So now that you understand,
you don't hate me anymore, right?

323
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,458
I still hate you.

324
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Damn.

325
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,916
Hello, everyone.

326
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,916
Sorry we're late.

327
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,958
You look dapper.

328
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,166
Is everyone here?

329
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,458
Let me introduce everyone, then.

330
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,625
My dad, Sakda.

331
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,916
And these two...

332
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,875
These two?

333
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,250
-They are--
-Wait.

334
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,291
Let them introduce themselves.

335
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:52,416
We're Sakkarin's uncles.

336
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,041
I'm Aong-aj, and this is Aj-aong, sir.

337
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,833
So you work for an airline?

338
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,250
Well, yes, we're captains.

339
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,625
Usually, I'm not in Thailand so much.

340
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,416
Always flying.

341
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,250
Usually Eastern Europe.

342
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,541
Going farther and farther.

343
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,250
I spend most of my time in cold cities.

344
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,208
Enough!

345
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,375
Stop blabbing about your job.

346
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,166
I'm glad to be able

347
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,208
to come here and visit Jam's father.

348
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,250
It's Jai.

349
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,250
-Now, this is what you should know.
-Wait.

350
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,000
I thought you said you have
a mom and a grandma.

351
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,541
So who are they?

352
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,666
Damn it, Sak!
You didn't tell him I was coming?

353
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,416
Well...

354
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,708
his mom...

355
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,125
She fell ill. Very ill.

356
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,083
What's wrong?

357
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,458
Stroke.

358
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,833
Oh, no. She's actually okay.

359
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,125
You don't have to lie.

360
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,208
It's the truth.

361
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,125
His mom got so sick
she needed to be on bed rest.

362
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:16,125
She needed to use her hands
to lift her legs just to switch sides.

363
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,583
Luckily, I found some herbal medicine.

364
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,041
I gave her some.

365
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:27,000
Now she doesn't use her hands anymore.

366
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,083
So she's better?

367
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,250
No, she can't even lift her arms now.
Still on bed rest.

368
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,791
Probably the side effects.

369
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,458
What's wrong? Want some to chew?

370
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,125
Will that help?

371
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,083
It'll help to pass the time.

372
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,291
It's quite hot.

373
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,458
Dude! Stay on track.

374
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,416
I didn't get enough sleep.

375
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm so thirsty.

376
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,916
Here.

377
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,875
Excuse me.

378
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:24,583
I'll go check if my employees
have your rooms ready.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,625
What a shame.
I was just starting to have fun.

380
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,458
Want to leave right now?
I don't think he believes us.

381
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,541
Right?

382
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,875
Relax. I'm doing very well here.

383
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,291
-"Very well"?
-Yeah.

384
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:48,166
You keep adding stuff
and rambling on about nonsense.

385
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,083
Nonsense?

386
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,333
This is what a conversation sounds like.
I'm a professional.

387
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,791
One more thing!

388
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:01,000
My dad really likes jungle food.
He also likes to cook.

389
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,833
-Remember?
-I remember.

390
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,166
Almost dinner time.

391
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,208
What would you like?

392
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,000
I like jungle food.

393
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,541
And...

394
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,291
I'd like to try to cook too.

395
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:25,166
Good. I like jungle food, too.
You'll help me in the kitchen today.

396
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:27,666
Okay.

397
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,750
Yes, Mr. Reang. We got the stuff.

398
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:37,125
Thank you so much
for getting someone to find it.

399
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,500
-Yes.
-What do you think is in there?

400
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,208
Maybe some boar meat.

401
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,333
Boar meat, my ass! What moves like that?

402
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,541
Thank you.

403
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:56,833
Oh, fuck!

404
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,541
-What?
-No, no, no.

405
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,833
Cooking the snake might be too much, Dad!

406
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,958
Why?

407
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,833
But your boyfriend said
he'd like some jungle food.

408
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,416
Hi, Mee. What?

409
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,416
Chai wants to know
if we can reduce the price?

410
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,791
But our prices are the most reasonable
in the area.

411
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,708
-Why does he keep pressuring us?
-What's wrong with you?

412
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,916
No, he's already getting a discount.

413
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:34,541
Girl, tell your dad to look over here.

414
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,083
-Dad!
-I won't!

415
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,416
Even though he's a regular,

416
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,916
this is the price!

417
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:44,083
This is fucking intentional!

418
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,750
Hey, Mee. I have another call. Hold on.

419
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,458
Hello.

420
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,708
-Who's this?
-It's me!

421
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,833
Who?

422
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,125
Look over here!

423
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,708
Are you crazy?

424
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,458
The snake is so close
it could bite our ass!

425
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,208
What's wrong?

426
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,833
What's wrong?
What you're holding is what's wrong.

427
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,916
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

428
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,916
The snake is already tired.

429
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:35,666
It won't bite anymore.

430
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,291
Look.

431
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,125
-Jai.
-Yes?

432
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,708
Get the pan ready.

433
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,333
And, you, come make the chili paste.

434
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,375
I'll get the whiskey.

435
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,458
It'll help with the aroma.

436
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,208
Maybe...

437
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,000
How about this?

438
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,291
You make the chili paste,
and I'll get the whiskey.

439
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,833
Or what you said.

440
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,916
Come on, go. Go.

441
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,833
Quick.

442
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,083
I'm going.

443
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,041
What?

444
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,166
The snake's gone.

445
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,541
The snake's gone!

446
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,666
Man!

447
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,083
This is insulting!

448
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,916
As a mine owner,
he should treat us better.

449
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,375
Son of a bitch.

450
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,250
We only get some stir-fried cobra.

451
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,125
-Yeah, so cheap.
-Shut up!

452
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,916
-Where did it go?
-How would I know?

453
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,541
Is it near your legs?

454
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,833
Where did it go?

455
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,333
-Or did it get out?
-What?

456
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,333
Your suit looks very nice.

457
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,000
What airline is that?

458
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,000
-Vulture Airline.
-Is that a real airline?

459
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,083
We fly like a vulture looking for corpses.

460
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,333
Amazing.

461
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,416
Where are you going? Wait for me!

462
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,375
Everyone, the snake got out!

463
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,916
I don't know if it's over there.

464
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,208
Shit!

465
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:52,000
How did you let it get out?

466
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,250
-Yeah.
-I don't know. It just got away.

467
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,333
-There!
-Where?

468
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,833
No. That's not it!

469
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,208
-Find it. Move the table.
-I'm looking!

470
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,333
-Come down and help.
-Shit!

471
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,666
I'm looking!

472
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,208
This one.

473
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes, Reang.

474
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,583
I'm about to cook it.

475
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,250
-Find it.
-Son of a bitch!

476
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,625
Where is it?

477
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:28,375
Find it before I kill it.

478
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,291
-Hey!
-Leave me alone!

479
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,708
You have to help too.

480
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,666
-It's not my job.
-What?

481
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,416
It's Buddhist Day today.
I don't want to hurt animals.

482
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,666
It's not my job either, you know?

483
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,958
Let's find it, quick!

484
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:41,666
Not here.

485
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,541
-Nora-singh.
-Yes, Dad.

486
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,750
-Look at that corner. Find it?
-Not here, Dad.

487
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,791
What about there?

488
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,333
-Where?
-Not here either.

489
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,416
-Look closely.
-Not here.

490
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,833
Look below.

491
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:54,125
-Still not here.
-Lower.

492
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,125
This is the lowest. Not here.

493
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,791
Lower than that!

494
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,958
Not here.

495
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,500
Why is my mouth so dry?

496
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,583
Move it. Move the table.

497
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,625
Where did it go?

498
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,958
What?

499
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,250
That's the wrong snake?

500
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,416
Why is that?

501
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,958
What's so different about this one?

502
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,041
This one is aggressive?

503
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,708
Don't tell me it's under there.

504
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,208
Not here.

505
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,041
Is that...

506
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,583
Of course, it's me.

507
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,333
It's up my leg now.

508
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,791
On my calf now.

509
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,375
Almost at my crotch.

510
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,625
Don't you dare! Those are my balls!

511
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,708
Quick!

512
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,916
Quick! It's almost at my balls!

513
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
What should we do?

514
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,000
Get something to beat the snake with!
Help your dad.

515
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,458
That won't do anything!

516
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,875
-My balls!
-Bigger one!

517
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,750
-What are you waiting for? Hit it!
-Hit it!

518
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,958
-Stupid snake.
-Hit it!

519
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:33,458
-You've come here to die!
-Hit it!

520
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,208
And I thought I would spare you.

521
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,833
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

522
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,875
What am I? A drum set?
Beating me like that.

523
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,208
What do we do now?

524
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,500
It's probably dead now. Get it out.

525
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,666
-Just pull it out.
-You do it.

526
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:51,833
Why me?

527
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,000
-Come on.
-Pull it out.

528
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,625
Go on.

529
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:56,833
Pull it out.

530
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,083
Throw it away!

531
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,500
Please forgive me, snake.

532
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,041
Is that blood?

533
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,791
Snake's blood.

534
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,583
What's that mark?

535
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,541
Probably a pimple burst.

536
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,750
Did you get bitten?

537
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,166
Take that back! I'll slap you!

538
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,000
No snake can bite into my thick skin!

539
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,416
Everything is back to normal.

540
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,666
Don't touch me!

541
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,041
Dad.

542
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,166
I said don't touch me. I can walk!

543
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,125
-So obvious.
-Yeah.

544
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:50,166
Look, he's sweating,
and his lips are turning blue.

545
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:53,375
Shit, your dad got bit.

546
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,208
I think it's fine.

547
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,958
I opened the bag, and it's quite mellow.

548
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,208
No need to change. Yeah. Bye.

549
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,833
-Let's go to the doctor.
-What?

550
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,541
-Tell your dad.
-Dad, let's go to the doctor.

551
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,041
Why the hell are you talking
without any sound?

552
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,083
Shit, his hearing is gone.

553
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
Why is it so quiet?

554
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,833
This is bad.

555
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,083
What?

556
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,000
Can't hear you!

557
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,166
Louder!

558
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,500
You got bit!

559
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:32,958
You got bit!

560
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,166
Who's a bitch?

561
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,416
What's going on?

562
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,541
You're really lucky
that we have the antidote on hand.

563
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:54,125
I've administered the dose.
You should get better within two days.

564
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,083
Why the cast, Doctor?

565
00:35:57,875 --> 00:36:00,541
Well, this has nothing to do
with the snake bite.

566
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,750
His leg was broken, so I put a cast on.

567
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,208
By the way, did someone beat you?

568
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,375
My asshole son finally got me.

569
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:15,333
It wouldn't have come to this
if you had taken better care of the snake.

570
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:34,958
Hi, Thep.

571
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,458
Your son is back from Australia?

572
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:39,750
Okay.

573
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,791
I'll take my daughter to meet him.

574
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,958
I just need to take care
of something first.

575
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,125
Sure. See you next week.

576
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,333
Bye.

577
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,666
Dad.

578
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,250
Sakkarin didn't mean to cause all that.

579
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,208
Don't defend him.

580
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,166
I'm not stupid.

581
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,333
How is it possible
that the family sells gold

582
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,583
and one of them is also a pilot?

583
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:14,250
Tell your boyfriend and his friends
they don't have to fool me any longer.

584
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,041
I want to meet who they truly are.

585
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,708
And then I'll decide
if they're good enough or not.

586
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,041
They can leave if they don't like it.

587
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,041
Clear your schedule too. Next week.

588
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,041
You can stay here, but I'm leaving.

589
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:02,500
Look at the cast on my leg.

590
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,916
And the owner of this house hates me.

591
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,250
I won't help Sak if I stay.

592
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:14,458
I'm leaving!
You're not going to say anything?

593
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,000
You don't even care. Not even listening.

594
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,166
Who am I even talking to?

595
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,458
I think you should go.
He doesn't care at all.

596
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,666
Of course, I should go.

597
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,791
What kind of person
doesn't do anything all day!

598
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,250
He just plays with his gun.

599
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,958
Shooting birds.
I wonder if he has hit any.

600
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:38,166
Son of a bitch!

601
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,541
Of course, right when I'm leaving.

602
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,458
-Nora-singh.
-Yes, Dad.

603
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43,416
Is that blood?

604
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,250
No, it's all shit.

605
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,208
Then why is it so sweet? Let's go.

606
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,208
-Let's go to the hospital.
-Let's go wash this shit off.

607
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,666
Let's calm down and talk.

608
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:06,375
I know your business isn't doing so well.

609
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:10,416
Not many buyers for minerals or rocks.

610
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,041
Wouldn't it be better
if you sold me this place

611
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,958
so I can turn it into a 5G antenna field?

612
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,500
The money you're offering me

613
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,250
is chump change...

614
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,000
compared to what you'll make

615
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:33,500
from a 30-year contract
with the cell phone company.

616
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,000
It's ten times more
than what you're offering.

617
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,083
Wouldn't it be better if I did it myself?

618
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,708
Go home.

619
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,916
Well, it's up to you, then.

620
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,916
Good day, Sakda.

621
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,625
I don't understand.
Why does Dad have to be so strict?

622
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:02,541
Because he works a dangerous job.

623
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,458
It's normal.

624
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:10,125
I've never gotten to choose anything
on my own, you know?

625
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:15,125
Since Mom's been gone,
Dad's been choosing everything for me.

626
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,666
And now he wants
to choose my boyfriend too.

627
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,333
Maybe he just wants the best for you.

628
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,041
Sure...

629
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,791
but he never asks
if that will make me happy.

630
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,708
Maybe he doesn't know how to do that.

631
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:38,041
Just like how I wanted
to make my family proud by lying.

632
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:45,500
To be honest, I used to wish
I had someone else's dad.

633
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,333
Having a strict dad is better
than having no dad.

634
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,583
But I don't have a mom.

635
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,750
Well...

636
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:59,166
if we were really dating,
we'd have a mom and a dad.

637
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,333
I see what you're doing.

638
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,875
Don't blame me for trying.

639
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:20,291
He was about to get bitten
by a snake, so I jumped in!

640
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,416
Suree...

641
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:26,208
At that moment,
I didn't think about my life at all.

642
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,541
Of course, I didn't want to die,

643
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,666
but Sak is just like my son.

644
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,250
Maybe the snake thing
was his plan, after all.

645
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,083
This is the detonator.

646
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,166
We dig a tunnel
into the mountain and set up a bomb.

647
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,125
We keep the detonator here
for safety reasons.

648
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:02,041
The bomb's timer is set
so they'll go off one after another.

649
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,416
Make yourself at home.

650
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:12,833
How can you make yourself at home here?

651
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,416
I don't think he wants
to show us his mine.

652
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:33,958
He just wants you to see
what will happen to you if you upset him.

653
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,166
That's reassuring.

654
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,458
I came back to tell you

655
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,833
that Sakda hates your son!

656
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,041
Then, you take me there.

657
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,458
-Fine, but promise me...
-What?

658
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:52,916
Are you taking her?

659
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,583
Are you crazy?

660
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,125
Let's go.

661
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,375
Let's have a drink.

662
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,375
Thank you.

663
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,833
This is my mom.

664
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,041
Oh, really?

665
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,583
Not your grandmother?

666
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,250
Mom!

667
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:40,125
Did you get better?
I was told you were in a coma.

668
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,291
She's all better now.

669
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,125
Is that what you told him?

670
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,250
Was it Aong-aj?

671
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,208
It's good that your mouth
is not twisted anymore.

672
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:59,083
You do look pale, though. Is that normal?

673
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,291
Long was just rambling.

674
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:14,250
That’s why I’ve been sneezing a lot.

675
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,041
So what changed your mind?

676
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:26,041
Why do you think he wants
to meet our family so much?

677
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:35,208
He probably wants to get to know us
and see if he can accept us.

678
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:39,166
-That's why I'm here.
-Yeah?

679
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,833
I have the right to see this family, too.

680
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:47,541
I also want to know if I can accept
my daughter-in-law's family.

681
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:51,666
Daughter-in-law? We're not even dating.

682
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,500
So sad.

683
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,750
How did it go yesterday?

684
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:04,041
He doesn't like us that much.

685
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,291
Not surprising. Look at your friends.

686
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,791
But I don't like that guy either.

687
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,458
This will be fun.

688
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,041
Here, sir.

689
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:30,625
No name on the letter.
We don't know who sent it.

690
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,375
Quiet! Did you hear something?

691
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:03,958
How did you get in here? Get out!

692
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,041
Get out!

693
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,250
What's going on?

694
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,000
What the hell is this?

695
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:17,041
Shit. Right in the middle.

696
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:19,541
What is it, Suree?

697
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,000
I don't know how he got in here!

698
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:25,458
Don't tell me you were going to rape her!

699
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,166
Give me the towel!

700
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,291
This is awkward.

701
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,375
All of you! Get out!

702
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,916
Not yet! Nobody moves!

703
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,375
-What?
-What's going on?

704
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:40,416
All of us!

705
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,041
I heard something weird.

706
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,916
Like a sound?

707
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:59,125
Nora-singh! What the hell
are you doing here?

708
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,333
I'm practicing my rap.

709
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:04,333
You're an idiot! In the middle
of the night? Are you crazy?

710
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,708
Let me hear it.

711
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,833
I got real gold, rare gold
If you get cold, let me get a hold

712
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:12,958
I got my bike--

713
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,166
Shut up! No more rapping!

714
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,000
Now get the hell out!

715
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,083
Get out!

716
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,375
Let's go. Out!

717
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:24,166
Suree, go on. I'll keep guard.

718
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:25,583
What are you thinking?

719
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,833
Nothing! I regard her as my sister.

720
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:29,583
Such a nice guy.

721
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,250
I see you take up a lot of space, Suree.

722
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:35,666
Go!

723
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,833
I'm so done.

724
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,375
Let's be honest.

725
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,958
I don't think it will work.

726
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,125
Then let's do this.

727
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,000
What?

728
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:04,583
My dad knows a lot of things,
and he likes to teach people.

729
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,916
And he's very happy doing it.

730
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:10,833
So what's he going to teach me?

731
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,041
I have an idea!

732
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:25,250
Sak! Where are you taking me?

733
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,666
You said you always
wanted to learn how to drive,

734
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,083
but it was too expensive, right?

735
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:30,125
So what?

736
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,333
Ready?

737
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,291
You said you'd take care of it. Did you?

738
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:57,416
I'm an impatient man.
I want to see things get done.

739
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,375
I already cut the brake lines on his car.

740
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:02,625
But are you sure we want to go that far?

741
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,291
Driving is not that hard.

742
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:13,041
I knew how to drive,
but then I got into an accident.

743
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:18,541
So I got scared and stopped.
I've forgotten how to drive since then.

744
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,583
Why are you telling me this?

745
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,375
I'm saying I'm not stupid!

746
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,625
Let's go, then.

747
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,833
Show me how you change gears.

748
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:33,583
But first, you need to step
on that clutch pedal.

749
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:35,000
Then change gears.

750
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,208
Step on it and change the gear like this.

751
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:41,791
What?

752
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,875
I can do it myself. No need to touch me.

753
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,583
Let's go, then.
Release the clutch and step on the gas.

754
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:53,416
Yeah. That's it.

755
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,916
Look, I'm sorry.

756
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:12,208
I'm sorry that I thought
you were the grandmother.

757
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,708
I'm sorry I burst in
when you were in the shower.

758
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:23,291
I'm sorry I haven't been
exactly nice to you.

759
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,791
But this is who I am.

760
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,416
Drive properly. Step on the gas!

761
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:31,791
Step on it!

762
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,958
Cargo bike! Turn!

763
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,958
Watch out!

764
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,416
Oh, my God!

765
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,583
-Chickens!
-Chickens!

766
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:54,541
Oh, my God!

767
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,916
Stop! Stop!

768
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,083
What the hell?

769
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,458
I told you to brake.

770
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,041
I did! The car wouldn't stop!

771
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,041
Of course, it would! We almost died!

772
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,916
Well, you're a terrible teacher!

773
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,583
Well, you're a terrible driver!

774
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,916
I didn't want to learn in the first place!

775
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,333
I didn't want to teach
in the first place either!

776
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:32,500
How can he call me stupid?

777
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,625
How dare he!

778
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,625
He is the stupid one!

779
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,750
What a terrible day!

780
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,250
Take her to a driving school.

781
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,833
She's too far gone.

782
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,208
-Take it!
-Okay.

783
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:05,083
Must have gone badly.

784
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,416
No doubt.

785
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,416
This is bad.

786
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:36,250
Only someone on the inside
can mess with my car.

787
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:39,333
Can you look into it?

788
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,250
Yes, sir.

789
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,083
So he's starting to get suspicious?

790
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,708
Then you guys must hurry.

791
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,875
If cutting the brake lines didn't work,
what else could we do?

792
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,833
She quit?

793
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,875
Yes, she left a long time ago.
Didn't you know?

794
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,958
But I saw Oui,
and she said she just saw Jai.

795
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,708
She said she was going back to Ayutthaya.

796
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:18,041
Ayutthaya!

797
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,833
Or could it be...

798
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
I just bit my own tongue.

799
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,750
Off I go.

800
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,291
There you are.

801
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:44,375
Tell your boyfriend
to join me for drinks tonight.

802
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,041
-Okay.
-Why are you smiling?

803
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,166
My dad always relaxes when he's drunk,

804
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,125
so you can score some points.

805
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:56,000
But I'm not a heavy drinker.

806
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,958
Just ask Long and Preecha to help you.

807
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,000
-You think it'll help?
-Yes.

808
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,166
-Sak! You bastard!
-What?

809
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:13,541
Not you.

810
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,458
I mean you!

811
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:21,083
It's a shame that you're rich,

812
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,541
but you don't know how to dress like it.

813
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,333
You need some jewelry. Look!

814
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,708
Let me give you some advice.

815
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,833
You need a little gold on you.

816
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,333
You really wanna make a sale now?

817
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:36,666
He's drunk.
It is the perfect time to sell.

818
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,708
I heard that!

819
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,750
I don't mind. I'm also drunk!

820
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,458
I don't like gold.

821
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:44,041
You don't like gold?
Why didn't you tell me?

822
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,708
Then you'll like this.

823
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,791
This is a talisman, right here,
a good one.

824
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,541
It's very easy to use.
Just chant this mantra.

825
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,875
Buddham Saranam Gacchami.

826
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,875
Dhammam Saranam Gacchami.

827
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,541
Sangham Saranam Gacchami.

828
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,666
It'll protect you 24 hours a day.

829
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,333
Take your stuff back.

830
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:13,375
I see you're a fierce one.
You must try this.

831
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,666
This is what they call "Heavy Metal."

832
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,666
How is it? Look.

833
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,791
Metallica fans
will want it as soon as they see it.

834
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,833
They'll take it right off your wrist.

835
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:28,291
I'm going to be honest.

836
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,791
I don't like fakes.

837
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:35,375
Son of a bitch! You can't say that
when you haven't even bought my stuff.

838
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,375
Let me give you some!

839
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:40,708
Calm down!

840
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,958
I'm sorry.

841
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,333
Let me take care of it.

842
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:59,750
How much is it? Couple thousand baht?

843
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,333
This is 360K.

844
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:04,500
How much?

845
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:06,833
360,000 baht.

846
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:09,666
I should go to bed.

847
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:11,041
When did you get so sleepy?

848
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,958
When you said 360,000 baht.

849
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,708
Is that the liquor's price or a plane's?
So damn expensive!

850
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:20,000
Let's go to bed, or we'll miss
the monks in the morning.

851
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,166
No turning back, quick.

852
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,083
Can I pay you back in installments?

853
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,250
Let me announce
the buffalo racing event in Chon Buri.

854
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:40,833
It takes place every year
on October 18th at Ban Bueng.

855
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:43,916
My honored guests,
before we start another race...

856
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,291
Hi, Grandmother.

857
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:47,791
Hello.

858
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:52,166
Do you remember me?
I'm Ae, Jai's boyfriend.

859
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,750
You fell down once, and I helped.

860
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,833
Are you alone?

861
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,625
Let me get to the point.

862
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:07,208
I'm Jai's boyfriend,
but we got into a fight.

863
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,875
I've been calling her,
but she hasn't picked up.

864
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:13,375
I really want to see her. I love her.

865
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,083
Has she been here at all?

866
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,750
Want some of this?

867
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,041
Some of that?

868
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,666
No, Ma'am. I don't like it.

869
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:25,666
I'd like to see Jai. Is she not here?

870
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,500
She went to her dad's house.

871
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:30,500
Her dad's house? Where is it?

872
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,000
Want some of this?

873
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:36,166
No, ma'am. I don't like it.
I don't chew that at all.

874
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:39,000
Her dad's house?

875
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,625
Never mind. Now I know she's
at her dad's house. I'll find it.

876
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,250
I've got a map.

877
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,250
Really? You've got a map?

878
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,166
Why didn't you say so?

879
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:54,291
If you don't mind, Grandmother,
can I have it?

880
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,291
I'm sorry, but it doesn't look good.

881
00:58:07,208 --> 00:58:09,166
-I figured.
-What?

882
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:15,916
I'm just thankful for the help
you and your family have given me.

883
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:20,375
I know no one
can change my dad's mind that easily.

884
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,291
-Nora-singh.
-Yes, Dad.

885
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:25,000
Sakda is biased against all of us.

886
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,500
Yeah. It doesn't matter how nice we are.

887
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:31,333
Look. He left us here
in this shitty market.

888
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,625
There isn't even a Starbucks!

889
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:37,125
It's noon now.
Where do I get pizza around here?

890
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,625
-How much for this chewing gum?
-Five baht.

891
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:46,041
-Damn! Can it be two baht?
-No, sir.

892
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,666
I don't have enough money!

893
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,708
Why don't you try to meet
your dad's friend's son?

894
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:09,333
Why should I? I don't like them,
and I don't want to know them.

895
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:11,916
Maybe you'll like them.

896
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,125
Maybe the son's very handsome,
and they're super rich.

897
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't like someone that easily.

898
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,333
And you don't get over someone
that easily either, right?

899
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,458
Let me tell you something.

900
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:22,541
Jai!

901
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:27,250
Ae!

902
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:39,125
For someone who drunk liquor
worth 360,000 baht yesterday...

903
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,625
Today, he's drinking a 30-baht one.

904
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:42,708
What a joke!

905
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:48,208
Sakda, can we sit with you?

906
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:51,750
I assume that is a yes.

907
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,708
Do you have a problem with me?

908
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:01,541
I do.

909
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,875
Do you ever want to slap my face?

910
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:06,083
Every single time.

911
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,125
I feel the same.

912
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:13,708
Let's do this.
We'll both drink and slap each other.

913
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,125
And after that, we become friends!

914
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,708
You said it.

915
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,041
A man like me always...

916
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,041
Keeps his word.

917
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,000
-When in Rome...
-Do as the Romans do.

918
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,500
-I tell you it's bad...
-Then it's good.

919
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,666
-I tell you it's good...
-Then it's bad.

920
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,166
That's not right!

921
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,833
Who goes first?

922
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:31,833
You shouldn't have asked.

923
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,500
Since you're the host, you can go first.

924
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,458
Fine.

925
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,416
Ae!

926
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:51,583
Your love

927
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:59,166
Your voice saying that you care

928
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:03,291
Your hands

929
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,291
Touching my forehead when I get sick

930
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:15,750
Everything
Every chapter is still here

931
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:21,458
Doesn't matter
How much time has passed

932
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:27,458
Everything
Every chapter keeps telling me

933
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:33,250
Who I am since I've lost you

934
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:36,708
Ae!

935
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:43,291
I'm the foolish one

936
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:49,500
True love is here
But I can't take care of it

937
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:54,916
And I've only realized
When it's too late

938
01:01:55,333 --> 01:02:02,333
It hurts and I want to go back
But there is no way

939
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,458
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

940
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:15,125
You're going to regret this.

941
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,333
Do you really need to stand up?

942
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,458
That's too much!

943
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,166
Nora-singh! Stay out of this.

944
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,375
Can you check?

945
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:50,500
Your hair is still there.

946
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,125
Just the bald spot, then.

947
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,000
Check your dad out. My best move.

948
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:57,291
I'll give you that.

949
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,625
Have you seen Sakda?

950
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:05,916
Why are you here?

951
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,333
I'm here to make up with you.

952
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,750
How did you find me?

953
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,083
It doesn't matter.

954
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,583
My heart told me to come here.

955
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,750
Please come back to me.

956
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,750
Ae, let go of me!

957
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,416
Boss,

958
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,291
-something's up!
-What?

959
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:28,375
Quick, boss!

960
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,708
Shit! Why did it have to be now?

961
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:33,666
Sakda!

962
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:35,416
-Stop!
-Let go!

963
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,083
Ae, let go of me!

964
01:03:44,541 --> 01:03:45,541
Who the hell are you?

965
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,125
And who the hell are you?

966
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,000
-I'm her dad!
-Hi, Dad.

967
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:49,916
I'm not your dad.

968
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,916
Well, no, but you're her dad.

969
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,916
What the hell are you talking about?

970
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,750
Here's the thing.
My name is Ae. I'm Jai's boyfriend.

971
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,500
Impossible. Jai's boyfriend
is right there.

972
01:03:58,583 --> 01:03:59,750
Him?

973
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,875
No, bullshit! I'm her boyfriend.

974
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,750
Jai. What is up with this clown?

975
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:06,916
What's going on?

976
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,000
Ae, you'd better leave.

977
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,041
Dad, calm down.

978
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,208
You can't tell me to calm down.

979
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:19,583
Wait. Can you hear me out, Dad?

980
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:20,541
I'm not your dad!

981
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,333
Get the hell out of my house.

982
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,708
Sak, let's go.

983
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,083
Mom, wait.

984
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:33,250
He's kicking all of us out,
and you still want to be here?

985
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:34,625
Let's go.

986
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,041
Get out of my way!

987
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,416
I'm sorry.

988
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,416
I'm sorry, Mom.

989
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,541
It's all my fault.

990
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,708
I just thought...

991
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:44,041
coming here to please him
would please her, too.

992
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,333
I'm such an idiot.

993
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,958
Everything is ruined.

994
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,083
Forget it.

995
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,541
But...

996
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:09,541
do you really think someone would love you
just because you please them?

997
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,958
Listen to me, Sak.

998
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,875
That's not the only reason
someone would love you.

999
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,833
Look at your dad when he was alive.

1000
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:28,666
He didn't try to please me at all.
Nothing romantic.

1001
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,333
But every time
that I had problems or I was upset,

1002
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:39,583
he was always there beside me to help.

1003
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,708
He wasn't able to help all the time,

1004
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,833
but he was there.

1005
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:49,500
Now, that is love.

1006
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,708
Thanks, Mom.

1007
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:22,541
What's going on?

1008
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,583
Where are you going, Sak?

1009
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,041
I'm going to help them, Mom!

1010
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,333
Let's go help them get along.

1011
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,708
Are you crazy?

1012
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,041
We just left, and now we're going back?

1013
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,375
Wait here a moment, Mom.

1014
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:40,958
Take this for me.

1015
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:42,708
What?

1016
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,625
-Jai!
-I thought you left.

1017
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:53,916
What about your dad?

1018
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,791
He went out. What's up?

1019
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:01,083
I've been thinking about it. I want--

1020
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,000
Hello, Uncle Term.

1021
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,750
Are you with the boss? I can't reach him.

1022
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:11,750
He's not with me.
I think he went to the mine.

1023
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:14,666
Your dad wanted me
to find out who's been trying to kill him.

1024
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,958
Kill him?

1025
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,333
I know who. I'm sending it to you.

1026
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:25,583
If cutting the brake lines didn't work,
what else could we do?

1027
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:26,833
Hurry up and think. 

1028
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,625
So you can get the money.

1029
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,583
Why do we have to come this far?

1030
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:42,583
This is well past the spot.

1031
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:47,875
Well, Mee said maybe
we can find some minerals here.

1032
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,833
So he asked me to bring you.

1033
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:53,625
That's not possible.
I already checked from the satellite.

1034
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:56,458
There's nothing left here.
It's just a waste of time.

1035
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,833
But... Mee said there might be some.

1036
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,166
Hello.

1037
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,708
I'm going to call the police.

1038
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,333
You try to get a hold of the boss.

1039
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,083
Tell him not to go to the mine

1040
01:09:07,166 --> 01:09:08,708
because they'll try
to kill him with a bomb.

1041
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,541
Okay.

1042
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,166
What's going on?

1043
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:16,000
I'll get Mee to come talk to you, then.

1044
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,500
You wait here, okay?

1045
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,958
It's right here, Sakkarin!

1046
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,625
Where are you going?

1047
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,166
Long story, Mom!

1048
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:14,000
Suree, stop pacing.
Your blood pressure will go up.

1049
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,541
So...

1050
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:20,291
No one is going to help Sak at all?

1051
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:23,041
Just going to sit here and do nothing?

1052
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:32,125
Who here knows how to drive?

1053
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,666
You're looking at the one.

1054
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,416
I know how to drive.

1055
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:46,791
But my leg is broken.

1056
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,041
No chance. No one else can drive.

1057
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,208
He's not picking up.
There's not much of a signal.

1058
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,041
Hello.

1059
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,333
Did you get him into the cave?

1060
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:19,791
All done.

1061
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,291
Good. Let's do it.

1062
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:23,458
Are you really serious?

1063
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:26,166
Why do you ask? We've come this far.

1064
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,041
Mr. Kongphop wants to see it happen.

1065
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,750
Get it done.

1066
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:44,208
Look!

1067
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,250
They're following us!

1068
01:11:57,666 --> 01:12:03,458
This is a nice place to walk
on our pilgrimage journey.

1069
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,791
It is also safe here, don't you think?

1070
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,291
Yes, Father.

1071
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Watch out!

1072
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,250
Father!

1073
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:20,375
What the hell? Learn how to drive!

1074
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:22,458
Did you even see the monks here?

1075
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,125
Yeah, we are monks. Not some goats.

1076
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,958
Father, watch out!

1077
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:41,708
Where are you going, Father?

1078
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,000
-I'm done.
-Father?

1079
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,166
I'm done being a monk. Done.

1080
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,875
Should we stop?
They will ram us to the ground.

1081
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:13,958
Let's not give up! Hope is just like air.

1082
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:16,000
Just because we can't see it
doesn't mean it's not real.

1083
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,375
Sak! Here I come!

1084
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:27,083
Suree,

1085
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,958
can you drive faster?

1086
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:32,041
I just learned how to drive again.
This is good enough!

1087
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,666
Good enough? Here's good enough!

1088
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,000
Here!

1089
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:05,791
I'm going to give you a big one.

1090
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,166
-Nora-singh!
-Yes, Dad.

1091
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,958
Give them the big ones.

1092
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:24,041
You go, Sak! The path is clear!

1093
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:31,250
It'll be a while before someone passes by.
Stay there, suckers!

1094
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,916
Have you seen my dad?

1095
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:46,875
Yeah. He went into the cave with Bo.

1096
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:51,958
But Bo already left,
and I saw him go into the office.

1097
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,041
-And Dad is still in there?
-I think so.

1098
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,625
You go get Dad in the cave.
I'll stop Uncle Bo.

1099
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:03,708
Okay.

1100
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,583
What now, Sak?

1101
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:21,166
You go help Jai.
I'll help Jai's dad in the cave.

1102
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,125
-You're going alone?
-Yes.

1103
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,791
He's right to go alone.

1104
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:26,666
He needs to rescue someone.

1105
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:28,833
You're not thinking straight!

1106
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,583
What if the person he rescues gets hurt?

1107
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:34,125
Someone needs to be there and help.

1108
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,375
He's right to go alone!

1109
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:36,375
There must be two people!

1110
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,791
It will take up too much space.

1111
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:41,916
How much space can it take?
Pick someone thin.

1112
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,708
-Who?
-You find him!

1113
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,208
What the hell are you looking at?

1114
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:57,916
I shouldn't have said
that you needed someone thin.

1115
01:15:58,041 --> 01:16:01,125
Come on. I'm glad you're with me.

1116
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,291
But I'm not really glad.

1117
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,708
-Uncle Bo, don't!
-Jai!

1118
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,000
Let go of that. Give it to me!

1119
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:15,250
-Let go!
-You let go!

1120
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:19,333
Jai, let go!

1121
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:23,125
-Jai!
-Uncle!

1122
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,875
Where are you?

1123
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,250
I'm outside, Sak!

1124
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,083
You go ahead!

1125
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:16,500
Jai! Quick! Stop the bomb!

1126
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,291
I can't stop it! He already set it off.

1127
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:22,708
Shit!

1128
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,916
Sakkarin, are you in the cave?

1129
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:29,166
Sakkarin!

1130
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,500
He must be.

1131
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,708
Why does that sound so close?

1132
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:48,041
Oh, my God.
Is there no other way to stop the bomb?

1133
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:52,666
Yes, there is.
Usually, they set a bombing route.

1134
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:56,333
Two to three bombs per zone,
and they'll set a timer.

1135
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:57,875
When you press the button,

1136
01:17:57,958 --> 01:18:01,333
the bombs will detonate
from the inside to the outside.

1137
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:04,416
But the outside already blew up!

1138
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,833
Really? Then something is wrong.

1139
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,250
What do we do now?

1140
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,666
There are two more ways.

1141
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:15,000
First, we need to find the second remote.

1142
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,750
Where is the second remote?

1143
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,916
Where is it?

1144
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,916
-Think! Where is the second remote?
-Where?

1145
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,416
You need to ask Mee.

1146
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,250
What? Would he give it to us?

1147
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:30,041
Yeah. What's the other way?

1148
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:31,125
Is there another way?

1149
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:35,500
You just said so.
Is there anyone else working here?

1150
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,916
Another way.

1151
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:38,833
There!

1152
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:39,958
Turn that off.

1153
01:18:46,416 --> 01:18:47,916
-What's up, Jai?
-Dad!

1154
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,750
They're going to kill you!

1155
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:51,125
Sakkarin is going there now!

1156
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:53,500
-You need to get out! There's a bomb!
-What?

1157
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:03,500
Here's the breaker.
If we can turn that off,

1158
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,500
it will cut all the electricity
inside the cave.

1159
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,458
Then the bomb won't detonate.

1160
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,416
-Do you have a ladder?
-I did before.

1161
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,750
-What about now?
-It's right there.

1162
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,541
But don't worry.

1163
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:18,583
We have a hydraulic system here.

1164
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:22,333
Just press this, and it'll come down.

1165
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,958
Why is it not coming down?

1166
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:27,875
Must be broken.

1167
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:31,208
What a waste of time. Get on my back!

1168
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:42,083
Dad, run!

1169
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,291
Where are we going?

1170
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,708
We'll go find Mee.

1171
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,833
We need another remote to stop the bomb.

1172
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,541
-Wait.
-What?

1173
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:54,875
How are we getting there?

1174
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:02,625
Here.

1175
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,458
What the hell are you doing? Get on!

1176
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,291
Let's go!

1177
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,583
Higher!

1178
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,625
I can't reach it, Dad.

1179
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:27,250
Higher!

1180
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,250
I can't push any higher!

1181
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,833
I can't reach it! Almost there!

1182
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,708
Step on my head!

1183
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:36,791
Are you sure?

1184
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,083
You already stepped on it, you asshole.

1185
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,875
Stay still, Dad! You keep moving!

1186
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:46,416
Higher!

1187
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,250
I'm already standing on tiptoes!

1188
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:57,208
There are four! Which one?

1189
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,166
The right one.

1190
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,958
Not that. It's the left one.

1191
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:02,625
Son of a bitch! Just say, "The left one!"

1192
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:06,791
It's not coming down.

1193
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,083
Try the other one!

1194
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,750
Which way is it?

1195
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,166
I hope this is the right way.

1196
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,958
Bo, did you press the button?

1197
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:11,916
I did.

1198
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,666
But they tried to stop me.
Right now they're trying--

1199
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,125
Bo?

1200
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,833
Hi, police, where are you now?

1201
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,625
Jai?

1202
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:35,916
Did you see Sakkarin?

1203
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Found him!

1204
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:38,500
Which way?

1205
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:42,750
Take a right. That's zone B, a shortcut.

1206
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:43,750
Okay.

1207
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:45,791
They're going to zone B.

1208
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,833
What? Don't go to zone B.

1209
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,375
Don't go to zone B!

1210
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,875
Don't go to zone B! Tell them!

1211
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,541
Don't go to zone B!

1212
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:54,916
It's a dead end!

1213
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,375
Sakkarin, do you hear me? It's a dead end!

1214
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,458
Go!

1215
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:01,083
DANGER
LANDSLIDE

1216
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
The bomb!

1217
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,291
Dad, it's broken!

1218
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:51,791
Sakkarin!

1219
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:54,250
What's wrong? Sakkarin!

1220
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,750
Sakkarin!

1221
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:57,291
Sak!

1222
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,875
Sak! Are you still there?

1223
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,625
Say something. You stupid son!

1224
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,916
DAD

1225
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:17,125
I'm still here, Mom.

1226
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:23,000
Jai, wait for me.
I'm driving your dad back to you.

1227
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,291
-There they are!
-Yeah.

1228
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:31,583
I see them!

1229
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:37,958
Shit!

1230
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:39,333
Why did you stop?

1231
01:24:39,416 --> 01:24:41,083
Stop, my ass! We're out of gas!

1232
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,416
So what now?

1233
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,791
It's okay. We can go on.

1234
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:46,875
Go, quick. Hold on tight!

1235
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,208
Holding on tight!

1236
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,916
They won't get away.

1237
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,166
Where are you going?

1238
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:03,416
Sakkarin! What's wrong?

1239
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,083
Sakkarin!

1240
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:06,750
Sakkarin!

1241
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:45,541
Come here.

1242
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:51,750
We both can't get out.

1243
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:54,958
You get out and leave me here.

1244
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,208
Go on.

1245
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:02,083
Don't waste your time.

1246
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,583
No!

1247
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:06,166
Go!

1248
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:15,000
I want you to tell Jai

1249
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:20,166
that I'm so proud of her.

1250
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,375
I'm so glad

1251
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:27,833
to have a daughter like her.

1252
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,125
I wanted her to be a good student,

1253
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:38,416
and she was.

1254
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:42,875
I wanted her to have a good job,

1255
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,916
and she got a position at a bank.

1256
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:51,500
I always tell everyone

1257
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,000
how lucky I am

1258
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,875
to have her as a daughter.

1259
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,875
But I've never told her that in person.

1260
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:06,416
I guess I've lost my chance now.

1261
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:10,708
No.

1262
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:15,291
Both of us can still get out.
We can do it.

1263
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,416
That's impossible!

1264
01:27:24,041 --> 01:27:25,333
Listen to me.

1265
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:27,833
It's impossible!

1266
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:31,750
Dad! Dad, don't do this. Dad!

1267
01:27:32,416 --> 01:27:35,125
You must get out, Dad. I don't want this.

1268
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:45,583
No.

1269
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:49,625
You have to trust me on this.

1270
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:05,166
Stop!

1271
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:06,833
Stop now!

1272
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,208
Where are you going?

1273
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:12,208
I told you to stop!

1274
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:13,291
Stop!

1275
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,500
Stop!

1276
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:19,333
A little bit more, Dad.

1277
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,208
Where are you going?

1278
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:24,833
-Let me go!
-Dude, stop the bomb now!

1279
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:45,833
We did it!

1280
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:55,208
What's that?

1281
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,208
Probably the coil.

1282
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:14,208
Sak!

1283
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:17,416
Sak!

1284
01:29:58,541 --> 01:30:00,833
She doesn't want
to be controlled by her dad,

1285
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:05,166
so she lied about dating me,

1286
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:07,458
and so he wants to meet our family.

1287
01:30:07,666 --> 01:30:09,916
I'd like to make her happy

1288
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,250
in the same way that she makes me happy.

1289
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:15,000
It's too much.

1290
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,250
Where are you going, Sak?

1291
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,541
I'm going to help them!

1292
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,791
Wait for me.
I'm driving your dad back to you.

1293
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,416
There!

1294
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:40,958
Sak!

1295
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,291
The police arrested a suspect today,

1296
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:28,583
an entrepreneur,

1297
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:32,458
charging him with the attempted murder
of the owner of the mine.

1298
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:35,416
They think the motive
is connected to the land's royalties.

1299
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:56,833
Do you want to talk?

1300
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:01,708
I'm not the one who wants to talk.

1301
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:14,375
Dad, you're always so strict.

1302
01:32:15,125 --> 01:32:16,958
That's why I'm always afraid of you.

1303
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:19,708
I never had the courage
to be direct with you.

1304
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,583
Your mustache alone scares me.

1305
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:27,083
Ever since I was little,

1306
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:30,250
I always did what you told me to.

1307
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:33,166
I studied accounting
because you wanted me to.

1308
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,541
I worked in a bank
because you wanted me to.

1309
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:38,750
You have no idea

1310
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,291
what I had to go through each day.

1311
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:45,500
I had to sit on this one chair,
right under the AC.

1312
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:50,958
I had to tolerate all kinds of customers,
get scolded for every little thing.

1313
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:53,208
I got yelled at for small mistakes.

1314
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:57,666
And then the boss came
and yelled at me some more.

1315
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:04,375
You said you choose everything
for my happiness,

1316
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,750
but it is your happiness.

1317
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,958
I'm not happy
with the things you choose for me.

1318
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,000
I didn't want a dad like this.

1319
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:19,458
So strict. So controlling.

1320
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:27,000
I wanted to run away from you.

1321
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:32,083
But not anymore.

1322
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:39,416
When I saw that bomb go off...

1323
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,833
I only thought about one thing...

1324
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:51,166
I wanted you to come back and be with me.

1325
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:55,416
You can scold me whenever you want.

1326
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:02,708
I know now

1327
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:05,041
that you love me

1328
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:07,875
because...

1329
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,041
I love you very much, too.

1330
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,958
Is that all?

1331
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:30,500
Dad!

1332
01:34:46,916 --> 01:34:48,291
I love you, Jai.

1333
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:50,708
I know.

1334
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:28,541
I'm going now.

1335
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:29,875
Going where?

1336
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,500
Anywhere! I'm an adult.

1337
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:45,916
So...

1338
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:47,583
Yeah.

1339
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:50,666
I know now

1340
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,708
that what you said about her

1341
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:56,333
was not exaggerated at all.

1342
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:02,666
Take good care of her.

1343
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:06,833
But she doesn't like me.

1344
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:08,333
Of course, she does.

1345
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:10,291
I'm her dad.

1346
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:11,750
I can tell.

1347
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:14,791
If you don't believe me,

1348
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:17,375
go ask her yourself.

1349
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,458
What's wrong?

1350
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:38,916
Well...

1351
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,333
I have a question.

1352
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:46,375
Okay.

1353
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,708
So...

1354
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:53,583
What is this between us?

1355
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:57,166
Attention, passengers boarding the train

1356
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,541
from Kanchanaburi to Bangkok...

1357
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,208
Let me say goodbye to my dad.

1358
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:06,166
...train number 486,
please wait on platform 7.

1359
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:12,833
Sak, you're not coming?

1360
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:16,666
We're leaving. Come on.

1361
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:17,708
Okay.

1362
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,875
-Quick, we're leaving.
-Okay.

1363
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,125
Here.

1364
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,833
-Hey.
-Yes?

1365
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:38,500
You raised him well.

1366
01:37:42,375 --> 01:37:43,791
It's very good

1367
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:46,458
that you raised him this way.

1368
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,000
Thank you for that.

1369
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:53,708
Sure.

1370
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:13,333
Hello, Thep.

1371
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:19,291
I'm sorry.

1372
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:26,958
I can't take my daughter to meet your son.

1373
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,666
Look...

1374
01:38:30,375 --> 01:38:32,208
My daughter already has a boyfriend.

1375
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,750
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1376
01:38:37,666 --> 01:38:39,000
Talk later.

1377
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,416
-What are you smiling about?
-Nothing.

1378
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:00,750
The train is here.

1379
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:02,166
Let's go.

1380
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:07,791
Attention, passengers
boarding the train from Kanchanaburi...

1381
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,750
-Good luck, kiddo.
-Bye, Dad.

1382
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:11,166
Please have your tickets ready...

1383
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,375
Go.

1384
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:14,875
Please board and find your seat.

1385
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:23,541
The train is currently leaving the station

1386
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,541
from Kanchanaburi to Bangkok.

1387
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:27,958
Passengers, please remain seated
while the train is moving.

1388
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:28,958
I'll be right back.

1389
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:30,375
Where are you going? We're leaving now.

1390
01:39:30,458 --> 01:39:31,833
I must do this.

1391
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:46,125
When did you get so brave?

1392
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:51,958
Attention, the train
will be delayed for five minutes.

1393
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,583
Don't tell me.

1394
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,625
Delayed quite often, huh?

1395
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:05,875
One slap each, now we're friends.

1396
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,750
Delayed by five minutes.

1397
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:10,875
Come visit me sometimes.

1398
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:12,000
Sure.

1399
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:14,166
Don't jump. It's dangerous.

1400
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Honey.

1401
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:20,500
Ae.

1402
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,083
How did you get here?

1403
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:26,625
It doesn't matter.

1404
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:31,500
I know now that I can't live without you.

1405
01:40:33,916 --> 01:40:35,833
I remember how we used to be.

1406
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,625
I can't live without you.

1407
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:43,125
Give me another chance.
Let's get back together.

1408
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:44,291
No!

1409
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,666
Ae, listen.

1410
01:40:47,333 --> 01:40:49,916
We're over.

1411
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,666
No, not over! Listen to me.

1412
01:40:53,916 --> 01:40:55,458
I have a new boyfriend.

1413
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:57,041
Bullshit!

1414
01:40:57,125 --> 01:40:58,250
Lies!

1415
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,083
Who is it?

1416
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,125
He's right here.

1417
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:05,166
It's Sakkarin.

1418
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:07,375
I don't believe you.

1419
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:10,583
I don't buy your fake boyfriend story.

1420
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:13,791
He's not a fake boyfriend. Watch this.

1421
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:33,875
I want to kick his stupid tongue.

1422
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:39,000
You really think
I'll believe you because of that?

1423
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:42,166
We did more than that!

1424
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:44,083
Let me show you.

1425
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,958
Don't!

1426
01:41:57,166 --> 01:41:58,166
Is he dead?

1427
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:03,916
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

1428
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,166
Jai!

1429
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:09,708
Jai!

1430
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:26,666
What?

1431
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:27,875
What was that?

1432
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:30,250
What was what?

1433
01:42:31,291 --> 01:42:32,750
What you did.

1434
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,833
That is it.

1435
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:37,541
That is what?

1436
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:41,958
Go figure it out.

1437
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,666
I don't want to figure it out.
I want to hear it.

1438
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:50,000
Are we...

1439
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,500
together now?

1440
01:43:04,625 --> 01:43:06,458
Yes. I think so.
