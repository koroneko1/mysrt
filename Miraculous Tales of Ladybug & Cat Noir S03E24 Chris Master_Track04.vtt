‎Come on! Look at these.
‎Don't you want to play with them?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.260
‎Dolls? I hate dolls! I hate toys!
‎They're for babies!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.060
‎Yes, but you're too young to play
‎Grim Monster Clash ‎Three‎!

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.300
‎No, I'm not! And I'm not scared
‎of monsters any more, you know! I'm--

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.540
‎A big kid. Yes, I know.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.940
‎Why don't we watch a cartoon instead?
‎I have<i>‎ Patati and Patato</i>‎ if you want!

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.780
‎That show's for babies! I'm a big boy!

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.100
‎Uh...

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.740
‎We could play with your snow globe?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.580
‎Ew!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.860
‎-Hey, what's that?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100
‎That? Oh, uh... It's nothing!

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.060
‎Hey! No fair.
‎Come on! What are all those gifts?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.220
‎Uh, look...

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.820
<i>‎I can't say they're the gifts I've made</i>
<i>‎for Adrien's next 35 birthdays,</i>

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.420
<i>‎'cause you'd tell Nino,</i>
<i>‎and he'd tell Adrien,</i>

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
<i>‎and Adrien would think I'm totally crazy!</i>

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.260
<i>‎Wait. Maybe I am.</i>

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.980
‎Hmm. I can't tell you I'm one
‎of Santa Claus' elves on a secret mission

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.620
‎and that I'm looking after
‎one of his boxes of gifts.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.220
‎You wouldn't be interested,
‎because gifts are for babies, right?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.260
‎And you're a big kid.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
‎-That's a lie!
‎-What? That you're a big kid?

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.580
‎No! That you're one of Santa Claus' elves!

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.940
‎I can't say anything more!

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.300
‎Hey, wait! That means you can
‎give me my Christmas present early!

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.940
‎Grobotek Ultima Destruktor! It's easy.
‎It's gotta be the biggest one in the box!

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.060
‎Now, wait a minute.
‎I thought toys were for babies!

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.940
‎They are, most of the time.
‎But Grobotek's different.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.580
‎You don't say! Well, I'm sorry,
‎but Christmas rules are very strict.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.100
‎You don't open gifts early.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.100
‎Santa gives them at Christmas,
‎not at Easter or Halloween.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.020
‎Otherwise, you might as well have a bunny
‎or a witch delivering your presents!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.140
‎But, since you know him,
‎you could ask him.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.980
‎Can't you just call him on the phone
‎or send him an email?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.940
‎Oh, no! You never disturb Santa Claus,
‎except at Christmas.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.580
‎The rest of the year,
‎he's in the North Pole!

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.100
‎Devi... uh...
‎supervising the production of toys.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.940
‎Besides, your present isn't here.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.220
‎Elves don't watch over
‎gifts for kids we know.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.980
‎One of the other elves must have it.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.660
‎Only Santa'd know where to find it,
‎because he knows who's getting what.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.660
‎He has the list of good children!

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.420
‎There is one exception
‎to the Christmas rule!

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.740
‎-Really? What is it? What is it?
‎-Santa is allowed to make one exception,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.540
‎but only for the best behaved kid
‎in the whole world.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.980
‎Who's the best behaved kid in the world?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.300
‎Hmm. Maybe... Ladybug?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.140
‎Well, seeing as she's saved Paris
‎a gazillion times, that makes sense.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.700
‎Or a kid, for example,
‎who cleans up all the mess he's made

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.060
‎and plays quietly with toys
‎that are for kids his age.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.140
‎-We're back!
‎-Did you guys have fun?

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.100
‎-Sure we did! How was the movie?
‎-Awesome!

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180
‎Thanks for watching my bro, Marinette.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.860
‎What's wrong, little dude?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.980
‎I want it to be Christmas right now!

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.900
‎I have absolutely no idea
‎where that came from.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.060
‎OK, I guess we'd better get going.
‎Bye, girl.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.820
‎-See you at school tomorrow!
‎-Yeah. Bye, Nino! See you soon, Chris!

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.740
‎-An elf on a secret mission?

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.820
‎Seriously! Don't you think
‎you went too far this time?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.380
‎I know, Tikki, it was pure ridiculousness,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.620
‎but I couldn't tell him the truth!

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.820
‎Besides,
‎I simply told Chris a nice little story,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.340
‎which, hopefully,
‎will teach him some patience!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.740
‎Speaking of which,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.260
‎I've an idea of what I can give Adrien
‎for his 50th birthday!

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.260
‎Give me a hand?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.860
‎Mmm-hmm.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.460
‎What? Snow?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.020
‎Whoa! How long was I asleep?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.140
‎Aaah!

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.940
‎It's over, Santa Claus! You're surrounded!
‎Surrender and don't put up a fight!

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.420
‎-Searching for Santa Claus, far and wide!
‎-Searching for Santa Claus, far and wide!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.660
‎-There's no way he can hide!
‎-Get back on the sidewalks!

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.740
‎-Running in the road is forbidden!
‎-Santa Claus! Have you seen Santa Claus?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.820
‎OK! It's all just a dream.
‎I'm going back to bed.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.060
‎Ow! Why did you do that, Tikki?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.500
‎-See? You're not dreaming!
‎-Well, if I'm not, it means...

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.020
‎This does look like a nightmare.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.380
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.340
‎Ha!

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.180
‎Santa Claus? Have you seen Santa Claus?

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.380
‎Santa Claus? But it's not Christmas yet!

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.220
<i>‎Nadja Chamack here.</i>
<i>‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news.</i>

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.020
<i>‎Paris has been literally invaded</i>
<i>‎by giant toys looking for Santa Claus.</i>

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.300
<i>‎Major Teddisky here! Santa Claus,</i>
<i>‎all your toys now belong to us!</i>

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.660
<i>‎If you don't give yourself up real quick,</i>
<i>‎this little city of Paris</i>

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.820
<i>‎will go kaboom lickety split!</i>

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.700
‎What's going on?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.540
‎-You'll never guess what I just found.
‎-Actually, I think I know, Milady.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.700
‎I'm with Santa. We're at the ice rink.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.100
‎I'll meet you there!

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.700
‎I can't believe it.
‎Are you really Santa Claus?

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.020
‎No. I'm the Easter Bunny in disguise. You
‎can't see my long ears because of the hat.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.620
‎Of course I'm Santa Claus!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.380
‎Oh! OK! I need you to know
‎I've been a really good boy.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.820
‎I smell a wood fire and cinnamon cookies!
‎Santa Claus must be nearby!

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.740
‎Soldiers! Get in line!

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.980
‎At your command, Colonel Woof Woof!

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.020
‎Follow me! This way!

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.700
‎Searching for Santa Claus, far and wide!

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.620
‎To Luna, Maya and Talia.
‎When I tell my daughters I met you,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.420
‎they're going to freak out!

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.420
‎Santa Claus? I'm so glad you're all right!

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.060
‎But what are you doing here?
‎It's not Christmas yet.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.140
‎I've no idea!

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.500
‎I was busy supervising the production
‎of toys for next Christmas with my elves,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.500
‎when all of a sudden... Bang!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.180
‎I woke up in my sleigh, in the Paris sky.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.020
‎Flying catfishes destroyed my sleigh.
‎My reindeer were able to get away,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.300
‎but if it hadn't been for Cat Noir,
‎they would have captured me!

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.980
‎Don't you think this whole thing
‎is kind of strange?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.660
‎Stranger than fighting a Pharaoh's
‎reincarnation or a Pigeon Overlord

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.540
‎empowered by magical butterflies,
‎you mean?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.940
‎Aha! Gotcha!

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.860
‎My sense of smell has sniffed you out,
‎Santa!

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.020
‎-Follow me and do not show resistance!
‎-Stay back, Santa!

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.660
‎Chris Master demands his gift!

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.780
‎-Chris Master?
‎-Christmas gifts must be deserved,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.700
‎and they're only given at Christmas!

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.060
‎If you think I'll bend the rules,
‎you're barking up the wrong tree!

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.260
‎Now hold on a minute!
‎There's no use in fighting.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.180
‎That's not the Christmas spirit.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.820
‎-Hmm?
‎-Would it be such a big deal

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.660
‎if you gave the presents early,
‎just this once?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.420
‎Listen to the smart man!

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.740
‎While we're at it,
‎I asked for super blades

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.140
‎and I could really use them
‎for my competition.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.060
‎-I kinda like this idea! I asked for--
‎-Stop! That's not the way it works.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.940
‎Aw! Why not?

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.380
‎Christmas rules are very strict.
‎You don't open gifts early!

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.020
‎I give them at Christmas,
‎not at Easter or Halloween.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.380
‎Otherwise you might as well have a bunny
‎or a witch delivering your presents!

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.220
‎Oh, no! What have I done?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.180
‎-Couldn't you...
‎-Make an exception?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.020
‎Tradition is tradition.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.460
‎If we stop respecting it,
‎then it's the end of Christmas.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.620
‎Aw...

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.980
‎Well, there is one case in which
‎I could make an exception, for...

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.100
‎The best behaved kid in the whole world.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.740
‎The one at the top of your list
‎of good children.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.780
‎Bravo, Ladybug! At last,
‎someone who knows the rules of Christmas!

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.540
‎But I doubt your Chris Master is
‎the best behaved kid in the whole world!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.460
‎In that case... Soldiers, attack!

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.860
‎-Attack!

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.780
‎Why so much hatred?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.940
‎Whoa!

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.300
‎Ladybug, Cat Noir! Protect Santa!
‎I can take care of these toys!

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.460
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha! Triple axel!

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.700
‎And a pike spin into a double toe loop!
‎Not so high and mighty now, are we?

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.220
‎Ow! Those are some sharp teeth for a toy!
‎Get me out of here!

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.060
‎I think I know who the toys' master is.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.140
‎-Who is he?
‎-I just have to check first, to be sure.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.300
‎May I, Santa?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.420
‎Mmm! That smell of a wood fire and
‎cinnamon cookies... it's so Christmassy!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.580
‎-You're up, Santa Cat!
‎-This way!

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.260
‎I smell Santa Claus' scent!

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.540
‎Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas everyone!

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.820
‎There he is! I can smell him!
‎He's not far, follow me!

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.300
‎Come on, Santa.
‎I know where to find Chris Master!

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.780
‎Chris! Chris! Chris!

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.420
‎Ladybug! My little bro, Chris, he was
‎in his bedroom and then he disappeared!

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.420
‎-Santa Claus?
‎-Ho, ho! Hello, Nino!

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.340
‎Nino, I think Chris has been akumatised.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.820
‎-Notice anything different about his room?
‎-His ‎favourite ‎toys have gone missing too!

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.340
‎-Plastic soldiers? A catfish?
‎-Yes! Plus his dinosaur.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.500
‎So he is the toys' master! But he could
‎be anywhere! How are we going to find him?

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.500
‎Please save the little dude, Ladybug!

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.340
‎Lucky charm!

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.020
‎Stationery?

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.140
‎You make surprise gifts appear?
‎Are you competing with me, Ladybug?

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.100
‎Of course! You're right! A surprise gift!

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.420
‎Could I have my Christmas present
‎right now, Santa? Please!

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.180
‎-You know that I can't do that, Ladybug.
‎-Except...

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.620
‎For the best behaved kid
‎in the whole world! But...

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.460
‎It's certainly worth a try!

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.100
‎Unbelievable!

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.460
‎Ladybug, you<i>‎ are</i>‎ the best behaved kid
‎in the whole world!

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.380
‎Seeing as she's saved Paris a gazillion
‎times, that totally makes sense!

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.900
‎"Dear Santa, I want the same gift
‎as Chris Lahiffe, whatever it is."

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.900
‎Are you sure about this?

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.180
‎You know this is the only gift
‎you'll get this whole year from me!

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.700
‎Yes, I know. But I'm doing it
‎to save Paris and Nino's little brother.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.060
‎Ah, you really do deserve to be
‎at the top of my list!

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.300
‎-Merry Christmas!
‎-Thank you, Santa.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.580
‎Now get to safety. I'll take it from here.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.100
‎By the way, Santa,
‎where do I fall on the list?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.140
<i>‎Chris Master!</i>
<i>‎I've got your Christmas present!</i>

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.940
<i>‎Come and get it if you want it!</i>

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.820
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ah!

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.380
‎Wow! Awesome! Grobotek Ultima Destruktor!

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.140
‎Mission accomplished, Chris Master!
‎We have captured Santa Claus!

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.340
‎He tried to trick us by dressing up
‎as Cat Noir, but he couldn't fool us!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.420
‎You<i>‎ were</i>‎ tricked!
‎That's Cat Noir dressed up as Santa Claus,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.740
‎not the other way around!

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.100
‎You're such babies! Keep searching!

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.100
‎It doesn't matter, Chris Master!
‎You don't need Santa Claus any more,

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.980
‎now that you have your present.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.380
‎I, on the other hand,
‎haven't yet received mine.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.700
‎Take Cat Noir's Miraculous,
‎then all we have to do

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.620
‎is get hold of Ladybug's magic jewels!

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.820
‎Gimme your paw, kitty cat!
‎Hawk Moth wants your ring.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.540
‎It's a stupid, dumb-dumb
‎Christmas gift, but that's his problem!

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.580
‎Ladybug?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.820
‎Christmas presents are delivered
‎on Christmas Eve,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.140
‎and only to the good kids, Chris Master!

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.420
‎I hate to say you and Hawk Moth
‎didn't even make Santa's list!

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.700
‎That's where you're wrong, Ladybug!

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.140
‎You've just brought me my second gift,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.340
‎which only goes to show what a good
‎Hawk Moth I have been this year!

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.700
‎Use the powers I gave you, Chris Master,
‎and seize their Miraculous!

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.460
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha! I have my secret weapons
‎to fight you with. Yourselves!

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.220
‎Have fun, dumb-dumbs!

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.420
‎At least now we know for sure
‎that the akuma is in his snow globe!

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.460
‎-Then we'll have to defeat ourselves!
<i>‎-Lucky charm!</i>

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.780
<i>‎Cataclysm!</i>

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.260
<i>‎Lucky charm!</i>

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.580
<i>‎Cataclysm!</i>

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.580
‎Playtime never ends for these two!

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.940
‎Problem is, my playtime is up!

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.380
‎I don't have much time
‎before I transform back!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.580
‎Watch out!

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.220
‎Then it's time to show them
‎who the real game masters are!

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.380
‎Aaah!

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.100
‎My toys are going to destroy you!
‎You guys are such babies!

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.100
‎It's over. In a few seconds now,
‎the Miraculous will be mine.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.580
‎Christmas has come early this year.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.940
<i>‎Lucky charm!</i>

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.420
<i>‎Cataclysm!</i>

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.180
‎What about using my power to destroy them?

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.740
<i>‎Lucky charm!</i>

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.780
‎If that's our only choice! But we need
‎to save it to smash the snow globe.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.740
‎Ho, ho, ho! Paws off, you naughty toys!

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.540
‎ Santa Claus!

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.620
‎At your service, Ladybug!

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.660
‎There's no way I'm letting anything happen
‎to the best behaved kid in the world!

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.140
‎-I'll take care of these two!
‎-The best behaved kid in the world?

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.420
‎-That's me!
‎-Hmm.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.060
‎Argh! No fair! My toys!

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.620
‎Come on, Chris, give me that snow globe.
‎You've got your Christmas gift.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.020
‎If you don't want me to take away
‎your present, Chris Master,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.940
‎remember that you're supposed to bring me
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.660
‎No! Stop!

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.580
‎Oh, no!

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:26.140
‎Destroy them, Grobotek Ultima Destruktor!

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.020
‎Aaah!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.300
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Nobody can beat
‎Grobotek Ultima Destruktor!

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.660
‎I can take it down.
‎Nothing can resist my Cataclysm!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.860
‎I know, but I'll need it fully functional.
‎Follow my lead.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.100
‎Hey! Grobothing!
‎You want my Miraculous? Come and get it!

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.700
‎Over to you, Cat Noir!

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.300
‎Stop, Grobotek!

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.180
‎Cataclysm!

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.140
‎No! Not my toy!

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.340
‎You have a choice,
‎your toy or the snow globe!

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.420
‎No! Don't do that!

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.740
‎Ho, ho, ho! Listen to Ladybug, kid.
‎You won't regret it!

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.100
‎No!

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.140
‎Thank you, Chris Master.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.780
‎No more evil-doing for you.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.380
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.780
‎Gotcha!

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.220
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.940
‎Huh?

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.460
‎Pound it!

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.260
‎-Goodbye, my friends.
‎-Hmm?

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.020
‎Goodbye, Santa Claus!

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.860
‎Goodbye? Why?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.420
‎Santa was brought here
‎by Chris Master's power.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.740
‎-So when everything's repaired...
‎-I'll be gone, till next Christmas!

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.540
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.580
‎Huh? Ah!

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:38.420
‎-So, big kid, feeling better?
‎-Yeah. But I don't remember much.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.260
‎-Don't worry. Everything's fine!
‎-Come on, big boy!

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.140
‎Cat Noir,
‎could you take Chris home, please?

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.900
‎Sure thing.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.460
‎Goodbye, Ladybug!

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.540
‎You stole my Christmas presents, Ladybug,
‎but my birthday's coming soon,

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.940
‎and trust me, I'll make sure
‎it's a day you'll never forget!

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.260
‎-Thanks for looking after the little dude.
‎-Have fun!

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.540
‎Sure will. It'll be awesome.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.540
‎We're really good buddies.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.460
‎I know I shouldn't have told you
‎I was an elf,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.940
‎-but you were acting like...
‎-A baby. I know.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.380
‎Mommy says lying is wrong.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.420
‎So from now on, we'll always
‎tell each other the truth, OK?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.660
‎OK, as long as you stop
‎trying to act all grown-up!

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.660
‎You're not an elf,
‎but you still have another secret, right?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.100
‎Another secret? What... what do you mean?
‎Like a secret identity?

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.900
‎No! the secret in that chest!

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.020
‎OK, the truth.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.860
‎-There is this guy I have a crush on.
‎-Eew! No! Stop! I hate romantic stuff!

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.260
‎Gross!

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.420
‎Oh, I am so in love!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.860
‎I dream about holding his hand
‎and looking at the stars together!
