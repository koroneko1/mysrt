<i>‎Hey, buddies! As you know,</i>

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.500
<i>‎Friendship Day is officially here!</i>

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.300
<i>‎Today, hundreds of amazing new friendships</i>

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.500

<i>‎picked at random,</i>

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.540
<i>‎will go on an exciting adventure</i>

<i>‎searching for a hidden celebrity!</i>

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.980
<i>‎Our celebrity is none other</i>

<i>‎than the Muse of Gabriel brand,</i>
<i>‎the one and only Adrien Agreste!</i>

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.580
<i>‎-Hello!</i>
‎-Hello!

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.700
‎Oh, no! What if they didn't get
‎my sign-up text, like last year?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.740
‎What if I don't get to take part
‎in the game?

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.060
‎Not gonna happen!

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.420
‎Because, last year,
‎you didn't have your amazing BFF

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.700
‎to make sure everything was gonna be fine!

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.500
‎ Thanks, Alya!

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.420
‎Here we go. It's starting!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.620
<i>‎Let me recap the rules</i>
<i>‎for our buddies here.</i>

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.540
<i>‎When Adrien pushes this button,</i>

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.220
<i>‎thousands of texts messages will be</i>
<i>‎simultaneously sent all across Paris!</i>

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.980
<i>‎In the message,</i>
<i>‎you'll find a riddle to solve,</i>

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.380
<i>‎which will lead you to your new friend.</i>

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.420
<i>‎Then,</i>
<i>‎you'll attempt to solve more riddles,</i>

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.460
<i>‎which will lead you straight to Adrien!</i>

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.580
<i>‎Here, in this super-secret location,</i>
<i>‎where I'll wait for the lucky winners!</i>

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.500
<i>‎-Ready?</i>
‎- T‎hree, two...

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.580
‎One... go!

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.660
‎"I'm the highest heart of the city."

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.940
‎The Sacré-Coeur, of course!
‎Good luck, girls!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620
‎"Where animals live nearby dinosaurs."

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
‎Oh! The zoo at the Jardin des Plantes,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.860
‎near the Palaeontology museum!
‎Oh, this so much fun!

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.140
‎"Once home of Royalty, now home of Art."

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.580
‎The Louvre museum! Aha! Victory!

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.860
‎I'm so not...

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.820
‎"With one turn of a handle,
‎I can raise the level."

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.420
‎What evil mind came up with this one?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.060
‎It's no use, Mother.
‎I am not worthy of fighting against you.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.620
‎Remember the story of the female
‎samurai warrior, Tomoe Gozen.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.460
‎In a time when women warriors
‎were rarely accepted,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.940
‎do you think she gave up?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.660
‎Perching on her steed,
‎wielding her naginata,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.380
‎she fought her way to recognition.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.500
‎As elusive as the wind,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.980
‎-as powerful as the flood...

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.900
‎ ‎as swift as lightning.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.060
‎What was that?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.340
‎<i>‎ Congratulations!</i>

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.460
<i>‎You've just received the first riddle!</i>

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.980
‎It's a game.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.100
‎That you signed up for
‎without my permission?

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.780
‎No, Mother. This must be a mistake.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.620
‎Tatsu, door.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.300
<i>‎Welcome, Ms Tsurugi.</i>

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.900
‎You know, Mother, Adrien Agreste
‎is participating in this... game.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.380
‎Gabriel Agreste
‎has many admirable qualities,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.660
‎but this only proves even he is flawed

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.220
‎by being too permissive with his son.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.700
‎In some ways, he is more blind than I am.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.420
‎Tatsu, to the Grand Palais.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.460
<i>‎Very well, Ms Tsurugi.</i>

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.540
‎Thank you so much for your participation.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.980
‎Now all we need to do is wait
‎for the first new couple of friends!

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.740
‎Tatsu, take Kagami back to our home.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.220
‎I will return in two hours.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.660
‎All right. Two hours. Let's play.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.580
‎ <i>‎Congratulations!</i>

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.060
<i>‎You've just received the first riddle!</i>

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.380
‎"One turn of a handle,
‎I can raise the level."

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.340
‎ ‎Child's play.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.380
‎Tatsu, take me to Canal Saint-Martin!

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.020
<i>‎Voice recognition failed.</i>

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.220
<i>‎-</i><i>‎ </i><i>‎Tatsu!</i>
‎-Take me to Canal Saint-Martin!

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.700
<i>‎Very well, Ms Tsurugi.</i>

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.820
‎Here we are! "With one turn of a handle,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.020
‎I can raise the level." Ta-dah!

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.300
‎It's Canal Saint-Martin.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.820
‎The water rises when the locks
‎are opened with a handle!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.260
‎-Very clever, Marinette!
‎-Now let's keep our eyes peeled.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.420
‎Hopefully my new friend is here somewhere!

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.020
‎- Oh, no!
‎-What is it? A supervillain?

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.460
‎Worse, Tikki! Kagami? My new friend?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.700
‎No way! She's brilliant, strong, cute...

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.820
‎-And?
‎-And she's got a huge crush on Adrien!

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.140
‎They fence together.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.060
‎Their parents are friends.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.660
‎If we win, she'll get the credit

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.060
‎and she'll wind up being his girlfriend!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.460
‎There's no way I'm doing this with her!

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.220
‎Nope. Nu-uh! Not doing it. Uh-uh!

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.980
‎ ‎She's so weird.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.500
‎OK. Fate has placed her in my path.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.700
‎I have to succeed.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.580
‎If I fail with Adrien's quirky friend,
‎I'll never pull it off.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.580
‎This isn't fair to Kagami.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.980
‎If you won't be her friend,
‎she can't play.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.940
‎Yeah, right! She's so smart,
‎she'd figure a way around it.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.580
‎Probably do it twice as fast by herself!

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.580
‎I bet I'd just slow her down if I went.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.900
‎Of course! You're right, Tikki!

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.180
‎If I stick with her, I can make us lose!

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.820
‎Adrien won't see Kagami win
‎and they won't fall in love!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.820
‎Uh... perhaps it would be better
‎for you not to go.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.860
‎ ‎Hide, Tikki, the game is on!

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.900
‎Kagami! Whoa! This must be fate!

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.340
‎I mean, what were the odds
‎of you and I being paired up?

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.420
‎One in ten million, at least. Right?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.540
‎So awesome!

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.500
‎You didn't look happy
‎about being my secret friend.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.340
‎I saw you turn around and walk away.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.100
‎I... I actually thought I'd,
‎um, gotten the place wrong.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.500
‎I totally hadn't seen you yet, no way!

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620
‎I'm super excited
‎to play the game with you!

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.540
‎ <i>‎Congratulations,</i>
<i>‎you've just located your game partner!</i>

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.540
<i>‎And, who knows,</i>
<i>‎maybe even a new friend for life!</i>

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.700
<i>‎You've just received the second riddle!</i>

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.100
‎"To get closer to your goal,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.860
‎you must explore further and deeper."

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.220
‎Hmm.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.020
‎I know! We have to take the train
‎at Gare du Nord station,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.260
‎leave Paris and head straight to England!

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.380
‎No. It means we have to go further down

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.220
‎the banks of the Seine, which is deeper.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.220
‎We may have to fish for our next clue.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.340
‎Come on. Let's hurry up and win!

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.020
<i>‎Hey! I sure hope your partner's</i>
<i>‎as cool as mine! Meet Wayem!</i>

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.180
<i>‎You'd better hurry up,</i>

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.740
<i>‎'cause we've already solved</i>
<i>‎our first riddle!</i>

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.260
‎I'm with Kagami. Can you believe this?

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.780
‎ <i>‎Go for the win,</i>
<i>‎'cause there's no way I'm going to let us</i>

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.940
‎find Adrien as long as I'm with her!

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.620
‎Look. We were right! We must fish out
‎the clue with this rod and magnet.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.700
‎-Here!

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.860
‎Now, fish!

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.220
‎Probably not the clue.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.980
‎Do you prefer to be called
‎by your whole name or a nickname?

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.100
‎Uh... by... my whole name?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.740
‎Thank you, Marinette!
‎Uh... Your hair is... very shiny!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.980
‎Uh... thank you?
‎Your hair is not too bad either.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.020
‎What is your blood type?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.860
‎My blood type? I don't know.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.260
‎Are you messing with me?

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.780
‎No. Everyone in Japan
‎knows their blood type.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.660
‎It tells you who you are. Mine is "O",

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.420
‎which means I'm independent, optimistic,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.580
‎strong-willed and intuitive.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.140
‎What's your favorite season?

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.180
‎Summer, 'cause it's nice and hot!

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.740
‎Or Spring... That's when Nature awakens.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.820
‎Or the Fall. The colors
‎are so gorgeous at that time of year!

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.020
‎But then again,
‎Winter inspires me so much!

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.260
‎You're indecisive, scatter-brained.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.500
‎A split personality. Typical AB.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.820
‎Say you found out
‎about some special ice-cream.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.020
‎Someone else gets there first.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.460
‎Do you A) Steal it from them?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.820
‎B) Get another type of ice-cream,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.660
‎even if it's not as good? Or C)
‎Never eat ice-cream ever again?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.100
‎Uh... I guess I'd try another flavor.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.780
‎Hmm.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.180
‎Shall we get some orange juice?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.740
‎Sure! It'd be a lot more fun
‎than this boring treasure hunt!

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.540
‎The clue. You've done a great job fishing!

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.420
‎Congratulations! First we win,
‎then we'll celebrate with orange juice!

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.180
‎-Ugh!
‎-"Trust challenge.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.580
‎Exchange unlocked phones.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.180
‎Take a selfie in front
‎of a different monuments,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.180
‎then take a selfie together,
‎like the friends you've become.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.420
‎Once we've received the selfies,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.020
‎we'll reveal
‎where Adrien Agreste is hiding."

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.020
‎You really are an indecisive girl.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.420
‎We'll meet back here. We'll win!

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.700
‎-What are you doing?
‎-Nothing.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.860
‎She placed her trust in you
‎when she gave you her phone.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.180
‎But she kept looking at it the whole time.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.500
‎Don't you want to know why?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.220
‎For all we know, she could have been
‎chatting with Adrien, texting him.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.700
‎Marinette! No!

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.500
‎ ‎Zero messages,
‎except the ones from the contest.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.380
‎And there's only one number
‎in her list of contacts. Her mom's.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.700
‎She doesn't even have Adrien's number?

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.060
‎What's this app?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.340
‎Oh, shoot!
‎So this is what Kagami was looking at

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.580
‎this whole time!

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.700
‎"30 tips for making friends."

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.380
‎That explains everything.
‎Her strange behavior,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.020
‎her weird questions.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.700
‎Kagami was just trying to be your friend!

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.660
‎I feel so bad.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.220
‎Oh, no! She's got my phone!
‎If she sneaks a peek,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.820
‎she'll see the messages
‎Alya and I sent each other.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.300
‎Do all humans really sneak
‎through other people's things?

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.300
‎You'd better run!

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.500
‎Cheese!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.460
<i>‎I can't believe you're stuck with Kagami!</i>

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.020
<i>‎Hang in there and don't worry,</i>

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.020
<i>‎I'm sure you'll figure out a way to lose!</i>

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.060
<i>‎Catch ya later. Mwah!</i>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.340
‎How tragic it is to feel unloved,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.540
‎alone, deprived of friendship.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.820
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise her!

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.100
‎I guess I am not worthy of our friendship.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.580
‎Our blood types must be too incompatible.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.580
‎-Hello?
‎-Kagami! Where are you?

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.700
‎You were supposed to wait for me at home!

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.140
‎Ah...

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.540
‎Hello, ma'am. I'm not Kagami, actually!

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.020
‎Who are you? Where is my daughter?

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.780
‎Kagami!

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.660
‎I'm a friend of Kagami's.
‎I'll put her on the phone!

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.060
‎Kagami doesn't have any friends.
‎Why do you have her phone?

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.100
‎Oh, I can assure you, ma'am,
‎I am a friend of Kagami's.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.420
‎-We're teamed up for a game.
‎-A game? But I forbade her to!

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.700
‎A game? Did I say "game"?
‎Oh, no, sorry, I meant a grab! To grab.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.860
‎I invited Kagami over
‎to grab some orange juice with me!

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.420
‎She'll be back soon.
‎I'll walk her home myself!

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.100
‎One negative emotion is disappearing,
‎but another is forming quickly.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.780
‎I can feel the anger of a mother

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.300
‎whose authority has been challenged.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.300
‎Go, my akuma, and seek out this new prey.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.300
‎Stop fooling around
‎and put my daughter through.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.860
‎I can assure you that she will
‎not be enjoying any glasses of--

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.780
‎Ikari Gozen, I am Hawk Moth.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.460
‎Ma'am, please don't punish your daughter.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.980
‎-Ma'am? Hello?
<i>‎-</i><i>‎ </i><i>‎With pleasure, Hawk Moth.</i>

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.980
‎I'm sorry. I tried to smooth things over,
‎but your mom's super angry now

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.340
‎and will be looking for you. I think
‎you should hide so she won't find you!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.820
‎Kagami!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.900
‎You disobeyed me!
‎You will never go out again!

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.420
‎ No! Mother!

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.620
‎I was completely wrong about Kagami.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.900
‎It's never too late to make things right.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.100
‎Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.100
<i>‎Akuma alert, akuma alert.</i>

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.180
<i>‎We ask all visitors to evacuate</i>
<i>‎the palace very calmly. Thank you.</i>

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.340
‎We have a new mission!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.060
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.100
‎You'll never catch me. I am Ikari Gozen.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.380
‎As elusive as the wind,
‎as powerful as the flood,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.740
‎as swift as lightning!

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.100
‎I see you've made a new buddy
‎for Friendship Day, Milady.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.420
‎Yeah. No, I don't think
‎she likes me all that much.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.180
‎-We're coming, Kagami!
‎-Kagami?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.740
‎Our new friend here has imprisoned
‎her own daughter as a punishment!

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.020
‎Lucky charm!

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.260
‎You really think it's time
‎to invite me to the cinema?

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.220
‎Sorry, kitty, only got one ticket!
‎I'll come back soon!

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.420
‎At least bring me back some popcorn!

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.300
‎Hello. I'd like to see this movie, please!

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.460
‎Excellent choice, Marinette!

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.740
‎-Master Fu?
‎-I had to find a cover

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.220
‎now that Hawk Moth knows my identity.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.180
‎Besides, I love the movies!

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.380
‎Marinette Dupain-Cheng, pick an ally

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.860
‎you can trust
‎alongside you on this mission.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.740
‎Choose wisely! Such powers
‎are meant to serve the greater good!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.420
‎As elusive as the wind,
‎as powerful as the flood,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.620
‎as swift as lightning.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.700
‎Yeah!

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.940
‎I hope you'll enjoy the show!

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.780
‎The akuma's probably in her bokken.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.100
‎In order to use my cataclysm,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.660
‎we gotta bring her guard down.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.580
‎We must be as elusive as the wind

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.980
‎or as powerful as the flood!

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.540
‎Lucky charm!

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.820
‎ ‎A box of bath bombs?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.140
‎You really think it's time to take a bath?

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.540
‎Not me.
‎Kagami is gonna use it. Get ready, kitty!

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.220
‎So, Ikari Gozen,
‎how would you like to become friends?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.700
‎-I don't need a friend!
‎-Can't say I'm surprised.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.940
‎You're going about it all wrong,
‎if you ask me!

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.060
‎Greetings, young lady,
‎and good day to you!

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.860
‎Fear not. I am Longg, the Dragon kwami.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.740
‎-You're a what?
‎-A kwa-mi.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.860
‎- ‎I hope it works!
‎- ‎The sooner the better, too!

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.580
‎Allow me to tell you
‎all about the many feats

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.100
‎that a magic being like myself
‎will help you accomplish

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.380
‎once the magic words have been spoken.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.500
‎Ladybug has hopes you will defeat
‎Ikari Gozen with panache,

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.340
‎using the element of your choosing,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.580
‎wind, water, or lightning.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.860
‎But, firstly,
‎let me tell you about her plan.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.420
‎Longg, bring the storm!

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.260
‎Wait! No! Not yet!

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.500
‎Wind dragon!

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.980
‎See, Mother? I can be as elusive as wind!

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.260
‎Thank you for the Miraculous, Ladybug.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.860
‎Nice to meet you, Cat Noir. I am Ryuuko.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.980
‎What are you doing? This wasn't the plan!

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.860
‎-What plan?
‎-<i>‎Ikari Gozen,</i>

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.860
<i>‎Ladybug has helped your daughter escape</i>

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.900
<i>‎by giving her a Miraculous.</i>

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.700
‎I don't know how she did it,
‎but I want her Miraculous too.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.340
‎Kagami, you've disobeyed me yet again!

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.620
‎And, this time, with the complicity
‎of these so-called heroes!

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.340
‎You are all going to pay!

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.180
‎Ryuuko! The plan!

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260
‎Longg must have told you about the plan!

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.020
‎No. Stay behind with Cat Noir.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.860
‎This is a personal matter,
‎between a mother and daughter!

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.020
‎ ‎Watch out!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.660
‎No!

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.740
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.260
‎What a masterful move, Ikari Gozen.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.140
‎Now, in just a few minutes,
‎Cat Noir will transform back

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.140
‎and his Miraculous will be mine!

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.340
‎I behaved hastily. I failed.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.460
‎I am not worthy to fight beside you.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.820
‎You made a mistake. As I do, every day.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.060
‎It's not a reason to give up fighting.
‎You alone can help me.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.860
‎That's why I chose you.
‎But we must work together as a team!

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.260
‎We're short on time. Here's the plan.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.260
‎Hurry up before I transform back!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.860
‎ ‎You were right, Mother.
‎I still have a lot to learn.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.500
‎You're starting to have some sense.
‎That's good.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.300
‎Hold your breath! Aim at the bokken!

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.940
‎You're a fast learner!

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.220
‎I have good teachers! Water Dragon!

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.260
‎Wow!

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.100
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.020
‎Time to de-evilise.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.140
‎Gotcha!

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.500
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.260
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.540
‎What's happened to me? Where is Kagami?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.380
‎Your daughter is nearby, ma'am.
‎She'll be here soon.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.700
‎ ‎Pound it!

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.260
‎Longg, open sky!

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.460
‎I have to tell you I won't be able
‎to give you this Miraculous again.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.060
‎ ‎I know.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.660
‎-I wasn't good enough.
‎-Quite the opposite.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.180
‎You learn fast.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.980
‎But Hawk Moth knows who you are now.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.780
‎And keeping one's true identity secret

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.060
‎is a very important rule
‎among superheroes!

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.540
‎Without it, you and everyone you love
‎would become endangered,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.780
‎-your family, your friends...
‎-I don't have many friends.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.740
‎You don't need lots of friends.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.420
‎What matters is that the ones you have
‎are true friends.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.940
‎Bug out!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.100
‎I'm sorry I wasn't truthful with you,

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.700
‎but I wanted to try and make a friend.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.660
‎-You have Adrien.
‎-It's not the same.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.060
‎I understand
‎that you want to make friends,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.500
‎but friendships can prove disappointing
‎sometimes.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.260
‎Be home in time for dinner.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.300
‎The game is over. We lost.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.220
‎No. We've won the right
‎to go for orange juice,

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.700
‎if you still want to.
‎Nothing can stop us now!

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.860
‎I was wrong about you, Marinette.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.220
‎I'm glad this game
‎randomly put us together.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.660
‎Now I see why Adrien
‎considers you a good friend.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.060
‎Oh! Uh... Did he tell you that...

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.580
‎I mean... that we're friends?

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.100
‎By the way, about this blood-type thing...

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.500
‎Isn't it a bit like the zodiac?
‎What's your sign?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.020
‎- ‎Dragon.
‎- ‎No way! I'm Snake!

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.340
‎Do they go well together?

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.380
‎I don't really believe in that stuff.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.020
‎ ‎Me neither! But you know what?
‎I'm glad we're friends.
