&lrm;OK, that's fine.
&lrm;We'll do the work. Don't worry.

&lrm;It's fine, Marinette.

&lrm;None of your business, nosey.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.780
&lrm;Actually, since I'm part of
&lrm;this group, it is.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.580
&lrm;It's OK. You and I will do
&lrm;all the research and the writing

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.500
&lrm;then Chloe can present it.
&lrm;That way it's equal.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.500
&lrm;That's not equal at all.
&lrm;Is that how you two work?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.660
&lrm;Yeah, ever since grade school

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.020
&lrm;when I started doing Chloe's homework.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.220
&lrm;We've been BFFs ever since.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.860
&lrm;You got a problem with that?
&lrm;Come on, Sabrina.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
&lrm;Sabrina, Chloe's
&lrm;taking advantage of you.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.540
&lrm;You don't have to do what she says.
&lrm;That's not how a best friend acts.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.820
&lrm;[Chloe] Not only am I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.860
&lrm;Sabrina's best friend,
&lrm;I'm her only friend.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.580
&lrm;So she better do what I say,
&lrm;cuz without me, she has nothing.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.860
&lrm;I'd rather have no friends
&lrm;than be friends with you.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.660
&lrm;Whatever. I've more important things
&lrm;to do.

&lrm;Marinette!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.220
&lrm;I can't believe you stood up to Chloe.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.900
&lrm;It was so amazing.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.820
&lrm;Well... yeah...
&lrm;What are friends for?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.780
&lrm;I'm super excited to hang out with you

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.740
&lrm;and have a new friend
&lrm;who helps with the project

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900
&lrm;We'll have the best time together.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.180
&lrm;We'll do the presentation
&lrm;and tell the truth about Chloe, OK?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.700
&lrm;[uncertainly]
&lrm;Sounds... great.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.900

&lrm;Marinette's right. I-I'm not your slave.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.300
&lrm;I never actually said that.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.380
&lrm;But Marinette didn't buy
&lrm;a super cute beret.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.460
&lrm;And I did.
&lrm;Perhaps I could lend it to you.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.180
&lrm;Are you trying to bribe her
&lrm;into staying your friend...

&lrm;No, excuse me,

&lrm;[Cat Noir] Chloe, this Evillustrator,

&lrm;he's targeting you specifically.

&lrm;Any idea why?

&lrm;No, everyone adores me.

&lrm;Yeah, because you're so adorable.

&lrm;What's the deal?

&lrm;Why are you acting weird?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.900
&lrm;You gotta admit that

&lrm;Fine, you stay. Later.

&lrm;What do you mean, later?

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.260
&lrm;You want to protect her,
&lrm;so you don't need me.

&lrm;So... later!

&lrm;Are you... going to hurt me?

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.780
&lrm;You? You're Marinette.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.500
&lrm;You're beautiful, sweet and perfect.
&lrm;I could never hurt you.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.940
&lrm;[embarrassed]
&lrm;Wow, that's very... flattering...

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.340
&lrm;Thank you.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.380
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;I just came to ask...

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.060
&lrm;It's my birthday today and...
&lrm;would you wanna come to my party?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.980
&lrm;Oh... actually...
&lrm;it's not really the best night.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.340
&lrm;I've got a presentation to work on

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.620
&lrm;and I have to call my friend
&lrm;so we can meet and...

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.940
&lrm;Please. It'll just be you and I.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.620
&lrm;[romantic music]

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.500
&lrm;Oh, my gosh.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.540
&lrm;[awkwardly]
&lrm;That's...me

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.060
&lrm;You like it?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.500
&lrm;[hesitantly]
&lrm;I love it.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.020
&lrm;So much that I'll be at your party...

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.940
&lrm;on one condition.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.340
&lrm;Anything for you.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.380
&lrm;You can't hurt Chloe anymore.
&lrm;I can't bear violence.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.020
&lrm;For you, and only you.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.500
&lrm;Meet you next to Notre-Dame
&lrm;at sunset.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.460
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.260
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.380
&lrm;What are you thinking, Marinette?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.140
&lrm;I'm thinking
&lrm;poor Nathaniel has a crush on me,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.860
&lrm;and his alter ego, the Evillustrator,

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.180
&lrm;is gonna get crushed by Ladybug.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.580
&lrm;But how is Ladybug going to
&lrm;crush this crush

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.900
&lrm;when you're going on the date
&lrm;with him as Marinette?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.060
&lrm;Maybe some cool cat needs
&lrm;to crash the party.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.820
&lrm;[Chloe whines]

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.460
&lrm;Sabrina is so selfish
&lrm;making me do this project myself.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.540
&lrm;[whining]
&lrm;My brain hurts.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.220
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;Hey...

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.020
&lrm;Cat Noir, are you any good
&lrm;at particle physics?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.580
&lrm;This cat's got
&lrm;particle physics in the bag.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.780
&lrm;Great.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.820
&lrm;Sit, kitty.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.420
&lrm;Now, make it sounds
&lrm;purr-fect for my presentation.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.180
&lrm;[she gasps]
&lrm;See that? I made a cat joke.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.460
&lrm;I can be funny.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.860
&lrm;[sarcastically]
&lrm;Yeah... hilarious.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.340
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.780
&lrm;You can't just fly off
&lrm;and then make cat calls, Ladybug.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.660
<i>&lrm;Sorry, that wasn't cool,</i>
<i>&lrm;but you can leave Chloe.</i>

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.980
<i>&lrm;I need you to protect this girl.</i>

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.580
<i>&lrm;Her name's Marinette.</i>
<i>&lrm;Cute, isn't she?</i>

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.620
<i>&lrm;The Evillustrator is in love with her.</i>

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.940
<i>&lrm;He won't harm Chloe</i>
<i>&lrm;if Marinette comes to his party.</i>

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.260
<i>&lrm;While he's distracted,</i>
<i>&lrm;you take him down.</i>

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.500
&lrm;What about you?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.100
<i>&lrm;I'm going on a secret mission.</i>

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.860
<i>&lrm;I'll catch you later. Can you handle it?</i>

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.220
&lrm;[he chuckles]
&lrm;It'll be a cinch.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.940
&lrm;You're out of danger.
&lrm;So, see ya... Later.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.740
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;Later? What about my presentation?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.140
&lrm;[she growls]

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.060
&lrm;[gasping]
&lrm;Sabrina...

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.580
&lrm;you scared me.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.340
&lrm;Sorry, I was just waiting for you.
&lrm;Did you get my messages?

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.300
&lrm;Yes... Yes I did.
&lrm;And I was totally going to call you.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.700
&lrm;You were?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.180
&lrm;[excitedly]
&lrm;I knew you would... Eventually.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.300
&lrm;So I did your geography homework.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.900
&lrm;[surprised]
&lrm;You didn't have to.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.900
&lrm;Since you're my new best friend,
&lrm;it's the least I can do.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.100
&lrm;Thanks but I can't accept it.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.820
&lrm;Really?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.100
&lrm;[she sighs]
&lrm;OK, but just this once.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.380
&lrm;Great.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.860
&lrm;So, you wanna work on
&lrm;the project tonight?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.740
&lrm;I'm so sorry Sabrina.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.300
&lrm;I've something really important to do.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.740
&lrm;Something important, really?
&lrm;That's fascinating.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.300
&lrm;You know who else uses that excuse?

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.140
&lrm;[hesitating]
&lrm;No...

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.380
&lrm;Chloe. I'm beginning to see
&lrm;how similar you two are.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.700
&lrm;You expect me to do all the work,
&lrm;like she did. Right?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.380
&lrm;No...I-I don't, really. It's just...

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.460
&lrm;I can't believe I did
&lrm;your geography homework for you.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.860
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.460
&lrm;I thought I was going to have to
&lrm;save you from her claws.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.700
&lrm;Get it? Claws.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.380
&lrm;I haven't even introduced myself.
&lrm;I'm Cat Noir.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.740
&lrm;Yeah, I know.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.260
&lrm;You save the day all the time
&lrm;and stuff. I'm Marinette.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.500
&lrm;Why are you here?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.660
&lrm;That birthday-boy date
&lrm;of yours is bad news.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.900
&lrm;[she mimics him]

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.420
&lrm;But you're safe with me.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.220
&lrm;That puts my mind at ease.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.860
&lrm;But I am going to need help.
&lrm;Care to assist a superhero?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.180
&lrm;What about Ladybug?
&lrm;Aren't you a duo?

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.420
&lrm;She's busy.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.260
&lrm;[she mimics him]
&lrm;So you get to be my Ladybug.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.700
&lrm;[sigh of repulsion]

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.500
&lrm;Cat Noir and I
&lrm;fighting crime together? Amazing.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.860
&lrm;What do I do?

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.540
&lrm;Just get his pencil away from him.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.420
&lrm;I'll take care of the rest.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.740
&lrm;[she giggles]

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.780

<i>&lrm;you're setting,</i>

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.580
<i>&lrm;but I don't get distracted, boy.</i>

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.340
&lrm;I just want Marinette to love me.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.220
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;And I want the Miraculous. So get it!

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.260
&lrm;Or else...

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.900
&lrm;[throbbing]

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.860
&lrm;[fearfully]
&lrm;OK, I will, I will.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.260
&lrm;[Marinette]
&lrm;Happy birthday.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.420
&lrm;[she giggles]

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.860
&lrm;[shyly]
&lrm;Marinette.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.380
&lrm;Thanks for accepting to come.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.140
&lrm;- It's so beautiful.
&lrm;- You like it?

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.820
&lrm;Well hold on.
&lrm;I'm just getting started.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.900
&lrm;[he groans]

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.620
&lrm;Come on, you've gotta be kidding.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.340
&lrm;Sorry...

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.260
&lrm;I didn't mean to startle you.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.780
&lrm;I can't draw in the dark.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.060
<i>&lrm;Voilà!</i>

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.500
&lrm;You're so talented.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.060
&lrm;So why would you want
&lrm;to use your power to hurt people.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.300
&lrm;Not all people, just Chloe.
&lrm;And I won't do it again.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.580
&lrm;You were true to your promise
&lrm;so I'll be true to mine.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.540
&lrm;I actually draw a little too.
&lrm;I'm not as good as you, of course.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.020
&lrm;I'm sure you're great.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.100
&lrm;Can I draw you something special
&lrm;for your birthday?

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.220
&lrm;[surprised]
&lrm;That would be amazing.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.900
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Marinette, give my pencil back.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.940
&lrm;I need to draw something... now.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.500
&lrm;No... I'm keeping it.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.460
&lrm;Cat Noir, now!

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.900
&lrm;Marinette?

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.580
&lrm;You're working with him?

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.940
&lrm;I'm so stupid.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.420
&lrm;I thought you liked me
&lrm;but you're just like Chloe.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.860
&lrm;Teasing me, mocking me,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.180
&lrm;leading me on!

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.820
&lrm;Come on, seriously?

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.380
&lrm;Why is everyone
&lrm;comparing me to Chloe?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.820
&lrm;And I'm taking back my promise.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.780
&lrm;Chloe's going to get
&lrm;a lesson she'll never forget.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.100
&lrm;We've been penned in, literally.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.540
&lrm;[Marinette gasps]

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.980
&lrm;Cat Noir, put your stick like this,
&lrm;then extend it.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.860
&lrm;- Great thinking.
&lrm;- Yeah, I'm a genius.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.300
&lrm;Gotta go.
&lrm;A superhero's work is never done.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.580
&lrm;Damsels in distress,
&lrm;ladies in waiting...

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.620
&lrm;I've more saving to do.
&lrm;You can thank me later.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.420
&lrm;Me thank him?
&lrm;He should be thanking me.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.260
&lrm;We'd still be trapped
&lrm;if it wasn't for me.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.020
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Speaking of which...

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.860
&lrm;He needs help saving Chloe.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.100
&lrm;[sobbing]
&lrm;I'm so sorry, Miss,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.100
&lrm;but after what happened
&lrm;in the Library,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.180
&lrm;I couldn't work on my project.
&lrm;It would have been too traumatic.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.780
&lrm;Just look what it's done to my hair.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.500
&lrm;[sobbing suddenly stops]
&lrm;Who's going to believe that?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.380
&lrm;Even a stupid hairdryer
&lrm;couldn't make me look bad.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.500
&lrm;[door rumbles]

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.780
&lrm;Cat Noir, is that you?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.140
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.700
&lrm;[she screams]

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.140
&lrm;Chloe, where are you?
&lrm;Are you hiding?

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.460
&lrm;That is so cute.
&lrm;You're playing hide and seek.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.900
&lrm;In the closet?

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.380
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.420
&lrm;[she screams]

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.100
&lrm;[he chuckles]

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.380
&lrm;[she screams]

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.340
&lrm;I win, Chloe. I found you.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.500
&lrm;My designer dresses, my heels...
&lrm;You're a monster!

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.780
&lrm;You like to walk all over people

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.580
&lrm;but you don't like it
&lrm;when others trample on you,

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.100
&lrm;do you, Chloe?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.420
&lrm;Do you?

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.860
&lrm;[she screams]

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.500
&lrm;Oops, broke your heel,
&lrm;better watch your ankles.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.020
&lrm;Look what the cat dragged in.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.260
&lrm;No cat dragged me anywhere,
&lrm;Cat Noir.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.860
&lrm;I flew in all on my own.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.500
&lrm;What was the secret mission?

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.980
&lrm;If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.580
&lrm;This is what's known as
&lrm;the final showdown.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.580
&lrm;The thing is if you knew her,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.300
&lrm;you wouldn't bother saving her.
&lrm;She's the real baddie!

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.620
&lrm;It's not true. Everybody adores me.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.780
&lrm;Look out!

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.540
&lrm;[she whimpers]

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.860
&lrm;The light...

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.020
&lrm;- He can't draw in the dark.
&lrm;- Got it.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.540
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.020
&lrm;[crumbling]

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.500
&lrm;Here, kitty,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.140
&lrm;a ball and chain to play with.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.260
&lrm;Hey!

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.220
&lrm;Sadly, those who get in my way
&lrm;get erased.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.980
&lrm;[he yells]

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.740
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.220
&lrm;[she whimpers]

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.340
&lrm;[ring bleeps]
&lrm;No, no, no...!

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.460
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
&lrm;Cat Noir's Miraculous,

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.140
&lrm;take it, take it now!

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.980
&lrm;Before you go,
&lrm;you have something I want.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.100
&lrm;Ladybug,
&lrm;this cat doesn't have 9 lives.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.740
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.140
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.260
&lrm;A bouncy ball?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.380
&lrm;Just try and stop me with that,
&lrm;little lady.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.660
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.780
&lrm;[tinkling]

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.540
&lrm;Gladly.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.700
&lrm;[bouncing and smashing]

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.140
&lrm;[he yells]

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.420
&lrm;[whimpering]
&lrm;Hurry!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.220
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.500
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.620
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.740
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.300
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.700
&lrm;[whooshing]

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.660
&lrm;[bubbling]

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.260
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;Where am I?

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.220
&lrm;POUND IT!

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.700
&lrm;[angrily]
&lrm;No!

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.340
&lrm;Their Miraculouses were
&lrm;practically mine, and they will be!

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500
&lrm;Once I have them all in my grasp,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.380
&lrm;I will have absolute power!

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.420
&lrm;[Ayla]
&lrm;What happened when Ladybug

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.020
&lrm;and Cat Noir turned up?

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.940
<i>&lrm;To be honest,</i>
<i>&lrm;they only made matters worse.</i>

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.620
<i>&lrm;They came barrelling in</i>
<i>&lrm;and started smashing things,</i>

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.060
&lrm;throwing balls around.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.300
&lrm;Balls?

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.460
&lrm;[she giggles]

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.220
&lrm;I hope you had a good time
&lrm;taking care of that thing...

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.180
&lrm;I'm really sorry, Sabrina,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.740
&lrm;but I can meet you today
&lrm;to work on the project.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.420
&lrm;Too late. Chloe and I are
&lrm;doing the project together.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.380
&lrm;You mean you're doing it.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.900
&lrm;Of course,
&lrm;after all she's been through.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.540
&lrm;[Marinette groans]
&lrm;Nice new beret.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.260
&lrm;I know. Chloe lent it to me.
&lrm;She really is my BFF.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.500
&lrm;Chloe!

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.260
&lrm;Your geography homework's ready.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.740
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.980
&lrm;Hey, I heard about
&lrm;your adventures with Cat Noir.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.180
&lrm;- Were you scared?
&lrm;- Me, scared?

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.780
&lrm;It was a dream...
&lrm;I mean you're a dream...

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.300
&lrm;I mean in your dreams.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.060
&lrm;[sighing]
&lrm;This is a nightmare.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.500
&lrm;[uncertainly]
&lrm;OK...

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.100
&lrm;So what about Cat Noir,
&lrm;was he awesome?

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.700
&lrm;Sure, yeah,
&lrm;but not as awesome as you,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.580
&lrm;because you're
&lrm;the most awesome of awesome.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.140
&lrm;So... that's a yes?

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.940
&lrm;[bell rings]

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.340
&lrm;Do you realise
&lrm;you just blabbered on to Adrien

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.620
&lrm;about how you think he's awesome?

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.620
&lrm;He touched me.
&lrm;I'll never wash my jacket again.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.180
&lrm;Girl, you have got to get
&lrm;better control of your emotions.
