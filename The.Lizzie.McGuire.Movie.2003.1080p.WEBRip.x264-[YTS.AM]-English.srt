00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,378
Some say juvenile.

2
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,980
I say genius!

Matt!

6
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,908
Say goodbye to your little toy.

7
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:20,781
And say hello to Matt owning
his big sister for eternity!

00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:42,482
I shall win the academy award!

82
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,538
I mean, yesterday,
you were in diapers,

83
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,634
and now you're graduating
junior high.

84
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,857
You're growing up,
and I can't believe
you're going to Rome

85
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,293
for two weeks
all by yourself...

86
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,181
Without me...

87
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,963
without me... There...
With you...

88
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,932
without me with you there...

89
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,333
you there without me.

90
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:01,902
Mom, I think that's about

91
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,323
all the combinations of
those words you can make.

92
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,207
Lizzie, this is a big day
for you, sweetheart.

93
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,810
He's going to
quote a dead guy.

94
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,100
<i>As William Shakespeare</i>
<i>once wrote,</i>

95
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:14,669
"be not afraid of greatness:

96
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,876
"Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

97
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,225
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

98
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,535
Thanks, dad, but I'm
just trying to get
through graduation.

99
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,792
Greatness can wait
till this nightmare's over.

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,827
Hey, gordo.

101
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,395
So, do I look okay?

102
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,410
Lizzie,
I'm your <i>guy</i> best friend.

103
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,698
You should really talk
to Miranda about this stuff.

104
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:33,867
But she's in Mexico city.

105
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,103
Yes... your blue robe
looks <i>way</i> cooler

106
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,678
than all the other girls'.

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,472
Thanks.

108
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,774
<i>Oh... My... God.</i>

109
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,224
Only you would think that
you could hide that powder-blue,

110
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,465
puffy-sleeved,
it's-kind-of-a-peasant-dress-

a-baggy-disaster-of-
questionable-fiber-content

112
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,218
that you wore
to the spring dance.

113
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,113
I...

114
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,522
Lizzie McGuire, you are
an outfit repeater!

115
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,693
But I...

116
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,454
Maybe <i>I'm</i> an outfit repeater,

117
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,396
but <i>you're</i>
<i>an outfit rememberer,</i>

118
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,065
which is just as pathetic.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,760
Okay, does she not have
anything better to do

120
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,603
than make my life miserable?

121
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,839
I mean...
We used to be best friends.

122
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,042
Yeah, but that was before
she became popular.

123
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,944
McGuire!

124
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,046
Go.

125
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,314
Hey, Mr. Escobar.

126
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,252
Nice after-shave.

127
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,147
Oh, thank you.

128
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,256
Margaret Chan either has ebola
or a very bad cold.

129
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,857
In any event, you're up.

130
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,359
U-u-u-up where?

131
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:34,394
At the podium.

132
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:36,516
You are going to deliver
the class president's speech.

133
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,165
B-b-b-but what about
the vice president?

134
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,774
Well, he's not graduating.

135
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,588
The secretary treasurer's
next in line.

136
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,291
A-all I did was handle
petty cash.

137
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,359
Well, I'm sorry,
but you're not buying
your way out of this.

138
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,562
Now, I want you
to deliver your speech

139
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,411
with as much pride
and commitment

140
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:52,979
as Margaret Chan would...

141
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,482
Even though you're no
Margaret Chan.

142
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,958
<i>You're no Margaret Chan.</i>

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,394
<i>You're no Margaret Chan.</i>

144
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,628
<i>You're no Margaret Chan.</i>

145
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,430
Run!!

146
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:16,236
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>uh, Lizzie McGuire.</i>

147
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:28,915
Um...

148
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,484
U-uh, Margaret Chan
couldn't make it tonight,

149
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:35,655
<i>so I'm going... I'm going to</i>
<i>be filling in for her.</i>

150
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,793
Not that any of us
could really do that,

151
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,962
but, um... Anyway...

152
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:43,096
Honey...

153
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,131
Honey, I'm losing the feeling
in my knuckles.

154
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,133
<i>I think that</i>
<i>we can all agree that...</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

155
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:50,870
Junior high is filled with...
Embarrassing and awkward

156
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:55,375
and sometimes just downright
humiliating moments... Right?

157
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,746
Uh...

158
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:02,248
Oh!
Me neither.

159
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,517
It is so sad.

160
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:06,753
Wow.

161
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,189
It's like watching one
of those little furry animals

162
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,957
get killed
on the discovery channel.

163
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,965
Mmm, I-I-I think Margaret Chan
would want me to have

164
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,967
some water right now.

165
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:23,536
Uhh! Oh!

166
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,444
Oh!

167
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:35,548
Play something!
Do something!

168
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,354
Yes! Ha ha ha!

169
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:42,956
Come on! Mom! Dad!

170
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,791
I've got to get out
of the country! Hurry!

171
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,594
Oh, honey, I know
you're still upset,
but it wasn't that bad.

172
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,162
Oh, really, mom?

173
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:53,066
Was your junior-high graduation
on "good morning America"?

174
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:55,835
What kind of creep would send
Diane Sawyer a video

175
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:57,537
to embarrass you like that?

176
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,638
Oh.

177
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,614
Ugh!

178
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,383
<i>What is that?</i>

179
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:12,719
That is miss ungermeyer.

180
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,055
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

181
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:16,723
She's gonna be
our high-school principal

182
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:18,491
for the next four years.

183
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,026
<i>If you stay on her good side,</i>

184
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,195
<i>it's a one-way ticket</i>
<i>to an Ivy league school.</i>

185
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:24,297
<i>And what if</i>
<i>you're on her bad side?</i>

186
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,233
<i>Excuse me!</i>
<i>I need to mop up some puke.</i>

187
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,535
Well, you...

188
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,870
You wind up as that guy?

189
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:34,407
No. You end up <i>working</i>
<i>for that guy.</i>

190
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,742
Miss ungermeyer...
Miss ungermeyer...
Miss ungermeyer...

191
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,343
Can you make sure
that there are no garlic

192
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,646
or soy products in
anything my Brittany
puts near her mouth?

193
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,147
Miss ungermeyer,
Luke has tennis elbow.

194
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,682
Could somebody please
carry his luggage?

195
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:44,517
Miss ungermeyer,
my son has asthma,

196
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,219
and he must have his puffer.

197
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,921
Now, Brittany,
she's got allergies...
Miss ungermeyer...

198
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:51,958
Attention, parents...

199
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Shut your pie holes.

200
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:56,196
<i>I'm on a mission here...</i>

201
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,730
To drag your progeny

202
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:01,067
to 31 historically significant
Roman landmarks

203
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,236
in two weeks.

204
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:06,940
Now, when these back-talking
miscreants return to you,

205
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:10,810
they will have dipped their toes
in a lake of culture,

206
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,545
before assuming their destiny

207
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,714
folding shirts
at the outlet mall.

208
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:18,418
Now, many... actually,
<i>most</i> of your classmates opted

209
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,322
for the 36-hour bus ride
to the water-slide wonderland.

210
00:10:22,324 --> 00:10:23,656
Whoo!

211
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,425
<i>But you...</i>

212
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:29,562
You, who are not
mouth-breathing trailer trash,

213
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:33,133
you will get to experience
the delights

214
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:36,236
of <i>LA città eterna.</i>

215
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:37,504
Hmm-hmm.

216
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,007
Rome. The eternal city.

217
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,742
Did no one read
the info packets?

218
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,614
Watch and learn.

219
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,517
Um, miss ungermeyer...

220
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,019
I just wanted to
let you know that I'm...

221
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,387
I'm really looking forward

222
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,956
to this exciting
and academically enriching trip.

223
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,991
What's your name?

224
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:59,058
David Gordon.

225
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,693
David Gordon.
Mm-hmm.

226
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,362
Now, I think in Italian,

227
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:05,131
that means a sneaky brownnoser
with a hidden agenda.

228
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,299
Huh?

229
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,500
- What?
- Uh, uh...

230
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,636
Yeah! Come on,
check those bags!

231
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:11,771
<i>I want to see that junk</i>
<i>in the trunk</i>

232

233
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,711
Okay.

234
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:23,650
Mom...

235
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,854
Okay, it's only two weeks, mom.

236
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,791
Honey, she...
she's got to go.
Two weeks.

237
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,529
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.

238
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:38,431
Safe trip, huh?
Okay.

239
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,600
Sweetheart...

240
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,571
Okay?
Mm-hmm.

<i>Final boarding,</i>

00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:31,718
We're going to the land
where they invented spaghetti!

245
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,719
Ah heh.

<i>All passengers now...</i>

Kate and all of

all went to
water-slide wonderland.

251
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,631
How many lizzies does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

252

I don't know, but it only takes
<i>one</i> to screw up a graduation.

Hey. Zip it.

Welcome to the hotel cambini.

Now, lest you think

274
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,878
that there are many of you
and less of me

275
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,847
and it will therefore be easy
to pull anything over on me,

00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,682
<i>think again.</i>

277
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,284
In addition to my being
smarter, faster,

00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,219
and better-looking than
most of you... heh heh...

279
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:22,221
I've also enlisted
a little help.

280
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:25,091
The assistant manager
of the hotel, giorgio averni,

281
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,760
was a commander
in the Italian Navy

<i>and is therefore</i>
<i>as up on his game as I am mine.</i>

Giorgio, would you like
to brief my students

284
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:36,269
on the security procedures
of the hotel?

285
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:39,806
We serve... At 5:00...

00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,507
The cookies.

287
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,977
Yeah.

00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,313
You heard the man.

289
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:48,815

You got a problem with that,

Um, any... any room is
just... just fine for me.

297
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,564
You know, being
a spineless little jellyfish

298
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,166
is almost as unattractive
as being a little brownnoser.

that you want to put all
that really embarrassing
stuff behind you

315
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,272
and just move on
and have a fresh start.

316
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,141
You do?

317
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:50,977
Yes.
I understand your dream.

318
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,211
It's a <i>big</i> dream.

319
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,448
It's a <i>huge</i> dream,
and you can't do it alone.

320
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,817
In fact, I don't think
you can do it at all.

321
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:58,951
Let it go.

322
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,255
<i>Lizzie, come on.</i>

323
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,628
Whoa!

324
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,695
Gordo, what?

325
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,430
Don't... don't worry.
Don't worry.

326
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:12,665
Where are we going?

327
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,200
Look.

328
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,103
Wow!

329
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:19,605
Pretty cool, huh?

330
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,811
You know what, gordo?

331
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,581
I'm not gonna let
Kate Sanders get to me.

332
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,882
Promise me something.

333
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:30,950
Anything.

334
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,852
Promise me
that when we're here,

335
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:34,120
we'll find adventures.

336
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,689
All right? This is
our chance to start over...

337
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:39,292
I mean, do anything
that we want to do.

338
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,561
Yeah. I-I know.
You're right.

339
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,363
Hmm. You and me...
adventures. Deal.

340
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:47,333
Deal.

341
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,107
The trevi fountain was designed

342
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,711
by gian lorenza bernini
and peitro da cortona

343
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,246
in the 17th century.

344
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:03,416
And I'll tell you, it
took about 100 years
to finish this bad boy.

345
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:04,784
Now, throughout history,

346
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,086
people have come
from all over the world

347
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:10,256
to make a wish and toss their
coin in the trevi fountain.

348
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,725
I'll tell you something... those
people are suckers, all right?

349
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,527
You got to make your own luck
in this world.

350
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:18,197
All right, moving on, people.
Let's go.

351
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,231
<i>Scusi.</i>

352
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,900
<i>Grazie.</i>

353
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:23,502
<i>Scusi. Grazie.</i>

354
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,504
You know what?
Forget what she says.

355
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:26,839
Make a wish.

356
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,141
I'm in Rome
with my best friend.

357
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,910
I'm good.
<i>You</i> make one.

358
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,645
Okay.

359
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,046
Hmm.

360
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,414
Okay.

361
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,428
Isabella?

362
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,063
Huh?

363
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:56,035
Okay, I was wishing for smooth
sailing through high school,

364
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,137
but <i>this</i> will work.

365
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,106
<i>Uh, I'm sorry.</i>

366
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:01,607
It's just...

367
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,477
You look an awful lot
like a friend of mine.

368
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,778
<i>Paolo...</i>

369
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,580
You have to get
to your photo shoot.

370
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:08,714
We got to go.

371
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:13,953
<i>All right, what you</i>
<i>little halflings are</i>
<i>feeling right about now</i>

372
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,621
is your energy flagging.

373
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,156
<i>We got four more stops today.</i>

374
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,625
<i>I want you people to</i>
<i>at least be able to shuffle</i>

375
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>from monument to monument.</i>

376
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,429
<i>We got one word for that,</i>
<i>and it's gelato.</i>

377
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:26,532
Look... it's him.
<i>Now, keep in mind</i>
<i>that Italian ice cream has</i>

378
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:28,601
about twice the sugar
of American ice cream.

379
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,537
<i>Means you're gonna want about</i>
<i>two scoops, huh?</i>

380
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,539
I know <i>i</i> do.
All right.

381
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,207
<i>I-I don't mean</i>
<i>to bother you.</i>

382
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,610
I'm Paolo...
Paolo valisari.

383
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:40,046
Oh, um, I'm Lizzie McGuire,

384
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,814
and this is
my friend gordo.
Hey.

385
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,549
This is my friend Sergei.

386
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:45,551
Sergei, doesn't she look
exactly like Isabella?

387
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,653
Isabella!
Paolo!

388
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,192
Um...

389
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,226
Paolo!

390
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,128
<i>Woman: Isabella!</i>
<i>Isabella!</i>

391
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:02,134
Paolo! Paolo!

392
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,471
<i>Ciao, Paolo!</i>

393
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,308
Uh, hmm...

394
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:12,178
Wow!

395
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,080
<i>That really does look like me.</i>

396
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:16,582
<i>Paolo: Except for the hair,</i>
<i>you could be her twin.</i>

397
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,318
Isabella is my singing partner,
<i>and you're like her sister...</i>

398
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,487
<i>like, uh...</i>
<i>Two pods in a pea.</i>

399
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:26,158
Lizzie...
Can I see you again?

400
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,660
Maybe tomorrow?

401
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,095
Please?

402
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,097
What's the word for "yes"
in Italian?

403
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,264
<i>Si.</i>

404
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,666
Uh...

405
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:34,734
No, I'm...

406
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,502
I-it's okay.
I-I-I can cover for you.

407
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,037
<i>Miss ungermeyer:</i>
<i>Head check!</i>

408
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,773
I'm sorry. I'm here
with my school, so I can't.
<i>1...2...3...</i>

409
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:42,408
forgive me
if I embarrassed you.
<i>All right,</i>
<i>stop moving around.</i>

410
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,110
It is just that some people,
when they come to Rome,

411
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,779
they want to find
adventure.
1...2...

412
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:48,714
Oh, it's okay.
...3...4...

413
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:51,016
I got some cool cheese.
...5...6...

414
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,152
Did you just say "cool cheese"?

415
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,186
Wah!

416
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,088
<i>8...9...</i>
<i>Paolo...</i>

417
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,223
We must go.
<i>...10...</i>

418
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:59,425
Uh, Lizzie...

419
00:20:59,427 --> 00:21:00,926
If you change your mind,

420
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,561
I will meet you
tomorrow morning

421
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,130
at the trevi fountain
at 9:00.

422
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,431
Hey, Gordon...
McGuire...

423
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,600
Did you not hear me say
"head check"?

424
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,869
15...16...

425
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,036
Who are you?

426
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,204
Paolo valisari.

427
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:17,009
Put your money
in your front pockets.

428
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,780
She makes me very scared.

429
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,982
Join the club.

430
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,483
Lizzie...

431
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,754
<i>Ci vediamo.</i>

432
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,790
What does that mean?

433
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,325
We will see each other.

434
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,965
Hey.

435
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,434
You know, this
Paolo and Isabella
cd isn't so bad.

436
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:45,237
I mean, if you're into
the alanis morissette-y,

437
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,473
alternative, dark,
like, brooding,

438
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,908
I-never-go-out-
into-the-sunshine-

439
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,776
and-my-life's-a-miserable-
black-hole-of-depression

440
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,511
kind of thing,
then you'd think they stink.

441
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:53,779
<i>But, I mean, for a, like,</i>

442
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:55,514
<i>driving-around-in-the-car-</i>
<i>with-the-top-down,</i>

443
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:57,082
putting-on-your-lip-gloss,
loving-life kind of thing,

444
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,083
they're good.

445
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,385
Here. Listen.

446
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,554
<i>¶ You don't have to sail</i>
<i>the ocean ¶</i>

447
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,222
yeah, not bad.

448
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:05,391
You use scented soap, huh?

449
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,559
What?

450
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,461
Um, it...
n-never... never mind.

451
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,831
So,
Paolo wants me to meet him

452
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,732
<i>at the trevi fountain tomorrow.</i>

453
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,167
So go.

454
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,570
But that would mean
I would have to sneak
away from the group.

455
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:19,038
So?

456
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
So I'm, like, physically
incapable of sneaking.

457
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,942
<i>Lizzie, weren't you the one</i>

458
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,044
that said that we were gonna
have adventures on this trip?

459
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:28,113
Yeah... we. <i>We</i> were
going to have adventures.

460
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,448
And we will.

461
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,885
It just so happens that
you have dibs on the first one.

462
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:35,554
Okay.

463
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,723
Just as long
as we don't do anything

464
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:40,392
that would get us
tossed on a plane home
by miss ungermeyer.

465
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:43,162
Uh... Unh.

466
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:45,664
Lizzie, are...
are you feeling okay?

467
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,439
Uh...

468
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:00,479
Is this girl sick,
or isn't she?

469
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:02,815
She doesn't have a fever,

470
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,149
and yet she's in bed.

471
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,686
<i>Ask yourself why</i>
<i>a beautiful young girl</i>

472
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,755
<i>on her first visit to Rome,</i>

473
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:11,423
probably seeking adventure,

474
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,926
wants to lie in bed all day.

475
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,495
She's ill.

476
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:19,832
<i>You know, I heard</i>
<i>she fell down at graduation,</i>

477
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,600
<i>made a complete fool</i>
<i>out of herself.</i>

478
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:24,570
And you think that could have
something to do with this?
I saw that on CNN.

479
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,038
CNN?

480
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,675
<i>Often, the nervous system</i>
<i>collapses</i>

481
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,844
after that type
of utter humiliation.

482
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:32,845
Hmm.

483
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,482
Do you have
any recommendations?

484
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,350
Oh, yeah, yeah. Um...

485
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:42,187
This young woman
should stay in bed.

486
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:47,293
<i>Uh, she... she should</i>
<i>also eat two apricots.</i>

487
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,461
Oh, for digestion or...

488
00:23:49,463 --> 00:23:51,463
Uh, no, they're in season...
very delicious.

489
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,465
Feel better, <i>signorina</i> McGuire.

490
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,733
You rest up, McGuire.

491
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,870
Don't want you to miss out
on all the adventures of Rome.

492
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,039
Uh, doctor, I have a boil...

493
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,702
Sorry.

494
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:35,507
<i>Uno, due, tre.</i>

495
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,675
<i>Tre.</i>
<i>Tre.</i>
<i>Tre.</i>

496
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,447
<i>Bene.</i>

497
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,455
I...I just...

498
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,457
I had them all wish
for you to come.

499
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:57,596
Hmm...

500
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,164
I don't have much time.

501
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,033
You know my chaperon,
miss ungermeyer...

502
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,434
Wait, wait, wait.

503
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,670
I have to show you something.

504
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:06,005
<i>¶ Sometimes the world</i>

505

506

wow!

510
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,818
I just thought you should see
Rome the way romans do.

511
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,021
So you knew that I would come.

512
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,622
I hoped you would.

513
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,960
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

514
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:30,529
This is Rome.
<i>Nobody</i> knows how to drive.

but with Lizzie there,
something <i>will.</i>

546
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,532
And what precisely
are you going to do

547
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:14,833
with that information...

548
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,803
just give it away, like you did
with the graduation video?

549
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,405
Hey! She was really
freaked out by that.

550
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,174
And you have what
to show for it?

551
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:25,144
The pride of a job well done?

552
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:28,046
Try buying a ps2 with
the pride of a job well done.

553
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,081
Oh!

554
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,016
Matt, Matt, Matt...

555
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,785
We've been over this
before... cash up front.

556
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:34,853
Melina...

557
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,822
<i>Are you staying for dinner?</i>

558
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,957
I'd love to,
Mrs. McGuire.
<i>Great.</i>

559
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,192
We'll need extra energy

560
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:42,194
to work on
our summer reading list.

561
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,296
Well, in that case,
I'll make some brownies.

562
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,097
Oh.

563
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,001
I've said it before...
you're weak! Weak!

564
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:51,270
Don't do anything
without consulting me first.

565
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:57,009
You rock.

566
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,724
Hey, Paolo...

567
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,226
Can I ask you something?

568
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,460
<i>Si, carina.</i>

569
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,630
Um... I know that our lives
are a little different...

570
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,466
actually, like several
universes different.

571
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,602
But doesn't your friend
Sergei ever get tired

572
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:25,304
of following us around
everywhere?

573
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,406
Actually,
Sergei's my bodyguard.

574
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,641
So, you see,
between me and Sergei,

575
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:31,343
<i>you'll always be safe.</i>

576
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:35,514
Whoa!

577
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:39,484
How famous do you have to be
before you need a bodyguard?

578
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,189
Paolo, go! Go!

579
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:46,358
I-it's miss ungermeyer!
It's our bus!

580
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,430
Go, go, go!
I cannot.

581
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,166
Excuse me,
miss... miss ungermeyer...

582
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,235
Didn't we just pass
the castel sant'angelo?

583
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,469
Yep. What about it?

584
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:59,905
Oh, I just noticed
that it's not on our itinerary.

585
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:01,206
That is correct.

586
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,908
Well, s-shouldn't it be?

587
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,410
<i>I-I mean, it...</i>
<i>it w-was a papal residence,</i>

588
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,246
and it does contain frescoes

589
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,448
from artists influenced
by the school of Raphael.

590
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,483
What are you up to, Gordon?

591
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:12,584
N-n-nothing.

592
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,019
I-I just figure that,

593
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,255
<i>While in Rome,</i>
<i>we should be exposed</i>

594
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:18,490
to as much renaissance,
raphaelite work

595
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,393
typified by chiaroscuro
and hellenic mythical imagery

596
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,061
as humanly possible.

597
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:27,599
Whew.

598
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,569
Ah, Gordon...
You are on the list.

599
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,704
And the list is not a place
you want to be.

600
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:35,140
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>Only in Rome, huh?</i>

601
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:38,010
You know how to
move that thing,

602
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,178
or you want me
to do it for ya?!

603
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,582
What are you looking at?

604
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:49,054
Want a piece of that...
a piece of the ungermeyer?

605
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:58,030
And over there
by that statue...
you see it?

606
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,031
Yeah.

607
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,465
That's where
the artist caravaggio

608
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,434
had his opponent
burned at the stake.

609
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:03,769
Oh, wait...
or was it the pope

610
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:06,171
who had caravaggio burned
at the stake?

611
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:08,473
Either way,
this neighborhood was tough.

612
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,378
Paolo...

613
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,646
<i>Si, carina?</i>

614
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:18,350
Do... You still love her?

615
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,918
Who? Isabella?

616
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,986
<i>Si.</i>

617
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,290
Of course I still love her.

618
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,693
But like a sister.

619
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,528
So why did you break up?

620
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,230
It's, um...
It's complicated.

621
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,967
What?

622
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:39,304
I mean, yes, we've been
voted "best pop duo
of the year" <i>again.</i>

623
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:41,506
Uh, but I want to do
more serious music.

624
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,408
And when I told this
to Isabella,

625
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,876
she said flat-out "no."

626
00:30:44,878 --> 00:30:46,778
So I was forced to tell her,
"this is it.

627
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,513
This will be
our last cd together."

628
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,549
What did she do?
Did she totally freak out?

629
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:52,117
She <i>totally</i> freak out.

630
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,353
And, yes, I feel awful about
that, but what about me?

631
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,054
I need to grow
as an artist, you know?

632
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,189
Yeah.

633
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,458
So, the other day
when I saw you,

634
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,194
I just... I don't know,
I had this crazy...

635
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,662
I just... I don't know.

636
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,364
W-what?

637
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:07,999
I had this crazy idea
that maybe you could help me.

638
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:14,539
Come on. How crazy could it be?
Just tell me.

639
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,742
No, I can't.
It's too... it's too...

640
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,244
Please.
Okay.

641
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:21,847
Isabella and I are supposed to
present an award together

642
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,815
at the international
music video awards.

643
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,283
Cool!

644
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:28,053
I-I mean, cool for
regular people like me,

645
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,155
but for you,
I guess it's just like work.

646
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:32,023
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I-it's cool for me, too.

647
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,759
You get all kinds of free
gift baskets and stuff.

648
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:36,261
But now because Isabella's
so mad at me,

649
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,963
she's refusing to appear.

650
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,866
The record company's
threatening to sue her
if she doesn't show up.

651
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:42,367
And what about you?

652
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,669
For me is no problem.
I write the music.

653
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,671
I don't know
where it comes from.

654
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,340
It just comes from me.

655
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:49,508
<i>¶ LA LA LA LA</i>

656
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,777
see?
So I can go solo.

657
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,145
But Isabella...

658
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,350
She needs the help to sing.

659
00:31:58,352 --> 00:31:59,951
You mean Isabella
lip-synchs?!

660
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,520
Please, please, please,
please, please!

661
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:03,722
You must promise me you will
speak of this to no one.

662
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,690
Imagine what would happen
to Isabella's career.

663
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:09,294
Oh, that's so sweet.
You still care about her.

664
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,964
You're definitely
broken up, right?

665
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,299
<i>Si.</i>

666
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,301
So, when I saw you yesterday

667
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:18,470
and I saw how all
those people thought
you were Isabella,

668
00:32:18,472 --> 00:32:20,605
I got my crazy idea
that maybe you could...

669
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,474
Pretend to be Isabella
for one night

670
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:24,409
and present the award
with me onstage.

671
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:27,045
Present an award?
O-onstage?

672
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:32,484
In front of an audience?

673
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:35,587
I-I-I'm really not good
in front of crowds.

674
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,222
I could never do that.

675
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,257
Of course you can do it.

676
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,926
You are <i>magnifico.</i>

677
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:45,997
I don't know Italian...
But I know what that means.

678
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,403
I don't know, Paolo.
I...

679
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,872
Don't worry, <i>carina.</i>

680
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:56,508
I could never ask you to do
this crazy thing.

681
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,916
No. You know what?
You don't have to ask.

682
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:07,719
<i>If this is gonna help</i>
<i>you and Isabella, then...</i>

683
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,622
I'll do it.

684
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,124
<i>Grazie!</i>

685
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:15,026
<i>Prego!</i>

686
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:37,749
Head check!

687
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:47,092
Gordo. Gordo.

688
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,064
You, Lizzie McGuire,
are actually presenting an award

689
00:33:53,066 --> 00:33:54,733
at the imvas with Paolo?

690
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,668
No...
me Isabella with Paolo.

691
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,036
What?
<i>It's a long story,</i>

692
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,405
but I'm doing it because
the real Isabella won't.

693
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:03,775
You're actually gonna
get up onstage in front
of all these people?

694
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:06,711
Well, that's the great
thing about it, gordo,
is it's not gonna be me.

695
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,680
<i>It's Paolo's idea</i>
<i>to help Isabella</i>

696
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:10,849
<i>because he still loves her.</i>

697
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:13,852
- But not romantically...
- like a sister.

698
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,554
He is <i>so</i> amazing.

699
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,621
<i>And he's 17!</i>

700
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,056
<i>I mean, for being so famous</i>

701
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,258
<i>and so used to getting</i>
<i>everything that you want,</i>

702
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,227
he's just...

703
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,662
He's just so kind.

704
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:25,096
For real?

705
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,332
Look, that's a lot
to say about someone

706
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,700
just knowing them a day.

707
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:30,001
I-I know that.

708
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:31,836
But I feel like
I've known him my whole life,

709
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:32,837
<i>you know?</i>

710
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,339
A-anyway, um...

711
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:37,208
I just wanted to come by today
and thank you.

712
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,244
I mean, I had the most
magical day of my life,

713
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,112
and it wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you.

714
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,249
It was that good, huh?

715
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,184
You're such a good friend.

716
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,622
The sting.

717
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,358
What sting?

718
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,560
You want a little <i>mano a mano?</i>

719
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,364
See, this is one of the reasons

720
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:01,132
that me and you
aren't friends...

721
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:03,635
'cause I-I never have any idea
what you're talking about.

722
00:35:03,637 --> 00:35:06,104
You see, some dudes
get the approach.

723
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,305
Others, the sting.

724
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:10,108
That Italian dude...
he's big-time approach.

725
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,511
I actually feel my brain
turning into goo.

726
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:15,180
Embrace the sting.

727
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:17,282
That's what you're vibin' here
from Lizzie.

728
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:18,750
Wait a minute.

729
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:22,153
Now, you actually think
that I'm jealous of Paolo?

730
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,122
Word.

731
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,690
Oh, no.

732
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,592
No, see, that would mean

733
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:30,061
that I like Lizzie
as more than a friend.

734
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:32,397
See? What do you mean
you and I have trouble
communicating, bro?

735
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,965
You're wrong, man.

736
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,802
<i>Whoa!</i>

737
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,972
<i>This girl looks freakishly</i>
<i>like my sister!</i>

738
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,341
Ow.
Zoom! Zoom!

739
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,946
<i>Another freakish coincidence.</i>

740
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:51,182
I mean, she has the same
necklace as my sister's.

741
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:52,450
Huh.

742
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:55,854
Why do we even pretend
you're in charge?

743
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:00,091
Okay, let's see
what this says.

744
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:01,226
<i>Ow.</i>

745
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,594
<i>"Isabella goes blond.</i>

746
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:04,863

748
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,966

<i>new blond hair."</i>

750
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:14,205
<i>They must think that Lizzie</i>
<i>is this famous singer!</i>

751
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:18,843
And if I show this to my mom,
Lizzie will be so busted!

752
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:22,313
If you show this to your mom,
it's worth nothing.

753
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:26,651
But if you show <i>this</i>
<i>to the Italian tabloids...</i>

754
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:30,321
we will be rolling in cash,
my friend.

755
00:36:30,323 --> 00:36:32,457
Interesting!

756
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:37,562
"We"?

757
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:40,331
Not up to toughing it
out on the streets with
us, miss McGuire?

758
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:43,568
I could try, miss ungermeyer...

759
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,203
<i>No, I just hate seeing you</i>

760
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,238
being denied
the cultural experience

761
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,007
of being in a foreign country.

762
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,442
I mean, you missed seven points

763
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,610
of historical significance
yesterday.

764
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:56,147
I know. It's really
killing me too,
miss ungermeyer.

765
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,317
Which is why I thought
I'd bring you a little something

766
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,186
to help ease the pain, hmm?

767
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:04,322
Mmh, well, that's really
thoughtful of you.

768
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:07,092
Well, seeing as how
your teeny-tiny little body

769
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,460
just doesn't have the strength,

770
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:10,762
we're gonna have to let
your <i>mind</i> do the wandering.

771
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,364
Ah!

772
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:16,568
<i>The rise and decline</i>
<i>of the Roman empire,</i> hmm.

773
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,770
I'd like one report on the rise
<i>and one on the decline.</i>

774
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:20,271
Ouch!

775
00:37:20,273 --> 00:37:23,575
If I didn't have a headache
a minute ago, I do <i>now.</i>

776
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:27,579
You don't have a problem
with that, do you, McGuire?

777
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,447
Um... No.

778
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:32,584
I mean, what else
do I have to do?

779
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:33,251
<i>¶ Why not</i>

780
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,719

<i>¶ you might lose a lot</i>

787
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:47,298
<i>¶ so why not?</i>

788
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,334
<i>¶ Why not?</i>

789
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:52,036
<i>¶ Why not</i>
<i>take a crazy chance? ¶</i>

790
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,540
wow.

791
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,447
Lizzie, I am
so grateful for your help.

792
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,482
You're doing a very kind thing
for Isabella.

793
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,785
Uh, Paolo, where are we?

794
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,019
Via condotti.

795
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,888
It is one of the most expensive
shopping districts

796
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,055
in the whole world.

797
00:38:11,057 --> 00:38:12,924
We must find you the perfect
outfit for the awards.

798
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:16,828
<i>Woman: Ah!</i>

799
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,696
Oh, hey, Isabella, Paolo!

800
00:38:18,698 --> 00:38:20,265
<i>Ciao!</i>

801
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:22,901
Your hair is so blond
and, uh, innocent.

802
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:24,602
Who did it?
Um...

803
00:38:24,604 --> 00:38:27,438
Th... the island that we were on
was really, really sunny,

804
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,240
so it was j-just the sun.

805
00:38:29,242 --> 00:38:30,708
Sun? We must
get sun, too, no?

806
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,076
<i>Ciao, Bella!</i>

807
00:38:32,078 --> 00:38:33,378
<i>Ciao, ciao, ciao.</i>

808
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,146
They are <i>so</i> tall!

809
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,514
You see,
they all want to be <i>you.</i>

810
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:37,782
No, they want to be Isabella.

811
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:39,551
Here, sit and I'll get franca.

812
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:40,852
I will just be a moment.

813
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,489
Whoa! Take your time.

814
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:47,659
<i>I'll just be sitting here</i>
<i>in heaven.</i>

815
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,194
<i>Hard as it is to imagine,</i>

816
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,262
<i>as we look at the crumbling</i>
<i>ruins of the forum,</i>

817
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:53,832
<i>that this was once</i>
<i>the center of commerce,</i>

818
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,768
religion, and politics
in ancient Rome.

819
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,170
All right, now,
the forum came into being

820
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,439
in the sixth century b.C.,

821
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:05,844
and with it,
a new urban culture was born.

822
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,312
<i>Uh, um... Di...</i>

823
00:39:07,314 --> 00:39:08,980
yeah, craft?

824
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:10,448
Is it time for the spaghetti?

825
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,517
It's, like,
9:00 in the morning.

826
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,086
Yeah, so? You never had leftover
spaghetti for breakfast?

827
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,721
I don't eat carbs.

828
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:19,190
Oh, and I suppose you
never had a spaghetti
sandwich, either?

829
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,959
<i>This cultural experience</i>
<i>is, like,</i>

830
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,127
so wasted on you.

831
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:25,930
Excuse me,
where did you buy
that Prada bag?

832
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:29,133
Craft! Sanders!
Separate.

833
00:39:29,135 --> 00:39:31,402
<i>Oh, we did, miss ungermeyer.</i>
<i>And thank God.</i>

834
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:36,040
Why don't you people,
uh, do something at your,

835
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,275
uh, skill level here?

836
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:39,010
Take a ten-minute
shopping break

837
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:41,212
while I choke down an espresso.

838
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:44,382
Whoa, this dude
definitely spent

839
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,850
way too much time on his biceps

840
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:49,220
and not enough on his abs...
totally old school.

841
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,493
<i>Si, si, si.</i>
<i>Uh... Wha...</i>

842
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,995
nice spy, bro.

843
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,596
<i>Yeah, watch and learn.</i>

844
00:39:58,598 --> 00:40:01,466
The slow curve.
Works every time.

845
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,700
I've got to go talk to them.

846
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,602
Hey, bro, that's not how
the slow curve works.

847
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:06,070
<i>They</i> come to <i>us.</i>

848
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:12,076
Um, eh, <i>ciao.</i>

849
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,711
<i>Ciao.</i>
<i>Ciao.</i>

850
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:16,114
Do you guys speak English?

851
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:17,448
Yes.

852
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,584
It is your friend we like.

853
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,219
Word.

854
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:22,921
Word?
Um, is that his name?

855
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,222
Yeah, sure.

856
00:40:24,224 --> 00:40:26,257
Hey, listen, do you guys know
who that is on the cover?

857
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:27,492
Oh, Isabella.

858
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:28,960
<i>Certo.</i>
<i>Certo.</i>

859
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:31,529
Do you think you guys could
translate it for me?

860
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:35,300
Um... Only if
you introduce us to word.

861
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:38,236
Well, can I keep
the magazine, then?

862
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,938
Deal!

863
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,540
All right.
Let's go.

864
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:51,182
<i>Ciao,</i> word.

865
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,318
Word?

866
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:55,553
Mmh?

867
00:40:55,555 --> 00:40:56,688
Franca: English?

868
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,289
Paolo: Yes, she's speaking
only English.

869
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,392
Our new single is in English
and Isabella needs to practice.

870
00:41:03,696 --> 00:41:07,398
What have you done?

871
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
Uh... Uh, uh...

872
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,234
You look...

873
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:12,403
well, you look like
a schoolgirl.

874
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,474
Maximus, what is wrong?

875
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,642
You love Isabella.

876
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,911
<i>Nice Maximus.</i>

877
00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:25,717
Very odd.

878
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,420
There is something...

879
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:32,623
Something very different
about you.

880
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,858
Um...

881
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,193
Rest.

882
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,495
<i>The rest on the island did</i>
<i>Isabella a world of good.</i>

883
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:38,629
She is transformed.

884
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,831
Yeah.

885
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,300
Well, I cannot
put clothes on this.

886
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,534
You... fix the hair.

887
00:41:43,536 --> 00:41:44,769
Fix the eyebrows.

888
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,770
Fix the lips.

889
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:48,339
Oh!
And fix the ears!

890
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,941
Fix the ears?

891
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:52,610
Jewelry.

892
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:53,845
Jewelry.

893
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,648
Now, that's a language
every girl understands.

00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:27,038
<i>¶ on the ru-u-u-nway ¶</i>

950
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:27,839
<i>¶ work ¶</i>

951
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:28,806
<i>¶ oh, yeah</i>

952
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:29,607
<i>¶ work ¶</i>

953
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:31,109
<i>¶ ah ah ah ah</i>

954
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:34,345
<i>¶ ohhhh ¶</i>

955
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:35,847
<i>¶ whoo</i>

956
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:41,052
Okay. Diva... good.

957
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,253
Tacky... bad.

958
00:43:44,523 --> 00:43:47,058
We'll have to fix that.

959
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,703
Okay, <i>none</i> of these are me.

960
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,272
Why are you laughing at me?

961
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:02,940
Because you're not supposed
to be you.

962
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:04,742
Okay, well,
if I have to go onstage

963
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:06,611
in front of an audience
as Isabella,

964
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:08,546
then I-I'm gonna have to
be confident,

965
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:10,615
and that's, like,
the thing I'm worst at.

966
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,016
We are all the same that way.

967
00:44:12,018 --> 00:44:13,251
Not you.

968
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:15,119
Yes, me.
And Isabella, too.

969
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:16,754
But it's how she works
through her fears

970
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:18,289
that makes her strong.

971
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,625
For instance, Isabella doesn't
let franca di montecatini

972
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:22,126
tell her what to wear.

973
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,195
<i>Isabella</i> tells <i>franca.</i>

974
00:44:24,197 --> 00:44:25,997
<i>Okay, so you're telling me</i>

975
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,266
<i>to tell</i>
<i>franca di monteca-teca-tecatini</i>

976
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,567
how...
how I should dress?

977
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:30,568
<i>Si.</i>

978
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,704
<i>Test your strength, Isabella.</i>

979
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:35,573
<i>Vai! Vai, vai.</i>

980
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:38,342
You don't like my clothes?

981
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,878
No. No.
I-I love your clothes.

982
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,713
But I don't want you
to dress me.

983
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:45,082
What?!

984
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:47,218
See, I'm not your Barbie doll.

985
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,053
I am Isabella parigi,

986
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:51,155
and I dress <i>myself.</i>

987
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:52,623
So, choices.

988
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,058
<i>I-I need choices.</i>

989
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:57,762
Whoa.

990
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:02,466
I really like these two.
<i>You</i> pick.

991
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,005
Both.

992
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:09,907
Both.

993
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,375
Wow.

994
00:45:11,377 --> 00:45:13,578
This is the exact same color
that I wore to my spring formal,

995
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,546
<i>and Danny Kessler thought</i>
<i>that I looked...</i>

996
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:16,514
Unh-unh.

997
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:21,586
Look at all of you.
You'd think that I'm American.

998
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:24,355
I am,
how you say, um...

999
00:45:24,357 --> 00:45:25,356
Awesome?

1000
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,262
The island.
You should go more often.

1001
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:32,763
Mmh.

1002
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,266
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1003
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:37,935
whoo! Goodbye, Lizzie McGuire.
Hello, fabulous.

1004
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:41,339
<i>¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1005
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,707
<i>¶ Come on</i>

1006
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:45,409
<i>¶ you make me feel</i>
<i>like a star ¶</i>

1007
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,544
<i>¶ oh, baby</i>

1008
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:49,080
<i>¶ you say, "stay, baby, stay</i>

1009
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,881
<i>¶ just the way you are"</i>

1010
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:53,551
<i>¶ and tell me, "girl, you're</i>
<i>fine and you will shine ¶</i>

1011
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,519
<i>¶ forever in my heart"</i>

1012
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:58,289
<i>¶ that's why you, yeah, you ¶</i>

1013
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:01,792
<i>¶ you make me feel</i>
<i>like a star ¶</i>

1014
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:03,961
<i>¶ ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1015
00:46:03,963 --> 00:46:05,229
there you go.
<i>Grazie.</i>

1016
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:06,230
<i>Grazie.</i>

1017
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,865
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

1018
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,334
I'm ready for my close-up.

1019
00:46:10,336 --> 00:46:11,502
Whoo!

1020
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:16,741
<i>Kate: I cannot believe</i>
<i>that not one Roman guy</i>

1021
00:46:16,743 --> 00:46:18,909
<i>has asked me out yet.</i>

1022
00:46:18,911 --> 00:46:19,910
Ugh.

1023
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:23,114
Look.

1024
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:25,416
Paolo...

1025
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:26,550
We gotta go!

1026
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:31,555
<i>Where's the zoom on this thing?</i>

1027
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:34,125
Uh, uh...

1028
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:39,997
Hello? Excuse me.

1029
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,533
Oh!

1030
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:44,669
I'm sorry.
I was just...

1031
00:46:45,938 --> 00:46:47,905
Hup! Head check!

1032
00:46:47,907 --> 00:46:50,741
Let's go! On the bus,
then back to the hotel!

1033
00:46:50,743 --> 00:46:52,943
Come on! Come on! Go!

1034
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,712
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo!</i>

1035
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:11,095
Giorgio:
<i>Si,</i> hold on one second!

1036
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:12,797
Okay! Hello.

1037
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,966
Hotel cambini.
This is giorgio.

1038
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,803
Go!
Huh? What?

1039
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:20,638
Wait.

1040
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,506
<i>Si.</i>
Excuse me,
can you fix this?

1041
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,041
<i>It will not close.</i>
<i>Ah, but, uh...</i>

1042
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,110
Why is it open
when there is no rain?

1043
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:28,979
This umbrella is very stubborn.

1044
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:31,048
<i>Please, it's bad luck to have</i>
<i>an open umbrella inside.</i>
<i>Go! Go!</i>

1045
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,918
<i>No, in the hotel cambini,</i>
<i>there is no bad luck.</i>
<i>Hey, thanks.</i>

1046
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,486
<i>Ah!</i>

1047
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:41,192
<i>Ungermeyer: All right, people,</i>
<i>one at a time. No running.</i>

1048
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,629
Ha ha ha!

1049
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:49,200
Ha! Ha ha!
Age before beauty, huh?

1050
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:53,637
Oh. You look strangely large
and familiar.

1051
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:54,905
Which floor?

1052
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:57,108
Oh. Thank you.
First.

1053
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,175
Okay.

1054
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:02,346
Little hint for you...

1055
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,448
you want to push the button,
elevator moves.

1056
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:07,618
Elevator is not safe.

1057
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,053
You an employee here?

1058
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:10,821
No.
No.

1059
00:48:10,823 --> 00:48:13,357
Well, then, who are you
to tell me whether or not
the elevator's safe?

1060
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,759
I am Sergei.

1061
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,527
Sergei.

1062
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:19,363
Well, Sergei, you're gonna
have to stand down immediately.

1063
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,302
Just because you are one hunk
of slavic muscle

1064
00:48:25,304 --> 00:48:27,738
does not mean you're not
gonna make it on my list!

1065
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,541
Elevator is safe now.

1066
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,051
Hey! Your umbrella!

1067
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,661
Feeling any better?

1068
00:48:50,663 --> 00:48:51,796
Mom?

1069
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:56,333
Still a little warm.

1070
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:58,335
Miss Sanders,
would you be so kind

1071
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,070
as to look after her for me?

1072
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:01,806
"Look after her"
as in do stuff for her?

1073
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,641
Miss ungermeyer,
why should I be punished?

1074
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:04,909
I'm not the one who's sick.

1075
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:07,344
Next year, I'm joining
the mouth breathers

1076
00:49:07,346 --> 00:49:08,946
at water-slide wonderland.

1077
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:12,917
You are so busted. You've been
out of this hotel room.

1078
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:14,051
What?

1079
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,287
How do you know?

1080
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:17,555
Please...

1081
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:20,925
Your eyebrows finally match,
your hair has highlights...

1082
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,626
Fresh manicure.

1083
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:26,030
I smelled acetone
the second I walked
in the lobby.

1084
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:29,500
Okay, but you
didn't rat me out
to miss ungermeyer.

1085
00:49:29,502 --> 00:49:30,601
Yet.

1086
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:33,137
Not until I figure out
what's in it for me.

1087
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,605
Now spill, dorkerella.

1088
00:49:37,576 --> 00:49:40,478
You'll <i>never</i> make me talk!

1089
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,180
I-I know that this
sounds insane, but...

1090
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:45,583
I think Paolo
really does like me.

1091
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:48,219
How could this happen?
How did <i>you</i> get <i>my</i> trip?

1092
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:50,588
How is Lizzie McGuire
living this fantasy

1093
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,656
and I can't even get
an Italian boy

1094
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:54,558
to buy me a plate of spaghetti?

1095
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,794
Um, Kate,
you don't eat spaghetti.

1096
00:49:56,895 --> 00:50:00,831
I'd eat carbs if an Italian boy
bought them for me.

1097
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:03,367
<i>So...</i>

1098
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,537
<i>I suppose you want me</i>
<i>to keep quiet about this?</i>

1099
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:09,673
Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

1100
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,108
Well, I'll keep it quiet

1101
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,577
if you keep it quiet
about me keeping it quiet.

1102
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:15,513
And...

1103
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:17,181
<i>When we get back home,</i>
<i>I'm the cool one again,</i>

1104
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:18,983
and you turn
back into a pumpkin.

1105
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,119
Oh, my God.
It's her.

1106
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:23,420
What are you doing?

1107
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:25,556
Uh, it's a long story.

1108
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:27,992
What do you want?
We're closed.

1109
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:31,462
Uh, I-I just wanted
to talk to Lizzie.

1110
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:32,530
<i>So talk.</i>

1111
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:35,199
I was kind of thinking maybe,

1112
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,901
you know,
outside in the courtyard.

1113
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:39,637
If this is about that whole
bizarre, parallel-universe,

1114
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:42,139
Italian-rock-star,
Lizzie's-suddenly-a-diva thing,

1115
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:43,841
I know all about it.

1116
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:45,175
She figured it out.

1117
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,712
Evil <i>and</i> smart.

1118
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:50,381
Embrace it. Fear it.

1119
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,616
I thought you might want
to take a look at this.

1120
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:54,251
I'm on the front cover
of a tabloid!

1121
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:55,419
Ha!

1122
00:50:55,421 --> 00:50:57,521
I wish to thank everyone

1123
00:50:57,523 --> 00:51:01,058
who's always believed in me
for this great honor.

1124
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,159
Do you know what that says?

1125
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,161
<i>It says that Paolo and Isabella</i>

1126
00:51:04,163 --> 00:51:06,664
are supposed to be <i>singing</i>
<i>at the music awards.</i>

1127
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,266
Well, it's got to be a mistake.

1128
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:11,268
Oh, I had some Italian girls
translate it.

1129
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,703
<i>Paolo didn't tell you?</i>

1130
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:13,871
Mmh, no.

1131
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:15,005
Don't you think
it's kind of weird

1132
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:16,106
that he tried to hide this
from you?

1133
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:17,575
Oh, my...
can you believe it?

1134
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,577
Maybe it's just
a last-minute thing, gordo.

1135
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,513
Aren't these things planned
for, like, months in advance?

1136
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:24,415
Gordo, when did you become
an expert

1137
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:26,116
on Italian award show thingies?

1138
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:28,752
It's called common sense,
Lizzie, which I happen
to have a lot of

1139
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:31,455
to make up for my lack
of the slow curve.

1140
00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:32,723
Slow curve?

1141
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:34,625
<i>Forget it. Look...</i>

1142
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:36,260
If you want to believe
some Italian kid

1143
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:37,728
that you think you know
after two days

1144
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,863
because he's
an international superstar,

1145
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:41,799
is really rich,
and has nice hair...

1146
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:42,800
<i>Be my guest.</i>

1147
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:43,867
Gordo...

1148
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,244
Oh, my God! He's early!

1149
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:02,052
Lizzie...

1150
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:03,787
Oh, my God,
I gotta go get dressed.

1151
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:05,155
Oh, don't worry.

1152
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,257
I'll cover for you
in case miss ungermeyer
does one of her

1153
00:52:07,259 --> 00:52:09,293
psycho, middle-of-the-night,
head-check things.

1154
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:11,028
Thanks. I owe you.

1155
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,062
Duh!

1156
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:20,638
Mom, dad, I found something
on the Internet

1157
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,539
I think you both should see.

1158
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,841
What is it?

1159
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:25,743
Well, since Lizzie's in Europe,

1160
00:52:25,745 --> 00:52:28,245
I thought I'd do
a little e-search on Italy.

1161
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:29,346
That's nice, son.

1162
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:30,814
<i>But what I found out...</i>

1163
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:32,549
it's not so e-assuring.

1164
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,085
<i>In fact...</i>

1165
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:37,254
It may shock you.

1166
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,490
<i>What are we looking at?</i>

1167
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:41,258
<i>Maybe nothing, and, uh...</i>

1168
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,760
Maybe something.

1169
00:52:42,762 --> 00:52:45,362
You see, when polled,

1170
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:48,532
74% of Italian teenage boys

1171
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:52,002
<i>said they would most like</i>
<i>to date American girls.</i>

1172
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:54,371
Where'd you get these numbers?

1173
00:52:54,373 --> 00:52:57,107
They're available for anyone
who has a computer.

1174
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,743
<i>You don't have to</i>
<i>worry about your sister, son.</i>

1175
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:02,279
She's very well-chaperoned.
Miss ungermeyer's there.

1176
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:06,216
Yeah, what is she...
5'1 ", 5'2" Max?

1177
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,988
Oh, please.

1178
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:14,291
Matt, as interesting
as this is,

1179
00:53:14,293 --> 00:53:16,026
where are you taking it?

1180
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:18,662
All right, you caught me.

1181
00:53:18,664 --> 00:53:19,697
I always do.

1182
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:22,032
I don't know why I even try.

1183
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:26,336
I'll deny
I ever said this, but...

1184
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:29,473
I miss my sister.

1185
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:31,308
<i>There. I said it.</i>

1186
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,077
Now you know.

1187
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,880
<i>I know I rag on her</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

1188
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:40,517
but now that she's gone,
I... I...

1189
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:41,985
Oh, honey...

1190
00:53:41,987 --> 00:53:43,220
We miss her, too.

1191
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:45,322
So, so much.

1192
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:47,658
I feel so alone!

1193
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,327
Oh! Li...
listen to me.

1194
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:53,864
You don't have to
make fake pie charts.

1195
00:53:53,866 --> 00:53:56,734
You just come to us
with the truth, okay?

1196
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:58,869
I know that now, mom.

1197
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:01,572
It's just so hard.

1198
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:02,840
I miss her so much!

1199
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:03,841
Oh!

1200
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:07,077
I can't believe
I let you talk me into

1201
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,380
Letting her go
on that trip!

1202
00:54:10,382 --> 00:54:12,149
I'll go get the passports.

1203
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:13,450
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1204
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:15,786
Shh.

1205
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:17,921
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1206
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,695
Ah, hmm, ah.

1207
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,431
Hmm...

1208
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:29,199
Uh...

1209
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:33,337
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmmm.

1210
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:45,415
Hmm?

1211
00:54:48,186 --> 00:54:49,386
Hmm.

1212
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:50,454
Hmm!

1213
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:01,999
Paolo.

1214
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:03,000
<i>Si.</i>

1215
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,302
What is this?

1216
00:55:05,304 --> 00:55:07,337
Uh... A car.

1217
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:11,008
Look...

1218
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,576
Are we supposed to sing?

1219
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:13,744
<i>Scusa?</i>

1220
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:17,347
Don't speak to me in Italian.

1221
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,749
It's too adorable.

1222
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,920
Are Paolo and Isabella
supposed to sing at the awards?

1223
00:55:22,922 --> 00:55:24,788
<i>Si.</i>

1224
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,191
<i>Si?!</i> Well,
why didn't you tell me?

1225
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:29,993
I wanted to tell you,
but you told me not to
telephone the hotel.

1226
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:31,195
Come on, come on, get in.

1227
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:33,330
<i>I'll explain everything</i>
<i>on the way.</i>

1228
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:36,466
<i>I want to show you</i>
<i>the tivoli gardens</i>
<i>before sunset.</i>

1229
00:55:36,468 --> 00:55:37,534
Come on.

1230
00:55:37,536 --> 00:55:39,469
<i>We have to get you</i>
<i>back by 10:00.</i>

1231
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:40,971
Okay.

1232
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:46,677
So, where is Sergei?

1233
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,712
You're not the only one
who sneaks off at night.

1234
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:01,124
Paolo: Isabella and I
<i>were</i> going to sing,

1235
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:03,093
but after Isabella
would not speak to me,

1236
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:05,195
I told the producers
we refuse to perform.

1237
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:07,297
I said Isabella
had throat problems.

1238
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:09,032
So, what happened?

1239
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,434
I mean, what changed?

1240
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:11,935
Isabella did.

1241
00:56:11,937 --> 00:56:14,671
The real Isabella
or me Isabella?

1242
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:17,708
You... a reporter heard
her speaking in front
of the gelato shop,

1243
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,476
and he reported
Isabella's voice was fine.

1244
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:21,511
And he said her English
was very good, by the way.

1245
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:23,180
But then
the record company called,

1246
00:56:23,182 --> 00:56:25,682
and now they're going to sue
if we don't sing.

1247
00:56:25,684 --> 00:56:27,084
What?

1248
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:29,152
So, they're gonna
make you sing?

1249
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:30,888
I... I mean, <i>us</i> sing?

1250
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,156
Don't worry, <i>carina.</i>
<i>I'll make this work.</i>

1251
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,324
Look.

1252
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,609
Ah!

1253
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:57,114
Look, Paolo, I-I don't think
this is going to work.

1254
00:56:57,116 --> 00:56:59,750
I mean, I cannot sing
in front of an audience.

1255
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:02,486
I won't even let my mom
hear me sing in the shower.

1256
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:04,855
Lizzie, I will teach you
all you need to know.

1257
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:06,156
Okay.

1258
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:09,626
So, what is Isabella gonna do
when she sees me being her?

1259
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:11,295
Ah, but she won't...
she's off on some island

1260
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,529
trying to get over all of this.

1261
00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:13,530
Come on.

1262
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,941
Here's my vow to you.

1263
00:57:23,943 --> 00:57:25,609
I, Paolo valisari,

1264
00:57:25,611 --> 00:57:27,911
will never let you,
Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.

1265
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:30,380
If I fail...

1266
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:33,583
I have to spend
seven days with that
scary head-check woman.

1267
00:57:33,585 --> 00:57:36,887
Her name's
miss ungermeyer.

1268
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:38,422
<i>Carina...</i>

1269
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,757
Hasn't everything
I've promised you come to be?

1270
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,326
Everyone believes
you are Isabella,

1271
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:44,661
you are having the time of
your life being someone else.

1272
00:57:44,663 --> 00:57:47,464
You even
told franca di montecatini
to buzz off!

1273
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:52,936
Don't you trust that we can
do the singing together?

1274
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,674
I guess.

1275
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:59,276
Well, you shouldn't.

1276

Hey.

00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:51,388
What do you got there,
little man?

1315
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,223
Uh, nothing.
What's this?

1316
00:59:53,225 --> 00:59:54,891
Uh, that's not Lizzie!
No!

1317
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:56,493
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

1318
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:59,029
I know my daughter.
I gave her that necklace.

1319
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:02,032
All right... tell me
what you know that I don't.

1320
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:05,368
It's only
a 14-hour flight, dad.

1321

<i>All right, people,</i>
<i>swallow those biscotti.</i>

1322
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:15,245
<i>We got a big day...</i>
<i>the pantheon, the colosseum.</i>

1323
01:00:15,247 --> 01:00:16,246
Oh.

1324
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:17,848
Uh, halt!

1325
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,150
Got to get these apricots
to McGuire.

1326
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:22,152
She looked sick as a dog
this morning.

1327
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:25,655
Mr. Gordon,
you having a problem?

1328
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:27,157
N-no, I just...

1329
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:28,658
I-I'm starting to agree
with Ethan.

1330
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,494
I-I think we need to eat
more spaghetti.

1331
01:00:30,496 --> 01:00:31,695
You da man!

1332
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,931
Sorry.

1333
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,800
Mr. Gordon,
is there a reason

1334
01:00:36,802 --> 01:00:38,135
you don't want me to go
upstairs?

1335
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:40,971
No, I-I just really think
we should get going.

1336
01:00:40,973 --> 01:00:44,174
Uh, so much <i>roma,</i>
<i>so little time-a.</i>

1337
01:00:44,176 --> 01:00:46,276
Well, you know,
when I get upstairs...

1338
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:49,246
and I <i>will</i> get upstairs...

1339
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:51,882
I expect to find miss McGuire
in her bed.

1340
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,186
Well, you... she may
be in the bathroom
or... or something.

1341
01:00:56,188 --> 01:00:58,255
You know, I'm beginning
to get the feeling

1342
01:00:58,257 --> 01:01:01,124
she was never sick
to begin with.

1343
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:02,792
No, no, no!
She... she was!

1344
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:05,128
You know, I bet
this whole thing was
just a clever ruse

1345
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,064
to sneak out of this hotel,
wasn't it?

1346
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,301
Yeah, it... it was.

1347
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:12,669
It was?

1348
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:16,306
Well, Lizzie and I were
talking about adventures,

1349
01:01:16,308 --> 01:01:17,474
and, uh, I don't know.

1350
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:19,142
Ah, spit it out, Gordon.

1351
01:01:19,144 --> 01:01:21,811
Lizzie's upstairs.
It... it's me.

1352
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:23,680
I'm the one
who's been sneaking out.

1353
01:01:23,682 --> 01:01:24,514
<i>You?</i>

1354
01:01:24,516 --> 01:01:25,682
But... but...

1355
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:29,386
<i>feels good</i>
<i>to get it off my chest.</i>

1356
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:32,022
You realize what this means?

1357
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:37,260
I...Shouldn't look to you
for a college recommendation?

1358
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:40,230
You should look
for your suitcase, Gordon.

1359
01:01:40,232 --> 01:01:41,565
You're goin' home.

1360
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:44,568
<i>Oh, I pegged you</i>

David Gordon...

1362
01:01:45,871 --> 01:01:48,872
sneaky little brownnoser
with a hidden agenda.

1363
01:01:49,407 --> 01:01:51,708
Well, you're busted.

1364
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:58,949
Love lifts us up
where we belong.

1365
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:12,462
Wow. This place is so cool.

And here is where, exactly?

1370
01:02:19,137 --> 01:02:20,537
It's the rehearsal hall.

1371
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:23,206
But the colosseum
will look more like this.

1372
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,274
Sergei!

1373

01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38,435

01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:50,013

<i>¶ Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!</i>

1426
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,111
Hey!

1427
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:25,014
Oh, I'm glad you're up.
I had the most amazing night.

1428
01:06:25,016 --> 01:06:27,750
I'm gonna go grab gordo
so I can tell you guys
together, okay?

1429
01:06:27,752 --> 01:06:29,018
You won't find him.

1430
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,820
What?

1431
01:06:30,822 --> 01:06:32,188
Why? Where'd he go?

1432
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,158
Probably getting on a plane
right now.

1433
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,526
Why?

1434
01:06:36,528 --> 01:06:38,027
<i>He totally covered for you</i>

1435
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:39,896
<i>and got himself</i>
<i>kicked off the trip.</i>

1436
01:06:39,898 --> 01:06:42,198
I-I don't believe it.

1437
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,033
W-why would he do that?

1438
01:06:44,035 --> 01:06:46,936
You're seriously asking
that question?

1439
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:55,512
Giorgio, you've got to call
the airline

1440
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:56,980
<i>and see if gordo's plane</i>
<i>has left yet!</i>

1441
01:06:56,982 --> 01:06:58,314
D-do you know what flight
he's on?

1442
01:06:58,316 --> 01:06:59,682
<i>Si, si.</i>

1443
01:06:59,684 --> 01:07:01,117
I will call.

1444
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:04,654
I cannot believe that gordo
would do this for me.

1445
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:06,456
M-maybe he's not
on the plane yet!

1446
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,458
Maybe I could go to the airport
and I could...

1447
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,193
And... What?

1448
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:13,496
I don't know.

1449
01:07:13,498 --> 01:07:16,132
I am now on hold.

1450
01:07:16,134 --> 01:07:17,967
<i>Woman on p.A. System:</i>
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

1451

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:07:34,652 --> 01:07:37,053
Mm-hmm.

01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:39,889

01:07:46,998 --> 01:07:48,565
Thank you very nice.

1461
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:51,167
The plane is gone.

1462
01:08:24,335 --> 01:08:26,102
Who is this girl?

1463
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:28,004
I have been relaxing
on the island,

1464
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:30,540
<i>trying to forget</i>
<i>about this whole situation.</i>
<i>Excu... Isabella!</i>

1465
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:32,875
Can somebody please tell me
what is going on?

1466
01:08:32,877 --> 01:08:35,311
I can. That's my friend
Lizzie McGuire.

1467
01:08:35,313 --> 01:08:37,246
<i>Hey!</i>

1468
01:08:37,248 --> 01:08:38,581
Hey!

1469
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,916
Let him go.
Let him go.

1470
01:08:39,918 --> 01:08:42,218
I demand for you to tell me
everything you know

1471
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,620
about this Lizzie McGuire.

1472
01:08:43,622 --> 01:08:45,955
I demand for you to tell me
everything there is to know

1473
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:48,257
about this...
this Paolo valisari.

1474
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:51,260
I left him and all
of my thoughts about
him on the island.

1475
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:53,262
Well, you may have left <i>him</i>
<i>on the island,</i>

1476
01:08:53,264 --> 01:08:55,431
but my friend Lizzie is
out there pretending to be you

1477
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:57,033
so that you don't get sued.

1478
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:01,004
We need to talk in private.

1479
01:09:02,607 --> 01:09:05,408
<i>Gordo's life is ruined</i>
<i>because of me...</i>

1480
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,243
selfish me!

1481
01:09:07,245 --> 01:09:08,778
So what are you gonna do now?

1482
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,613
It's over.

1483
01:09:10,615 --> 01:09:12,782
I'm going to turn myself in
to miss ungermeyer.

1484
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,919
Lizzie, you'll get sent home,

1485
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:18,855
and then you won't be able
to help Paolo.

1486
01:09:18,857 --> 01:09:20,923
Okay, well,
I'm never going to be able

1487
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:23,092
to get through this
the way I feel now.

1488
01:09:23,094 --> 01:09:24,927
Okay. Fine. Quit.

1489
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:27,964
But then everything gordo did
will be for nothing.

1490
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:35,705
Now, you know things are bad
when <i>Kate</i> starts making sense.

1491
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:37,373
I know one thing's for sure.

1492
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,541
What?

1493
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:40,777
I'm not gonna have to
act sick today.

1494
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:16,879
<i>Mr. craft, you are in</i>
<i>the most historic</i>

1495
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,148
and beautiful city
in the world.

1496
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,084
<i>Has that had no effect on you?</i>

1497
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:22,585
Well, actually, it has.

1498
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:24,787
The cobblestones
are shredding my wheels.

1499
01:10:24,789 --> 01:10:27,223
Switched to a pair
of birdhouse pterodactyls.

1500
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:30,827
Have you even made a dent
in your reading list?

1501
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:32,395
I finished it.

1502
01:10:32,397 --> 01:10:34,230
You read 11 books?

1503
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:36,432
I mean I read the list.

1504
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,442
Shh.

1505
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,279
Shh.

1506
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:53,783
McGuire.

1507
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:55,618
Lizzie McGuire.

1508
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,755
<i>Si, si,</i>
<i>we are in the travel guides.</i>

1509
01:10:58,757 --> 01:11:00,089
No. No.

1510
01:11:00,091 --> 01:11:01,591
No.

1511
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:05,628
We're the parents of Lizzie.

1512
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,963
Ah! <i>Si!</i>

1513
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:12,468
Uh, I'll call a cab.
It's very far.

1514
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,904
Anybody else want to step up
to the plate?

1515
01:11:14,906 --> 01:11:16,239
Who's asking for McGuire?

1516
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,308
I've left you
four messages already,

1517
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:22,779
but she's been under
my watchful eye all the while.

1518
01:11:22,781 --> 01:11:24,781
Where'd Sanders go?
Hmm.

1519
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:27,383
Lizzie? Sweetheart?

1520
01:11:27,385 --> 01:11:29,318
Honey?

1521
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:31,988
Cool!

1522
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:37,426
<i>Where is Lizzie?</i>

1523
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:39,395
And do you have
any embarrassing photos

1524
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:41,831
<i>or videos of her</i>
<i>while she's been here?</i>

1525
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:42,899
Ow.

1526
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:44,000
Uh...

1527
01:11:44,002 --> 01:11:45,468
You better tell us
where Lizzie is,

1528
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:47,270
or this deck's gonna catch
some serious air.

1529
01:11:47,272 --> 01:11:48,504
<i>Well, it's possible</i>
<i>that she's at</i>

1530
01:11:48,506 --> 01:11:50,239
the international
music video awards

1531
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:52,441
doubling for an Italian
pop star named Isabella,

1532
01:11:52,443 --> 01:11:54,110
<i>who's, like, totally her twin.</i>

1533
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:58,514
Why does everyone
always look at me like that?

1534
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:07,323

He said for you to enter

and I must enter

1557
01:13:31,509 --> 01:13:33,009
And what about my dress?

1558
01:13:33,011 --> 01:13:34,644
I-I still have to get dressed
and everything.

1559

1566
01:13:50,428 --> 01:13:51,694
We've rehearsed this.

What are you doing here?

1577
01:14:19,524 --> 01:14:21,691
Lizzie, Lizzie, that's...
that's not important right now.

1578
01:14:21,693 --> 01:14:23,359
Y-you need to listen
to me.

1579
01:14:23,361 --> 01:14:24,961
Of course it's important!
I feel so bad.

1580
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:26,929
I cannot believe
that you would do that for me.

1581
01:14:26,931 --> 01:14:29,098
Wait a minute.
Why aren't you gone?
<i>It's a long story, but...</i>

1582
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,599
okay, well, I want to hear
all about it,

1583
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:31,834
<i>but I've got to go get</i>
<i>my dress on, okay?</i>

1584
01:14:31,836 --> 01:14:33,169
Lizzie, listen to me.

1585
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,404
Paolo is setting you up.

1586
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,441
What are you talking about?

1587
01:14:38,443 --> 01:14:39,508
<i>Actually...</i>

1588
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,043
He is setting <i>me</i> up.

1589
01:14:46,717 --> 01:14:48,718
Freaky, huh?

1590
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,619
<i>Way</i> freaky.

1591
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:52,989
Way, <i>way</i> freaky.

1592
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:55,891
That whole story
about Paolo doing his own music

1593
01:14:55,893 --> 01:14:57,193
<i>and going solo...</i>

1594
01:14:57,195 --> 01:14:58,594
that's Isabella.

1595
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:00,429
<i>She's the one that sings live.</i>

1596
01:15:00,431 --> 01:15:03,499
<i>Si.</i> Paolo is the one
that lip-synchs, not me.

1597
01:15:03,501 --> 01:15:05,434
<i>Isabella is the one</i>
<i>that wants to quit the act.</i>

1598
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:07,036
Paolo I-is just a liar.

1599
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:08,971
<i>This has all been</i>
<i>some crazy scheme</i>

1600
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:10,973
to set you up
and embarrass you onstage

1601
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,142
<i>so it looks</i>
<i>like Isabella can't sing.</i>

1602
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:14,710
<i>Si, si.</i> It's true.

1603
01:15:14,712 --> 01:15:17,046
<i>Paolo wants to destroy</i>
<i>Isabella's career.</i>

1604
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:22,151
But Paolo would never
do that to me.

1605
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:23,486
I don't believe you.

1606
01:15:25,023 --> 01:15:26,522
Isabella...

1607
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:33,162
Lizzie, who are you
going to believe,

1608
01:15:33,164 --> 01:15:34,997
this boy you are knowing
your whole life

1609
01:15:34,999 --> 01:15:38,834
<i>or... This boy you are</i>
<i>just meeting who says...</i>

1610
01:15:38,836 --> 01:15:41,670
"You shine with the light
from the sun"?

1611
01:16:14,371 --> 01:16:18,908
Okay. Well, then,
you're here now,
so go and sing.

1612
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,076
But I am not blond.

1613
01:16:20,078 --> 01:16:21,577
Paolo will know that it's me,

1614
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:23,179
and he'll make an excuse
to leave.

1615
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:25,681
<i>But if we want to</i>
<i>get back at him</i>

1616
01:16:25,683 --> 01:16:28,084
<i>in front of the whole world</i>
<i>on live TV,</i>

1617
01:16:28,086 --> 01:16:29,046
we must make him sing...

1618
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:31,554
and <i>really</i> sing,
not lip-synch.

1619
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:33,055
But how?
What am I supposed to do?

1620
01:16:33,057 --> 01:16:34,256
I can't sing live!

1621
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,993
Change! Change!

1622
01:16:37,995 --> 01:16:39,128
Change your clothes

1623
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:41,530
and go up there and do
what you rehearsed, okay?

1624
01:16:41,532 --> 01:16:43,732
Everything will be fine.
I-I promise.

1625
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,701
<i>I have a plan.</i>
<i>What plan?</i>

1626
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:47,403
<i>Man:</i>
<i>28 minutes till showtime.</i>

1627
01:16:47,405 --> 01:16:49,505
So, what's the plan?

1628
01:16:49,507 --> 01:16:50,840
I don't know.

1629
01:16:50,842 --> 01:16:52,308
Okay.

1630
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,944
No, see, it doesn't matter
about the tickets,

1631
01:16:54,946 --> 01:16:57,346
because my daughter is
back there

1632
01:16:57,348 --> 01:16:59,014
impersonating
a famous pop star,

1633
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:00,516
so... I got to get in!

1634
01:17:00,518 --> 01:17:01,817
That's what everyone says.

1635
01:17:01,819 --> 01:17:03,085
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Enough of this!</i>

1636
01:17:07,091 --> 01:17:08,257
Uhh!
Uhh!

1637
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:09,758
Ha! Let's go!

1638
01:17:12,964 --> 01:17:15,598
Sandro, did Paolo bring
the voice track for me tonight?

1639
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,134
No. No, he did not.
There is no track.

1640
01:17:18,136 --> 01:17:21,137
Paolo, he says
you're gonna sing live,
like you always do.

1641
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:26,242
<i>Paolo and Isabella!</i>

1642
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:39,622
Sandro, turn down
Isabella's mic.

1643
01:17:39,624 --> 01:17:41,757
What's that?
Turn down the mic!

1644
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:57,273
<i>¶ Have you ever seen</i>

Okay.

1655
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,375
Say <i>buonasera</i> to my
new American friend,
Lizzie McGuire!

<i>into thinking</i>
<i>that I could not sing.</i>

1658
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,550
Lizzie McGuire is nice girl.
You try to hurt her.

1659
01:19:14,552 --> 01:19:16,752
Let me go, Sergei.
<i>You</i> work for <i>me.</i>

1660
01:19:16,754 --> 01:19:18,954
Not anymore, Paolo.

<i>Paolo!</i>

1662
01:19:21,192 --> 01:19:25,294
Paolo cannot sing music.
Now he must face music.

1663
01:19:25,296 --> 01:19:27,763
<i>- Was it all a lie?</i>
<i>- No, it's just...</i>

1735
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,876
<i>Lizzie got everything</i>
<i>you're supposed to get</i>

1736
01:24:40,878 --> 01:24:42,544
when you go to Europe...

1737
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:45,047
<i>adventure, romance,</i>
<i>total confidence.</i>

1738
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:46,248
Yeah?

1739
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:50,085
Well... If all that can happen
to Lizzie McGuire,

1740
01:24:50,087 --> 01:24:52,454
<i>the only thing i know now is...</i>

1741
01:24:52,456 --> 01:24:54,289
I don't know <i>anything.</i>

1742
01:24:54,291 --> 01:24:55,958
That's hot.

1743
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,492
<i>What?</i>

1744
01:24:57,494 --> 01:25:00,896
Girls who think they know
everything are just a turnoff.

1745
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,532
Really?

1746
01:25:03,534 --> 01:25:05,133
Oh, totally.

1747
01:25:05,135 --> 01:25:07,402
Like, what about you
not ratting out Lizzie?

1748
01:25:07,404 --> 01:25:11,540
I mean, that was just so...

1749
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:12,874
Not you.

1750
01:25:27,056 --> 01:25:28,657
That's good.

1751
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:29,658
<i>Si.</i>

1752
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,560
Aaaaaaah!

1753
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:37,065
Mom, dad, I'm so glad
that you guys made it.

1754
01:25:37,067 --> 01:25:38,800
You would have never
believed me.

1755
01:25:38,802 --> 01:25:40,769
<i>That is for sure.</i>
<i>I thought</i>
<i>after you found out</i>

1756
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:42,938
all the things that I did,
I would be grounded.

1757
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,874
You're grounded for the rest
of the summer, sweetheart.

1758
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:48,210
But we're really proud of you.

1759
01:25:51,749 --> 01:25:53,582
You know, lying,
even for a good reason,

1760
01:25:53,584 --> 01:25:54,883
is beneath you, Gordon.

1761
01:25:54,885 --> 01:25:56,385
Yeah.
I know. I know.

1762
01:25:56,387 --> 01:25:59,321
I'm a lying, spineless,
brownnosing jellyfish

1763
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:01,657
with a hidden agenda...
I got it.

1764
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:04,159
Well, that may be true,
but I'll tell you something.

1765
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:06,461
Little miss diva over there
told me everything.

1766
01:26:06,463 --> 01:26:09,931
The way I see it, you're
a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.

1767
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:13,001
And loyalty goes a long way
with the ungermeyer.

1768
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:14,169
Hmm?
Thanks.

1769
01:26:16,973 --> 01:26:20,776
Hey, just think about it...

1770
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:22,277
we got four years
of high school

1771
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:23,779
to look forward to
together, huh?

1772
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:25,447
Ooh. Sammies.

1773
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,184
Sergei is hungry.

1774
01:26:29,186 --> 01:26:31,520
So is miss ungermeyer.

1775
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:36,558
You are strong woman.

1776
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,728
You protect cubs like lioness.

1777
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:41,496
Sergei is impressed.

1778
01:26:41,498 --> 01:26:44,833
Hmm.
You're still on my list.

1779
01:26:44,835 --> 01:26:46,935
As long as I am at the top.

1780
01:26:49,339 --> 01:26:51,006
Hey, there!

1781
01:26:51,008 --> 01:26:54,209
I bet you're wondering...
who is this Lizzie McGuire

1782
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:55,610
and where did she come from

1783
01:26:55,612 --> 01:26:58,313
and what are her
most <i>embarrassing</i> moments?

1784
01:26:58,315 --> 01:27:02,851
Well, I can give you
total access to all of that

1785
01:27:02,853 --> 01:27:05,520
for a <i>very</i> competitive price.

1786
01:27:05,522 --> 01:27:07,489
Hmm. When in Rome...

1787
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:10,092
Yeah, yeah.
Do as the romans do, right?

1788
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:11,093
No.

1789
01:27:11,095 --> 01:27:13,895
We do not blackmail
our sisters.

1790
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,531
As a former commander
in the Italian Navy,

1791
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:19,768
I am ordering you
to leave the country.

1792
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:20,769
No!

1793
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:29,911
Hey.

1794
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:34,616
So...

1795
01:27:34,618 --> 01:27:37,119
One last sneak-away
for old times' sake?

1796
01:27:37,121 --> 01:27:38,620
Yeah. Sounds good.

1797
01:27:38,622 --> 01:27:40,622
Okay.

1798
01:27:42,559 --> 01:27:43,558
Aha.

1799
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,727
No!

1800
01:27:51,902 --> 01:27:54,069
So, are you gonna miss it here?

1801
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:55,237
I don't know.

1802
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:56,972
Kate says
that I should just stay

1803
01:27:56,974 --> 01:27:58,707
and have my stuff
shipped over from home,

1804
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:00,909
because when I leave here,
it'll never be the same.

1805
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:02,444
Well, she's wrong, as usual.

1806
01:28:02,446 --> 01:28:05,046
You didn't have to be in Rome
for all this to happen.

1807
01:28:05,048 --> 01:28:07,015
You think?

1808
01:28:07,017 --> 01:28:08,416
Trust me.

1809
01:28:08,418 --> 01:28:10,585
You had it in you
the whole time.

1810
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,025
Gordo?

1811
01:28:17,027 --> 01:28:18,527
What?

1812
01:28:24,968 --> 01:28:26,635
Thanks.

1813
01:28:26,637 --> 01:28:28,804
You're welcome.

1814
01:28:32,275 --> 01:28:33,508
Yeah.

1815
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,511
So, um... Want to get back
to that party

1816
01:28:36,513 --> 01:28:38,346
so we don't get
in any more trouble?

1817
01:28:38,348 --> 01:28:40,849
Yeah. I can't afford
any more... more trouble.

1818
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,017
Yeah.

1819
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:21,857
