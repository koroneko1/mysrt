00:49.666 --> 00:52.234
Hang on. I know.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.269
Mm.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.605
You're doing so good.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.507
You're doing so good.
You all right?

00:58.508 --> 01:00.309
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.312
<i>Dr. Matthews to the nurses' station.</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.047
Excuse me.

01:05.048 --> 01:09.251
My wife's in labor.
We called ahead for Dr. Wheeler.

01:09.252 --> 01:11.843
I just need you to fill this out, please.

01:12.622 --> 01:15.349
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, hon.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.565
- I'll be right up.
- Yeah.

01:23.566 --> 01:27.158
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:27.637 --> 01:30.967
- Is this your first?
- No, no, it's our third.

01:30.974 --> 01:33.132
Sir, can you sign here?

01:34.410 --> 01:38.002
We're gonna name her Jessica.

02:07.911 --> 02:10.138
Vitals look good.

02:12.816 --> 02:14.449
Where's John?

02:14.450 --> 02:17.085
- Where's my husband?
- Just relax now.

02:17.086 --> 02:19.119
Everything's gonna be okay.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.629
What's happening?
What are you doing?

02:27.630 --> 02:29.198
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:29.199 --> 02:31.466
- What?
- Your baby's dead.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.869
No, it's not dead. It's alive.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.938
What are you talking about?
It's moving.

02:35.939 --> 02:39.274
It's a terrible loss. We're so sorry.

02:39.275 --> 02:42.878
- Just relax.
- No!

02:42.879 --> 02:45.914
What? No, no, no. Put me to sleep.
I wanna be asleep.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.848
- It's too late for that.
- No!

02:52.956 --> 02:55.080
It's okay, you're doing great.

02:55.358 --> 02:57.492
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

02:57.493 --> 02:59.720
You might feel some tugging.

03:05.168 --> 03:07.970
Oh, my God. This isn't happening.

03:09.405 --> 03:13.075
Congratulations, Mrs. Coleman.
It's a girl.

04:28.551 --> 04:32.220
Yes, Kate, your dreams can be
a manifestation of your emotions.

04:32.221 --> 04:34.556
It's your body and mind's way
of dealing...

04:34.557 --> 04:37.225
with the stress and grief
of what happened.

04:37.226 --> 04:40.095
What if this has nothing to do
with the stillbirth?

04:40.096 --> 04:42.596
What do you think it's about?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.769
We're seeing kids
for the first time this weekend.

04:46.770 --> 04:50.827
And maybe the nightmares...

04:53.977 --> 04:57.944
Maybe I'm just not ready to adopt yet.

05:03.186 --> 05:07.483
I drove by the wine shop
on the way home the other night.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.791
Did you stop?

05:09.792 --> 05:13.795
No. Wanted to. The thought
went through my brain, you know?

05:13.796 --> 05:15.897
It wasn't for myself. It wasn't...

05:15.898 --> 05:20.035
I just thought it would be nice to have
a bottle handy, in case we had guests.

05:20.036 --> 05:21.864
But you didn't go in.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.407
Mm-mm.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.609
The key, to me...

05:27.610 --> 05:30.212
is not that you had the urge...

05:30.213 --> 05:32.047
but that you resisted it.

05:32.048 --> 05:36.118
You wouldn't have made it through
the home study if you weren't ready.

05:36.119 --> 05:37.753
But, ultimately...

05:37.754 --> 05:40.822
you have to decide.

06:03.546 --> 06:05.538
Hi.

06:06.182 --> 06:09.551
Honey, hello.

06:09.552 --> 06:12.254
Let me see. Ooh. Did you paint this?

06:13.456 --> 06:17.259
It's a beautiful butterfly.
It's fantastic.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.561
Really wonderful. Good.

06:19.562 --> 06:23.154
Let's go. I'm cold.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.490
Are you okay?

08:12.074 --> 08:14.066
Ah!

08:18.714 --> 08:20.116
Max!

08:20.117 --> 08:21.950
Max!

08:21.951 --> 08:23.818
Stop throwing!

08:23.819 --> 08:27.018
I'm working.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.124
KATE:
No, honey, I'm sorry.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.826
Just take a break
for a little while, okay?

08:31.827 --> 08:35.486
Because Mommy's trying
to play. Okay?

08:39.202 --> 08:41.501
Daddy's here.

08:44.707 --> 08:46.740
- Mine.
- Hey.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.011
- Hi.
- Sorry, practice went a little late.

08:50.012 --> 08:53.080
- It's all right.
- Whoa.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.817
- Okay, tough guy. Give me that.
- Wicked.

08:57.587 --> 08:59.087
No, no.

08:59.088 --> 09:01.723
Shoot it, shoot it. Go, go, go, go.

09:01.724 --> 09:05.594
- No.
- Yes! Give me five.

09:05.595 --> 09:07.729
Hey, how did it go? Daniel.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.688
Fine.

09:14.270 --> 09:16.570
JOHN:
Hey.

09:17.173 --> 09:18.373
Okay.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.442
DANIEL:
Five minutes. I'm at the last level.

09:20.443 --> 09:22.377
JOHN:
No more video games. Brush your teeth.

09:22.378 --> 09:25.247
That's no fair. It won't save.
Come on, Dad, please?

11:51.994 --> 11:53.195
Sorry.

11:53.196 --> 11:55.764
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:55.765 --> 11:57.359
God.

12:02.338 --> 12:04.235
You smell good.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.442
Okay.

12:18.287 --> 12:20.713
All right.

12:23.926 --> 12:27.496
I have to stop being like this.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.791
JOHN:
I get it.

12:37.373 --> 12:41.709
I'm very excited, I'm happy.

12:41.710 --> 12:44.437
I get nervous.

12:44.713 --> 12:47.474
I'm really scared.

12:49.885 --> 12:55.057
Last time I felt all of this
was right before I lost the baby.

12:55.058 --> 12:58.760
I don't want you to feel like we have
to go through with this for my sake.

12:58.761 --> 13:02.263
It's not just- It's not for you.

13:02.264 --> 13:04.532
I wanna take the love
we felt for Jessica...

13:04.533 --> 13:09.093
...and I wanna give it to somebody
who really needs it.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.442
Are you sure, hon?

13:16.545 --> 13:18.606
Yes.

13:39.502 --> 13:42.537
- Wanna make a snowman?
- Sure.

13:42.538 --> 13:44.537
It's really cold out here.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.547
Hey, stop it.

13:59.788 --> 14:01.656
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:01.657 --> 14:03.124
So glad you could make it.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.818
- So are we.
- Yeah, finally, right?

14:06.161 --> 14:09.992
- So good to see you.
- Thank you for coming.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.269
- This is really something.
- So go take a look around.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.431
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:20.242 --> 14:21.776
Look at the snow orphan.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.311
Snow orphan?

14:23.312 --> 14:26.180
Uh, snorphan?

14:35.925 --> 14:40.791
- Hey.
- No, show it to Sister Mary.

15:02.952 --> 15:06.521
- Slow down, slow down.
- You can't catch me.

15:06.522 --> 15:08.248
Yes, I can.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.479
Hello?

15:41.357 --> 15:43.247
Hi.

15:56.839 --> 15:58.840
Are all these paintings yours?

15:58.841 --> 16:03.172
- Yes. Do you like them?
- They're remarkable.

16:03.345 --> 16:04.912
Thank you.

16:04.913 --> 16:08.346
My name is Esther. What's yours?

16:08.350 --> 16:11.441
John. Nice to meet you.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.381
- Can I take a seat?
- Of course.

16:16.692 --> 16:19.961
I never get tired of watching
these kids enjoy the party.

16:19.962 --> 16:22.664
It really is. I'm so sorry
we didn't do this sooner.

16:22.665 --> 16:24.666
Don't be. It's a big leap.

16:24.667 --> 16:29.397
Adopting an older child
is not an easy decision to make.

16:30.372 --> 16:31.706
KATE:
John's in the bathroom.

16:31.707 --> 16:34.242
Think he'll find us?
Do you wanna go look for him?

16:34.243 --> 16:39.247
- Where did you get the idea for this one?
- My paintings always tell stories.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.750
This one's about a sad mother lion
who can't find her cubs.

16:42.751 --> 16:46.688
- She's smiling.
- She's dreaming about her babies.

16:46.689 --> 16:48.791
It's the only thing
that makes her happy.

16:48.792 --> 16:53.794
- I hope she finds them.
- She will. Look.

16:56.398 --> 16:59.767
They were lost in the jungle,
and they were so scared...

16:59.768 --> 17:02.071
...because they didn't have a mother.

17:02.072 --> 17:04.638
Just when they thought
they'd be alone forever...

17:04.640 --> 17:08.443
...they found their mother asleep
under this tree.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.113
Now when she wakes up,
her dream will have come true.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.818
- She'll have her family again.
- Amazing. You came up with that story?

17:15.819 --> 17:18.909
- I think I hear his voice down here.
- Yes.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.291
Hey. I want to introduce you.
This is my wife, Kate.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.257
Kate, this is Esther.

17:26.095 --> 17:27.859
Hello.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.898
How are you? Nice to meet you.

17:33.335 --> 17:35.770
She painted all these.

17:35.771 --> 17:36.972
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.874
These are fantastic.
These are really wonderful.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.443
- Thank you.
- Where did you learn how to do this?

17:42.444 --> 17:45.813
I've just had lots of time to practice,
I guess.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.783
It's really boring here.

17:48.784 --> 17:50.953
It's boring here?

17:50.954 --> 17:53.788
If you're so bored,
why aren't you down at the party?

17:53.789 --> 17:59.053
I've never really seen the point of it.
Nobody's ever talked to me before.

17:59.394 --> 18:00.661
I guess I'm different.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.030
There's nothing wrong
with being different.

18:03.031 --> 18:05.166
JOHN:
Well, you two have a lot in common.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.673
ESTHER:
I think people should always...

18:11.674 --> 18:14.308
...try to take the bad things
that happen to them...

18:14.309 --> 18:16.844
...and turn them into something good.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.814
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

18:19.815 --> 18:22.115
Absolutely.

18:28.390 --> 18:32.060
She's originally from Russia, but it's
amazing how strong her English is.

18:32.061 --> 18:34.529
She's only been in the country
a few years.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.731
You get children
from other countries?

18:36.732 --> 18:41.435
It's rare. But when we do,
it's sometimes difficult to place them.

18:41.436 --> 18:45.407
The family that brought her to America
died in a house fire.

18:45.408 --> 18:47.008
In a fire?

18:47.009 --> 18:48.576
My God.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.701
Esther barely got out.

18:50.879 --> 18:55.583
She's been through a lot, but this
is an extraordinary little girl.

18:55.584 --> 18:58.719
She's very bright.
She's very mature for her age.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.024
And she's very well-mannered.
She's a bit of a princess, actually.

19:03.025 --> 19:07.425
She wears those ribbons on her wrists
and her neck all the time.

19:07.462 --> 19:08.696
Mine too.

19:08.697 --> 19:11.632
We had trouble with her
when we tried to take them off.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.634
How does she get along
with other kids?

19:13.635 --> 19:16.070
Oh, when she has to interact,
she's great.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.372
Babe?

19:18.373 --> 19:21.742
- She really did seem to open up with us.
- Yeah.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.712
I thought she more
than opened up with you.

19:24.713 --> 19:26.982
You seem to have made
quite a connection.

19:26.983 --> 19:31.746
I could get the paperwork together
and see you back here in three weeks.

19:37.459 --> 19:39.554
All right.

19:49.071 --> 19:50.304
Okey-dokey.

19:50.305 --> 19:52.506
Call me if you need anything.

19:52.507 --> 19:54.871
Bye. Okay, thank you.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.631
Oh, that's T~H.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.433
T~H. Yeah.

20:19.434 --> 20:21.703
And " Max" is like this?

20:21.704 --> 20:23.361
Yeah.

20:24.039 --> 20:26.031
Good.

20:29.978 --> 20:34.947
- Is this your house?
- Now it's your house too.

20:50.799 --> 20:55.267
Hi, sweetie.
Hi. Look who's here.

20:59.708 --> 21:04.211
Hello, Max. My name is Esther.

21:04.212 --> 21:07.144
She's been practicing the whole way.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.885
- Can she hear?
- A little.

21:10.886 --> 21:12.853
She was born almost completely deaf.

21:12.854 --> 21:16.652
That just allows her to hear enough
to read lips.

21:19.594 --> 21:22.263
That's all right, I got it.

21:26.501 --> 21:29.103
I'd like to introduce you
to Grandma Barbara.

21:29.104 --> 21:31.973
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:31.974 --> 21:35.566
That's precious.
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.779
Danny.

21:38.780 --> 21:41.575
This is Esther.

21:43.085 --> 21:44.880
Hello, Daniel.

21:45.487 --> 21:47.616
Hey.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.893
Why does she dress like that?

21:52.894 --> 21:56.230
- Come on. Stop it.
- I'm just asking a question.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.532
Oh!

21:58.900 --> 22:02.069
- You have a piano?
- Yeah.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.798
- Would you like to learn how to play?
- I would love to.

22:14.449 --> 22:15.649
Do you like it?

22:15.650 --> 22:18.412
- It's perfect.
- Good.

22:25.328 --> 22:26.761
Thank you.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.130
How do you say "thank you"?

22:29.131 --> 22:30.831
Thank you.

22:40.075 --> 22:42.977
Wow, look at that.

22:42.978 --> 22:46.148
What? What? What?

22:46.149 --> 22:47.581
Dad, look.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.283
- Dad.
- Where did you get that?

22:49.284 --> 22:52.453
- Dad, look, I'm killing Trevor.
- Great.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.344
Yes.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.426
Thank you.

22:58.427 --> 23:01.461
Come on, Dad. My solo's
gonna end, hurry, look.

23:02.431 --> 23:04.765
Wow, cool.

23:09.204 --> 23:12.466
- Trevor, you suck.
- Shut up.

23:13.443 --> 23:16.442
That's fabulous.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.580
Come on, guys. This is lame.

23:19.581 --> 23:22.411
I was just about to beat you.

23:22.784 --> 23:25.716
I'm glad you like it, honey.

23:42.370 --> 23:44.232
Come on, guys.

23:49.144 --> 23:51.645
Hurry up, I'm freezing my ass off.

23:51.646 --> 23:56.979
- Dude, it's all in here.
- Oh, God. My hands are freezing.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.153
Oh, man, she's hot.

23:59.154 --> 24:02.746
- Move over, man.
- Page 34 will change your life.

24:03.558 --> 24:05.755
Whoa.

24:06.128 --> 24:07.995
This looks like your mom.

24:10.232 --> 24:11.963
No.

24:16.239 --> 24:18.706
Esther and Maxine
seem to be getting along well.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.074
Yeah.

24:20.075 --> 24:21.943
How's she doing, Kate?

24:21.944 --> 24:24.445
Esther's fitting right in.

24:24.446 --> 24:26.247
I meant Maxine.

24:26.248 --> 24:29.050
She's playing by the pond
like nothing ever happened.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.885
She doesn't remember, does she?

24:30.886 --> 24:33.886
No. She's fine.

24:38.193 --> 24:42.029
So, what are your plans?

24:42.030 --> 24:45.656
You know,
probably get Esther settled...

24:45.901 --> 24:48.035
then go back to teaching.

24:48.036 --> 24:50.172
Thought they weren't gonna
take you back.

24:50.173 --> 24:51.805
No, I'm not talking about Yale.

24:51.806 --> 24:55.075
I'll just... I'll probably
give lessons from home.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.611
That's too bad.
That was a very good job.

24:57.612 --> 24:59.747
Well, I didn't quit
because I wanted to.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.083
I know. You had to have
your moment of clarity.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.209
That is an A.A. term.

25:06.388 --> 25:08.822
And I didn't go to A.A.
I just stopped drinking.

25:08.823 --> 25:13.018
Same difference. We all need
a wake-up call sometimes.

26:19.562 --> 26:21.553
Hi.

26:22.063 --> 26:25.757
- Hi.
- Come here.

26:43.285 --> 26:45.512
Yeah?

26:46.689 --> 26:50.157
- Oh, hey.
- We're scared of the lightning.

26:50.158 --> 26:52.253
Oh, come in.

26:52.661 --> 26:58.255
- I wanna sleep next to Daddy.
- Hang on.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.098
Okay.

27:09.644 --> 27:12.179
I'm gonna call later,
make sure everything's okay.

27:12.180 --> 27:14.549
Okay. They're gonna love
your design.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.583
- You gonna pick up the phone?
- Yeah.

27:16.584 --> 27:18.576
All right.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.056
Esther?

27:21.057 --> 27:22.923
Esther?

27:22.924 --> 27:24.825
Come on.

27:24.826 --> 27:28.430
Esther, come on, we gotta go!

27:28.431 --> 27:32.032
You gotta be kidding me.

27:32.033 --> 27:35.831
Wow. Uh...

27:36.037 --> 27:38.935
- Will you please go wait in the car?
- Come on.

27:42.211 --> 27:44.978
Sweetheart,
this isn't really a school dress.

27:44.979 --> 27:47.715
But I like it.
Don't you think it's pretty?

27:47.716 --> 27:49.483
Yes, it's so beautiful...

27:49.484 --> 27:52.753
...but I just don't think
you're gonna be comfortable in it.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.054
What about those jeans?

27:54.055 --> 27:57.091
You're afraid the other children
will laugh at me.

27:57.092 --> 28:02.153
I thought you said there wasn't
anything wrong with being different.

28:02.932 --> 28:05.432
Yes, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.729
Okay. Have fun.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.373
Take a seat, please. Take a seat.

28:12.374 --> 28:15.101
Don't make me ask again, please.

28:15.443 --> 28:18.679
Okay, this is our new student.
Her name's Esther Coleman.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.982
And I'd like you all
to make her feel very welcome today.

28:21.983 --> 28:25.586
Oh, look. Little Bo Peep texted me.
She wants her outfit back.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.419
Okay, go take a seat.

28:32.660 --> 28:36.127
Okay, if everybody could turn
to Page 27...

28:40.435 --> 28:41.668
No!

28:41.669 --> 28:44.105
No! Esther, what are you doing?

28:44.106 --> 28:47.107
Get away from there! No!

28:47.108 --> 28:51.146
You don't play near the water!
You know that!

28:51.147 --> 28:53.043
Come on, get out!

28:54.015 --> 28:56.276
Max.

29:13.034 --> 29:16.296
Sweet. Bull's-eye.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.699
Got you.

29:51.841 --> 29:53.004
Did you kill it?

29:53.005 --> 29:55.773
It's just a paint-ball,
I didn't think it'd hurt him.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.954
Put it out of its misery.

30:08.022 --> 30:11.226
It's in pain,
and it's your responsibility.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.627
It was just an accident.

30:12.628 --> 30:15.128
If you walk away now,
it'll starve to death.

30:15.129 --> 30:17.287
Is that what you want?

30:21.736 --> 30:24.327
I'm not doing it.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.812
It's all right.

30:31.813 --> 30:35.143
- It's in heaven now.
- What's wrong with you?

30:42.390 --> 30:44.791
- Is the water warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.

30:44.792 --> 30:47.623
Okay. Call me if you need anything.

31:05.046 --> 31:07.209
Esther?

31:07.650 --> 31:09.983
Esther.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.352
Open this door.

31:15.658 --> 31:18.425
- What are you doing?
- I always lock the door.

31:18.426 --> 31:20.427
No, we don't lock doors
in this house.

31:20.428 --> 31:23.087
But what if someone comes in
and sees me?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.598
Nobody's gonna come in.

31:24.599 --> 31:27.801
Look, I'm gonna stand right here,
if that's what you want.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.504
I could sing for you.

31:29.505 --> 31:34.438
I used to sing for the sisters
so they would know I was all right.

31:36.345 --> 31:38.507
Okay.

31:38.613 --> 31:42.672
All right. But you know what?
This is just for tonight.

33:27.789 --> 33:32.224
Your parents must have gone
to a lotta retard camps to find her.

33:33.494 --> 33:35.295
Watch it.

33:36.497 --> 33:38.689
Are you okay?

33:43.705 --> 33:45.864
Is this a Bible?

33:47.308 --> 33:51.571
Jesus Freak brought a Bible
to school today.

33:55.717 --> 33:57.682
Hey, wanna come over?

34:03.224 --> 34:05.993
- Good one.
- Your sister's a total spaz.

34:05.994 --> 34:08.083
She's not my sister.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.764
I can't believe you did that.

34:11.766 --> 34:15.635
Oh, little doggy.
Is this your collar, little doggy?

34:31.319 --> 34:35.780
Not A. A. B.

34:41.563 --> 34:43.330
You did really good.

34:43.331 --> 34:47.958
No, I didn't.
I made like 11 mistakes.

34:48.771 --> 34:50.893
I'll do better next time.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.473
Your teacher told me
what happened today.

34:55.511 --> 34:58.211
Don't you want to talk about it?

34:58.212 --> 35:01.007
There's nothing to talk about.

35:01.016 --> 35:04.516
You know I'm here for you, right?
You know that, right?

35:05.153 --> 35:08.518
I got something I wanna show you.

35:12.593 --> 35:15.062
I have one just like this
that I use as a diary.

35:15.063 --> 35:19.099
And I thought that maybe you
and I could use this one...

35:19.100 --> 35:21.327
...for a scrapbook.

35:22.104 --> 35:25.194
That's Mommy and Daddy
on their wedding day.

35:26.007 --> 35:29.042
That's Daniel, Christmas morning.

35:29.678 --> 35:31.977
Here's Max.

35:34.315 --> 35:36.144
And there's you.

35:41.122 --> 35:43.782
Who's Jessica?

35:44.425 --> 35:47.721
Max talks about her.

35:47.962 --> 35:51.131
"I never held you, but I feel you.

35:51.132 --> 35:55.498
You never spoke, but I hear you.

35:56.271 --> 36:01.671
I never knew you, but I love you".

36:06.414 --> 36:08.641
What happened to her?

36:10.886 --> 36:14.045
She died
while she was still in my tummy.

36:14.555 --> 36:17.291
But we scattered her ashes here.

36:17.292 --> 36:20.894
And as long as this plant grows...

36:20.895 --> 36:26.194
then part of her
will be alive inside it.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.443
She would have been lucky.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.876
You're a great mommy.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.686
Thank you, sweetheart.

36:46.687 --> 36:50.051
Thank you. It means a lot.

36:53.427 --> 36:56.263
- How are you?
- I'm good.

36:56.264 --> 37:00.767
It's very interesting.
Esther started to open up today.

37:00.768 --> 37:02.135
That's very interesting.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.805
I'm starting to feel
like there's a real connection.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.007
Me too.

37:09.710 --> 37:12.013
- No, honey, not here.
- Shh.

37:12.014 --> 37:13.680
They're sleeping.

37:13.681 --> 37:18.149
Baby, come here,
you'll like it, believe me.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.527
- Okay, let's get down to business.
- No, no, no.

37:26.528 --> 37:29.729
Okay, just for a second, then.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.757
Yeah.

37:40.709 --> 37:42.475
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

37:42.476 --> 37:46.342
I have to. Wait, wait, wait.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.585
Yeah.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.807
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

38:39.266 --> 38:42.500
Oh, Jesus.

38:42.738 --> 38:46.500
Jesus, honey. Damn it.

38:51.812 --> 38:53.907
Esther?

38:54.916 --> 38:57.417
We have to talk about last night.

38:57.418 --> 39:00.851
- Do we?
- Yes, we do.

39:02.724 --> 39:05.625
See, there are certain things
that grown-ups do...

39:05.626 --> 39:08.896
that children
aren't supposed to see.

39:08.897 --> 39:13.523
And that was one of them.

39:17.139 --> 39:19.899
Esther, listen to me.

39:23.645 --> 39:27.407
When grown-ups love each other
very, very much...

39:28.082 --> 39:30.951
they wanna show each other
that love. Express it.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.848
I know. They fuck.

39:36.491 --> 39:39.359
She could've picked it up anywhere.
Probably at school.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.264
This wasn't something she overheard.
I mean, she knew what it meant.

39:43.265 --> 39:44.632
Huh.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.966
And, babe,
the way she said it is...

39:46.967 --> 39:51.402
I don't even think she expected
to get in trouble over it.

39:51.972 --> 39:56.167
Well, we'll talk to her
about it tonight.

39:56.945 --> 39:58.678
Fine.

39:58.679 --> 40:01.304
Well, what did you have in mind?

40:01.382 --> 40:04.952
No, I thought we could take her
to Dr. Browning.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.154
I don't think we need to take her
to the shrink quite yet.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.792
Well, you know,
we just don't know that much about her.

40:11.793 --> 40:14.327
The family she stayed with
could've been like:

40:14.328 --> 40:18.466
" Pass the fucking potatoes"
at dinnertime, you know?

40:18.467 --> 40:22.035
If she's saying it to my face, what
is she saying when we're not there?

40:22.036 --> 40:25.765
I don't want her exerting
that kind of influence over Max.

40:26.340 --> 40:32.311
Anyway, I just don't want to make
a big deal out of one little dirty word.

40:32.747 --> 40:36.149
Fine. Fucking spend some time
with her, then.

40:36.150 --> 40:37.517
All right, bitch.

40:41.722 --> 40:44.756
Let's have a snow fight!

40:45.026 --> 40:48.219
Come on, no throwing snowballs.

40:58.172 --> 40:59.797
Hey, neighbor.

41:01.275 --> 41:04.844
- Hey.
- Haven't seen you around lately.

41:04.845 --> 41:06.847
I've been pretty busy.

41:06.848 --> 41:10.083
Has the homeowners' association
been soldiering on without me?

41:10.084 --> 41:12.619
It's not the same.

41:24.698 --> 41:28.234
Um, actually, I had a favor to ask.

41:28.235 --> 41:31.171
I have a chair
that I need moved upstairs...

41:31.172 --> 41:36.800
and I was hoping you could come by
and help me with that sometime.

41:36.977 --> 41:38.611
Yeah.

41:38.612 --> 41:40.581
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.716
Maybe Kate and I could help you out.
Just let us know.

41:43.717 --> 41:45.485
I'll call you.

41:45.486 --> 41:48.021
Let's go, honey.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.917
Okay, I'm watching you.

44:05.927 --> 44:10.263
Brenda's father says
that you pushed her.

44:10.264 --> 44:11.932
That's not true.

44:11.933 --> 44:13.599
We were just playing.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.161
I swear.

44:17.104 --> 44:19.969
- Okay.
- And did you see what happened?

44:54.109 --> 44:56.509
What? Mom, what's she saying?

44:56.510 --> 44:59.739
She wants you to pass the bread
and butter.

45:01.082 --> 45:04.343
- Wasn't asking you.
- Hey, now.

45:13.762 --> 45:16.386
Can you eat normal?

45:16.964 --> 45:18.631
I am eating normal.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.802
Yeah, maybe in Transylvania,
or whatever country you're from.

45:21.803 --> 45:24.003
Incidentally, I'm from Russia.

45:24.004 --> 45:28.642
Transylvania isn't even a country.
It's a part of Romania.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.176
You are such a freak.

45:30.177 --> 45:32.211
- Hey.
- Hey, Danny.

45:32.212 --> 45:34.214
I don't want any more talk
like that.

45:34.215 --> 45:36.849
But why does she have to act
like that?

45:36.850 --> 45:39.185
All my friends make fun of me
because of her.

45:39.186 --> 45:41.121
Maybe you need different friends.

45:41.122 --> 45:44.223
Maybe you should send her back
to the retard camp.

45:44.224 --> 45:46.025
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

45:46.026 --> 45:47.728
Apologize to your sister.

45:47.729 --> 45:52.059
She's not my fucking sister.

45:54.135 --> 45:56.032
I got it.

45:57.538 --> 45:59.633
Okay.

46:01.810 --> 46:03.233
That's me.

46:20.894 --> 46:23.759
You get the key back
when you say you're sorry.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.738
Is there anything special
you want me to make tonight?

46:32.739 --> 46:34.407
You have any favorites?

46:38.212 --> 46:39.679
Hello.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.217
- Well, how are you?
- Hi, we're great. We're doing good.

46:43.218 --> 46:45.218
<i>- How is she?
- She's here, hold on.</i>

46:45.219 --> 46:48.120
Hey, Sister Abigail.
Do you wanna say hello?

46:48.121 --> 46:52.714
- Come on. Esther, just quickly say hi.
- I said, no.

46:55.763 --> 47:01.493
You know what, do you mind, darling,
can you get five apples for me?

47:01.535 --> 47:04.404
Sorry, she got shy all of a sudden.

47:04.405 --> 47:07.006
It's all right.
I'm just calling to remind you...

47:07.007 --> 47:09.409
that I'm gonna need her medical...

47:09.410 --> 47:12.705
and dental charts
for my supervision report.

47:15.883 --> 47:18.418
She's not thrilled about the dentist.

47:22.389 --> 47:25.058
How is everyone doing?
Is she opening up to you?

47:25.059 --> 47:29.116
I guess you can say that. She dropped
the F-bomb on me a few weeks ago.

47:31.566 --> 47:33.432
I guess she's finally
coming out of her shell.

47:34.835 --> 47:36.669
Yeah.

47:36.670 --> 47:38.605
Any other glitches I should know of?

47:38.606 --> 47:40.306
<i>We had a big one recently.</i>

47:40.307 --> 47:42.932
It's a girl named Brenda at school.

47:44.679 --> 47:48.247
They were at the playground,
there was a slide, well, she fell off.

47:48.248 --> 47:51.685
Esther may have pushed her down.

47:51.686 --> 47:54.453
I'm not getting the story straight,
but she got hurt.

47:54.454 --> 47:55.655
Is she all right?

47:55.656 --> 47:59.059
Luckily. She broke her ankle
and had something like 6 stitches.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.826
That doesn't sound too lucky.

48:00.827 --> 48:03.759
Well, she's lucky
she didn't break her neck.

48:32.860 --> 48:35.728
You told me
you didn't know how to play.

48:35.729 --> 48:38.497
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

48:38.498 --> 48:41.601
You offered to teach me
and I accepted.

48:41.602 --> 48:47.174
Okay. So then you were
just pretending this whole time?

48:47.175 --> 48:49.308
I thought
you would enjoy teaching me.

48:49.309 --> 48:53.380
It must be frustrating for someone
who loves music as much as you...

48:53.381 --> 48:57.814
to have a son who isn't interested
and a daughter who can't even hear.

49:02.556 --> 49:05.249
Wait, wait, wait.

49:07.061 --> 49:09.862
I walk in on her playing Tchaikovsky
without a mistake.

49:09.863 --> 49:12.331
I mean, she's been lying to me
this whole time.

49:12.332 --> 49:15.369
She just wants to spend time
with you. It's hardly a lie.

49:15.370 --> 49:16.569
You wouldn't know.

49:16.570 --> 49:19.338
You wouldn't.
She's on her best behavior with you.

49:19.339 --> 49:22.575
She's completely different with me.

49:22.576 --> 49:24.510
So, what are you saying?

49:24.511 --> 49:27.047
I don't know.
She threw a fit at school.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.016
She pushed Brenda at the playground.

49:29.017 --> 49:33.085
- Now you're saying that was her fault?
- I don't know. Honey, I don't know.

49:33.086 --> 49:35.555
I wasn't there.
You were watching them.

49:35.556 --> 49:39.291
Oh, come on. It was an accident.

49:39.292 --> 49:42.696
Okay, let's not blame her
for anything, fine.

49:42.697 --> 49:44.530
I'll take her word for everything.

49:44.531 --> 49:47.801
Should I just believe what she said
about you and Joyce too?

49:47.802 --> 49:50.335
What did she say?

49:50.604 --> 49:54.675
- She says that you were hitting on her.
- What?

49:54.676 --> 49:58.444
Oh, come on. She must've
misunderstood. It was, like...

49:58.445 --> 49:59.945
Did she invite you over?

49:59.946 --> 50:03.283
She asked me
to help her move a chair.

50:03.284 --> 50:07.486
- She did?
- Yeah. I blew her off.

50:07.487 --> 50:10.057
Oh, God.

50:10.058 --> 50:11.424
Why didn't you tell me?

50:11.425 --> 50:13.426
- I...
- We could've laughed about it.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.395
- No, I knew how...
- You were hiding it.

50:15.396 --> 50:17.963
Honey, I knew how you'd react.

50:17.964 --> 50:20.332
Kate. Kate.

50:20.333 --> 50:23.336
You can't get jealous of every woman
that I talk to, right?

50:23.337 --> 50:25.838
- It's been like 10 years.
- What does that mean?

50:25.839 --> 50:28.207
You say that
like it actually means something.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.744
It's only been two years
since you told me.

50:30.745 --> 50:35.782
You know how sorry I am. I just feel
like I've earned a little trust here.

50:35.783 --> 50:39.652
- I gave you a second chance.
- That's not fair. That's not fair.

50:39.653 --> 50:43.023
Let me get this straight. We can talk
about my mistakes, not yours?

50:43.024 --> 50:46.726
I was sick! You were an asshole
who wanted to fuck somebody else!

50:46.727 --> 50:49.228
You put our child's life in danger.

50:49.229 --> 50:52.364
I could've walked away months ago.
Nobody would've blamed me.

50:52.365 --> 50:57.104
Oh, that's sharp. That's sharp. Where
did you get that from, your mother?

51:10.551 --> 51:14.386
Danny. Turn that crap down,
please, I gotta work.

51:14.387 --> 51:16.045
- Fine.
- Thank you.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.622
I'll get it.

51:27.534 --> 51:31.271
- Hello, Esther.
- What are you doing here?

51:31.272 --> 51:33.506
May I come in?

51:33.507 --> 51:37.042
I'm afraid I may have made a mistake.

51:37.043 --> 51:39.346
There could be something wrong
with Esther.

51:39.347 --> 51:40.713
What?

51:40.714 --> 51:43.983
What? You told us that you'd never
had any trouble with her.

51:43.984 --> 51:47.419
I didn't. But trouble
does have a way of finding her.

51:47.420 --> 51:49.078
What kind of trouble?

51:49.990 --> 51:52.359
Two girls get into a fight,
there she is.

51:52.360 --> 51:55.194
Someone gets caught stealing,
there she is again.

51:55.195 --> 51:57.563
- So? Does that mean-?
- Just let her finish.

51:57.564 --> 52:02.001
After you told me about the girl in
the playground, I called her old school.

52:02.002 --> 52:04.603
While she was there,
there was a boy...

52:04.604 --> 52:06.740
who fell with scissors in his hand...

52:06.741 --> 52:09.542
and accidentally stabbed himself
through the jaw.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.210
And Esther was there again.

52:11.211 --> 52:15.178
I don't understand.
He accidentally stabbed himself.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.350
But the most troubling thing
is the Sullivan house fire.

52:18.351 --> 52:21.977
I checked into it further.
It was arson.

52:22.422 --> 52:24.957
They have never found the person
who did it.

52:24.958 --> 52:27.127
JOHN:
What are you suggesting here?

52:27.128 --> 52:29.628
That she had anything to do
with any of this?

52:29.629 --> 52:31.096
It's ridiculous.

52:31.097 --> 52:33.266
That a child could commit such crimes...

52:33.267 --> 52:35.334
it flies in the face
of everything I believe.

52:35.335 --> 52:37.168
Well, yeah.

52:41.876 --> 52:46.446
There's a mean lady here.
She's come to take me away.

52:46.447 --> 52:48.582
Will you help me?

52:48.583 --> 52:52.384
We've had
some behavioral problems, but...

52:52.385 --> 52:55.222
Yeah, nothing like that.
I mean, right?

52:55.223 --> 52:58.090
- Yes, we have.
- Really, hon, think about it.

52:58.091 --> 53:01.962
I've tried to reach the Russian
orphanage where she was raised.

53:01.963 --> 53:04.730
I think we need to know
what we're dealing with.

53:04.731 --> 53:07.400
Well, I'll tell you
what we're dealing with.

53:07.401 --> 53:09.635
- No, you know what?
- Stop it. Listen.

53:09.636 --> 53:12.972
We're dealing with a 9-year-old girl
who's an orphan, okay?

53:12.973 --> 53:17.600
- We're taking her to Dr. Browning.
- We can take her to Dr. Browning.

54:14.434 --> 54:16.627
Do you want to play?

54:23.311 --> 54:26.145
I'll call you
as soon as I find anything else out.

54:26.146 --> 54:28.881
- Right. Take care.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

54:28.882 --> 54:30.944
Maybe later.

54:51.505 --> 54:52.705
It's going to be fine.

54:52.706 --> 54:56.639
We'll scare her so bad
she'll never come back here.

55:04.352 --> 55:05.552
Here she comes.

55:05.553 --> 55:07.753
Wave your arms and make her stop.

55:07.754 --> 55:09.382
Max, go.

55:38.619 --> 55:41.520
You all right? Max?

55:41.521 --> 55:43.650
Max?

55:43.823 --> 55:45.282
You okay?

55:58.338 --> 56:00.540
Stop crying.

56:00.541 --> 56:05.177
Grab a foot
and help me get her off the road.

56:05.178 --> 56:07.171
Now.

57:15.749 --> 57:19.749
Help me hide her.

57:57.458 --> 57:59.158
That doesn't matter.

57:59.159 --> 58:02.896
They'll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her.

58:02.897 --> 58:07.330
I had to kill her because
she was going to tell on me.

58:08.268 --> 58:13.828
You're not going to tell on me.
Are you?

58:22.615 --> 58:24.083
Don't worry.

58:24.084 --> 58:26.418
You're my little sister.

58:26.419 --> 58:29.721
I won't let anything
happen to you.

58:29.722 --> 58:31.613
I love you.

59:41.761 --> 59:44.162
Tell me what you saw.

59:44.163 --> 59:47.133
- What are you doing?
- What did you see?

59:47.134 --> 59:49.468
I saw you and Max
in the tree house.

59:49.469 --> 59:51.036
What else?

59:51.037 --> 59:53.539
- What do you mean?
- What else did you see?

59:53.540 --> 59:55.374
I didn't see anything. I swear.

59:55.375 --> 59:57.909
- Did you tell anyone?
- No.

59:58.144 --> 01:00:00.076
I didn't tell anyone.

01:00:01.148 --> 01:00:02.481
Please...

01:00:02.482 --> 01:00:06.719
If I find out that you're lying,
I'll cut your hairless little prick off...

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.117
before you even figure out
what it's for.

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:14.092
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

01:00:16.896 --> 01:00:19.123
You pissed yourself.

01:00:30.275 --> 01:00:32.910
It was nice talking to you, Alice.
I hope we can be friends.

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.537
I'd like that.

01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:39.315
- We'll be right out, honey.
- You can come on in.

01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:49.561
My initial instinct is that...

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:53.961
there's not a deeply-rooted problem
in Esther's past.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:58.693
- So there's nothing wrong with her?
- No.

01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:04.342
It's not all good news.
I think what needs to be examined...

01:01:04.343 --> 01:01:07.969
is Esther's relationship
with those around her.

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:09.608
Specifically with you, Kate.

01:01:09.609 --> 01:01:13.578
It seems she feels there's been some
real tension between the two of you.

01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:16.915
- Okay.
- She's doing her best to please you...

01:01:16.916 --> 01:01:19.949
but you're blocking her attempts
to bond.

01:01:20.854 --> 01:01:25.324
That's not true. That's not true
at all, I've done everything.

01:01:25.325 --> 01:01:28.194
- Right?
- Just let her finish.

01:01:28.195 --> 01:01:31.264
Something's happening
to cause Esther to feel this way.

01:01:31.265 --> 01:01:35.803
Perhaps it's your guilt about
drinking or what happened to Max.

01:01:35.804 --> 01:01:38.672
Maybe some of your feelings
of inadequacy as a mother...

01:01:38.673 --> 01:01:42.176
are manifesting themselves
in your relationship with Esther.

01:01:42.177 --> 01:01:44.939
I don't feel inadequate.

01:01:47.682 --> 01:01:49.584
What did she tell you?

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:53.278
She didn't see. She doesn't know.

01:01:53.889 --> 01:01:56.124
She's so stupid.

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:59.962
Esther's a very shy, reserved...

01:01:59.963 --> 01:02:04.192
sensitive little girl going through
an extremely difficult time.

01:02:10.307 --> 01:02:14.400
She's exceptionally bright
and highly articulate.

01:02:16.882 --> 01:02:20.848
She just needs a little patience
and understanding.

01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:40.964
Thanks for your support back there.

01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:44.105
That was your idea.

01:02:46.881 --> 01:02:49.015
Kate, wait, wait, wait.

01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:52.519
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but a lot of what she said made sense.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.020
Do you wanna get that?

01:02:58.594 --> 01:03:00.927
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, is this Mrs. Coleman?</i>

01:03:00.928 --> 01:03:02.196
Yes. Who's this?

01:03:02.197 --> 01:03:04.298
This is Sister Judith
from St. Mariana's.

01:03:04.299 --> 01:03:06.668
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to know...

01:03:06.669 --> 01:03:09.705
if Sister Abigail
made it to her appointment with you.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:12.040
Yes. Why?

01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:14.076
<i>She hasn't returned since yesterday...</i>

01:03:14.077 --> 01:03:17.771
<i>and I'm just starting
to get really worried.</i>

01:03:27.726 --> 01:03:30.725
Charlie 24,
you wanna hold them there?

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:37.324
Hey.

01:03:43.008 --> 01:03:45.543
Okay, I think we're done.

01:03:46.479 --> 01:03:50.115
Detective, do you have
any leads or suspects?

01:03:50.116 --> 01:03:54.120
- No, not yet.
- I just don't understand...

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:56.821
this kind of thing.
Who would do this? It's...

01:03:56.822 --> 01:03:58.024
Awful.

01:03:58.025 --> 01:04:00.494
You think of anything else,
you give us a call.

01:04:00.495 --> 01:04:02.585
Yes. Absolutely.

01:04:02.862 --> 01:04:04.855
Let's go.

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:04.363
This is what Sister Abigail
was talking about. Look.

01:05:04.364 --> 01:05:08.233
"Character-disturbed children".
Look at the symptoms.

01:05:08.234 --> 01:05:13.932
"Superficially charming. Difficulty
at making and keeping friends".

01:05:14.074 --> 01:05:16.010
I'm not sure this is what she meant.

01:05:16.011 --> 01:05:20.546
She could've told Dr. Browning
whatever she wanted to hear. Look.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.818
They "are adroit manipulators...

01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:28.822
oftentimes playing people off
one another to get what they want".

01:05:28.823 --> 01:05:31.225
Well, you gonna show this
to Dr. Browning?

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:34.094
I'm not showing her anything.

01:05:34.095 --> 01:05:35.930
I'm not seeing her anymore.

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:39.067
- When did you decide that?
- When do you think?

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.102
You're gonna discount Dr. Browning?

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:45.504
Why does everyone get the benefit
of the doubt from you except for me?

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:58.088
If you need help with the kids,
we can arrange that.

01:05:58.089 --> 01:06:00.953
I don't need help.

01:06:09.368 --> 01:06:11.369
I just wanna know more about her.

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:15.474
I wanna know where she came from,
and I wanna know who she is.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:17.876
What if Sister Abigail was right?

01:06:17.877 --> 01:06:20.813
I mean, if someone was in danger,
our own children...

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:23.682
- wouldn't you wanna know?
- Of course I would.

01:06:23.683 --> 01:06:27.619
I'll contact the orphanage she came
from in Russia. All right?

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.744
I mean, it's a start.

01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:42.761
- What?
- Hey.

01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:50.277
Fine.

01:06:50.278 --> 01:06:53.782
I was wondering if you'd heard from
anyone at the Sludyanka Shelter.

01:06:53.783 --> 01:06:57.018
Sister Abigail had mentioned
that she would...

01:06:57.019 --> 01:06:58.613
Oh, you did.

01:07:01.358 --> 01:07:05.155
I don't understand. How can they
have no record of her being there?

01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:07.797
Yes, please.

01:07:07.798 --> 01:07:12.528
Could you just call me as soon as
you know anything, please? Thank you.

01:07:43.904 --> 01:07:46.096
Esther, we gotta go.

01:07:52.179 --> 01:07:54.275
Esther?

01:07:57.884 --> 01:08:00.015
Esther?

01:08:01.055 --> 01:08:02.557
You got me.

01:08:05.294 --> 01:08:08.262
- What?
- I don't want to go to the dentist.

01:08:08.263 --> 01:08:11.065
- Why not?
- I just don't want to go.

01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:13.896
- What, are you scared?
- No.

01:08:15.206 --> 01:08:17.238
We're gonna reschedule, though.

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:21.644
Tell you what, I'll let you play hooky
if you want to come and draw with me.

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:23.979
All right.

01:08:27.251 --> 01:08:29.118
Wait, Daniel.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.176
How are you two getting along
with Esther?

01:08:35.093 --> 01:08:36.426
Fine, I guess.

01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:38.359
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Mom.

01:08:40.064 --> 01:08:44.269
But has she ever made you feel,
I don't know, uncomfortable...

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.862
or has she done anything
that she's not supposed to do?

01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:53.004
- No.
- Like, has she ever hurt any of you?

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.738
No.

01:08:58.685 --> 01:09:00.484
You sure?

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:07.251
Okay. All right.

01:09:08.261 --> 01:09:11.064
I like it
when it's just the two of us.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:15.303
You don't know how long I've waited
for a daddy just like you.

01:09:15.304 --> 01:09:17.371
Mommy too, right?

01:09:18.773 --> 01:09:20.808
I don't think
Mommy likes me very much.

01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:22.377
Hey.

01:09:22.377 --> 01:09:25.113
- That is not true. Mommy loves you.
- It's all right.

01:09:25.113 --> 01:09:28.384
It must be hard to love an
adopted child as much as your own.

01:09:28.385 --> 01:09:33.444
Sweetheart, you're just as much a part
of this family as Danny and Max. Okay?

01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:37.359
Do something nice for Mommy.
Show her how much you love her.

01:09:37.361 --> 01:09:40.484
That's a wonderful idea.

01:09:59.519 --> 01:10:02.279
I have a special surprise
for you, Mommy.

01:10:02.654 --> 01:10:04.454
You do?

01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:09.022
I picked these flowers
just for you.

01:10:11.397 --> 01:10:17.536
- Esther, what did you do? God.
- My arm!

01:10:17.537 --> 01:10:19.072
- Why did you do this?
- Daddy, my arm!

01:10:20.642 --> 01:10:21.941
- John!
- Hey.

01:10:21.942 --> 01:10:25.145
- What did you do?
- Hey. Stop, stop.

01:10:25.146 --> 01:10:26.380
Why did you do this?

01:10:26.381 --> 01:10:29.650
- Oh, God. God, she did this on purpose.
- No, no, no.

01:10:29.651 --> 01:10:31.251
- Yes, she did.
- Hey. Honey, no.

01:10:31.252 --> 01:10:33.854
She knew
what these roses meant to me.

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:37.358
It's my fault, hon. I told her
to do something nice for you.

01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:39.655
I can't believe this.

01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:24.136
Daddy!

01:12:24.275 --> 01:12:26.939
Daddy!

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.349
Daddy, Daddy!

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.006
What is it, honey?

01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:34.811
My arm still hurts.

01:12:39.158 --> 01:12:42.795
Can I have a look at it?
You're okay.

01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:45.396
I'll be gentle.
It's all right, honey.

01:12:45.397 --> 01:12:47.561
Oh, my God.

01:12:49.035 --> 01:12:52.127
We need to take you
to the hospital.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:58.713
You're a brave little girl,
you know that?

01:12:58.714 --> 01:13:02.111
Doctor said
you're gonna heal real fast, okay?

01:13:18.034 --> 01:13:19.829
You broke her arm.

01:13:23.339 --> 01:13:25.642
It's impossible.
I didn't grab her that hard.

01:13:25.643 --> 01:13:31.340
She wants to sleep in here tonight.
Maybe you should sleep downstairs.

01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:53.704
I'm having guests for dinner.

01:13:57.244 --> 01:14:00.540
You know,
you can have it. Thanks.

01:15:03.348 --> 01:15:06.178
Have a good day.

01:15:13.494 --> 01:15:15.260
Daniel.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.389
Your books.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.366
- What happened? Let me see your bag.
- I don't know.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.134
We just bought this.
Pick it up, it's gonna get wet.

01:15:36.118 --> 01:15:38.178
Mom!

01:15:39.988 --> 01:15:43.820
Max! No! Help!

01:15:44.726 --> 01:15:46.695
Max!

01:15:48.297 --> 01:15:50.255
Max!

01:16:02.213 --> 01:16:04.171
Max!

01:16:11.289 --> 01:16:13.323
Max!

01:16:13.324 --> 01:16:15.259
Are you okay?

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.796
I'm here. Mommy's here.
You're okay, honey. Come on.

01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:24.358
I got you. Yeah. Oh, baby,
it's okay. I'm so sorry.

01:16:25.804 --> 01:16:28.474
I remember I put it in park
and I set the brake.

01:16:28.475 --> 01:16:31.344
Max didn't indicate
that Esther did anything.

01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:36.615
Well, Max is covering for her.
And I don't think it's the first time.

01:16:36.616 --> 01:16:40.744
It also wouldn't be the first time
you blamed Esther for your own mistake.

01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:46.326
You know what?
I want her out of this house.

01:16:46.327 --> 01:16:48.762
You're ready for somebody
to come and take her?

01:16:48.763 --> 01:16:51.366
I am. I don't care.

01:16:51.367 --> 01:16:55.368
I will do whatever it takes
to protect my children.

01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:57.666
The girls found this this morning.

01:16:58.007 --> 01:17:00.875
The girls found it.
You mean Esther found it.

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:03.678
Yes, Esther. Does it make
any difference? Is she lying?

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:04.980
You need help.

01:17:04.981 --> 01:17:08.183
We've reserved a place for you
in a rehabilitation facility...

01:17:08.184 --> 01:17:10.686
about 45 minutes from here.

01:17:10.687 --> 01:17:12.220
I didn't drink it.

01:17:12.221 --> 01:17:15.824
I bought two bottles.
I poured one of them down the sink.

01:17:15.825 --> 01:17:17.727
- But not this one?
- No.

01:17:17.728 --> 01:17:21.697
John, I haven't had a drink
in almost a year.

01:17:21.698 --> 01:17:24.334
We wanna help you,
but there's nothing we can do...

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:28.604
- until you stop lying to yourself.
- I'm not lying. I wanted to drink it.

01:17:28.605 --> 01:17:32.342
You have no fucking idea how badly
I wanted to drink it, but I didn't.

01:17:32.343 --> 01:17:34.878
- I didn't drink it.
- If Max had gotten hurt...

01:17:34.879 --> 01:17:38.650
What happened this morning
has nothing to do with this.

01:17:38.651 --> 01:17:40.843
I find that hard to believe.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.785
The only reason that I'm sober
is because of Max and Daniel.

01:17:46.259 --> 01:17:49.995
I think about what would have
happened had you not been there...

01:17:49.996 --> 01:17:52.198
and it makes me wanna kill myself.

01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:54.133
I would never do anything...

01:17:54.134 --> 01:17:57.369
to let something like that
ever happen again. I wouldn't.

01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:59.840
That is so manipulative.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:03.375
I know I haven't given you reason
to believe me, I know I haven't.

01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:05.879
I lied to you.
I should have told you about this.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.383
I'll go to therapy, I'll go to fucking
A.A. if that's what you want...

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:11.918
- but you have to believe me.
- I don't.

01:18:11.919 --> 01:18:14.923
You have to believe me.
John, you have to trust me on this.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:17.525
I'll give you a week
to go to rehab...

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:20.228
or I'm leaving
and I'm taking the kids with me.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.597
I think that's fair, okay?

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:25.300
I'll help you as much as I can,
make it really easy.

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:27.269
Mom's gonna come in the afternoon.

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:32.408
All right? I'm willing to do this.
I'm willing to try and figure this out.

01:18:32.409 --> 01:18:36.808
- But it's up to you.
- I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.

01:18:57.136 --> 01:19:00.432
Max. Max, are you okay?

01:19:01.008 --> 01:19:05.099
What did she do? Did she do something
to make the car crash?

01:19:06.212 --> 01:19:11.083
If you saw her, you have to help me,
so Mom and Dad can protect us.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.214
Why not?

01:19:23.999 --> 01:19:26.691
Is that Sister Abigail?

01:19:33.242 --> 01:19:36.744
Max. What did she do
in my tree house?

01:19:38.982 --> 01:19:41.276
Are the bad things still there?

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.155
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:51.490
I'll get the stuff from the tree house.
Then they'll have to believe us.

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:41.448
- Going somewhere, Kate?
- What are you doing here?

01:20:41.449 --> 01:20:44.119
She's fine. Let's not wake her.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.453
Go to your room.

01:20:45.454 --> 01:20:49.190
Honestly, we're past that now.
Aren't we?

01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:51.850
I know what you're doing.

01:20:52.429 --> 01:20:54.461
I will not let you
hurt my children.

01:20:54.462 --> 01:20:55.865
Me?

01:20:55.866 --> 01:20:59.634
I'm not the one who passed out drunk
and let Max almost drown in the pond.

01:20:59.635 --> 01:21:01.237
If it wasn't for John...

01:21:01.238 --> 01:21:05.638
she'd be dead,
and you'd probably still be in jail.

01:21:06.978 --> 01:21:08.669
Who told you that?

01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:12.576
It's very intimate.

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:14.751
- I learned so much.
- Give it to me.

01:21:14.752 --> 01:21:18.456
- Jessica. Your cheating husband.
- Esther, give it to me.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:20.425
Where you hide your wine bottles.

01:21:20.426 --> 01:21:22.927
I'm... I'm warning you
right now.

01:21:22.928 --> 01:21:25.430
"She was still kicking
when the doctor told me...

01:21:25.431 --> 01:21:28.300
it was something called phantom...

01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:29.934
fetal movement.

01:21:29.935 --> 01:21:33.773
- For 16 days, I carried my dead baby".
- Stop it. Esther.

01:21:33.774 --> 01:21:37.176
" It was the cruelest torture
I could imagine".

01:21:37.177 --> 01:21:39.779
Stop it. You stop it.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.080
What's wrong with you?

01:21:42.081 --> 01:21:45.018
Kate, it's too late.
It's your own fault.

01:21:45.019 --> 01:21:47.280
You took your family for granted.

01:21:47.288 --> 01:21:51.017
- What do you mean?
- What are you going to do?

01:21:52.093 --> 01:21:54.189
Hit me?

01:21:59.534 --> 01:22:02.770
We adopted her from you.
How could you not know anything?

01:22:02.771 --> 01:22:05.206
The Sullivans
could have adopted her illegally.

01:22:05.207 --> 01:22:08.777
<i>She doesn't remember anything
that could help us?</i>

01:22:10.045 --> 01:22:12.136
I'm gonna call you back.

01:23:28.999 --> 01:23:32.465
"Saarne Institute".

01:23:50.956 --> 01:23:54.926
Hello. Do you speak English?

01:23:56.628 --> 01:23:58.463
Do you speak English?

01:23:58.464 --> 01:24:00.632
Is there anyone
who speaks English there?

01:24:00.633 --> 01:24:02.767
This is very important.

01:24:06.672 --> 01:24:08.637
I don't know what you're saying.

01:24:21.354 --> 01:24:23.856
- Hello?
- Is this the Saarne Institute?

01:24:23.857 --> 01:24:25.591
<i>Yes.</i>

01:24:25.592 --> 01:24:29.195
Yes. I need to talk to somebody
about one of your children.

01:24:29.196 --> 01:24:31.998
She was adopted by an American family.
It's a girl.

01:24:31.999 --> 01:24:35.301
<i>She is not come from here.</i>

01:24:35.302 --> 01:24:37.604
Well, I haven't even
told you her name yet.

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.641
You do not understand.
Saarne Institute is not an orphanage.

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.607
It is a mental hospital.

01:25:10.041 --> 01:25:12.610
Are you looking for this?

01:25:14.211 --> 01:25:16.211
Poor Sister Abigail.

01:25:16.814 --> 01:25:21.753
I couldn't have done it myself,
you know. Max is just as guilty as I am.

01:25:21.754 --> 01:25:25.623
- Whatever Max did, you made her do it.
- Think about it.

01:25:25.624 --> 01:25:28.716
How did she even know
what was up here?

01:25:28.727 --> 01:25:32.065
It's always better
to burn the evidence.

01:25:32.066 --> 01:25:37.134
If they find these things,
they won't just be coming for me.

01:25:37.135 --> 01:25:39.466
They'll be coming for Max too.

01:25:40.341 --> 01:25:42.839
- Is that really what you want?
- Wait.

01:25:44.044 --> 01:25:45.975
What're you doing?

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.773
Are you crazy?

01:25:54.857 --> 01:25:56.356
Let me out!

01:25:56.357 --> 01:25:58.789
Let me out of here!

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:11.930
Mom!

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:17.246
It's called the Saarne Institute.
S~A~A~R~N~E, Saarne.

01:26:17.247 --> 01:26:18.680
<i>It's in Estonia.</i>

01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:23.420
Estonia? No, this can't be right.
All of her paperwork is from Russia.

01:26:23.421 --> 01:26:25.988
I'm sending them a picture
of her right now.

01:26:25.989 --> 01:26:28.925
Maybe her birth mother
was a patient there.

01:26:28.926 --> 01:26:32.086
I don't know.
Maybe she was even born there.

01:26:36.835 --> 01:26:39.294
Mom!

01:26:39.705 --> 01:26:42.973
Help!

01:26:58.724 --> 01:27:01.355
Mom! Dad!

01:27:08.335 --> 01:27:10.038
Oh, God!

01:27:19.114 --> 01:27:21.876
Oh, God. Call 911!

01:27:33.163 --> 01:27:36.288
Don't worry.
You're going to heaven.

01:27:38.403 --> 01:27:40.764
Oh, God!

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:47.566
Oh, my God! Daniel!

01:27:47.578 --> 01:27:50.180
Move away! Move away from the fire!

01:27:50.181 --> 01:27:51.415
Daniel?

01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:55.887
Oh, God, no. Daniel?
Mommy's right here. Can you hear me?

01:27:55.888 --> 01:27:59.058
Please wake up.
Honey, Mommy's right here, okay?

01:27:59.059 --> 01:28:01.888
You're gonna be all right.

01:28:11.672 --> 01:28:16.108
We stopped the abdominal bleeding,
but he has a very serious neck injury.

01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:20.348
He's stabilized for now. You should
consider yourselves very lucky.

01:28:20.349 --> 01:28:22.883
- Can we see him?
- In a little while.

01:28:22.884 --> 01:28:25.018
He's resting in the ICU.

01:28:25.019 --> 01:28:28.623
Okay. And will he be able
to tell us what happened?

01:28:28.624 --> 01:28:30.357
It's possible.

01:28:30.358 --> 01:28:34.053
No way of knowing for sure what
he'll remember until he wakes up.

01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:36.220
Excuse me.

01:28:38.601 --> 01:28:41.032
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:44.207 --> 01:28:48.478
JOHN: I know you're exhausted
and upset, and so am I.

01:28:48.479 --> 01:28:52.447
There has to be some other explanation.
She didn't come from an insane asylum.

01:28:52.448 --> 01:28:56.953
The orphanage you thought
she came from has never heard of her.

01:28:56.954 --> 01:28:58.888
Everything about her could be a lie.

01:28:58.889 --> 01:29:02.057
We have her passport. We have
school records, medical records.

01:29:02.058 --> 01:29:04.361
These are papers
from around the world.

01:29:04.362 --> 01:29:06.564
What is this?
It's a piece of paper.

01:29:06.565 --> 01:29:11.397
Your own mother was there this time. It
wasn't just me. Your mother was there.

01:29:11.436 --> 01:29:14.506
It's either Esther
or Daniel who started the fire.

01:29:14.507 --> 01:29:17.442
- Who do you think it was?
- I don't know.

01:29:17.443 --> 01:29:20.279
I'm so done.
I'm done connecting these dots for you.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.914
You know, you can think
whatever you want about me.

01:29:22.915 --> 01:29:26.419
I will leave tonight. If that's
what you want, I will leave tonight.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.250
On one condition. Esther goes too.

01:29:32.626 --> 01:29:35.328
Can I have a dollar
for the soda machine?

01:29:35.329 --> 01:29:38.797
Your mother wants you
to stay right there.

01:29:44.606 --> 01:29:48.574
There you go. Don't be too long.

01:30:21.446 --> 01:30:23.335
Okay.

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:15.302
What? What is it, sweetie?

01:31:24.715 --> 01:31:27.049
<i>Code 99, ICU.</i>

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:29.952
<i>Code 99, ICU.</i>

01:31:29.953 --> 01:31:32.422
- Coming through, coming through.
- Mom, take Max.

01:31:32.423 --> 01:31:36.260
Let's go, Room 304! Crash
cart coming through! Move, people!

01:31:36.261 --> 01:31:38.462
- Daniel?
- Clear the hall! Clear the hall!

01:31:38.463 --> 01:31:41.833
You have to stay out here.
He's in cardiac arrest. Stay out here.

01:31:41.834 --> 01:31:43.292
Daniel!

01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:46.571
- Here we go.
- Start a drip.

01:31:46.572 --> 01:31:48.673
- Check BP, please.
- Check ventilation.

01:31:48.674 --> 01:31:50.275
Oh, God.

01:31:50.276 --> 01:31:53.505
We got a pulse.
We got a pulse.

01:31:55.781 --> 01:31:57.206
Kate.

01:31:57.851 --> 01:31:59.879
Kate.

01:32:00.919 --> 01:32:04.457
What did you do?
What did you do to him, you bitch?

01:32:04.458 --> 01:32:05.692
Stop, stop!

01:32:05.693 --> 01:32:08.762
- Orderlies!
- She's trying to kill my baby!

01:32:08.763 --> 01:32:10.364
- Daddy!
- Hold her!

01:32:10.365 --> 01:32:13.058
KATE:
She's trying to kill my baby!

01:32:13.668 --> 01:32:15.564
Hold her still.

01:32:15.637 --> 01:32:17.897
Get off me.

01:32:18.607 --> 01:32:21.301
Hold her still. Hold her still.

01:32:21.309 --> 01:32:23.978
Okay. Easy, easy.

01:32:23.979 --> 01:32:26.381
- You okay?
- There you go.

01:32:46.203 --> 01:32:49.473
- Kate.
- Daniel.

01:32:49.474 --> 01:32:52.143
They're running tests.
We should know more tomorrow.

01:32:52.144 --> 01:32:54.939
Don't worry about Daniel.
He'll be okay.

01:32:55.613 --> 01:32:57.347
He'll be home in a few days.

01:32:57.348 --> 01:32:59.384
You need to stay here,
get some rest.

01:32:59.385 --> 01:33:01.553
I'm gonna take
Max and Esther home.

01:33:01.554 --> 01:33:03.888
Johnny.

01:33:05.057 --> 01:33:08.285
Please don't let her near Max.

01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:12.619
I love you.

01:35:45.164 --> 01:35:47.699
Hello, Daddy.

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:52.328
- What're you wearing?
- Do you like it?

01:35:53.707 --> 01:35:56.769
Oh, Jesus.

01:36:02.016 --> 01:36:06.610
Look at you. What have you done
to your face? What is this?

01:36:08.857 --> 01:36:12.221
I don't want to be alone.
I'm scared.

01:36:18.901 --> 01:36:21.469
I love you, Daddy.

01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:23.706
You too, hon.

01:36:23.707 --> 01:36:25.740
I really love you.

01:36:27.745 --> 01:36:29.839
I know.

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.438
I know.

01:36:34.152 --> 01:36:37.120
John, let me take care of you.

01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:39.814
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

01:36:41.559 --> 01:36:46.961
What's gotten into you, huh?
What's going on?

01:36:50.769 --> 01:36:53.964
You said you loved me.

01:36:59.012 --> 01:37:02.844
You are so confused.

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:06.185
You know what?
I don't love you like that.

01:37:06.186 --> 01:37:10.087
That's the way Kate and I
love each other.

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:14.251
You understand?

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:17.058
I don't see that.

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:20.667
- You have to respect your mother.
- I do.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.338
I just feel like I'm alone sometimes
in respecting you.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:28.709
I don't think anyone ever thinks
about what you might be feeling.

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:31.679
I really care about you, John.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.909
Yeah, I know, Esther.

01:37:37.353 --> 01:37:40.581
I'm just... I'm tired.

01:37:41.058 --> 01:37:43.993
I'm very tired.

01:37:43.994 --> 01:37:46.229
And I don't know what to do.
It's difficult.

01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:49.032
I mean,
everything's just falling apart...

01:37:49.033 --> 01:37:54.296
and... oh, my God,
I'm so worried for Daniel.

01:37:57.175 --> 01:37:59.599
Oh, God.

01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:02.380
You're a good person, John.

01:38:02.381 --> 01:38:05.278
You're a great father.

01:38:06.151 --> 01:38:08.812
And a handsome man.

01:38:11.591 --> 01:38:13.658
Jesus Christ!

01:38:13.659 --> 01:38:16.060
My God, stop, stop, stop!

01:38:16.061 --> 01:38:18.598
Just stop talking and go upstairs!
Go to your room!

01:38:18.599 --> 01:38:22.123
- Stop talking to me like I'm a child.
- I'm calling Sister Judith tomorrow.

01:38:22.124 --> 01:38:24.488
We're gonna have a conversation
about your future in this house...

01:38:24.489 --> 01:38:27.601
because I can't do it, I just...
I can't do it anymore.

01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:30.772
Fine.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:34.971
Esther.

01:38:51.401 --> 01:38:55.903
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Katherine Coleman?</i>

01:38:56.574 --> 01:38:58.807
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, this is she.</i>

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:02.867
My name is Dr. Värava.
I'm calling from the Saarne Institute.

01:39:02.868 --> 01:39:04.148
Oh.

01:39:04.248 --> 01:39:06.384
I've just seen the picture
you e-mailed to us.

01:39:06.385 --> 01:39:07.784
And do you recognize her?

01:39:07.785 --> 01:39:11.654
Where is she right now? Is she
someplace where she can hear you?

01:39:11.655 --> 01:39:14.811
No, she's not with me.
She's with my husband at home.

01:39:14.812 --> 01:39:16.731
Call your husband right now,

01:39:16.732 --> 01:39:19.531
and tell him to get your family
out of the house.

01:39:19.532 --> 01:39:23.768
<i>- And then call the police.
- He won't listen to me. But why?</i>

01:39:23.769 --> 01:39:27.738
<i>Then tell him the little girl in
the picture is not really a little girl.</i>

01:39:27.739 --> 01:39:30.809
- She's a grown woman.
- What?

01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:33.479
<i>What're you talking about?
The picture I sent you...</i>

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.449
<i>is of our adopted daughter,
and she's 9 years old.</i>

01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:39.853
No, she's not.

01:39:39.854 --> 01:39:44.691
She has a rare hormone disorder.
It's called hypopituitarism.

01:39:44.692 --> 01:39:48.194
It causes proportional dwarfism.
She only looks like a child.

01:39:48.195 --> 01:39:53.634
According to our records,
Leena Klammer was born in 1976.

01:39:53.635 --> 01:39:55.770
She's 33 years old.

01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:58.339
This can't be.
This is a mistake.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:01.710
<i>I hope so, for your sake.
Does she have the scars?</i>

01:40:01.711 --> 01:40:04.579
What? I don't know.
What scars?

01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.149
Leena was one
of our most violent patients.

01:40:07.150 --> 01:40:09.817
When she was here,
she was kept in a straitjacket...

01:40:09.818 --> 01:40:11.820
<i>to stop her
from hurting our staff.</i>

01:40:11.821 --> 01:40:13.989
<i>She was constantly fighting
to get out of it.</i>

01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:19.195
It cut into her skin and left her
with scars around her wrists and neck.

01:40:19.196 --> 01:40:21.665
<i>There is no way
you could not have seen them.</i>

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:23.300
Why was she at your hospital?

01:40:23.301 --> 01:40:27.904
She's dangerously ill, violent.
She killed 7 people that we know of.

01:40:27.905 --> 01:40:30.874
Oh, my God.
How could she fool us?

01:40:30.875 --> 01:40:35.140
She has been passing herself off
as a little girl for most of her life.

01:40:35.214 --> 01:40:38.416
<i>She tricked a family here
in Estonia into adopting her.</i>

01:40:38.417 --> 01:40:43.621
When she couldn't seduce the father,
she killed him and his whole family.

01:40:43.622 --> 01:40:47.326
<i>- Then she burned the house down.
- Yes. How did you know?</i>

01:40:47.327 --> 01:40:50.562
She disappeared a year ago
and we lost track of her.

01:40:50.563 --> 01:40:54.224
<i>If it's really Leena,
you don't have much time.</i>

01:41:34.745 --> 01:41:36.875
Esther?

01:42:50.327 --> 01:42:53.987
Come on, Johnny. Come on.
Pick up the fucking phone.

01:43:03.908 --> 01:43:06.106
Shit.

01:43:27.602 --> 01:43:29.502
Come on.

01:43:30.805 --> 01:43:32.171
Oh, God!

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.274
Come on.

01:44:09.413 --> 01:44:10.613
Come on.

01:44:10.614 --> 01:44:12.482
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

01:44:12.483 --> 01:44:16.053
I need the police.
We have an intruder in our home.

01:44:48.923 --> 01:44:50.381
Come on.

01:44:54.462 --> 01:44:55.997
- This is John.
- John?

01:44:55.998 --> 01:44:58.031
<i>You've reached my cell,
but I can't pick up.</i>

01:44:58.032 --> 01:44:59.797
Oh, fuck it.

01:46:15.984 --> 01:46:18.079
John?

01:46:22.858 --> 01:46:26.318
John? John?

01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:31.024
No, God!

01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:45.011
No, God!

01:46:47.651 --> 01:46:49.417
Max.

01:48:28.929 --> 01:48:31.359
What the fuck?

01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:04.992
Esther! Don't you hurt her!

01:51:10.004 --> 01:51:13.540
Leave her alone! I'm here!

01:51:13.942 --> 01:51:15.933
Esther!

01:52:46.108 --> 01:52:47.806
I know.

01:54:42.834 --> 01:54:46.428
Go back. It's too dangerous.
Go back.

01:54:59.486 --> 01:55:01.588
Please.

01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:04.282
Don't let me die, Mommy.

01:55:07.195 --> 01:55:11.356
I'm not your fucking Mommy!

01:55:26.783 --> 01:55:29.613
Baby, it's okay.
