1
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,708
Despite being a quarter mile apart,

2
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,583
Paul hasn't gone anywhere.

3
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,500
He's with us forever.

4
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,583
We are family.

5
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,458
You watch too many movies?

6
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,166
I think you're cuckoo.

7
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,708
Playing too many games?

8
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,291
You guys.

9
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,958
Are you just talk or do you wanna race?

10
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,958
You really watch too many movies.

11
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,791
Hey, Pon.

12
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,500
Wake up.

13
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,666
It's late.

14
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,166
-Your night races are ruining your sleep.
-I'm awake.

15
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,416
You have trouble getting up every morning.

16
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,958
Hurry.

17
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,708
One moment.

18
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,750
Hey.

19
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,041
-Pon, wake up.
-One more minute.

20
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,958
Pon, get up!

21
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,250
Get up! Get up!

22
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,000
One minute!

23
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,333
I told you to get up!

24
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:53,458
Fuck! With your lazy ass, when are you
going to be well off like others?

25
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,083
When will you be rich?

26
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,083
Wife, listen to me.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,708
We are family.

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,166
Family, my ass!

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,625
I hate your face enough.
Don't make me hate your voice, too.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,916
We humans...

31
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,541
do not have equal chances to be rich.

32
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,375
But we all do have equal chances

33
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,250
to do good deeds.

34
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,458
Yeah?

35
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,333
How about my foot there?

36
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,375
Want some more?

37
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,250
You can't be rich with your lazy ass.

38
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,583
The rich get richer.

39
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,000
The poor get poorer.

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,583
Don't think too much about it.

41
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,375
Be like a plastic bag.

42
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,166
How?

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,500
Fly here, fly there.

44
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,416
But live for a hundred years, dear.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
"Dear"?

46
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,000
Philosopher!

47
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,750
You're nonsense.

48
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,625
I'm going to work now.

49
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,166
Hang in there, okay, Dad?

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,958
Okay? Hang in there.

51
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,208
Dilly-dallying?

52
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,458
Finish feeding him, then go to work!
And hurry back.

53
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,666
Look.

54
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,375
Nothing gets done

55
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,875
as a result of taking care of your dad
being paralyzed for many years.

56
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,791
Go to work and come home.
Don't stop anywhere, okay, Vin?

57
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,791
Mom! Stop complaining.

58
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,291
Cheer me up.

59
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,000
So I can go to work.

60
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:24,208
-Cheer you up? Amen.
-So we'll be rich.

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,375
Let that wish come true.

62
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,875
-Come on.
-You've been saying that for years.

63
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me kiss you.

64
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,791
No. Hurry up and go.

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,916
Come on.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,291
No!

67
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,708
Hugs, hugs.

68
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,833
-Hurry up and go.
-Are you shy?

69
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,416
-Go!
-Okay, Mom. Bye.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,125
-Buy some food on the way home.
-Bye, Dad.

71
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,833
-Okay.
-I don't want to cook.

72
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Bye, Mom.

73
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,250
Bye. Take care of him.

74
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,041
Pon!

75
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,250
Pon!

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,833
Pon!

77
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,666
It's late. Coming?

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,083
-Hey, bro.
-What?

79
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,041
What happened to your face?

80
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,125
I told you. You deserve this.

81
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,583
-Whose blood is it?
-My wife's.

82
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,875
You slapped her so hard,
her blood splashed on your face?

83
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,166
My action scene is this awesome.

84
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,583
Hey. How many times have I told you
not to call me Pon?

85
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,708
-So what do I call you?
-Paul.

86
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,416
-Paul.
-No.

87
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,333
Paul.

88
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,666
-Paul.
-Paul.

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,708
-Paul.
-Paul.

90
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,791
-Paul.
-Paul.

91
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:33,791
-Paul.
-Paul.

92
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,000
Enough! Fuck!

93
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,208
You didn't shit this morning?
Your brain is full of shit.

94
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,958
Not true.

95
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,833
Close the door.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,333
Hey.

97
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,375
Ingrain this in your brain.

98
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,458
-Don't have a wife.
-Because?

99
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,333
When you start dating, she's still a Thai.

100
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,291
After a while, she'll be check...

101
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,083
Czechoslovakian?

102
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,250
Check you morning, noon, and night.
You can't go anywhere.

103
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
What? So why do you have a wife?

104
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,416
It's better than a hand.

105
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,583
Don't you know "Sperm Murder"?

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,875
That's it.

107
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,833
Paul!

108
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,041
Wait for me!

109
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,833
Hey, hurry, Davika.

110
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,750
I am. This skirt is tight.

111
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,625
-Let's go.
-Pon?

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,208
Still here?

113
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,166
Well, well, well, Davika.

114
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,208
Let go of my husband.

115
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,250
If I find out you two have something...

116
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,208
Move away from him.

117
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,708
Mia.

118
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,291
I won't get involved when you're looking.

119
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,041
I always do.

120
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,333
He's so handsome. I can't look away.

121
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,208
-We're going now.
-Wait.

122
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,625
Forget something?

123
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,083
Bye, my ass!

124
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,333
Good!

125
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,750
You have to wai your wife?

126
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,833
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,333
-No arguing?
-Yes.

128
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,791
So cute.

129
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,916
I'm going to wash the clothes now.

130
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,125
It serves you right!

131
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,250
Not only is my wife beautiful...
she's also a klutz.

132
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
Falls down everyday.
Her womb must have moved.

133
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,708
Let's go.

134
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,875
The bus for hire

135
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,583
Runs on the road parallel to the highway

136
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,291
Sit, sit.

137
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,250
Sit down, sit.

138
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,666
It's so hot.

139
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,166
Why sit so close to me?

140
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,791
It's got to be you.

141
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,666
Every day.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,166
Hey, Vin.

143
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,958
Is your dad better now?

144
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,625
What? My dad is not that bad.

145
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,166
What the heck? I meant your dad's health.

146
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,375
I see. He's better now.

147
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,041
The day that you and your mom
were not at home,

148
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,916
it was lucky I went in there.

149
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,625
Or your dad would have been...

150
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,916
Vin!

151
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,208
Vin.

152
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,750
Vin!

153
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,250
It's not locked?

154
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,416
What? Papa?

155
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,416
Mom! Mom!

156
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,708
Vin!

157
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,958
Shit. Who dropped him here? Papa?

158
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,000
Mom? Vin?

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,333
Easy. Easy, Papa.

160
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,416
What, Papa? We're not at the hospital yet.

161
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,375
Almost there.

162
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,583
Pon.

163
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,750
If it hadn't been for you that day,

164
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,041
my dad would have died.

165
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,500
I love you.

166
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,166
No need to love me so much.
Let me ask you this.

167
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,166
If you saw your dad drowning,

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,625
would you help him?

169
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,500
Of course. My dad.

170
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,708
Good.

171
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,500
Well, let me ask you this.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,291
If you were on a boat
and saw your parents drowning,

173
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,666
and you could only help one of them,
who would that be?

174
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,500
-Mom, of course.
-Fuck your dad?

175
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,625
What about you?

176
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,291
Here. We're here.

177
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,625
Come.

178
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,541
Asshole.

179
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,458
What's going on there?

180
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,041
Come on.

181
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,708
Hey, show him!

182
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,125
Come on.

183
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,041
What's going on?

184
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,166
They're hitting a handicapped person.

185
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,208
Nobody is helping?

186
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,625
Who's gonna help? He's a cop's son.

187
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,583
But a cop's son shouldn't be
hitting a handicapped person.

188
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,750
You. Help him!

189
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,250
What?

190
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,166
Hurry.

191
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,333
He has a knife.

192
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,208
Yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,250
Beat him to death!

194
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,625
Stop!

195
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,041
-Beat him to death!
-Stop!

196
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,250
Beat him to death!

197
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,916
I told you guys to stop!

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,958
Watch out.

199
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,958
Hey!

200
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,625
-What did you do to my wife?
-Your wife?

201
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
-Yeah.
-All right.

202
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,708
Kill him, my love.

203
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,791
Kill him?

204
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,208
Shut up.

205
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,416
I'm a cop's son.

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,458
I'm a security guard's son.

207
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,708
-Here.
-Gun!

208
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,125
What?

209
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,833
I'll call the cops.

210
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,458
You're hooligans.

211
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,000
My dad is a cop.

212
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,416
My dad is a cop, too.

213
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,125
My dad is also a cop.

214
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
Tell them your dad has cancer.

215
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,708
-My dad has cancer. What's wrong with you?
-Your dad really has cancer.

216
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,333
Still standing around?

217
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,291
-What?
-Want some?

218
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,958
Let's go!

219
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,833
-This bitch ran her mouth.
-This side.

220
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,291
Get her.

221
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
What are you doing to my wife?

222
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:39,375
If you don't want her
to be stomped to death,

223
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,416
give me the knife.

224
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,083
You want it? Here.

225
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,833
I think it is a knife for anchovies.

226
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,250
-How do you know?
-So stinky!

227
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,708
I know your dad is a cop.

228
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,541
But think,

229
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,250
being a cop's son 
means you can't hurt people.

230
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,458
You can't hurt a handicapped person.

231
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,333
Don't disgrace your dad's police uniform.

232
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,208
Your dad is a cop, I am...

233
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,708
a bus driver.

234
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,416
Here. Bus conductor.

235
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,833
-Here. Bus conductress.
-Yeah!

236
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,916
I never brag to anyone. Dumbass!

237
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,666
Yeah.

238
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,500
-Don't come around here again. Go away!
-Go!

239
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,500
I'll tell my dad.

240
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,291
Dum, let's go home. Start the engine.

241
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,125
Go away!

242
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,125
Awesome!

243
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,375
He's looking at me.

244
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,625
What?

245
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,916
We'll see.

246
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,833
There.

247
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,000
Paul!

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,958
I'll go with you.

249
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,500
Are you crazy?

250
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,458
You're on a different bus and round
from me. You can't come with me.

251
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
My bus has left.

252
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,583
I missed it.

253
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,291
Was busy with the cop's son.

254
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,416
I'll catch up with my bus.

255
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
Okay, come on.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,750
Hurry.

257
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,541
And where are you going?

258
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,875
Go on with making a living.

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,875
You're badly hurt.
Why don't you report it to the cops?

260
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,625
There's no point reporting it.

261
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,416
Yeah, you're right.

262
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,666
We all know...

263
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,416
who's big in this country.

264
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,083
I don't know who's big.
But I know mine is long.

265
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,083
-Are we talking about the same thing?
-You haven't seen mine.

266
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,750
What are you doing?

267
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,583
What are you doing?

268
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,958
Come here, Vin!

269
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,208
What?

270
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,750
When did you get on the bus?

271
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,750
Same time as you.

272
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,375
I was here and didn't see you.

273
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,083
I got on through the front door.

274
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,000
And you didn't tell me.

275
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,916
I was waiting for you.

276
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,250
All over my eye.

277
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,375
Well, well, well.

278
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,958
Hello, sir. I like your work.

279
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,416
I'm a big fan of yours.

280
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,541
-Calm down.
-Don't come close.

281
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,166
I'm going to commit suicide.

282
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,541
Wait. Listen to me.

283
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,833
Listen to me. Calm down.

284
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,666
Focus and talk to me.

285
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,166
Please. Tell me what's on your mind.

286
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,708
What's going on?

287
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
I...

288
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,750
told my girlfriend

289
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,291
to meet on a bus.

290
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,208
We'd meet every day.

291
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,041
But it's been eight days!

292
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
She never came to see me.

293
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,041
Shit. Eight days?

294
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,500
I can't take it anymore. I'm so depressed.

295
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,541
I want to die.

296
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,125
Please, please. Chill.

297
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,208
Chill. Listen to me.

298
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,083
We have only one chance to be born,

299
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,375
only once. And you don't know
if you'll be born again.

300
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Think about your mom and dad
who raised you.

301
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,333
They want to see your future.

302
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,791
If you do something, how would they feel?

303
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
If you die,
how will they live their lives?

304
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,208
Who would they be with?

305
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,500
Girls are like a washing machine.

306
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,416
If you don't have one,
then you hand-wash your clothes.

307
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,791
-That's right.
-Hand-wash?

308
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,000
I'd rather die.

309
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,750
Stop!

310
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,166
Even though you have a face
like a dog's elbow

311
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,166
and your mouth 
is like skin under the foot,

312
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,666
I believe, really believe, that one day

313
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,333
no one would ever love you.

314
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,333
Shit!

315
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,125
If you're gonna talk shit about me,
let's fight.

316
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,625
What?

317
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,083
You're so mean.

318
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,416
No more. I'm going to jump.

319
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,375
Calm down.

320
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,291
Don't jump.

321
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,458
Thank you very much

322
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,750
for letting me help you.

323
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,375
You are incredible!

324
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,000
You helped him.

325
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,083
Yeah, yeah.

326
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,208
Aren't you jumping off a bridge today?

327
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,416
I want to die!

328
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,833
Can't take it anymore. Ma'am.

329
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,333
Help me.

330
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,791
My life is so tough.

331
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,541
My girlfriend left me.

332
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,041
I'm all alone.
My love isn't coming back.

333
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,083
Stop me. I'm going to jump.
Stop me now.

334
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,708
Stop me, pull me back.
Good, pull me back...

335
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,125
You!

336
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,916
You remember me, right?

337
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,833
I'm about to commit suicide.

338
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,958
Stop me, stop me now.

339
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,708
Jump! Go ahead!

340
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,208
-You're not worried about my parents?
-Fuck them.

341
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,333
-Jump!
-Go ahead.

342
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,458
Kick me! Kick me now.

343
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,416
I'm about to jump, so kick me.

344
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
Nah. You're not worth kicking.

345
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,750
I would like to suggest something.
On my bus,

346
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,958
don't jump off the bus.
Or I'll really kick your ass.

347
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,583
No. Who would do such a thing?

348
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,250
If my girlfriend comes and doesn't see me,
she'll be sad.

349
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,625
I really want to see how beautiful
your girlfriend is.

350
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,041
Very.

351
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,291
Yeah.

352
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,958
All right, let's go.

353
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,000
Leaving.

354
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,666
What?

355
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,291
He'll hear it.

356
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,708
There.

357
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,583
Hurry. The bus is leaving.

358
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,333
Sit down, sit down.

359
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,333
Sit, sit.

360
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,541
Are you okay?

361
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,416
I'm all right.

362
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,541
Hanging around for so long
and getting on at the last moment.

363
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,416
Life is too precious
to mess with bus number 888.

364
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,250
RAMA VIII - HAPPYLAND

365
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:35,791
Pon! Stop fooling around. The next bus 
will catch up and take the passengers.

366
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,083
Okay.

367
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,000
Sorry.

368
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,041
Hey.

369
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,833
I told you to cut the brake line.
How is he still able to stop the bus?

370
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,375
You told me to put a phone there.
You have to call the number

371
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,958
-to activate the cutting.
-Really?

372
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,041
Give me the phone.

373
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,458
I didn't bring it with me.

374
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,916
Me, neither.

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,500
What? How can we cut the brake line, then?

376
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,375
It's all right. I'll borrow his phone.

377
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,541
I don't have one.

378
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,000
-I do.
-Why're you going to give it to him?

379
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,791
Come on. We have the same enemy.

380
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,333
-I won't let you borrow it.
-Stingy.

381
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,625
-I won't.
-It's only a phone.

382
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,666
Hey!

383
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,375
No fighting on my bus!

384
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,500
Get off if you're going to fight.

385
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,000
-Bus fares.
-Here.

386
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,416
Do I have to?

387
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,083
Here.

388
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,791
Bus fare.

389
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,958
For two.

390
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,000
Two?

391
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:32,875
Okay.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,083
All done, Pon. Now!

393
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,375
Okay!

394
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,458
We need to reach the target.

395
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,958
Our income has been down 
these past few days.

396
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,666
The boss is bitching us.

397
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,041
Hey, isn't it fast enough?

398
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,916
I've already floored it,
my foot is almost out to the headlight.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,916
You're exaggerating!

400
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,250
Passengers are weird these days.

401
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,375
If we drive too fast,
they think we have taken speed.

402
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,666
Too slow, they think we are losers.

403
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
Do they know that I drive this fast

404
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,375
to earn a living for my family?

405
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,208
How about we get 1,000 people today?

406
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,833
I'll make it 2,500.

407
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,375
Okay.

408
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,375
Vin!

409
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,041
Vin!

410
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,666
Tell Paul to stop if he sees my bus.
I need to get off.

411
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,583
Tell Paul!

412
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,583
Vin!

413
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,958
Did you hear me?

414
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,291
Did you hear me?

415
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,333
Vin!

416
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,250
-Fuck! I heard you.
-Pon, the bus!

417
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,541
What's all the fuss?

418
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,166
I don't want to hear your voice anymore.

419
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,708
I can't drive!

420
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,458
What?

421
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,291
Go drive the bus! We'll all fucking die!

422
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,541
Don't you want to die?

423
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,291
I don't want to die with you. Go!

424
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,500
Go!

425
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,250
Just give me the phone and end it.

426
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:53,208
You said you'd let me borrow it.

427
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,166
No, I didn't.

428
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,083
Fuck!

429
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,708
Hey, Pon!

430
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,000
Hey!

431
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,166
What the hell?

432
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,625
Stop!

433
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,666
Hey, stop.

434
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
-Stop.
-No.

435
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,250
I said, "stop."

436
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,583
I told you to stop!

437
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,166
Come back and drive!

438
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,375
Pon!

439
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,333
And you!

440
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,541
What about me?

441
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,791
I told you to stop!

442
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,833
What is with all the talking?

443
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,166
Why talk so much?

444
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,166
-Pon!
-I want to say...

445
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,708
I don't want to hear you anymore.

446
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,375
We're gonna hit something. 
Fucking Pon!

447
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,291
No one is driving!

448
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,583
Fucking Pon!

449
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,125
My balls.

450
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,458
-Move.
-What the hell?

451
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,875
Shouldn't have left the seat.

452
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,625
No more fighting!

453
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,166
Don't blame me.

454
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,041
And why do you have to fight all the time?

455
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,708
Stop to pick up the Magic Monkey.

456
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,041
Must be going to Southern Asia.

457
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,166
-Should have stayed home with that makeup.
-Bus fare.

458
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,625
What color is your foundation?

459
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,791
Probably a wrong one.

460
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,791
Oh, you look shy.

461
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,583
More passengers at the next stop.

462
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,416
Right here.

463
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,083
Open the doors.

464
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,875
The day you let go of my hand,
I went crazy

465
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:14,375
Been calling you until my tears dried up

466
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:19,958
Could you not leave me like this?

467
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:23,666
Please, please

468
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,583
Let's sit over there.

469
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,416
Bus fares.

470
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,125
You can take a bus now?

471
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,041
Of course, when we travel 
with someone we love.

472
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,791
I can go with him anywhere.

473
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:04,875
Pon!

474
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,750
What the fuck is wrong with you?

475
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,750
Pon.

476
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:18,583
In the past, she wouldn't get on a bus.

477
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:21,166
She said it's for the poor and it's hot.

478
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,875
But now, she said
she can do it to please her lover.

479
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,166
Damn, you puppy.

480
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,250
Stop sobbing, you little puppy.

481
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll tell you something.

482
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:54,166
As long as your face 
is not even half as handsome as mine,

483
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,125
your heart will always be broken.

484
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:58,541
You're making it worse!

485
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:03,041
It's not my intention,
but it's the way I am.

486
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,375
You can be sad, but don't kill yourself.

487
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,125
There is no bridge around here.

488
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,541
Fuck you! Want to get your ass kicked?

489
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:27,333
Men are taught to be tough

490
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:30,833
Men cannot whine
No matter how hard the situation is

491
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,750
Men have to bear with it

492
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,375
With broken hearts, or disappointment

493
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:37,625
Men cannot be sad
Must keep their chin up

494
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:44,083
You can take it, right, real man?

495
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,875
Your Holiness.

496
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,708
What are you doing?

497
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:49,958
It's heavy, isn't it?

498
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,333
Did you really need to say that?

499
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,166
It's almost 10:00 a.m.
Nobody's in the market.

500
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,083
A little bit longer, to get the cart full.

501
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,250
-Your Holiness...
-Police! Run!

502
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,791
Police! Let's go!

503
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,333
Your Holiness.

504
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,125
Your Holiness!

505
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,916
-Your Holiness.
-Hurry. Go straight.

506
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:06,250
Your Holiness.

507
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,583
Police. Let's go.

508
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,958
No talk, just run.

509
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,166
-Run.
-Your Holiness.

510
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,125
Leave anything that falls. Hurry up.

511
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,083
Run, run.

512
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,833
Your Holiness.

513
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,416
Hurry, hurry.

514
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,166
Stop, stop!

515
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,083
What the heck?

516
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,416
Are you okay?

517
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,500
Let us in.

518
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,875
You surprised me! Get on!

519
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,000
Get on. Hurry.

520
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,666
Are you okay?

521
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,125
No.

522
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,166
What's happening?

523
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,291
-Sit.
-Your Holiness.

524
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,125
Drive carefully.

525
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,250
What a hellish driver.

526
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,875
Your Holiness.

527
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,125
Hi. I'd like to make merit.

528
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,416
He just wanted to make merit,
and chased us this far to do it?

529
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,750
You, hold this.

530
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,333
Give me.

531
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,583
Stopped a bus just to make merit.

532
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:11,375
Next time, you'll probably
hold a charity, Sergeant.

533
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,750
Are you done?

534
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,125
Please bless me.

535
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,083
Okay.

536
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,375
Age, Skin,

537
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,375
Happiness, Para... cetamol.

538
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,625
Para... cetamol.

539
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,458
-Are you done yet?
-Yes, yes.

540
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,666
Damn. Stopped the bus to make merit.

541
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,041
The next bus is coming.

542
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,416
-Come on.
-Kid.

543
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,416
For two.

544
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,208
Monks go free.

545
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,416
Government employees and monks go free.

546
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,875
Here. Kid.

547
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,708
No fares?

548
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,500
Yeah. How long have you been a monk?

549
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,000
Long time.

550
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,750
-You forgot or you have Alzheimer's?
-I don't take a bus often.

551
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:06,541
Let me ask you something.
What were you thinking running after me?

552
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,208
I don't know.

553
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,583
I saw you shouting something.
I panicked, so I ran.

554
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,791
I see.

555
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:13,708
Yes, panic.

556
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,291
How long have you been a monk?

557
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,708
Nine terms.

558
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,291
Nine terms?

559
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:22,166
-Are you sure you're a real monk?
-You said it, not me.

560
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,291
So you're not a real monk?

561
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,250
Are you crazy? Are you trying to frame me?

562
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,958
Do you know Monk Jazz?

563
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,166
Yeah, that son of a bitch.

564
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,208
He's really famous now.
Five hundred million.

565
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:36,875
Five hundred million, of course.
He is really handsome.

566
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:40,125
No. Monk Jazz at Wat Saket.
Not the one in the movie.

567
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,541
Different Jazz, then.
I know the one at Wat Sakae.

568
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,458
I see.

569
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,583
It's so hot, sister!

570
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,291
Hang in there.

571
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,500
Our van broke down.
I'm taking you to catch a bus.

572
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,458
Why not a taxi?

573
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,000
You crazy? What are you thinking?

574
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,125
No money for taxis.
Our clients haven't paid us.

575
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:01,541
It's so hot that we're melting.

576
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,208
Stop!

577
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,875
If you complain, I'll take back
all the money for boobs.

578
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:09,708
Do you know Monk Thepmahayan?

579
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,791
That's every monk.
Monks don't wear an underwear.

580
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,833
Bus 888.

581
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,000
Please stop.

582
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,416
Step up here, girls.

583
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,166
Come on up.

584
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,458
Stop!

585
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:43,875
-Don't sit! Your dress will wrinkle.
-Yes, ma'am.

586
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,125
Stand.

587
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,250
All wrinkled.

588
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:51,291
Do I need to tell you every time?
Cover your boobs.

589
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,833
I'm a monk, not a ghost.

590
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:56,125
I'm so sorry. We're booth girls.

591
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,666
Our dresses are quite revealing.

592
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,125
There's nothing there.

593
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,958
Well, I haven't got them done.

594
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,125
Take care of yourself. Cover your boobs.

595
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,000
All right, just sit.

596
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,125
Forget about the dresses. Just sit.

597
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,708
Are you okay?

598
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:34,583
Yeah.

599
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,000
Pervert! Sister!

600
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:44,958
Are you harassing her?

601
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,791
-Well...
-You're harassing her?

602
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,000
No.

603
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,291
-Yes?
-No. Stop!

604
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,125
You're framing me.

605
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,500
Do you have proof?

606
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:57,833
Is there a CCTV? Play it.

607
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,041
No need.

608
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,750
That's very clear.
It's hard here but not anywhere else.

609
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:07,041
Follow my hand.

610
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,500
Sit down. Sit. And...

611
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,416
Don't be a pervert anymore, okay?

612
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,708
Yikes! Your smell.

613
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,791
Sit and cover your boobs.

614
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,583
They are too stimulating.

615
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,291
Go sit!

616
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,083
-What are you doing?
-What is that?

617
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,166
Hey. Look at how you dress.

618
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,791
Disrespecting the bus.

619
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,166
Not nice.

620
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,166
Sit still.

621
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:52,166
Lord.

622
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,166
-Lord.
-Buddha.

623
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,208
What?

624
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,291
Hey!

625
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:13,083
Where are they?

626
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,166
Where are all the big boobs?

627
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,291
-They got off.
-When?

628
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,250
They all got off.

629
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,416
Why didn't you wake me up?

630
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,416
Well, I saw you asleep
and didn't want to bother you.

631
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,083
No one woke me up.

632
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,791
-Why didn't you get off with them?
-Be quiet!

633
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,750
What?

634
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,666
Hey!

635
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,833
Hey!

636
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:35,541
-What are you guys talking about?
-What?

637
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,041
Done? The bus is coming.

638
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,291
One moment.

639
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,333
Lad Phrao, The Mall Bang Kapi...

640
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,416
-Hurry. The bus is here.
-Okay, okay.

641
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,000
Here. Hundred each.

642
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,083
The bus is here. Let's go.

643
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,958
Get on, hurry.

644
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,541
Let's go.

645
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,750
Hey.

646
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,833
No adults are giving up seats for kids?

647
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,916
What? There are empty seats. Sit.

648
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,375
-Do I have to use my hand here?
-Relax.

649
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,666
Why are you angry with me?

650
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,875
I don't know.

651
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,083
I'm sorry.

652
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:24,541
I don't know.

653
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,083
Who are you talking to?

654
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,166
I don't know.

655
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,750
My bad.

656
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,958
What are you doing?

657
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:32,875
Touching up.

658
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,625
You don't need any more.

659
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,458
It's as white as a temple wall.

660
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,708
I'm cute, aren't I?

661
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,750
Cute like a monkey!

662
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,500
And you're pretty like a buffalo!

663
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,375
A buffalo.

664
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,333
You, too.

665
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,291
Passengers next stop.

666
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,291
Wait.

667
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,291
How do you know?

668
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,541
-How does he know?
-Look.

669
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,791
Wait.

670
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,166
That's a dead body!

671
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,375
Come on up.

672
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:05,875
Through the window is easier.

673
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,500
-Okay.
-Yeah, through the window.

674
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,375
-Go help them.
-Damn!

675
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,125
No one's gonna help?

676
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,500
Come on up.

677
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,166
Lift.

678
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,666
Catch.

679
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,833
Hurry.

680
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,750
What the heck?

681
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,291
Come on, come on.

682
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,916
Don't pull his head.

683
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,333
Take the gurney, too.

684
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:40,083
Come on, come on.

685
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,166
Take me in.

686
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,333
Turn, turn, turn.

687
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,416
-Turn it.
-Put him on the floor.

688
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:52,125
You two didn't even think
to help us at all?

689
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,166
It's against the rules.

690
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,500
Your Holiness.

691
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,875
-Anything I can help with?
-It's done.

692
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:01,291
See? Even the crazy person wanted to help.

693
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:02,833
I'm not crazy.

694
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,375
I came here to apply for...

695
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,958
The Voyyy Singing Contest.

696
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What's your name?

697
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,083
Theppitak Aesala.

698
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:14,708
Go ahead.

699
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,708
Okay.

700
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,125
Where are you going?

701
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,666
Go ahead and sing.

702
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:25,083
Prepare to handle all the flirts

703
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:29,000
From now on we'll be choo-be-dub-be-doo

704
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,041
'Cause something like that

705
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,125
Happened to me before, so I never forget

706
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,208
Enough! Stop!

707
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,000
Go ahead.

708
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,666
Go ahead towards the exit.

709
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,500
Are you sure you're not the Magic Monkey?

710
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,583
I'm gonna go drive now. Move.
Get out of my way.

711
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,166
Everyone, sit down.

712
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,125
We're leaving.

713
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,750
Kid.

714
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,000
What is this bus? You take on everything?

715
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:56,208
Don't complain, please.

716
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:59,041
We are all equally worth something.

717
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,791
What the fuck? You startled me.

718
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,375
What's wrong with you?

719
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,791
Taking "hem" to hospital?

720
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,000
"Hem" who?

721
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,791
Hemorrhoids.

722
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,666
What's up?

723
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,458
He's sick with many illnesses.
Cancer, diabetes, heart disease,

724
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,791
high blood pressure.

725
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,041
No. What's up with your face?

726
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,375
I had it tattooed.

727
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,166
-Where?
-In prison.

728
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,083
Okay. Never mind.

729
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,708
RAMA VIII - HAPPYLAND

730
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:44,916
Hey, bro.

731
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,291
You left long before me.
How come I caught you?

732
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:51,083
What are you saying?
Louder, my eyesight is bad.

733
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,375
Your listening is bad.

734
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,375
Why? What's up?

735
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,250
Up for a race?

736
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,958
Who are you challenging, four-eyes?

737
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,041
You!

738
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,375
I've been driving since before
your mom and dad met each other.

739
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,833
Don't let him win, bro.

740
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,541
-I'm not scared.
-Show him.

741
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,625
I've been the bus champion 
since I was a sperm.

742
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:15,208
Get your binoculars ready to see 
the rear end of my bus, fuckface!

743
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,291
Fowl mouth, camel-balls head!

744
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,833
-I'll tell you this...
-What?

745
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,916
Lollygaggers like you
never become winners.

746
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:30,000
Stop running your mouth and just race.
Donkey-feet face!

747
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,583
Pon. I'm getting off here.

748
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,541
Go, go. Hurry.

749
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,750
I miss you.

750
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,708
Miss me for what?

751
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,583
See you in the evening.
I miss you already.

752
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,500
Evening? You've seen my wife?

753
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,208
Yikes. Don't make me throw up. Go!

754
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,041
Open the door.

755
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,958
Hey, wait!

756
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,000
-What?
-Tell your driver. Life means something.

757
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't risk it with Paul Walker.

758
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:57,166
My head!

759
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,458
Sorry. You're in my way.

760
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,958
Hey, you know what? After the race,

761
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,666
you'll know I'm Vin S.H.

762
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,125
Paul!

763
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,416
Bye, bye, Paul!

764
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,333
Get on the bus.

765
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,958
Is that hair or a scourer?

766
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,500
Let's go. My robe is all wet.

767
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,291
My dear passengers,

768
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,208
it's time to hold on to your seats.

769
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,583
Let's go!

770
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,208
Paul!

771
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,708
Pon, they're behind us. Hurry.

772
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,958
Hurry, bro.

773
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,083
Hurry.

774
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,333
Hurry.

775
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,875
Go!

776
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,250
Hey, don't let him win.

777
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,333
Let's go.

778
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,958
Don't let them win!

779
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,375
Sit in your seat!

780
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,416
They're coming.

781
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,625
Skunk, skunk!

782
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:37,375
Paul is winning, he's winning!

783
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,291
Bitch!

784
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,000
Come after me.

785
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,791
Pon, show him.

786
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:53,875
Try to beat me.

787
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,833
Don't let him win, okay?

788
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,875
RAMA VIII - HAPPYLAND

789
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,125
Hurry, hurry.

790
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,583
Hey, someone is sick.

791
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:11,625
Brother, I'm scared.

792
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:13,333
Don't be scared. I'm right here.

793
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,666
Are you what I think you are?

794
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,166
How could that be?

795
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,125
What about you?

796
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,458
Yes.

797
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:32,875
So I guess one of them.

798
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,666
Go back to cheering. Let's go!

799
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,541
-What the hell?
-Gear stick.

800
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,166
Put it back.

801
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:53,291
Awesome!

802
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,625
-Paul is winning!
-Here.

803
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:19,291
What's happening?

804
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,583
Right.

805
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,750
Hey.

806
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,583
Where are you going?

807
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,583
Is there a snake?

808
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,708
Can't hold it anymore.

809
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,625
It got me!

810
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:07,416
Help! Somebody help!
There's a snake biting my balls.

811
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,750
You!

812
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,833
It's even worse now.

813
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:14,375
Somebody help me.

814
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,791
Hurry up. Hurry.

815
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:24,958
Hurry.

816
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,416
Help me!

817
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,875
Pon!

818
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,125
Aren't you getting off?

819
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:35,208
I don't know.

820
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,166
What do you know?

821
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,583
Why are you playing with a snake?

822
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm not playing. It's biting my balls.

823
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,833
Help him.

824
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,625
-I'm scared of snakes.
-What?

825
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,208
Scared of a snake?

826
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,125
-Where's the snake?
-I'm not scared of snakes.

827
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,708
Look. Right here.

828
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,416
If you're not scared, then help me.

829
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,958
-Okay.
-Don't worry about me. Mind the snake.

830
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,416
Hurry. Come help.

831
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,583
Hurry.

832
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:08,625
Stop!

833
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,875
This isn't helping.

834
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,583
I used to be a nurse. I'll help you.

835
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:12,833
It must be hungry

836
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,000
and must have mistaken that for a rat
and swallowed it.

837
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,958
Don't pull,
rather let it swallow the whole thing.

838
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:19,583
Then pull it hard.

839
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,000
Hey, the snake's head is still there.

840
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:25,291
No. It's my penis.

841
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,250
Don't worry. I can suck up the venom.

842
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,250
Live sucking. Never seen it before.

843
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,291
You're all right. There's no more venom.

844
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,041
Girl, a python doesn't have venom.

845
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,958
What? So what did I just suck out?

846
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:44,875
My venom.

847
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:48,333
Serves you right. Sucking without asking.
Some must have gone down your throat.

848
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,291
-Pon, are you all right?
-Bring the gurney.

849
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,083
I can take the snake bite.
But when she sucked me...

850
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,083
What?

851
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,333
I'm exhausted.

852
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,291
Bring the gurney.

853
00:45:58,416 --> 00:45:59,583
Hurry up, bro!

854
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,208
Hurry up.

855
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,458
Lay down.

856
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,166
Bro, let's retrieve what we hid.

857
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,166
Let's go.

858
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,750
Lift him up. Come on.

859
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,625
Hey, what are you doing?

860
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,291
Let's go.

861
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:26,541
Easy.

862
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,750
Go, go.

863
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,875
Up there, help him.

864
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:32,875
Get on the bus.

865
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,875
Help! Help! The snake is squeezing me.

866
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,458
Help. The snake is squeezing me.

867
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,666
Don't bite me, okay?

868
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,208
Who can drive a bus?

869
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,333
No.

870
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,833
Can anyone drive a bus?

871
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,583
Me. I can drive.

872
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,625
Go ahead then. Take him to hospital.

873
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,583
-Okay, okay.
-Hurry.

874
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,833
You can do everything? Are you crazy?

875
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,125
Yes, I am.

876
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,083
We're all right now.

877
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,291
You're okay, right?

878
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:05,833
I'm sorry. Before going to the hospital,
let's dress the wound.

879
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,333
-Go ahead.
-Wait.

880
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:08,500
-Okay.
-Girl.

881
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,041
After him, could you help me, too?

882
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,291
-What's wrong with you?
-Hemorrhoids.

883
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,958
Easy. Use a rubber band.

884
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:17,791
Open it.

885
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:21,416
Are you crazy? Show my penis
to all these people?

886
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,416
It's swollen to the size of a cat's head.
It's not appealing.

887
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,833
I'm sorry. I need eyewitnesses.

888
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,375
No need.

889
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,416
Easy, bro.

890
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,000
Let me sterilize it.

891
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,416
Put a lot on.

892
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,250
Why scream?
It's to kill germs.

893
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:40,041
Kill germs, or me?
You sprayed the whole thing, bitch?

894
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,083
Okay, okay. Let's get started.

895
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:44,333
Let me put on gloves. So it's clean.

896
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:45,458
Other side.

897
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,041
Sorry, sorry.

898
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,458
-Bitch!
-Easy, girl.

899
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,291
Carefully put them on.

900
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,166
Great. You hit yourself.

901
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,875
We'll sterilize it and then suture.

902
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,291
-Do you have anesthetic?
-One moment. Sorry. Can I borrow it?

903
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,791
-What are you doing?
-One moment.

904
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,791
-What are you doing?
-Numbing it.

905
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,125
Numb, my ass. It hurts!

906
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,166
Not there yet.

907
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,500
He's injured. Please help him.

908
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,291
Hang in there.
We'll take you to the hospital.

909
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,875
Enough.

910
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:37,125
My head!

911
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,583
Calm down. You'll soon be at the hospital.

912
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:41,625
You're so capable.

913
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,458
Thank you.

914
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,500
-Nurse.
-Yeah.

915
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,500
Wash it sometimes.

916
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,416
I always wash it. It's a sweaty day.

917
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,708
It's so smelly, you pole dancer.

918
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,958
-Hush! Or I'll cut your suture.
-Stuck in my nose.

919
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,208
What'd you bandage my face for?
My penis hurts, not my face.

920
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,208
Take it off.

921
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:02,166
Right now?

922
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,666
Yes.

923
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,166
Don't just look at it.

924
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,208
What are you doing? Grooming?

925
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,166
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay.

926
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,708
He's almost dead.

927
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,625
Hey...

928
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,833
Be calm and collected.

929
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,041
I don't care.

930
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,458
Ready?

931
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,208
I've been ready.

932
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:20,958
Let's go to the hospital.

933
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,916
So painful!

934
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,541
Calm down, Grandpa.

935
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:35,416
Wait... Well... teacher...
Soon you'll be dead.

936
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:37,916
You'll soon be at the hospital.

937
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,208
Drive faster! He's almost dead.

938
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:48,083
You two are not helping,
just cursing me to death.

939
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,416
Move. We're in a rush to the hospital.

940
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,291
Hang on tight.

941
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,333
Don't get too excited.

942
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,041
Get out of the way!

943
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:23,500
Help him sit.

944
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,541
Be careful, your Holiness.

945
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,166
So, how is he? Dead?

946
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,083
Looks dead.

947
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,125
Not yet.

948
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,916
-Pull over! I want to get off.
-Why?

949
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,791
Pull over!

950
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,041
You guys. He's dead.

951
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,333
Dead?

952
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,583
What the hell?

953
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,041
Not breathing anymore!

954
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,541
Somebody's dead?

955
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,750
What the hell?

956
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,166
Everything is wrong here.

957
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,166
Shit.

958
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,250
Move! We need to go to the hospital.

959
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,875
Why'd you bring me on this crappy bus?

960
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,625
All this commotion.

961
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,500
I didn't know it'd be like this.

962
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,750
By now, I should have been home.

963
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:55,666
Yeah.

964
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,916
What would my mom say?

965
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,458
Somebody take a look at him.

966
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,416
Dead or alive? Fuck.

967
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,625
Yikes!

968
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,000
Bro, it's your phone.

969
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,791
-You stole my phone?
-Yes.

970
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:16,958
No! You dropped it over there.

971
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:20,125
Can I borrow it to make a call?

972
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,291
-You need it?
-Yes.

973
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:24,583
What's the number?

974
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:26,333
-0-8-8...
-0-8-8...

975
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,833
-8-8-8...
-8-8-8...

976
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,625
-8-8-8-8.
-8-8-8-8.

977
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,583
-Here.
-I think I'll die before I get home.

978
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:34,916
-Want to get off at the next stop?
-Okay, okay. Ring the bell.

979
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,208
Thank you very much.
It rang, but nobody answered.

980
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,125
Quick. Ring it.

981
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,208
This stop, please!

982
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:44,583
It rang, but nobody answered.

983
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:47,583
-What number did you call?
-0-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8.

984
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,958
Whose number is that?

985
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,833
The number to cut the brake line.

986
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,458
-Cut the brake line?
-Fuck!

987
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:01,333
The brakes aren't working!

988
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,541
What? The brakes aren't working.

989
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,583
-I didn't mean to.
-You didn't mean to?

990
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,791
It wasn't me.
The brakes are just not working.

991
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,666
Red light!

992
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,375
Station One to Station Two.
A bus ran a red light.

993
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,958
Code 40. Tien Ruammit intersection.

994
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,166
There are some injured.
Please send an ambulance, stat.

995
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:41,500
Calm down. Focus.

996
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:44,208
The bus could crash and kill us all.

997
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,166
Shut the fuck up.

998
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,541
Don't worry.
I'm used to handling responsibilities.

999
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:01,625
-I'm scared, I'm scared.
-What are you mumbling?

1000
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,500
Are you drunk?

1001
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,291
Move.

1002
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,833
He's cutting us off.

1003
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,750
Everybody, stop!

1004
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:20,000
Find a way to stop the bus. Or...

1005
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:22,291
I'll kill myself.

1006
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,750
Okay.

1007
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,500
Go ahead, shoot yourself.

1008
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,583
Come on.

1009
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:31,291
Stop. If you don't stop me,
I'll shoot at my heart.

1010
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,125
Go ahead.

1011
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,500
Hey!

1012
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,458
Are you gonna shut up now?

1013
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,875
Sit down. Sit!

1014
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:44,041
Are you crazy? Carrying a gun on the bus.

1015
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,166
It's dangerous, you know?

1016
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,541
Or you're a criminal
who has just robbed a bank?

1017
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:51,500
Or you're a kidnapper. Who are you?
Why do you have a gun?

1018
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,333
Why? Want to be the first to die?

1019
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,458
Dumbass! That's all you got?

1020
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,500
-Are you gonna sit down? Go.
-Okay.

1021
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,250
Calm down, okay?

1022
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:08,291
-Shut the hell up!
-He's just sick.

1023
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:10,791
The blonde head.

1024
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,500
Hey!

1025
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,625
Why are you jumpy? Call the police.

1026
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,708
Tell them the brakes aren't working. 
Hurry.

1027
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,583
I called a meeting today...

1028
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:22,250
because I really need help.

1029
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:26,083
I have been chasing them all over.
But I still can't catch them.

1030
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:27,458
To tell you the truth...

1031
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,125
many people are also chasing them.

1032
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,708
That's why I called you guys here.

1033
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,750
All hands on deck.

1034
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:34,916
Understand?

1035
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,875
If we can catch them,

1036
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,791
it will be your success.

1037
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,125
Do you have something to report?

1038
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,416
I want to tell you that this morning...

1039
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,583
I caught one of them.

1040
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,500
-Slowball.
-You're good.

1041
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:54,791
Amazing.

1042
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,166
Why didn't you tell me?

1043
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,583
I secretly did it.

1044
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,291
I heard that one of them
is in our station.

1045
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:05,500
I was gonna tell you
that it's in your office.

1046
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:07,250
-Really?
-Yes.

1047
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,125
Yes. Wait.

1048
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,875
Hey! Wait.

1049
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,458
Stay still. I found it.

1050
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:15,291
-Right in front of your face.
-Really?

1051
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,041
Here it is. Stay still.

1052
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,083
Dodging?

1053
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,041
Wait. You stay still.

1054
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:25,333
Stay still. This way.

1055
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,166
Don't dodge. Damn. No more balls.

1056
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:31,166
-Boss. Here, I found it.
-What?

1057
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,375
It's yellow, isn't it?

1058
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,666
-Hey. It's with me?
-Same one. Boss, stay still.

1059
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,916
-Fuck. Get this!
-Hey...

1060
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,333
-That's our boss.
-Sorry.

1061
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,291
-Boss.
-What's up?

1062
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:44,666
We got a 191 call. The brakes of bus
number 888 aren't working.

1063
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,958
It's now on Ratchada Road,
which is in our jurisdiction.

1064
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,625
Tell everyone on the bus

1065
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,041
to get a grip and calm down.

1066
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:56,458
I'll go there immediately.

1067
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:58,375
Let me catch a Pokémon.

1068
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,333
-Where is it now?
-Boss? I think we should go now.

1069
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:04,875
-Why?
-In our area,

1070
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,625
there should be a lot of them
because there are courts.

1071
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,500
I've found so many of them. All beautiful.

1072
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:15,916
Here. 1,500-1,600 XP. High points.
All beautiful.

1073
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,958
Where?

1074
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,416
-Poseidon, sir.
-That's a Pokémon?

1075
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,833
A masseuse.

1076
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,750
Yeah. Yes, sir.

1077
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:24,958
Okay, sir.

1078
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,250
Everybody, relax.

1079
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:29,291
Calm down.

1080
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,750
Right now the police are chasing Pokémons.

1081
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,916
No. They are finding a way to help us.

1082
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,375
Wait, guys. Calm down.

1083
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:46,000
The police are coming.

1084
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,625
Thai police can do a lot of things.

1085
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,416
Catch criminals, drugs, set up checkpoints

1086
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,833
by electric poles to surprise the bikers.

1087
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:54,791
And this is a serious case,
catching Pokémons.

1088
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:58,583
They are not easy to find.

1089
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,791
When are you gonna stop being delusional?

1090
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,291
The bus can't stop. What should we do?

1091
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:10,125
-Stop!
-Move. I want them to see us.

1092
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,750
Did you hear something?

1093
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,291
What?

1094
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:18,583
Clock.

1095
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,708
Correct. It's a clock.

1096
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,625
That's because I put a time bomb
on this bus.

1097
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,708
Bomb! Bomb!

1098
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,541
It will all go off at once.

1099
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:32,541
Boom.

1100
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:34,416
-Done.
-Very good.

1101
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,333
-Nobody saw us.
-Great. Let's go home.

1102
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,375
No. I didn't plot any bomb.

1103
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,083
And I didn't cut any brake line.

1104
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,208
Then let's go.

1105
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,291
Remember us?

1106
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,375
Think.

1107
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:46,208
Think.

1108
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,208
Think.

1109
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,833
Think. Think.

1110
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,291
That fucker is looking at me.

1111
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,000
He might be one of your friends.

1112
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,500
I don't have a friend like this.

1113
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:56,291
Bro, he's choking me.

1114
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,916
-What are you looking at me for?
-And you're looking at me.

1115
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,666
What? Are you messing with me?

1116
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,125
Shit. Are you sleeping now?

1117
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,000
He's not sleeping.
My friend knocked him out.

1118
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,958
Fucker!

1119
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,541
We are here, motherfuckers.

1120
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:20,666
Where?

1121
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,791
Police station.

1122
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:24,625
What did I do?

1123
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,875
-Let's go for a re-education.
-You the driver, nerd,

1124
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:29,000
remember my face. I'll get you back later.

1125
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,333
Now I know.

1126
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:33,041
You're the ones
that were fighting on my bus.

1127
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:33,958
Yeah.

1128
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,958
I wished you would become good guys.

1129
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:37,500
But you are fucking worse.

1130
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:38,833
Are you calling me names?

1131
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:41,041
We are Youths of the Year,
seven years in a row...

1132
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,208
Youths? Your faces are super old.

1133
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,916
Should have been sent for re-education.
Bastards.

1134
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,541
Should have sent you to...

1135
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,750
Eat this!

1136
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:51,625
Will you shut up now?

1137
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:55,041
Now... when I put my finger

1138
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,541
and press it

1139
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:58,583
like this...

1140
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,958
the bomb will be activated.

1141
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:06,125
You'll all be dead.
But we'll go home and sleep happily.

1142
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,291
But you've pressed it.

1143
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:10,541
-Have I?
-Shit. You pressed it so many times.

1144
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,125
Can you hear it?

1145
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,041
-Yes, your Holiness.
-What noise?

1146
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,875
-Engine noise.
-Listen for a bomb.

1147
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:21,291
-Yes, I heard.
-What is it?

1148
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,416
A time bomb.

1149
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,708
What should we do now?

1150
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:30,875
It'll go off in less than an hour.

1151
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:36,041
Good. Then I have time to kick your ass.

1152
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,416
There's a bomb?

1153
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,541
Yes, sir. We need to do something
before it goes off.

1154
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:43,958
I agree with him.

1155
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,958
Then we should get this bus
out of our jurisdiction asap.

1156
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:50,416
We should take it to an open area.

1157
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,208
And help the passengers out
by asking for military help,

1158
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,250
for safety.

1159
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,583
How about at Don Mueang
or Suvarnabhumi Airport?

1160
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:01,083
That's good.

1161
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,166
Because neither
are in our jurisdiction.

1162
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,500
See? All because of your dumbness.

1163
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,416
Speaking before thinking.

1164
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,541
Why are you yelling at me?
We're in this together. We're all hurt.

1165
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:13,791
Yeah?

1166
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,625
What's up with your face?

1167
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,458
I've was wondering.
Since we've got on the bus,

1168
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,916
you haven't spoken to anybody. Why?

1169
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,541
I got my ass kicked by a cop's son
and his boys.

1170
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:30,541
Got your ass kicked?

1171
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:33,208
Why are you so dumb to let them do that?

1172
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,916
Yeah, why are you so dumb 
to let them do that?

1173
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,166
Don't you see lots of feet here?

1174
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:42,583
Bro, it's all right.

1175
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:46,500
If we survive this,

1176
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,541
my boys and I

1177
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,708
will go help you to get back at them.

1178
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,833
Still want to fight?

1179
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:02,041
Breaking news. Bus no. 888,

1180
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:07,333
full of passengers, can't stop
because the brake isn't working.

1181
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:10,375
Right now, the bus is on Ratchada Road

1182
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,375
near Thailand Culture Center Intersection.

1183
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:15,833
We are informed that the bus driver is
Ponsak Chuanchuen.

1184
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,791
Pon! Fuck!

1185
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:21,916
Don't die yet, please.

1186
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,750
To all gods and angels,

1187
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,958
if I survive this,
I'll become a real monk.

1188
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,125
-What? You're not a monk?
-No.

1189
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,875
Why are you wearing a monk robe?

1190
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:32,958
I bought it.

1191
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,833
You know it's wrong?

1192
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,708
-Yes, I do.
-Then why did you do it?

1193
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,916
Your Holiness, all the alms I got,

1194
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,291
I never sell them,

1195
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,916
I donate them to the poor in slums.

1196
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,833
Where are all the kids?

1197
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:50,583
I'm here.

1198
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,375
Here. Eat it.

1199
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:58,541
Remember, work hard at school.

1200
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,750
Your stomach is full now.
Study hard, not just play.

1201
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:06,666
Your parents are tired.
Tomorrow I'll bring some more.

1202
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,958
You're so bad.

1203
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:10,666
Pretending to be a monk.

1204
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,625
-Sinner! I wish you go to hell.
-Yeah.

1205
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,625
You tarnish the religion. I might not
survive today, but let me yell at you.

1206
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:17,958
-Yeah.
-I did respect you.

1207
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:20,166
Wait.
Did I kill your parents or something?

1208
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,500
Why are you yelling at me?

1209
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:23,000
Not the least bit of shame?

1210
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,125
This is not nice.

1211
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,291
Hey!

1212
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,708
Let me take care of him.

1213
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:29,583
Yeah. Give him some.

1214
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,750
Fake monk.

1215
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:38,041
Fuck. You're just putting
your hands on your hips.

1216
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,208
When you do something good

1217
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:43,625
and somebody says you're doing it
for an image,

1218
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,416
let them think so.

1219
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,083
They can only criticize other people,

1220
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,500
but do nothing good.

1221
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,833
Well...

1222
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:55,583
let's think of him as a Robin Hood monk.

1223
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,458
Taking from the rich
to give to the poor.

1224
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,666
Uniform or good clothes...

1225
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:05,291
are not proof of good people.

1226
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:10,000
But a good mind is.

1227
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:12,958
Amen.

1228
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:14,750
That was unexpected.

1229
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:17,583
You should become a monk.

1230
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,958
-I was once, don't want to be again.
-Why?

1231
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,166
Too tiring to climb a mountain.

1232
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,375
Come here.

1233
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,666
I'm so sorry.

1234
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,000
That's all right.

1235
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:33,250
While we are alive...

1236
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,375
do something good to each other.

1237
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,041
When you die,

1238
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,916
you can't take anything with you.

1239
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,333
Hey, lift the corpse up.

1240
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,375
Be careful.

1241
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,458
What? Give him some respect.

1242
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,958
You, too?

1243
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,541
-Ob!
-What's up?

1244
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:04,666
Ob...

1245
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,250
Have you heard about my boyfriend?

1246
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,375
Yeah.

1247
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,916
Please. Please help him, Ob.

1248
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,041
Okay. My boss is giving the orders.

1249
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,875
Please help him. I love him very much.

1250
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:20,000
Don't worry. My sister's boyfriend

1251
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,875
is like my brother. I love you the same.

1252
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:24,083
Thank you so much.

1253
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:26,875
You love him, but what about Dad?

1254
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:31,000
I don't know if he's still mad at me
for leaving him for Pon.

1255
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:34,541
Nah. He's been asking about you every day.

1256
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:35,750
What did he say?

1257
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:38,916
He's worried about whether
you can afford your living.

1258
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,625
It's all about love.

1259
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:48,500
I can't help it. Pon is good,
handsome, and capable.

1260
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,416
You're sure?

1261
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,875
-Anyway, please help him.
-Okay.

1262
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:55,125
By the way, have you got
your tattoo removed?

1263
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:58,458
He had his replaced with another tattoo.
Hurry.

1264
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,708
-This way.
-What?

1265
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:05,958
Fuck.

1266
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:10,166
The bus with no brakes
is the same one that I forgot my gun on.

1267
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,333
Don't panic.
We'll find a way to get it together.

1268
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,833
We? Get it together?

1269
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:18,541
Get your gun back together.
Well, I have to get back

1270
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:22,375
-before our boss finds out this, too.
-I'm glad. I'm so glad to see my gun.

1271
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:25,250
-See you.
-To see my gun.

1272
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,625
What do we do to get my gun back?

1273
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,208
What's up with you?

1274
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,291
Nothing.

1275
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:32,666
You're frowning.

1276
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,458
It's nothing.

1277
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,000
If you want to ask me something, you can.

1278
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,250
Remember that night?

1279
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,541
Which night?

1280
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,833
That night?

1281
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:13,583
Salin just kept me company.
Nothing happened between us.

1282
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,166
How about me?

1283
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You, I love.

1284
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:55,125
Neither airport is giving us permission
to use their space.

1285
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:58,125
Well, then, contact the airport
nearest to Bangkok.

1286
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,333
Yes, sir.

1287
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:04,291
You go tell the passengers on the bus
to be calm and collected.

1288
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:06,000
Don't panic.

1289
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:10,666
We'll lead them to the nearest airport.

1290
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,083
Yes, sir.

1291
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:15,666
Let me say it here.
I want this to be confidential.

1292
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,458
Do not let the press know.

1293
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,791
Yes, sir.

1294
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,250
Hello, Mom.

1295
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,916
I'll do my homework at my friend's.

1296
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,583
I might be late. Yeah.

1297
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,458
Yeah.

1298
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,708
Don't worry about me. Yeah.

1299
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:35,208
Love you, Mom.

1300
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,083
Why did you lie to her?

1301
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:39,625
A little white lie.

1302
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,875
-Where's the bus going?
-I don't know.

1303
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,166
Get up!

1304
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:53,916
I told you to get up.

1305
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,666
Hey, back off.

1306
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,000
Calm down. What are you doing?

1307
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,375
I want my stuff.

1308
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:03,375
-What is it?
-Something valuable to me,

1309
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:04,916
and can make me rich.

1310
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,583
I knew it! He's a criminal.

1311
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:09,458
Criminal?
Then that child is not his brother?

1312
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:10,500
He's my brother.

1313
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,250
He doesn't look like you at all.

1314
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:15,000
You're black as coal,
he's white as cotton.

1315
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:20,208
I'll shoot anyone who comes closer.

1316
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,916
Lift your butt.

1317
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,375
He'll hurt the hostage.

1318
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,916
Taking a child as a hostage?
Let's kick his ass.

1319
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:29,958
I'll kick your ass instead!
Fucking yelling out.

1320
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,666
Move back.

1321
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,541
You!

1322
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:38,291
Don't be scared. It's a fake gun.

1323
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:39,458
How do you know?

1324
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:41,625
The noise when it fell.

1325
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:44,625
That's right. The real one is here.

1326
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:47,250
Here, look if you don't believe me.

1327
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:51,666
Why are you doing this?

1328
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:57,416
Brother.

1329
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,666
Yes.

1330
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:04,333
Today, my friends told me
that they went to a theme park.

1331
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,250
I want to go there sometime.

1332
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:12,833
Can you take me there? I want to go there.

1333
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,666
Maud, the entry fees are expensive.

1334
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,583
Shouldn't we spend all this money on food?

1335
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:27,916
Okay?

1336
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,708
Okay.

1337
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:37,833
If Mom and Dad were still alive,
they could have taken us there.

1338
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:45,125
I should go to bed now.

1339
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,291
Maud.

1340
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:50,916
Maud.

1341
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,750
What's going on?

1342
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,666
Why are you crying?

1343
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:58,375
I'm missing Mom and Dad.

1344
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,250
Maud.

1345
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,833
Don't cry.

1346
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:18,625
We're poor.

1347
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,958
That's not the point.
You're not the only one.

1348
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,791
We can't choose how we were born.
Look at me.

1349
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:26,833
A face like this should be a CEO,
but I'm a bus driver.

1350
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,333
Kid, you look like a blobfish.

1351
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,166
Give it back to me!

1352
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,791
-Shoot me if you dare.
-Fuck!

1353
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,750
The bullet would hit me first.

1354
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:43,000
-Here. Open it.
-Defy me?

1355
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:45,458
You defy me?

1356
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:51,000
You want to see my wrath? Give it back.

1357
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:53,291
Give it back to me.

1358
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,375
Here, bro.

1359
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,875
You'll be in jail for a long time.

1360
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:03,083
Because you sell... sausage.

1361
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,250
This alone will fill you up.

1362
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,875
Hey, stop!

1363
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,375
Kid, hold this.

1364
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:28,958
Where did you get this?

1365
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,708
Somebody told me to hold it.

1366
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:31,666
Stop!

1367
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:33,666
Let's go.

1368
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,375
Sergeant! Somebody saw them outside

1369
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,958
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

1370
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:15,083
Maud, don't tell anybody
where I hid it, okay?

1371
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:17,750
We'll be rich 
and can go to the theme park.

1372
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,083
Hey, you know what?

1373
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:24,791
It's bad enough to be poor,
don't be a criminal.

1374
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:30,458
Many poor people with legal jobs
have become rich.

1375
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,958
Stop doing this.

1376
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:34,625
Don't let the rich look down upon us.

1377
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:36,583
Be poor but proud with a legal job.

1378
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:39,583
Two sausages can't make you rich.

1379
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:44,541
Pon, the police are calling.

1380
01:13:44,625 --> 01:13:45,750
Hello.

1381
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,750
Yes.

1382
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:53,250
The police said
they would lead us to the nearest airport.

1383
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,458
Okay, sir. Bye.

1384
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,416
Think about it.

1385
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,833
About what I told you.

1386
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,666
Stop crying.

1387
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:16,375
I'll take you to the theme park.

1388
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,875
Guys, we're here.

1389
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:47,958
We're okay now.

1390
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,583
Hey! The driver!

1391
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:58,166
Why don't you follow the police?

1392
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,833
Why did you turn this way?

1393
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,458
Over there!

1394
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:02,875
What's up with you?

1395
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,958
-What?
-Hey! An airplane!

1396
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,166
Everyone, don't panic.

1397
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:15,708
We have less than eight minutes left
until this bus explodes.

1398
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,916
Hey, hey.

1399
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:23,375
Guys, there's a military truck.
They came to help us.

1400
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:24,875
We'll be okay.

1401
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:27,583
Let the injured go first. Open the door.

1402
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,333
-Where are you going?
-What?

1403
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,000
Let the injured go first.

1404
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,458
I don't care. I'll go first.

1405
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,000
Hey, your Holiness.

1406
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,250
You're a fake.

1407
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:41,083
You deserve to die on the bus.
I should go first, my girl is waiting.

1408
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:43,916
Stop. Your girl means nothing.
I have to go do my boobs.

1409
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,958
Can we cut in front of you?

1410
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,625
-Where are you going?
-Home to play games.

1411
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,458
Fuck! Still thinking of games? Move back.

1412
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:55,208
You all move away.
I'll go first. I come with a child.

1413
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:57,000
Why did you bring him here?

1414
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,416
You go.

1415
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,583
Hey. No need to fight.

1416
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:03,416
-There's another door.
-The back door is broken. It won't open.

1417
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,583
-Hey!
-The front door can open. Let's take it.

1418
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:06,666
Hey!

1419
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,625
-So take the back door, not the front.
-Hey!

1420
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,041
What is that for?

1421
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:13,833
Let me go first.

1422
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:16,166
Do your boobs? Do a repair first.

1423
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,875
Here.

1424
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:19,833
Point it at me.

1425
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,166
-You're not becoming a monk?
-If I survive, I'll come back.

1426
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,125
Go!

1427
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:24,583
Good!

1428
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:26,125
-Go on.
-Open the door.

1429
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,000
Help me, please.

1430
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,541
Go on.

1431
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:00,708
Hurry.

1432
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,583
Almost there, Pon. Hurry.

1433
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:53,208
Step right here.

1434
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,875
Hey! Hey!

1435
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:03,333
The airplane!

1436
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,916
Fuck!

1437
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,583
The driver! You drive!

1438
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:19,750
I'm the conductor.
I'm not the driver. You are.

1439
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:23,958
I love you.

1440
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,875
I love you, too, Pon.

1441
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:30,500
-If we must die, you die first, okay?
-What?

1442
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:33,291
-You die first.
-Shit. We die together.

1443
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:47,375
Sir, the bus is going into the forest.

1444
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:58,750
-What the fuck?
-What do we do?

1445
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:21,625
It's the meaning of love

1446
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:27,750
No matter how far apart we are

1447
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:33,875
It's the meaning of friendship

1448
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:40,916
It will never fade

1449
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:45,000
Sir, the passengers on the bus

1450
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,250
are all safe. 

1451
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:50,750
And the bus fell off the cliff 
into the sea, and exploded.

1452
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:54,125
Luckily, it didn't explode in our area.

1453
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,541
Yippee!

1454
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:58,875
It's just hatched. Look.

1455
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,375
Awesome.

1456
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:04,333
-Look!
-It's hatched.

1457
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:14,208
LATER... ON

1458
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:24,291
I know that deep down

1459
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,958
you're a good person.

1460
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:30,291
So, I'd like you to work hard
on practicing the dharma

1461
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:34,166
and help maintain the religion
to stay strong.

1462
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,958
I'd like to congratulate you
with this merit

1463
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,541
and bless you.

1464
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:53,333
Brother, are you ready?
I don't want to miss the theme park.

1465
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,541
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

1466
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,000
Let's go.

1467
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,291
Let's go. You ready?

1468
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,000
-Yes.
-Okay. Let's go.

1469
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:12,541
Before I go home,
can I get your line ID?

1470
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:13,666
What line?

1471
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:14,791
The end of the line.

1472
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,583
Love you till the end of the line.

1473
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:23,333
Nurse. I'd like to take you 
to see America.

1474
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:24,500
Which state?

1475
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:26,750
-The state of love.
-Love you very much.

1476
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,375
How about you? Got something?

1477
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:33,875
Nurse. Don't sit like that for long.
You might be hungry.

1478
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,791
-Hungry for food?
-Hungry for me.

1479
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,666
Really?

1480
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,375
You can't beat me.

1481
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,458
Let me see your hand.

1482
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,708
Your skin is so smooth.

1483
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:48,916
If you come live with me,

1484
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,750
I'll give it a good cleaning.

1485
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,333
The sea has sand.

1486
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:59,083
My heart has you. I'm fantasizing...

1487
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,208
My fucking foot in your mouth.

1488
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,208
You're good. But...

1489
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:08,791
we've just met, you shouldn't use
that kind of language.

1490
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,250
In response,

1491
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,125
I'll slap you with my nose.

1492
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,000
Slap here! Slap with your nose.

1493
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:21,125
Want to try my foot? Fragrant.

1494
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:23,958
There's nothing here, my dear wife.

1495
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:27,458
I was complimenting you, your beauty,
and your kindness to the nurse.

1496
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:29,291
Really? Then it's okay.

1497
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,458
Let's go home, my dear.

1498
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:34,583
You look beautiful today.

1499
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,041
I'm still single.

1500
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:38,666
-Hey!
-You begging for an ass kicking?

1501
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,333
Let's go home, my dear.

1502
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,541
I brought a car today.

1503
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:45,916
What a beautiful car. Whose car is it?

1504
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,708
My dad's car.

1505
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,250
You two talk to each other now.

1506
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:51,708
Well, we are not mad at each other.

1507
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,291
I just chose to be with my dear husband.

1508
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:01,166
Are you just talk or do you wanna race?

1509
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,333
Stay or leave?

1510
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,166
Let's go.

1511
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,833
-It's in the movie.
-Pon!

1512
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,000
Ready?

1513
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:12,583
-Let's go!
-Go!

1514
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:33,541
It's the meaning of love

1515
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:39,666
No matter how far we are apart

1516
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:45,791
It's the meaning of friendship

1517
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:52,625
It will never fade

1518
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:31,041
Have you found your girl?

1519
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:35,000
No. But I'll keep looking.

1520
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,750
Good luck to you.

1521
01:26:37,833 --> 01:26:39,458
I hope you find her soon.

1522
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,208
Thank you.

1523
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,875
You know what?

1524
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:14,416
I waited for you
at the bus stop every day.

1525
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:18,000
Days become months.

1526
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,833
Months became forever.

1527
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,333
No one can replace you.

1528
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:26,125
Today, could you do me the honor?

1529
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,833
Go on a date with me,
dinner with me, will you?

1530
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:31,541
I can't today.

1531
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,041
I'm in a hurry.

1532
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:38,875
I have to take her to Hong Kong.

1533
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,958
It's okay.

1534
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:44,875
Please remember,

1535
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:46,666
no matter how long,

1536
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,708
I'll be waiting for you right here.

1537
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:50,208
Ten years?

1538
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,583
Are you moving to Hong Kong?

1539
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,208
I'll be in jail. Let's go.

1540
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:57,083
Or I'll sue your mom for stealing.

1541
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,583
No.

1542
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,583
-No!
-Hey.

1543
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:05,916
-No!
-What's wrong?

1544
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:08,541
Do you remember him?

1545
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:09,791
Yeah, the handicapped guy.

1546
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,666
And I thought you'd learned.

1547
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,000
How can you say that?

1548
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:14,291
Guys, hold them up.

1549
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,375
Here.

1550
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,750
I'm a cop's son, you know.

1551
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:25,166
My dad holds a high rank.

1552
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,208
I don't care.

1553
01:28:26,291 --> 01:28:27,416
Switch to another person.

1554
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,250
Okay. No problem.

1555
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,125
Nut. Do it.

1556
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,666
-No, I can't.
-Why?

1557
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,375
Because I have premeditated it.

1558
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:35,750
How about you?

1559
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:37,583
No? Then go ahead.

1560
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:40,708
I didn't mean to do this.

1561
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,166
Why are you slapping me?

1562
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,375
I'm a drag queen.

1563
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:47,375
I don't care.

1564
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,166
Mia.

1565
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:58,166
I don't think we can go on like this.

1566
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,416
-What would you say if I sold drugs?
-Are you crazy?

1567
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,541
The fellow at the end of the alley does it
and he's become rich.

1568
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,250
So you want to do it too?

1569
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,791
It's illegal, you know.

1570
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:11,541
Think about me.

1571
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:13,500
If you got caught,
how long would you be in jail?

1572
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:15,250
What are you talking about?

1573
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:18,166
I mean, gluta beauty drug.

1574
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,833
Fuck.

1575
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:24,583
I thought you meant amphetamine
or something.

1576
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,208
Are you crazy? Look at me.

1577
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:30,666
The police always search me.
Test my pee and even my poop.

1578
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,625
If I were a drug dealer,
I'd be in jail for sure.

1579
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:33,958
Well, you look like one.

1580
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,500
I do?

1581
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,208
You don't know?

1582
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,458
You really look like one.

1583
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:54,541
-Goddess...
-No need to say it.

1584
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:57,166
I know it all. Ask me.

1585
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:00,416
-Well...
-No need to say it.

1586
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,666
I know it all.

1587
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:03,708
Ask me.

1588
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:07,083
Well, I've been broke for a long time.

1589
01:30:07,708 --> 01:30:09,291
When will I become rich?

1590
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:15,333
When you have a lot of money.

1591
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:22,291
What would you say
if I got up and kicked her?

1592
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:30,166
Why are you all here?

1593
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:38,375
Fake and bull... shit!

1594
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:41,000
What are you saying?
I have no idea what happened.

1595
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,750
Have no idea...

1596
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:48,958
No idea at all...
Swear on your dad's life...

1597
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:52,541
Yeah.

1598
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,166
Be careful. It'll spill on my bike.

1599
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:07,958
I'm so lucky to see
a hard-to-find creature.

1600
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,875
Your face looks so funny.

1601
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,125
You were so brave to be born like that.

1602
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,583
You!

1603
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:17,708
You!

1604
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:21,291
Before you criticize someone,
look at your own face.

1605
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,958
Why do people like to insult someone else?

1606
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:27,041
Don't judge people by the outside,
but the inside.

1607
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:33,416
-You, in the red shirt...
-Yeah.

1608
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,416
You have a boyfriend?

1609
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:35,833
No.

1610
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,916
-Want to be my girlfriend?
-Are you sure?

1611
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,625
Yeah. Hop on.

1612
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:41,458
Bye-bye.

1613
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:45,708
There.

1614
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,666
Sister, I'll let you kiss me.

1615
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,458
Great.

1616
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:05,041
Why didn't he pick a pretty face like me?

1617
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:20,000
-Are you okay?
-Enough. That's enough.

1618
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:23,041
Why are you driving so fast?
The bus is full of people.

1619
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,083
He needs to bring the injured to hospital.

1620
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,416
I'm afraid to be us as well.

1621
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,208
-Where is your temple?
-Koh Lak.

1622
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:29,250
-Where is it?
-Phuttake.

1623
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:31,583
-What temple again?
-Are you messing with me?

1624
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,958
Now?

1625
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:42,333
-I'm filing my nails, waiting for you.
-Yeah, yeah.

1626
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:44,083
That makes me horny.

1627
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:47,833
-Damn it. I'm right here.
-Where?

1628
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:49,958
What the hell?

1629
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:56,041
Don't smile.

1630
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:58,166
I'm sorry.

1631
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,708
I'm sorry.

1632
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,291
It's too tight. He can't breathe.

1633
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,708
Do you know Monk Thammachaiya?

1634
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,541
Forget it. I won't play this joke.

1635
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,416
The one who plays Likay?

1636
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,208
Okay, okay.

1637
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,250
-Can we redo the suture?
-Why?

1638
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:20,333
-My ring is gone.
-You lost it in my balls?

1639
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:23,000
-Get it back when I'm better.
-My engagement ring.

1640
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:25,083
Shit.

1641
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:26,666
Take a photo.

1642
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:29,083
What? What?

1643
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:30,333
What?

1644
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:36,375
-What's next, pal?
-I'm not your pal.

1645
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:39,208
Sorry, sorry.

1646
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:40,958
