1
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,250
Continuing with the STIC,

2
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,583
or the Standardized Test
for International Colleges,

3
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,916
a general knowledge exam

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,291
for students who wish to apply
to US universities.

5
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,958
This year, the body overseeing the exam

6
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,291
discovered that
a cheating incident occurred,

7
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:08,000
leading to the leaking of exam questions
in many countries throughout Asia.

8
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,958
Further investigation is pending.

9
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,500
It's not mine.

10
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,625
My name is Rinrada Nilthep.

11
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,208
I'm in my final year
at Krungthep Thaweepanya School.

12
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,875
You can call and check my academic record.

13
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:47,166
The STIC isn't beyond my abilities.

14
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,500
STUDENT RECORD: MISS RINRADA NILTHEP

15
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,708
GPA: 4.00, SEVENTH GRADE,
ACADEMIC YEAR 2011

16
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,083
NINTH GRADE

17
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,166
Straight As since first grade.

18
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,416
Honor student from seventh grade
to ninth grade.

19
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:37,958
First place in the school district's
mathematics competition.

20
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,958
National Crossword Champion.

21
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,625
And in sports, this one is for swimming.

22
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,250
You don't have to say anything else.

23
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,041
It's enough already.

24
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,125
You don't have to ask anymore

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,791
whether or not we want to accept Lynn.

26
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,666
Instead, you need to ask Lynn

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,666
whether or not she wants to study here.

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,458
What do you say, honey?

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:08,125
I don't have to give my decision
right now, do I?

30
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,916
It's not that I don't want to study here.

31
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,291
I just think my old school
suits me better.

32
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,333
Because if I move here,

33
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,541
Dad will have to pay
almost 150,000 a year.

34
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,458
How did you get 150,000?

35
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,125
One semester is only 60,000.

36
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,250
so that makes it 120,000 a year, right?

37
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,541
Correct.

38
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:38,083
However, I commute with my dad,
as he teaches at my old school.

39
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,166
If I study here, I would have
to take the Skytrain,

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,625
including the motorbike taxi
from the station. That is 80 baht a day.

41
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,875
SKYTRAIN- 50 BAHT
MOTORBIKE- 30 BAHT

42
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,166
Return trips over 8 months,
which is 170 days,

43
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,791
excluding public holidays,

44
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,375
that makes it 13,600 baht per year.

45
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,166
Then there's the cost of lunches.

46
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,166
I get rice with 2 side dishes
for 20 baht at my old school.

47
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,000
Here, it's 35 baht.

48
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,416
Then there's also the cost
of my school supplies

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,250
and my new school uniform.

50
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,166
All in all, I think...

51
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,291
it might not be worth it.

52
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,166
NEW UNIFORMS- 1,184 BAHT
NEW BOOKS- APPROX. 875 BAHT

53
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,083
Gold medal in math.

54
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,291
Honey.

55
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,583
I can afford it.

56
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,916
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,333
What if we waive the tuition fees?

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,375
Vit.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,875
And let's include
the free lunch program as well.

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,375
I want to show that we appreciate
Lynn's academic abilities.

61
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,708
Is it worth it now?

62
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,083
It's worth it.

63
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,125
Now, it's worth bringing this.

64
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,166
It's worth it, right?

65
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,750
LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION

66
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,875
LYNN

67
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,833
TENTH GRADE

68
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:05,958
Done.

69
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,125
Wait!

70
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,333
We have to use this ID
for the next three years.

71
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,583
You have to look good.

72
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,291
You're new here, aren't you?

73
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,708
I'm Grace.

74
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm Lynn.

75
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,333
-What are you doing?
-Let me have a look.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,916
Take off your glasses.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,958
Trust me.

78
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,791
Wow!

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,666
Pretty!

80
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,916
Come on, smile.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ready? One, two...

82
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,708
Go now.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,416
Quickly. Off you go.

84
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,833
GRACE

85
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,208
Our ID numbers follow each other,
so we have sat together for three years.

86
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,166
Actually, we're really close.

87
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,916
Everyone says Lynn is smart.
As for me, well...

88
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,791
I'm good at extracurricular activities.

89
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,583
Some people might even think I'm dumb.

90
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,541
This term, the headmistress came up
with a new rule.

91
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,416
To be in the school play,
you need a GPA of at least 3.25.

92
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,333
Why? I'm too dumb to appear
in a school play?

93
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,083
I think acting is harder than studying.

94
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,625
Really?

95
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,708
Really.

96
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:08,958
Look.

97
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,833
I have had tutoring
with Mr. Sophon for weeks,

98
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,500
but I still don't know shit.

99
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,625
And math really pulls my grades down.

100
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,500
The answer is C.

101
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,375
What?

102
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,416
You knew the answer
after only a quick glance?

103
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,416
And upside down, too!

104
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,041
It's super easy.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,916
Union A and B intersect with C.
Do the ones in brackets first.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,750
Then the intersection of C
is just what's left in C.

107
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,833
-That's the answer.
-Yes.

108
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,250
I got it!

109
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,666
Scholarship kids are really excellent.

110
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,708
One more question--

111
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,750
Will you be my tutor, Lynn?

112
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,958
Why not?

113
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,083
If you teach me,

114
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,875
I'll buy you a milkshake every day.

115
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,708
No.

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,666
You'll get to review the lessons
every evening.

117
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,083
Not enough.

118
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,208
What if...

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,083
If you agree,

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,458
I'll get to be your first student,
Teacher Lynn.

121
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:26,791
Teacher Lynn!

122
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,958
Teacher Lynn!

123
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,791
Teacher Lynn.

124
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,333
I like the sound of that.

125
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,666
I'll teach you all of this today.

126
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,083
Grace told you that I helped her
with her studies?

127
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,041
That's true.

128
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,875
But there's nothing wrong
with tutoring a friend, right?

129
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,625
It's the time everyone
has been waiting for.

130
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,916
MIDTERMS

131
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,625
Thirteen...

132
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,541
Stop it. Take a deep breath
and clear your mind.

133
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,500
It's crystal clear.

134
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,375
Students, you may begin the exam.

135
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,333
MIDTERM EXAM, MATHEMATICS

136
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,291
MATHEMATICS
60 QUESTIONS FOR 30 POINTS

137
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:32,083
WHAT IS THE ANSWER
FOR UNION A AND B, INTERSECT WITH C?

138
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:38,250
WHAT IS THE ANSWER
FOR UNION A AND B, INTERSECT WITH C?

139
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,708
WHAT DOES THE SHADED AREA SHOW?

140
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,291
WHAT IS THE SUBSET
OF INTERSECTION A AND B?

141
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,833
WHICH ANSWER IS CORRECT?

142
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,041
Mathematics.

143
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,166
I have warned you before
that it's not easy.

144
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,833
People who knew
that they didn't understand,

145
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,791
but still didn't come to me
for tutoring...

146
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,416
Well, it's too late for them now.

147
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,125
They're out of time.

148
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,791
Grace!

149
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,250
Grace!

150
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,041
The questions are just like those
on the teacher's cheat sheet.

151
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,166
-Yes?
-You can do it, right?

152
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,291
No.

153
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,958
What do you mean? I taught you already.

154
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,041
I can't remember.

155
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,958
Why are you two talking?

156
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,500
No talking, no cheating.

157
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,125
I won't tolerate any nonsense
in my exam room.

158
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,708
IF X^2 - 13X + 42 = 0,
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF X - 13/2?

159
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,500
51. D

160
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,958
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP

161
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:30,958
Grace.

162
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,791
The answer.

163
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,666
Should I write my name on the scrap paper?

164
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,625
Of course, you should.
Haven't you taken an exam before?

165
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,791
I'm sorry, sir.

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,958
B D C D A A C A C A...

167
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
STUDENT REPORT CARD
MISS RUJIRA SAETONG

168
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,416
A 3.87! I got a 3.87!

169
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I got a 3.87!

170
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,833
What did you get? What did you get?

171
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,250
An easy 4.

172
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,708
Are you free tomorrow? Let's celebrate.

173
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,166
Sure. Where shall we go?

174
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,875
How about Pat's place? It's convenient.

175
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,625
You have a swimsuit, right?

176
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,916
Pat, would it kill you
to just get in normally?

177
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,333
I guess not,

178
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,666
but it wouldn't be cool.

179
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,750
Damn! I got water in my ear.

180
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,083
Mr. Pat, dinner is served.

181
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,333
Just leave it there.

182
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,708
Babe, I'm getting cold.

183
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,166
PAT

184
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Are you diving to look for coral, Grace?

185
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,875
I have been asking Grace
to invite you over many times.

186
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,375
We're in the same class,
but we hardly ever talk to each other.

187
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,375
Grace, though...

188
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,416
-She's always, "Lynn this, Lynn that."
-Shut up.

189
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,708
Are you jealous?

190
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,958
Grace always tells us
that you're so smart.

191
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
Without your help, Grace's grades
wouldn't have improved.

192
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,833
I have even told her that

193
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,416
I want to have a best friend like you.

194
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,791
I have noticed
that you have a lot of close friends.

195
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,125
I do.

196
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
But none of them are that close

197
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,791
that they would lend me
their erasers during an exam.

198
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,666
What is it?

199
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,833
You also want to appear
in the school play?

200
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,875
Smart people like you just don't get it.

201
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,791
But thickheads like me,

202
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,458
we're all dying to get good grades.

203
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,666
Right, babe!

204
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,250
Dad said he'll buy me a new car if I pass.

205
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,666
Sounds good?

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,916
I know we aren't that close.

207
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,791
But if you agree...

208
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,500
I'll pay you 3,000 per subject.

209
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,958
Per person.

210
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,500
Per person?

211
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,958
What do you mean?

212
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,583
I have five more friends, you see.

213
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,666
Oh? What if the teachers find out?

214
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,833
Don't worry about that.

215
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,791
All of my friends can be trusted.

216
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,958
And they're all willing to pay 3,000 each.

217
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,750
Think about it. That's for one subject.

218
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,833
How many subjects are there
in each term, Grace?

219
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,416
If you don't count PE...

220
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,416
Thirteen, right?

221
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,208
So, for just one exam,

222
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,250
you'll get 13 times that amount.

223
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,958
That's 234,000 baht.

224
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,791
A nice number, 234,000 baht.

225
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,541
In exchange for your brains.

226
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,500
You can think of it as getting
your school's tea money back.

227
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,041
What "tea money"?

228
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,500
Seriously? You really didn't know?

229
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,000
Everyone has to pay.

230
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,666
The dumber you are,
the more you have to pay.

231
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,625
I had to pay 400,000.

232
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,750
As for him, he donated 20 iMacs
to the school library.

233
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,125
But I got a scholarship.

234
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,416
The scholarship is for studying.

235
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,666
Don't forget your maintenance costs.

236
00:17:54,208 --> 00:18:00,500
RECEIPT FOR STUDENT FEES: 200,000 BAHT

237
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,166
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

238
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,791
MR. PRAVIT NILTHEP
AND MRS. SUJIKARN PHAIBULRUNGROJ

239
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,333
What's gotten into you?

240
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
I was going to sell it to buy a new car.

241
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,541
It seems like
you haven't played it in ages.

242
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,958
I just remembered
that yesterday was Mom's birthday.

243
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,458
Why did you want me to move
to this school so badly?

244
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,625
Many students who graduate
from this school

245
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
get scholarships to study overseas.

246
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,958
I wanted to give you better opportunities.

247
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,041
Dad, I'm not like Mom.

248
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,333
Have you ever wondered

249
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,833
if I would have been happier
at my old school?

250
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,833
Three points.

251
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,583
Don't make too much noise, okay?

252
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,625
Consider our neighbors.
Come and have dinner.

253
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,250
I'm off to bed.

254
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,791
I admit that I paid Lynn.

255
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,083
But paying your friend for music lessons

256
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,833
can't be against the law anywhere, right?

257
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,583
Or can it?

258
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,166
Are you going to send me
to an international court?

259
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,708
Have any of you ever heard
that classical music

260
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,458
can help with the brain's development?

261
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,958
We'll use four songs

262
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,375
to represent A, B, C, and D.

263
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,583
Memorize the movements of my fingers.

264
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,041
This is A.

265
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,458
When you memorize it,

266
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,041
remember it starts with the pinky
and ends with the thumb.

267
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,458
This is B.

268
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,958
B is 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, repeated twice.

269
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,291
This is C.

270
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
And this is D.

271
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,041
I'll give you three answers and skip one.

272
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,333
Then, I'll repeat the pattern.

273
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,583
So, it won't be suspicious.

274
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,500
This will keep the marks low enough
to stay under the teacher's radar.

275
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,375
Answer the other questions yourselves.

276
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,583
I'll start giving you
the answers at 9:15 a.m.

277
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,458
Meanwhile, start answering
the other questions.

278
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,458
FINALS 2013
8:30-10:30 A.M.

279
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,916
A

280
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,208
-D.
-D.

281
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,500
D

282
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,541
C

283
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,000
Goodness.

284
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,000
This shirt is expensive.

285
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,583
Getting rich from teaching piano?

286
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,791
It's okay to wear new clothes, you know.

287
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,583
At school, they say
you're a stingy teacher.

288
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,083
Well, I guess a new pair of pants
wouldn't hurt, too.

289
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,958
CLASSICAL PIANO LESSONS BY TEACHER LYNN

290
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,541
More people want to join
your piano lessons.

291
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,666
CONGRATULATIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP, ELEVENTH GRADE

292
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,833
ACADEMIC YEAR 2013

293
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,375
MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL, ELEVENTH GRADE

294
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,833
ELEVENTH GRADE

295
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,833
BANK

296
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,041
Stay tuned. We'll be back in a moment

297
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,583
with another episode of Teen Genius.

298
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,166
The next team is almost ready.

299
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,875
It's true that Lynn and I study
at the same school.

300
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:31,958
But we're not friends.

301
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,041
Actually, we're rivals.

302
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,583
What's the matter, Bank? Are you nervous?

303
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,625
You had noodles for lunch?

304
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,666
How did you know?

305
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,500
You have some on your shirt.

306
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,375
Your shirt's creased as well.

307
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,416
Here's a baby wipe.

308
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,916
Give it a wipe.

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,791
THAI LIFE INSURANCE
5,000 BAHT

310
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,375
Hey! If we win, there's a 5,000 reward!

311
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,583
Actually, we'll get less than that.

312
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,375
It's taxed at 3%, so we lose 150.

313
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,583
So, it's only 4,850, or 2,425 each.

314
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,166
That's still a lot, though.

315
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,666
It's enough for a salmon buffet.

316
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,500
If we really win,

317
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,416
will you go out for dinner
with me tonight?

318
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,166
No.

319
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,708
I don't like eating out.

320
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,250
It's a waste of money.

321
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,666
What's so funny?

322
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,041
Nothing.

323
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,958
It's just that you sound like my dad.

324
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,000
Is that good or bad?

325
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,583
If it's like Dad, I guess it's good.

326
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,708
Messy hair, wrinkled shirt,
you're exactly like him.

327
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,958
What is it? I'm just fixing up your hair.

328
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,625
We'll be on air soon.
We have to look good.

329
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,375
You need to look smart.

330
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:17,625
Are you ready?

331
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,208
The final question.

332
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:36,166
Tell me the value of pi with
as many decimal places as possible.

333
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,833
It's 3.1415926535897932--

334
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:40,958
That should do it!

335
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:44,666
The winner of Team Genius this week is...

336
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,208
Krungthep Thaweepanya School!

337
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,750
I'm amazed.

338
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,875
How did you work out
the value of pi so quickly?

339
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,833
I didn't work it out.

340
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,958
I just memorized it.

341
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,375
Memorized the value of pi?

342
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,166
As a kid, I enjoyed playing
memory games with my dad.

343
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,208
The value of pi, names of people and dams.

344
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,666
Very smart indeed.

345
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,375
It's fitting that you're one
of our scholarship students.

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,916
Come and have a seat.

347
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,291
I didn't ask you to come here
just so I could praise you.

348
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,875
I also have some good news to tell you.

349
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:29,958
The Singapore Embassy
is offering scholarships.

350
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,875
They're full scholarships,

351
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,500
from bachelor's degrees to doctorates.

352
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:39,916
In terms of grades, behavior,
and determination,

353
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,791
you're the only two who are worthy

354
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:45,541
of being sent to take
the scholarship exam.

355
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,208
There's a little problem, though.

356
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:55,000
This scholarship is only given
to one student per school.

357
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,125
But that won't be a problem, right?

358
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,958
I mean, you were teammates yesterday.

359
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,041
But now, you are rivals. Fun, isn't it?

360
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,625
LITTLE BANK LAUNDRY SERVICE

361
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,625
The machine's not working again.

362
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,083
I can't finish the laundry in time.

363
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,916
MATHEMATICS

364
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

365
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,083
Your hands are all calloused.

366
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,375
It's understandable
that you think I cheated.

367
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,875
But thinking that Bank cheated as well...

368
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,000
Apart from my father,

369
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:24,708
I have known no one
more hardworking and honest

370
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,083
than Bank.

371
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,333
Bank!

372
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,875
What's wrong, Tong?

373
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:34,666
Did you finish studying for the exam?

374
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,333
I'm just like you. I got sick
and didn't get through it all.

375
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,916
I'm like you in every way,
like I told you.

376
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,833
Then finish studying.

377
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,291
Help me, man.

378
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,208
GRADE 11 ROOM 2

379
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,166
Let me copy.

380
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,666
I really can't fail this time.

381
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,250
I tried. But this piano code is too hard.

382
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,541
What piano code?

383
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,625
Nothing. It's nothing.

384
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,125
It's just that I won't copy for free.

385
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,375
I'll pay you for it.

386
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,625
Three thousand. Is that enough?

387
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,500
Let me copy. Your grades won't go down.

388
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,083
Wait! Listen to me. Bank.

389
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,333
Wait for me, Bank.

390
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,458
Bank!

391
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:30,708
Bank!

392
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,875
Damn it, Bank!

393
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,000
Can't you help a brother out?

394
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,208
Man, you're cruel!

395
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,625
Come on! Hurry!

396
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,083
Today, you're all taking
the exam together.

397
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,041
Don't sit next to your classmates.

398
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,875
Okay. You can all begin.

399
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,250
CLASS 1

400
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,166
CLASS 4

401
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,166
CLASS 3

402
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,083
CLASS 6

403
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,666
11. B

404
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,375
39. D

405
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,166
40. THIS EXAM PAPER IS SET 1.

406
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:05,333
Sir!

407
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:08,083
How should we answer question 40?

408
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,333
There are two sets of questions.

409
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:13,208
Which set did you receive?
Just answer according to the set you have.

410
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,583
Two sets?

411
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,375
A. SET 1

412
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,500
B. SET 2

413
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,791
40. A

414
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,416
WATCH OUT, TONG IS COPYING YOU

415
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,208
Lynn. Which set do you have?

416
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:46,958
What is the set number?

417
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,083
Set One.

418
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,333
Leave Set One here.

419
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,666
What is it?

420
00:33:58,708 --> 00:33:59,666
Row three.

421
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,166
Banjong.

422
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,750
Crew cut, wears glasses.

423
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,166
He's copying Rinrada
who's sitting next to him.

424
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,125
I'll go and see for myself. No problem.

425
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,708
You can go.

426
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,041
What is it? Tell me.

427
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,833
You have 30 minutes left.

428
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:01,458
A. SET 1

429
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,041
B

430
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:47,458
B

431
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,833
D

432
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,625
40. A

433
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,083
Tong!

434
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,250
What?

435
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,583
Switch the exam papers.

436
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:10,916
Quickly!

437
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,708
BANJONG WONGPOOM

438
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,041
Twenty minutes left.

439
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,541
1. B

440
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,166
Lynn!

441
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,291
What is it?

442
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,750
Should I erase your name
and write mine instead?

443
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,166
No need. Just sit still.

444
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,125
6. A

445
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,750
Ten minutes to go.

446
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,500
35. A

447
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,125
Last five minutes.

448
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,041
40. B

449
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,583
B. SET 2

450
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,125
Time's up!

451
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,208
You can stop writing now.

452
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,291
Hey!

453
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,083
You can put your pencils down now!

454
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,208
That's enough!

455
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,208
Don't you have enough As?

456
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,250
That's it!

457
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,708
GOSH! THE TEACHER'S PLAYING HARDBALL!

458
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,916
WE NARROWLY MADE IT. THANKS, LYNN.

459
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,458
Is it worth it? That was a close call.

460
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,833
Well, it's 3,000 each for 25 people.

461
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,750
What do you think?

462
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:32,666
Rinrada!

463
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,375
You didn't write your name
on the scrap paper.

464
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,041
Miss Rinrada, Class 11/3,

465
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,791
and Mr. Banjong, Class 11/1,

466
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,416
please come to the headmistress's office
immediately.

467
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:53,833
I can assure you.

468
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:56,166
If you don't believe me,
have Tong retake the exam.

469
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,791
Then, you'll know the truth.

470
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,208
I have asked the two of you to come here

471
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,750
because Thanaphon says
there has been cheating.

472
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,375
There are two sets of papers.
It's not worth cheating.

473
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,833
I'll give you the chance
to tell me the truth.

474
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,250
Banjong, did you cheat or not?

475
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,875
We'll soon find out.

476
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,708
Thanaphon, Rinrada, you are both excused.

477
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,875
Banjong, you stay here.

478
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,333
Lynn, don't leave just yet.

479
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,500
What are these numbers doing
on your worksheet?

480
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,625
They're not the ones from your exam set.

481
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,541
Please don't get caught.
Please don't get caught.

482
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,375
Please don't get caught.

483
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:40,916
Everything will be fine.

484
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,750
It's probably about the scholarship.

485
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:00,000
It's like this. We have evidence that
Lynn did the exam paper for her friends.

486
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:04,916
Lynn.

487
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,916
Tell us why you did this.

488
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,250
If you don't tell me, I'll expel you.

489
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,458
For the money.

490
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,416
It's, well...

491
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,291
Tong tried to hire me
to take the exam for him.

492
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,500
For 3,000 baht.

493
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,833
I'm extremely disappointed in you.

494
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,166
Vit.

495
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:37,791
I accepted your daughter
because she was a good student.

496
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,750
But being a good student isn't enough.

497
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,583
She also needs to exhibit good behavior.

498
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:47,041
You're a teacher, too.
You must understand.

499
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,458
Doing the exam for your friend
is considered cheating.

500
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,291
It's a serious violation of school rules.

501
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,625
Actually, I could expel you immediately.

502
00:42:57,625 --> 00:42:59,166
But since this is the first time,

503
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,333
I'm just cutting off
your free scholarship.

504
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,500
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,750
Can't Tong and Lynn just retake the exam?

506
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:24,791
Remember, Lynn.

507
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,875
School is a place for studying,

508
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,208
not a place for making money.

509
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,125
What's so funny?

510
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,541
-You have no manners.
-No.

511
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:36,708
That's not it.

512
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:37,750
Mr. Pravit.

513
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:40,333
You're a teacher.
Didn't you teach her manners?

514
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,458
I'm sorry.

515
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,750
I couldn't have been the only one
using the school as a place to make money.

516
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,000
What do you mean by that?

517
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:59,125
I'm talking about the tea money
that my dad paid.

518
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:03,791
It's not called tea money.

519
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,875
It's called school maintenance fee.

520
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:08,958
The school maintenance fee.

521
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:10,791
Isn't it the tuition fee?

522
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,166
Enough, Lynn. Enough.

523
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,291
Please let my daughter continue here.

524
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,875
I will take care
of the remaining tuition fee.

525
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:25,833
Let's go.

526
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:27,833
Fine.

527
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,500
But there's one condition.

528
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:35,750
You're banned
from the Singapore scholarship.

529
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:49,625
Let's go.

530
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,416
What's the scholarship got to do with it?

531
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,708
It's true that I helped my friends
copy my answers,

532
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,458
but I never copied anyone else's.

533
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,125
All of the results that I have achieved

534
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:00,416
have been the product of my own ability.

535
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,125
Other students have such ability as well.

536
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:06,375
People like Thanaphon
deserve the scholarship more.

537
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,416
If you can't accept this condition,

538
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,125
it's better that you leave.

539
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:14,708
All right, Vit?

540
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,833
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,291
Let's go.

542
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:26,750
Good luck with the scholarship.

543
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,750
If evidence has been found...

544
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:47,625
then I guess Lynn may have cheated.

545
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,500
CONGRATULATIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
ACADEMIC YEAR 2013

546
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,833
But I'm not involved.

547
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,833
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP, ELEVENTH GRADE

548
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,208
Both of us being honor students
doesn't mean...

549
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,625
MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL

550
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:00,208
we have the same personality.

551
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,208
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP

552
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,000
Just what I thought.

553
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:10,625
You definitely wouldn't have done that
for merely 3,000 baht.

554
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,041
Piano lessons.

555
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,666
Didn't you ever think
that it might have been better

556
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,083
to actually teach your friends?

557
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,791
But the headmistress
cheated us first, Dad.

558
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,791
How can you call it cheating
when I paid willingly?

559
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,833
So did my friends.

560
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,875
You still don't see
that you did something wrong?

561
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,458
I'll take the blame.

562
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:57,250
It's my fault

563
00:46:58,791 --> 00:46:59,958
I can't blame anyone else.

564
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,583
If I can't even raise you
to be a good person,

565
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:09,541
how dare I ask other people
to pay for your tuition?

566
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,666
I'll sell my car to pay what's left
of the tuition fee.

567
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,625
As for this shirt...

568
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:29,916
I don't want it anymore.

569
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,208
And let's forget about going abroad.

570
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,000
You're not going anywhere anymore.

571
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:39,625
Stay here with your dad.

572
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,625
Return all of the money to your friends.

573
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,208
No matter how much you all think
that Lynn is a bad person...

574
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:13,416
she's a really good friend of mine.

575
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm sorry for being a crybaby...

576
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,041
but I'm not just putting on an act.

577
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:36,125
TWELFTH GRADE

578
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,333
So, do I look great or not?

579
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,625
Not bad.

580
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,166
Casting is tomorrow.

581
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
This isn't all you asked me
to come for, right?

582
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,541
How have you all been?

583
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,833
Can you all take care of yourselves
for the two terms we have left?

584
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:10,166
Pat and I have other things
to worry about.

585
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,583
Has Pat told you?

586
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,708
We just got back from France.

587
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,416
The trip was a lot of fun.

588
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,541
Yes, because you left me behind.

589
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,333
-Well, it was a shopping spree.
-Mom.

590
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,750
I got you something, too--

591
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,916
-Pat.
-Yes?

592
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,083
Grab me some red wine from the cellar.

593
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,750
Why don't you get the maid to get it?

594
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,500
Yes, sir.

595
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,625
Grace, would you like some more dessert?

596
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:54,625
I'm fine, thanks.

597
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:58,541
We invited you here today

598
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,833
because we wanted to thank you.

599
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,916
Thank me for what?

600
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,875
For helping Pat with his studies.

601
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,541
You have no idea

602
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,375
how much we have been stressing out
over his grades.

603
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,541
But as soon as you two started dating,

604
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:17,666
Pat has become a whole new person.

605
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,416
What I'm saying is that

606
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,750
you're smarter than all of those
famous tutors.

607
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:33,708
Actually, we have been planning
for some time

608
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,208
to send Pat to the same college
I went to in Boston.

609
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Judging by his earlier grades,

610
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:44,666
I know that he definitely won't make it.

611
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,416
So, this is what I'm thinking.

612
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,416
You should go with him,

613
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,375
so you can help him
with his studies there.

614
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,041
Sounds good?

615
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,333
There's no need to worry about expenses.

616
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,291
Accommodation, food...

617
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,583
We'll take care of it.

618
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,000
As for the tuition fees...

619
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,208
If you are short...

620
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,958
you can always feel free to ask me.

621
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,541
I already have all
of the information ready.

622
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,458
Please have a look at it.

623
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,625
If money isn't an issue, say yes, okay?

624
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,916
You know about the STIC exam, right?

625
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,208
It's like the GAT/PAT
for entry to US universities.

626
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,166
It's held at the same time
around the world.

627
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,958
I need to take the STIC

628
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,041
and I need to take it within this year.

629
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:02,791
If I don't,

630
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:06,416
I won't be able to apply
to the universities in time.

631
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,208
HOW TO BLITZ THE STIC

632
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,416
I have already risked
a lot for you, Grace.

633
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,166
It's really hard for me
to ask you for help.

634
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,541
But Pat and I really don't know
what else to do.

635
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,916
Pat says he's going to hire you
for 600,000 baht.

636
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:15,000
HOW TO BLITZ THE STIC

637
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,791
Excuse me. Could you return this to Pat?

638
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay.

639
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,750
Could I borrow a pen and some paper?

640
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,958
I REALLY CAN'T HELP YOU THIS TIME, SORRY!

641
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,250
Miss.

642
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,750
Would you like to reserve a room?

643
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:09,791
As for time zones,

644
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:13,041
the STIC is held at the same time
and date worldwide.

645
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,541
This means that these countries over here

646
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,541
will take the exam earlier
than other places.

647
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:21,250
To put it simply,

648
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,250
if both of you take the exam in Thailand,

649
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:26,083
while I take it somewhere
where it's held earlier,

650
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,041
such as in Sydney, Australia,

651
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,166
that means four hours earlier
than Thailand,

652
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,250
we get to see the exam questions sooner

653
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,125
and answer them sooner as well.

654
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:37,333
I can send the answers back to you

655
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:39,500
and to other people in Thailand, too.

656
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,458
As many as we want.

657
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,208
Using this method,

658
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,625
not only will I be helping you

659
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,333
get a passing score
to get into a university,

660
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:53,291
I'll be getting revenue
from other customers as well.

661
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,541
After deducting expenses,
we can split the profits.

662
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,000
Isn't it too risky?

663
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,250
Risky? Not at all.

664
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:05,541
Who is this?

665
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,208
It's Teacher Lynn, babe.

666
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:09,208
This is the only way

667
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,083
for me to have enough money
to go and study with you

668
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,708
without having to ask anyone for help.

669
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,458
Oh, I forgot to mention.

670
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,916
I'm going to Boston
with both of you as well.

671
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,666
It will be so much fun to go together!

672
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:34,708
You two will be responsible
for finding customers for me.

673
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,500
As for the exam itself,

674
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:37,750
I'll take care of it.

675
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,833
Wait a minute.

676
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,875
Before we get to the part about customers,

677
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,291
I get the time zone thing,

678
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,458
but I'm still confused.

679
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,750
How are you going to get the answers
out of the exam room?

680
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:50,625
Secretly write them down?

681
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:52,750
Memorize them.

682
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,541
Memorizing them is the best way.

683
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,250
It's the safest.

684
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,750
And it leaves no trace.

685
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:02,666
I'm sorry.

686
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,416
Are you one of the X-Men?

687
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,875
The STIC has more than 100 questions.

688
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,875
Can you remember all of them?

689
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,916
Yes, I can.

690
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,083
If I have enough time.

691
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:15,750
However, after I'm done
with the questions,

692
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,291
there's not much time left.

693
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,500
The best I can do is remember half
of the questions.

694
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:21,708
Only half?

695
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,083
There's one person who could help.

696
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,291
But he won't.

697
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,250
What's up, Mom?

698
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:39,958
Yes, I'm done.

699
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,541
Mr. Rut's house?

700
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,041
Can't it wait until another day? Tomorrow?

701
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,125
I have my scholarship exam at 8:00 a.m.

702
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,833
Okay.

703
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:04,750
Hey, you!

704
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,375
Your basket grazed my mirror!

705
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,916
If you had said sorry--

706
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:25,791
That hurts...

707
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,916
It's 250,000 for a passing score.

708
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,000
It's not that much money for you, is it?

709
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,125
The tutoring fee for the STIC
is way more expensive.

710
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,625
Let's think about it.

711
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,875
We need to try and find 30 customers.

712
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,583
More than this and it will be risky.

713
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,750
Any less and it won't be worth it either.

714
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,875
I have almost 30 people
in my STIC group chat already.

715
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,958
If you can ask your friends there to join,

716
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,958
I'll knock 5,000 off the original fee
that you're supposed to pay me.

717
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,916
But wait.

718
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:34,750
You must make sure
no one knows about this.

719
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,666
Especially that loser, Bank.

720
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,250
Hey, no need to worry about that dumbass.

721
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,458
He won't tell anyone.

722
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:43,375
Why not?

723
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:44,708
Didn't you hear?

724
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,750
The dumbass got beaten up.

725
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,541
He's in the hospital.

726
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:02,625
The best part is

727
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,833
he didn't make it to the scholarship exam.

728
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:18,541
SEMINAR: EXCELLING IN EDUCATION

729
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,583
I believe that everyone here

730
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,125
wants to pass the STIC

731
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,708
to turn their dreams into reality.

732
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,708
That's Steve Pat.

733
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,583
I have a way for everyone
to obtain satisfactory scores.

734
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,416
All you can take into the exam room

735
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,333
is a 2B pencil, an eraser.

736
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:43,541
Your exam ID...

737
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,625
And your passport.

738
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,916
Communication devices
are strictly prohibited.

739
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:53,250
So, I'll hide the phone with the answers

740
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:57,083
to be sent back to Thailand
in a cistern in the exam room toilets.

741
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:00,958
I'll send the answers back
during the breaks.

742
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:03,833
The exam is divided into three sessions,

743
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,166
with two breaks.

744
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,291
Wait. Just a second.

745
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,041
How do the customers get
the answers into the exam room?

746
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,875
Not everyone can memorize
all the answers like you.

747
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,333
Barcode.

748
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,250
Everyone will receive a 2B pencil

749
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,750
with a barcode on it.

750
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,583
The different widths of the lines
in each barcode

751
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,125
will represent a different answer.

752
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,500
From left to right.

753
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,708
Starting with the thickest line,
which stands for A,

754
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:39,208
then B, C, and D.

755
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,666
Sounds cool, right?

756
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,208
But the fun doesn't stop there.

757
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:44,833
There are four pencils.

758
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:48,166
One pencil for one section.

759
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,083
And these numbers next to the barcode
are for the grid-in questions.

760
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,291
GRID-IN ANSWERS

761
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:59,166
For the essay, they use
already-published material.

762
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,125
I'll send keywords,
so you can Google them.

763
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,708
-That's mine.
-I'm not giving it to you.

764
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,958
-It fell.
-Hey!

765
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,541
I'm telling you how to do this,

766
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,458
but you'll have to write
the answers yourselves.

767
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,291
To summarize, on the exam day,

768
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:16,125
everyone has to leave
the meeting point by 7:30 a.m.

769
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,750
in order to reach the exam rooms in time.

770
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:24,083
We'll provide a motorbike to take
each person to their exam venue.

771
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,958
Finally, everyone has to pay in cash

772
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,875
within the next two weeks.

773
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,333
Otherwise, the deal is off.

774
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,208
One other thing
I need to emphasize is that...

775
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:43,083
what we are about to do together
must be kept secret.

776
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,208
Does anyone have any issues?

777
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:49,833
If not,

778
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:52,416
we'll end the seminar now.

779
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,583
We will unite

780
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,208
in our educational quest

781
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,833
to obtain scores that will allow us
entry to any college.

782
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,750
We need to be able to choose our school,

783
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,625
not let it decide whether or not
we can study there.

784
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:25,708
Hey, that's rough, Bank.

785
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,416
What's up?

786
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,375
I was sorry to hear about it.

787
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,750
That you weren't able to take
the scholarship exam.

788
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:53,958
Same here.

789
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,416
What happened that day...

790
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,750
I didn't mean it. Really.

791
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,041
I wouldn't know
whether you meant it or not.

792
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,625
What I do know is that you're responsible
for what happened to me as well.

793
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,333
I have a proposition for you.

794
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,208
What is it?

795
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,833
It involves taking an exam.

796
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,958
Taking an exam or cheating in an exam?

797
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:30,375
For me, using the word "cheating"

798
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,416
means someone loses something.

799
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,458
But here, we'll make money
and others pass exams.

800
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,875
Everyone wins.

801
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,083
Bank.

802
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,791
We are both losers, actually.

803
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:53,125
We weren't born winners
like Pat and Grace.

804
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:57,583
We have to try harder than other people
to get what we deserve.

805
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:00,583
Look at what happened.

806
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:01,625
We're not the same.

807
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:03,750
You cheated.

808
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:06,166
But I was just unlucky.

809
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:10,791
True.

810
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,333
But don't you see
that even if you don't cheat,

811
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:17,041
life cheats you anyway.

812
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:25,291
This is Grace's home address.

813
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,750
See you tomorrow if you're interested.

814
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,416
HONEST TRADE PRINTERS

815
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,166
HONEST TRADE PRINTERS

816
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,833
WORK EFFECTIVELY

817
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:17,291
Sit down here.

818
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,125
Hey.

819
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:21,791
You're not going to sit?

820
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:34,833
This is what's going to happen.

821
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:40,625
First, you and I fly to Sydney, Australia
and take the STIC together.

822
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,041
Hey, Lynn.

823
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,250
You're missing one document.

824
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:59,375
Dad, that Teen Genius show that I was in,

825
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,166
they want me to appear
in it again, in Sydney.

826
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,125
BY THAI LIFE INSURANCE

827
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,000
They need your bank statement for my visa.

828
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,500
Who are you going with?

829
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:16,958
I'm going with Bank.

830
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,166
It's not just us.
Our teacher is going too.

831
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,083
Secondly,

832
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:30,625
you and I will each have to memorize
half of the exam questions.

833
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:31,833
Don't forget.

834
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:34,333
Bank memorizes the first half,
and Lynn the second half.

835
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,708
Section 1 has 52 questions.

836
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:38,041
Start.

837
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,708
52 QUESTIONS

838
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:44,708
44 QUESTIONS

839
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,916
16 GRID-IN QUESTIONS

840
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,083
For the final section,

841
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:50,333
you need to leave the exam room
before the end

842
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,708
to send the essay question in time.

843
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,333
Time's up for Section Four.
Start the essay question.

844
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,458
It shouldn't be hard for you
to remember the title.

845
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:04,541
The hard part is that
they won't let you leave early.

846
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,958
To avoid any suspicion,

847
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:10,083
you will have to act sick.

848
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:12,500
Sure.

849
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:14,541
I can throw up.

850
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,583
So, do I have to puke now?

851
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:26,625
-No.
-No! You don't.

852
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,583
Go now.

853
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,083
So, how much is my cut?

854
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,250
One million.

855
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,125
How much is yours?

856
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:00,666
Two million.

857
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,291
What do you say, Bank?

858
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,458
Everything is in your hands.

859
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:12,916
TOILET

860
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:22,833
Got it!

861
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:23,916
In time.

862
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:28,833
You should have just said yes
from the start.

863
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:49,041
Hey, guys!

864
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:53,750
See you tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.

865
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,833
Have you lost it?

866
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,583
Doesn't the plane leave at 11:00 p.m.?

867
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,916
What's the rush?

868
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,916
There's one more thing
we need to rehearse.

869
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:10,750
That's enough.

870
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:15,375
You can't keep on grilling someone
who's innocent!

871
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,833
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

872
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,000
Watching an innocent man's tears

873
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:24,166
stream down like this.

874
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,041
That's way too much, Pat. Way too much.

875
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:39,250
I have used up all my cards.

876
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:41,166
You guys are acting
like we have really been caught.

877
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,500
I get it already.

878
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,875
If you get caught,
we'll let you be the fall guy.

879
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:49,875
Last question
before heading to the airport.

880
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:50,833
The last question.

881
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:57,000
Ready?

882
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,625
What if Bank gets caught?

883
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,625
What will you say?

884
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,125
That has even less to do with me.

885
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:10,833
I have never even been his friend.

886
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I have seen him at school
for the last four or five years.

887
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,875
I haven't noticed him
having even one friend.

888
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,125
He looks like a douchebag too.

889
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:18,416
And he's a weirdo.

890
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:21,125
He even got beaten up outside the school

891
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,041
and ended up on a scrap heap.

892
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:31,625
So, are we done?

893
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,166
Stop!

894
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,750
Calm down, Bank!

895
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:38,166
Bank, stop!

896
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,375
I told you to stop!

897
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:43,791
Dumbass!

898
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,750
-Stop it!
-You motherfucker!

899
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,500
What the hell are you doing?

900
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,750
You were the one who told me to say this.

901
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,875
So, why are you mad at me?

902
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,041
Pat! Stop!

903
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,416
Bank. Bank, stop!

904
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,000
What is it? What?

905
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,625
-I...
-You... What, then?

906
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,916
I never told anyone

907
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,083
that I once woke up on a scrap heap!

908
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:27,916
Now, do you know what I'm angry about?

909
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,583
All of you set this up, didn't you?

910
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:36,333
Set it up so I couldn't take
the scholarship exam!

911
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:39,583
All of you were in on it, right?

912
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:42,041
You guys knew, right?

913
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,208
Right?

914
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,333
You knew, right?

915
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:50,208
Why aren't you dumbasses answering me?

916
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,375
Bank! Cool it, man!

917
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,083
I don't want to hear
any more from you again!

918
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,583
Bank, give it a break.
Let's talk about this.

919
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,500
Let's talk about it, Bank!

920
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:07,583
You're okay now, right?

921
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10,125
I'm sorry, Bank.

922
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,208
Bank.

923
01:13:11,541 --> 01:13:14,041
I'm really sorry, Bank. I'm really sorry.

924
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:15,875
I didn't know
they were going to go that far.

925
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,291
Bank, just listen to me first.

926
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,916
You're still going to take
the STIC, aren't you? Bank.

927
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,875
-I'm begging you.
-That damn STIC!

928
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,000
Bank, listen to me first, Bank.

929
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,583
I'm listening to you!

930
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,375
It's just me and my mom at my place.

931
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:31,875
She's like a hunchback, doing the laundry.

932
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,458
I'm not rich like you!

933
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,250
It was my dream to get a scholarship,

934
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:39,541
to help my mother have a comfortable life.

935
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,000
Damn you!

936
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:42,541
Bank.

937
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,375
If you don't take the STIC,
my dad will kill me.

938
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:47,458
Please, Bank.

939
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,958
We both win, don't you see?

940
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:58,083
Bank, I'm begging you.

941
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,166
In that case...

942
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,666
send those thugs to beat up your dad!

943
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

944
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,166
Wasn't it you who told me
that you needed him?

945
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,250
So, if I don't play dirty,

946
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,333
do you think he'll agree to help you?

947
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,208
Lynn!

948
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,958
Let's talk first.

949
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,125
You were in on this too, weren't you?

950
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:06,583
I didn't have a clue.

951
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:10,500
Please try to understand Pat.

952
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:13,708
He did it because he wanted
to help you with your plan.

953
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,458
Without any consideration
about who might get hurt?

954
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:29,708
THE FUTURE OF LAUNDRY

955
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,833
Grace, return everyone's money.

956
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:33,958
I'm pulling out.

957
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:35,708
Wait, Lynn.

958
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,500
Calm down.

959
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:41,083
If that's how it is,
I respect your decision.

960
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:42,291
You don't have to do it.

961
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,541
No more clients, okay?

962
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,125
Just the three of us. The original plan.

963
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,958
Don't you understand?

964
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,583
When I said no, I meant no.

965
01:15:58,041 --> 01:15:59,000
Okay.

966
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:01,583
It's up to you, then.

967
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:07,291
I only have one request.

968
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,958
Don't be mad at me.

969
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:17,333
If I had half of your brain,
I wouldn't do anything this stupid.

970
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:18,500
Please?

971
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:44,000
The plane is leaving in three hours.

972
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,125
Let's go, Lynn.

973
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,041
Bank.

974
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,166
I'll go through with it.

975
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,750
At least there's money in it.

976
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,166
I won't get beaten up for nothing.

977
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,375
What if I told you that...

978
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:17,291
I didn't want to do it anymore?

979
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,333
I'm not begging you.

980
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,833
I'm here, thanks to you.

981
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,791
I slept on a scrap heap,
thanks to you as well.

982
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:31,458
All of this shit is happening
because of you.

983
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,958
Don't you think you're responsible
for this, too?

984

SYDNEY

985
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,750
Here. Your phone.

986
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:39,666
Lynn.

987
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,166
I'm sorry.

988
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,291
Sorry for what?

989
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,083
Well...

990
01:18:51,208 --> 01:18:52,125
your nose.

991
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,333
You know...

992
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,083
I have never been abroad before.

993
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:34,416
Starting tomorrow,

994
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:37,375
the world is our oyster.

995
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,041
Let's take a selfie together.

996
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,750

10-MINUTE BREAK

999
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:49,041
The first break is from 5:15 a.m.
until 5:25 a.m.

1000
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:55,666
WE'RE READY

1001
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:23,208
All right.

1002
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:36,708
BANK?

1003
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,833
BANK?

1004
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,583
I WANT ANOTHER MILLION

1005
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,875
One more million? You ass!

1006
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:51,083
-Ass!
-Hey, Pat!

1007
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,791
WHAT'S WRONG?

1008
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,625
Damn!

1009
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:12,041
TRANSFER THE MONEY WITHIN FIVE MINUTES

1010
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:14,500
OR FORGET ABOUT THE ANSWERS

1011
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:21,416
Damn it! Asshole! Five minutes?

1012
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,375
Ask him. What the hell is wrong with him?

1013
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:28,083
-Pat! Pat, calm down.
-How can I calm down at this time? Fuck!

1014
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:32,125
-Hey!
-Bank! You bastard!

1015
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:36,416
THIS IS GRACE.

1016
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,625
I THOUGHT WE ALREADY AGREED
ABOUT THE MONEY.

1017
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:47,541
THE FIRST MILLION IS FOR THE JOB.
THE SECOND IS FOR THE SCRAP HEAP.

1018
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,958
MONEY TRANSFER: OCTOBER 8, 2016

1019
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,416
THIS IS ALL I HAVE IN MY ACCOUNT.

1020
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,041
I'LL SEND MORE WHEN I GET THE ANSWERS.

1021
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,583
-Come on.
-There it is. Let's go!

1022
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:23,666
Okay.

1023
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:54,208
Back in the game.

1027
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,125
Don't we have to leave here
before 7:30 a.m.?

1028
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,125
Yes.

1029
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:22,791
-It's almost 7:00 now.
-How long do we have to wait?

1030
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:24,125
I'm supposed to get more than this.

1031
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:25,458
I have already paid you.

1032
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,916
Hey, it's past 7:00 a.m. already.
Why aren't they sending the other answers?

1033
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,916
I don't know!

1034
01:39:21,458 --> 01:39:22,500
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1035
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,875
Is Lynn here? I can't contact her.

1036
01:39:39,458 --> 01:39:40,500
I haven't seen her.

1037
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:45,416
Lynn told me that she was
going to Sydney for a competition.

1038
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,541
No wonder I haven't seen her.

1039
01:39:49,666 --> 01:39:51,875
I'm sure she'll bring back a medal.

1040
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:55,958
But I found this permission letter
that I had signed at the house.

1041
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:57,833
When I called the show, no one answered.

1042
01:40:17,791 --> 01:40:19,583
So, I came to this address.

1043
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:39,500
Can someone tell me why Lynn is in Sydney?

1044
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:50,333
If the two of you don't answer,
I'll go and tell the headmistress.

1045
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:28,333
Tell me now what you're up to!

1046
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:39,541
NEXT

1047
01:42:41,083 --> 01:42:42,250
Lynn and Bank are dating!

1048
01:42:43,541 --> 01:42:45,041
They went on a secret trip together.

1049
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:57,458
Lynn thought you wouldn't let her go,

1050
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:58,833
so she lied.

1051
01:42:59,166 --> 01:43:01,000
I didn't know how to stop her.

1052
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,000
I think it would be best

1053
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:07,375
if you go back and talk
with your daughter in person.

1054
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:30,333
Come on!

1055
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:38,416
Sir.

1056
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:40,833
Love is a beautiful thing.

1057
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:54,541
Shit!

1058
01:44:05,333 --> 01:44:06,583
What's up?

1059
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:09,625
It's 7:00 a.m. already.
The motorbikes are leaving.

1060
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:11,416
They're saying it's past the time
they agreed on.

1061
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,083
Explain to me first what's wrong.

1062
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:14,541
I don't know anything!

1063
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,083
I'll speak to them myself.

1064
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:18,916
What's wrong with your leg?

1065
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:20,833
It's 7:30 a.m. already.

1066
01:44:20,916 --> 01:44:22,750
-What's up?
-Where are the barcodes?

1067
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:24,458
-I already paid you.
-You said it will be okay.

1068
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:25,875
-You'll get it soon.
-We'll be late!

1069
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:37,291
Hey, you'll make it. I promise.

1070
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,250
Pat! We ran out of stickers!

1071
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:17,208
Here you go, 500 baht each.
Just a minute. Chill. Thanks.

1072
01:45:37,333 --> 01:45:38,500
Shit!

1073
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:42,041
Hey! Please open the door!

1074
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:43,375
Can you open the door, please?

1075
01:46:16,166 --> 01:46:17,625
Come on!

1076
01:46:29,125 --> 01:46:31,333
Grace, it's almost 7:30 a.m.
Do we have all the answers?

1077
01:46:31,458 --> 01:46:32,916
Not yet. There are still six to go.

1078
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,291
Why does it say "Edge"?

1079
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:39,791
It says "Edge."

1080
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:41,041
What's Edge?

1081
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:42,625
There's no signal.

1082
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:57,000
What happens if we don't make it?
And the money that we paid?

1083
01:46:57,416 --> 01:47:00,250
If we don't make it,
we want our money back!

1084
01:47:04,583 --> 01:47:06,666
-Come on!
-Have we got them yet?

1085
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:09,000
These three bikes,
go to the Bang Kapi venue.

1086
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,958
These two rows, head to Sutthisan.

1087
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:14,166
Are you on your bikes?
Put on your helmets! Quickly!

1088
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:16,416
Take one set each.

1089
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,041
One set each.

1090
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:20,666
Okay, we're all set! Helmets! Quickly!

1091
01:48:21,416 --> 01:48:22,875
Helmets, quickly! Put them on and go!

1092
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:54,416
Let's go!

1093
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:16,375
I'm from the embassy.

1094
01:49:16,708 --> 01:49:19,125
A Thai student has confessed
using his phone's dictionary.

1095
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:20,416
We're dealing with it.

1096
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,291
What will happen to him?

1097
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:24,958
They'll probably cancel his result.

1098
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,833
Worst case, they'll ban him
permanently from the STIC.

1099
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:29,208
As for the others,

1100
01:49:29,666 --> 01:49:31,916
they'll let them go
if they don't find anything.

1101
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:35,208
Wait here first. I'll take care of things.

1102
01:50:18,291 --> 01:50:20,041
They have been investigating
for two or three days.

1103
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:20,958
Just a moment.

1104
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,791
What's the matter?

1105
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:54,333
I need to use the bathroom, sorry.

1106
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:55,583
Of course.

1107
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:27,958
Lynn!

1108
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:29,958
It's Lynn FC!

1109
01:51:30,041 --> 01:51:30,958
TEACHER LYNN FC

1110
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:33,833
Thank you, Lynn!

1111
01:51:37,291 --> 01:51:39,541
We're throwing a party for you
at our place tonight.

1112
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:40,666
What are we celebrating?

1113
01:51:41,583 --> 01:51:42,708
Bank got caught.

1114
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:46,125
And I had my result canceled, Pat.

1115
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:53,750
Well, we'll find another
exam venue for you, won't we?

1116
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,250
If you don't retake the exam,

1117
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:58,583
you won't be able to apply
to a university in time.

1118
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:02,041
Hey, Lynn!

1119
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:04,375
Lynn, you have to apply
to retake the exam.

1120
01:52:04,875 --> 01:52:06,750
Please, Lynn. Pretty please?

1121
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:10,791
I have changed my mind already.

1122
01:52:12,041 --> 01:52:13,916
Both of you already have
the results you needed.

1123
01:52:19,041 --> 01:52:22,166
But we can't go and study without you.

1124
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:28,875
Don't you both know...

1125
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,041
that university exams
aren't multiple-choice?

1126
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,708
Even if I went and studied with you,

1127
01:52:38,375 --> 01:52:39,916
you wouldn't be able to copy my answers.

1128
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,041
I'll find my own ride.

1129
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,625
ARRIVALS

1130
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:20,666
Where's your boyfriend?

1131
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,333
Where is he?

1132
01:53:30,625 --> 01:53:31,875
I wanted to invite him for dinner.

1133
01:53:38,416 --> 01:53:39,250
Where is he?

1134
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:43,916
Why didn't you tell me
about your boyfriend?

1135
01:53:51,041 --> 01:53:52,875
-Dad...
-What?

1136
01:53:56,125 --> 01:53:57,875
I have something to confess to you.

1137
01:53:58,958 --> 01:53:59,916
What is it, honey?

1138
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:04,041
Tell me.

1139
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:14,458
ARRIVALS

1140

01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:23,291
I would like to be a teacher
like my father,

1142
01:54:23,375 --> 01:54:26,000
so others can benefit the most
from my knowledge.

1143
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:31,875
So, do you have any previous experience
in tutoring others?

1144
01:54:31,958 --> 01:54:33,500
Have you ever taught anyone before?

1145
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:36,833
Yes, I have.

1146
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:54,166
I SCORED 1,460 IN THE STIC

1147
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:58,541
Being a teacher isn't just
about being smart in academics.

1148
01:54:59,708 --> 01:55:00,875
Do you think that

1149
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:04,208
you can set a good example
in other ways too?

1150
01:55:16,416 --> 01:55:17,583
GRACE: LYNN, WHEN ARE YOU COMING?

1151
01:55:17,666 --> 01:55:19,666
PAT: BANK HAS TAKEN HIS SHARE.
COME AND GET YOURS.

1152
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,125
I'm not going to lie.

1153
01:55:21,208 --> 01:55:22,208
GRACE: HURRY UP. I MISS YOU.

1154
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,666
I have done a lot of bad things
in the past.

1155
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,291
But I will learn from them
for my own benefit

1156
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:29,375
and for others.

1157
01:55:31,375 --> 01:55:33,625
LYNN LEFT THE CHAT

1158
01:55:53,291 --> 01:55:55,250
But it's such a waste.

1159
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:58,833
To be honest, with this much
knowledge and ability,

1160
01:55:59,875 --> 01:56:02,791
you could have gotten a scholarship
and gone abroad to study.

1161
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,750
Haven't you considered this?

1162
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:08,666
I think that...

1163
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,583
there are others who deserve
a scholarship more than me.

1164
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:23,208
STUDENT EXPULSION LETTER:
THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL

1165
01:56:23,291 --> 01:56:26,958
CONGRATULATIONS TO SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS
MR. THANAPHON VIRIYAKUL, ELEVENTH GRADE

1166
01:56:27,041 --> 01:56:31,208
MISS RINRADA NILTHEP, ELEVENTH GRADE

1167
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,750
BANK: COME OVER TO MY PLACE TONIGHT

1168
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:56,500
Come in.

1169
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:05,125
The store looks nice and fresh,
Little Bank.

1170
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,208
I'm sorry. It's Mr. Bank now.

1171
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:09,041
Are you laundering money?

1172
01:58:11,125 --> 01:58:12,750
You were expelled from school

1173
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,250
because the embassy reported you, right?

1174
01:58:20,833 --> 01:58:21,958
So, what's next?

1175
01:58:24,083 --> 01:58:25,750
That's the reason I asked you over.

1176
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,708
Did you apply for the GAT/PAT exams?

1177
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:35,083
I have a proposition for you.

1178
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:39,708
GAT/PAT INTENSIVE TUTORING BY BANK
EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

1179
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:41,625
I have a foolproof plan.

1180
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,125
Much safer.

1181
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,000
We can get the answers out to more people.

1182
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:49,916
More importantly, there are more customers
for the GAT/PAT than for the STIC.

1183
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:52,166
But this plan requires...

1184
01:58:55,791 --> 01:58:57,583
Teacher Lynn's assistance.

1185
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:22,500
How much more money do you need?

1186
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,375
If your cut isn't sufficient...

1187
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,666
you can get mine from Pat.

1188
01:59:28,916 --> 01:59:29,875
Go and get it.

1189
01:59:35,916 --> 01:59:37,166
No. Wait a minute.

1190
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:41,708
It's not about whether it's enough or not.

1191
01:59:43,375 --> 01:59:46,166
It's about how much more we can make...

1192
01:59:47,458 --> 01:59:48,791
in the future.

1193
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:51,833
Lynn.

1194
01:59:53,666 --> 01:59:55,291
I have done the calculations.

1195
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,041
This time,

1196
01:59:59,208 --> 02:00:00,625
there's at least ten million in it.

1197
02:00:01,708 --> 02:00:05,125
For that much money, don't you think
that it's worth the risk again?

1198
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:08,500
You see it, right?

1199
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:10,083
That even if we get caught,

1200
02:00:10,583 --> 02:00:12,291
that wouldn't mean jail.

1201
02:00:16,791 --> 02:00:17,791
Actually, Lynn,

1202
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:22,000
are you going to study for four more years
for a five-figure salary

1203
02:00:22,791 --> 02:00:25,375
when we could have millions by then?

1204
02:00:26,666 --> 02:00:28,666
Why settle for a stupid desk job?

1205
02:00:39,875 --> 02:00:41,416
Because for me right now,

1206
02:00:42,041 --> 02:00:43,750
no amount of money is worth it.

1207
02:00:53,458 --> 02:00:54,333
Lynn.

1208
02:00:56,375 --> 02:00:57,708
If you won't do this...

1209
02:00:59,875 --> 02:01:01,833
I'll tell everyone
that you were the mastermind

1210
02:01:01,916 --> 02:01:03,125
behind the STIC scandal.

1211
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:05,750
I guarantee that you'll end up
being banned

1212
02:01:05,833 --> 02:01:07,083
from studying abroad, just like me.

1213
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:15,666
Fine.

1214
02:01:16,541 --> 02:01:17,708
We're even, then.

1215
02:01:21,041 --> 02:01:22,458
It won't just be you.

1216
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:24,791
It will also be Grace, Pat.

1217
02:01:24,958 --> 02:01:27,625
And all the customers who took the STIC
that time will be caught up as well.

1218
02:01:28,458 --> 02:01:29,416
Think about it, Lynn.

1219
02:01:29,708 --> 02:01:30,916
If they find out about it,

1220
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:32,916
they'll cancel all of the scores
in the country.

1221
02:01:46,333 --> 02:01:47,375
On top of that...

1222
02:01:49,916 --> 02:01:51,625
your father will be devastated, too.

1223
02:01:54,041 --> 02:01:55,125
Don't be afraid, honey.

1224
02:01:58,333 --> 02:01:59,958
We'll get through this somehow.

1225
02:02:01,541 --> 02:02:02,875
Smile, honey. Smile.

1226
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,125
Smile like your dad.

1227
02:02:22,708 --> 02:02:23,875
Miss Rinrada?

1228
02:02:23,958 --> 02:02:25,416
You once told me, didn't you...

1229
02:02:27,458 --> 02:02:28,916
that if we win, we would win together.

1230
02:02:29,958 --> 02:02:31,625
If we go down,
we would go right down together.

1231
02:02:33,708 --> 02:02:35,541
I won't be the only one
taking all the blame again.

1232
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:38,083
If you don't do it,

1233
02:02:38,625 --> 02:02:40,541
I'll make sure you go down with me.

1234
02:02:48,541 --> 02:02:49,458
What do you say, Lynn?

1235
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:54,208
What's it going to be?

1236
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:57,625
Everything is up to you now.

1237
02:03:05,041 --> 02:03:05,875
You're right.

1238
02:03:06,125 --> 02:03:07,500
Everything is up to me.

1239
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,500
