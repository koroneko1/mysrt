1
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,625
Come on. Hurry up.

2
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,250
Come on.

3
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,000
We all know that
we need eight to ten hours of sleep,

4
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,291
but what we really don't know is
how long a person can go without sleep.

5
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,708
Insomnia is a physical disorder

6
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,375
that is deeply rooted
in a person's mental health.

7
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,375
The mind can be highly affected
by stress and anxieties

8
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,333
which then in turn may prevent us
from falling asleep.

9
00:02:56,416 --> 00:03:00,375
But in most recorded cases,
it doesn't last for more than a few days.

10
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,833
Now that's for the majority.

11
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:07,500
There are exception with serious cases
of clinical insomnia.

12
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:15,000
Extreme insomniacs can lose sleep
that lasts for months or even years.

13
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,583
This is triggered
by something more complicated

14
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,083
than just your average stress,

15
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:23,666
trauma, strain of a heavy ordeal
or anything tragic one may suffer from.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,083
So what happens to you if you stay awake

17
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,166
for months or perhaps even years?

18
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,375
Can you imagine the side effects
it will bring?

19
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,458
Just one or two sleepless nights

20
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:45,333
are enough to throw your mental capacity
into complete disarray.

21
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,166
That's how easily it happens.

22
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,750
You may call it
a state of emotional deviation.

23
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,083
You increase that and go
more than three nights without sleep,

24
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,583
then you're looking at acute confusion.

25
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:01,833
Not just that, it also causes
an onset of derangement and delirium.

26
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,333
So now this becomes a problem.

27
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,083
Your immediate perception of reality
is distorted.

28
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,458
And if the condition persists
longer than that,

29
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:19,041
the symptoms intensify
into auditory and visual hallucinations.

30
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,375
You won't be able to separate imagination
from what's real.

31
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,833
When I was in med school like you,

32
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,000
oftentimes, I would go
on consecutive nights without sleep

33
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,833
while working on projects.

34
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,416
I remember once,
a lab rabbit started talking.

35
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,041
Spoke to me, just wouldn't stop prattling.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,916
Good rabbit kept me company.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All night long.

38
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,791
Made me happy.

39
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,125
Three nights is the longest
I've gone without sleep.

40
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,583
I remember I was in the ninth grade
back then

41
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,750
when June and I moved to live
with our grandmother.

42
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,375
Ever since moving there,

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,333
I've been obsessively concerned
with the security of the house.

44
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,083
Every night,
I compulsively check all of the locks.

45
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,250
I know I've already locked all the doors,

46
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
but I can't stop myself from rechecking.

47
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,916
It gives me peace of mind.

48
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
Lately, June has started coming home late.

49
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,125
I'm worried about her.

50
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,666
I have to call her a dozen times
before she answers.

51
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,916
Please try again later.

52
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,708
I can't sleep.

53
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,625
In the past few weeks,

54
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,916
I'd consciously stay awake,
studying past midnight until two a.m.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,375
Then at three a.m., I have to go
to the market to buy ingredients.

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,125
But I look at the bright side.

57
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,333
Twenty-four hours used.

58
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,666
I don't waste a second.

59
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,500
NOTICE OF LATE HOME LOAN PAYMENT

60
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:25,625
AMOUNT DUE 782,155 BAHT

61
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,291
June.

62
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,208
So you're finally home, huh.

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,583
I'm gonna get changed
and go back to school.

64
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,958
Well, hurry up
and come down for breakfast.

65
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,541
June, you hear me?

66
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,666
So you're thinking of
dropping out of med school?

67
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,250
I know you have financial problems
at home, Jane.

68
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,458
But that doesn't mean it's over.

69
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,375
We can always try and find a way.

70
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,958
There's a lab assistant job
that's available.

71
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,375
Would you like to give it a shot?

72
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,416
I've already asked.

73
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,416
It's a complete waste of time.
Not even worth what they're going to pay.

74
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,791
Well, it would be a waste, too,
if you suddenly abandon everything.

75
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,000
Hmm.

76
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,333
What about June?

77
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,458
Maybe she could help out after school.

78
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,250
Think about it. You know what they say.
Two heads are always better than one.

79
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,875
Oh, I have an idea.

80
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,791
Jane?

81
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,250
Jane.

82
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,583
Yes?

83
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,541
Sorry. I just remembered that

84
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,458
a German pharmaceutical company
has been in touch.

85
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,000
They need volunteers
for a new drug research.

86
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,833
I hear they pay good money
for anyone willing to join.

87
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,416
I figured that

88
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,416
judging from your interview on insomnia,

89
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,708
you should easily qualify
for that research.

90
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,541
How soon do you think I can start?

91
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,041
Qratonin is a substance
that comes from a part of the brain

92
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,416
called the thalamus.

93
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,166
Qratonin can be used to treat
brain-dead patients,

94
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,541
and the substance only releases
when we're awake.

95
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,750
So we started the experiment called Deep.

96
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,583
The Deep process consists of three levels.

97
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,208
The higher the level,

98
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,583
the more concentrated Qratonin becomes.

99
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,666
And the duration of each level

100
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,375
may vary from person to person.

101
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,916
This experiment must only be conducted
by Weimar personnel.

102
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,916
Hello.

103
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,541
My name is Hans Miller.

104
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,000
And I am the Director of Research
of this facility.

105
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,750
Firstly, I would like to say
thank you so much for coming today.

106
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,875
-Uh, what is your name?
-It's Jane.

107
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,083
Jane, have you heard of Alexander Fleming?

108
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,500
Is he the one who discovered penicillin?

109
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,208
Correct.

110
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,166
When Alexander Fleming
discovered penicillin,

111
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,875
he revolutionized
the pharmaceutical business.

112
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,958
Now, Qratonin will do exactly the same.

113
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,750
One question.

114
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,541
Why does this Qratonin only release
when we're awake?

115
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,583
Now, have you heard
of the substance melatonin?

116
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:42,583
Ah, yes. Isn't that the substance
that helps with our sleep?

117
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,750
Excellent.

118
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,458
Melatonin helps us sleep.

119
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:51,875
And Qratonin will do the absolute opposite
and keep us awake.

120
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,541
Last question.

121
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,625
How much money will I get?

122
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,958
For Level 1,

123
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,166
you will get

124
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,916
100,000 baht.

125
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,166
Okay.

126
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,333
By participating in the Deep process,

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you will need a microchip implant
in your occipital area.

128
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,416
This microchip will only extract
Qratonin from the brain.

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,833
Now, as long as
you have the microchip in your neck,

130
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,416
you must wear this watch.

131
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,291
It will measure your heartbeat

132
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:56,166
and the amount of Qratonin
that we have harvested in percentage.

133
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:01,125
When it reaches 100 percent,
you must come back here immediately.

134
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,791
And then we can remove the microchip
from your neck.

135
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,083
I have to remind you,

136
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,875
that you have signed an agreement.

137
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,583
This experiment is secret,
and we don't want you talking to anybody.

138
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,625
Because we do not want our rivals
to hear what we're doing.

139
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,875
Okay.

140
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,583
All right, that's all set.

141
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,916
The Level 1 process has started.

142
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,583
Oh, there is one thing
you should know first.

143
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,541
You must not fall asleep, ever.

144
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,958
If you fall asleep
for more than 60 seconds,

145
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,333
the microchip may short-circuit,

146
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,958
and it may stop your heart.

147
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,916
Don't worry if you fall asleep.

148
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,333
This watch will warn you
before reaching 60 seconds.

149
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,541
I guarantee you, it's safe.

150
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,958
Grandma!

151
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm all right.

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,708
I just dropped my dentures.

153
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,458
Gran, next time if you need help, tell me.

154
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,041
Can you sit still?

155
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,458
You shouldn't strain yourself so much.

156
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,583
Ah. All right, enough.

157
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,000
See? You know, you're way too active
for someone your age.

158
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,041
How come you never listen to me?

159
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,208
I need to move every now and then.

160
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,333
Or else my joints
would get all tired and stiff.

161
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,583
Oh, Jane. Have you seen the notice yet?

162
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,958
We're a few months behind the mortgage.

163
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,791
Grandma, it's all right.
I'll take care of it. Okay?

164
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,750
I don't want you losing sleep over it.

165
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,916
Don't tire yourself.
You've worked so hard.

166
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just relax.

167
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,458
Huh?

168
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,416
What did you say just now?

169
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,875
Come on. I'm not falling for it.

170
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,666
And who was that?

171
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,583
June.

172
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,500
What?

173
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,333
Who just drove you here?

174
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,750
I booked online.

175
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,375
Then why were you sitting in the front?

176
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,708
If I didn't,
then regular cabs would have harrassed us.

177
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,666
And also why didn't you text me back?

178
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,375
Hey, you better answer me.

179
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,625
What the hell, Jane.

180
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,416
I ran out of data. So chill, okay?

181
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,125
-Then why won't you answer my calls?
-Well, you know I had band practice.

182
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,708
Really? You had practice all night?

183
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:28,750
I see.

184
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,166
So you think I'm sleeping around?

185
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,250
What else should I think?

186
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,875
Okay.

187
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
Then that's what I'll do.

188
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,416
Hey, give me an abortion if ever.
Since you're a doctor.

189
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,875
Hey!

190
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,583
So you're on Deep, aren't you?

191
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,041
Deep? What is it?

192
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,333
That's Win,
our top-class party animal.

193
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,875
He actually spends more time in nightclubs
than he does in the classroom.

194
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,541
I'm on it, too.

195
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,625
I don't think
you're supposed to tell anyone that.

196
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,125
It's just between us.

197
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,291
How did you get in?

198
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,958
Was it Professor Nichcha?

199
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,333
Mm-hmm.

200
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,375
I guess
I just met all of their qualifications.

201
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,666
I guess you're good at staying awake, too.

202
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,875
But you know there are others…

203
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,750
who are professional insomniacs.

204
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,416
Just like you and me.

205
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,541
Check it out.

206
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,166
That's Cin,
the famous beauty blogger

207
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,916
and the local school's celebrity.

208
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,416
And whatever she does,

209
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,875
her thousands of followers
go crazy about it.

210
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,625
Let me show you this Korean essence water.

211
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,666
It is super awesome.

212
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,875
Can't recommend it enough.

213
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,375
Chip, chip, chip, chip. Ooh.

214
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,416
Brilliant in high school.
Her family forced her to study Medicine.

215
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
But what she really wanted
was to study Communications.

216
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,041
School stresses her out so much.

217
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,500
She barely sleeps.

218
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,750
Has to rely on sleeping pills.

219
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,000
What's with you, Win?

220
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,333
Shouting my name around like a maniac.

221
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,166
Oh, so Jane is on Deep, too?

222
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,291
And you know what else?

223
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,291
Wherever you find Cin,

224
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,750
you're always gonna find this guy.

225
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,083
Hey, Peach!

226
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,416
Hey, Peach!

227
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,291
Peach, the gaming nerd.

228
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,416
When he's not studying, he's living
inside one of his online games.

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,250
Games, games, and more games.

230
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,541
Has a thousand friends
in the virtual world.

231
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,666
In the real world, however,
it's the complete opposite of that.

232
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,291
Hi there.

233
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,333
You too, Peach?

234
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,166
So when was it you signed up?

235
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,875
Yesterday.

236
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,500
That's like the same day I did.

237
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,500
Not fair. How come you're still looking
so dang radiant?

238
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,750
Look at my panda eyes.

239
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,041
I would have never done it
if it weren't for the 100 grand.

240
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,208
So everyone gets the same deal.

241
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,416
Of course. It's easy money, you know.

242
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,375
I mean,
I can keep doing it forever.

243
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,583
Well, that's no surprise.
You're a movie marathon monster after all.

244
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,166
And you, Peach?

245
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,833
How you holding up?

246
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,041
-Good.
-And you, Cin?

247
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,291
It's easy-peasy, Win.

248
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,291
That 100,000 baht is definitely
keeping my eyes wide open.

249
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,541
Keep your voice down, Cin.

250
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,125
Sorry.

251
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,208
Aren't any of you afraid of this thing?

252
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,708
We sleep,

253
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,916
and we're dead.

254
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm not.

255
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,208
We stay up,

256
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,750
and we stay alive.

257
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,416
Hell yeah. Right on.

258
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,750
Look, check it. Mine's almost full.

259
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,083
How about you? Let me see yours.

260
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And you, Cin?

261
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,208
Whoa, 77 percent. Way ahead of us.

262
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,958
Come on, Peach. You're lagging.

263
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,291
Oh. I don't have any of you on my LINE.

264
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,791
What do you say?
Let's add each other online.

265
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,333
We can watch each other's backs.

266
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,000
Mm. Oh.

267
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,291
Instagram accounts, too.
Follow and like me on that.

268
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,708
Hey, guys, what is going on?

269
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,166
It's kinda still a bit too early
to hit the sack.

270
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,333
So why don't we all play
a fun little game tonight.

271
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,291
Look.

272
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,500
I love you.

273
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,125
So help me name this show
and if your entry has the most likes,

274
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,375
you'll get this cutie doll.

275
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,250
ALL-NIGHTER LIVESTREAM WITH CUTIE CIN

276
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,583
WHY USE FINN MOBILE?

277
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,333
OUTSTANDING DEBT 658,901 BAHT

278
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,916
-Whoo!
-Whatever. Not impressed.

279
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,583
-You know what, I think I should turn pro.
-Yuck.

280
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,583
Hey, you guys.

281
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,875
I feel like I have a stalker.

282
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,625
Since I've been on Deep,
someone has been stalking me for sure.

283
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:51,458
Just the other day,
I heard a strange sound.

284
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,750
I looked around and checked,
but there was no one around.

285
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,500
It's probably a serial killer.

286
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,375
Not funny, I'm being dead serious here.
Not being crazy.

287
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,416
If the Deep lab asks you
to do another round,

288
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,250
would you still do it?

289
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,875
Whoo!

290
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,250
And why not? Easy money, right?

291
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,791
-We got through Level 1 in one piece.
-Right.

292
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,416
They'll pay even more for Level 2.

293
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,916
You do know we'd have to stay awake
for a whole lot longer.

294
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,500
But if we stay awake…

295
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,083
we stay alive, right?

296
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,041
Yeah, I'm all in.

297
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,750
With the money,
I can get a boob job in South Korea.

298
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,291
Gonna get them all nice and gigantic.

299
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,750
Big, huge boobs.

300
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,291
Oh, that's right.
Let's start a group chat.

301
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,791
And if they get in touch,
then we can just go together.

302
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,625
-All right?
-Sounds good.

303
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,708
Pick a group name.

304
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,375
The "Deep Process Group Research"
kind of sounds appropriate.

305
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,000
Sounds kinda like a term paper,
doesn't it?

306
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,208
How about this?

307
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,125
We are the Great Sleepless Gang
and mind you,

308
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,708
the gang that shocked the world

309
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,083
for being paid an enormous amount
by just staying awake.

310
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,791
-Good, right? Right?
-You're an idiot.

311
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,708
What a buzzkill. So then what?

312
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,916
Uh…

313
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,958
-How about "Non Non"?
-What? "Non Non"?

314
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,166
"Non Non"?

315
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,083
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Right.

316
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,750
-Well, the N-O-N.
-What's Non mean?

317
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,916
-Non is French for no.
-Uh-huh.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,208
The Thai word for sleep is "non".

319
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,125
Put together, it means "no sleep."
"Non Non." No sleep.

320
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,541
-Oh.
-Oh. Non Non.

321
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,291
Oh, that's wicked and cool.

322
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,500
We're going with that.
It's a cool name. Non Non.

323
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,083
-Are you sure about it?
-I'm already doing it.

324
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,541
Too late, it's done.

325
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,333
-Non Non.
-You're in?

326
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,833
-I am. Joining up. Non Non.
-Right.

327
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,875
Ladies and gents,

328
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,583
that's it. We are Non Non.

329
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,833
Get ready.
Watch us conquer the Deep levels.

330
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:12,750
Uh-huh.

331
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,416
We won't be going to bed,

332
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,750
-we'll be getting rich instead!
-Whoo!

333
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,250
-Whoo!
-Cheers, everyone.

334
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,750
-Mm. Mm.
-Ah.

335
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:25,000
Awesome. Come on, guys, it's bowling time.

336
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,791
-Mm.
-Cin, Peach, it's the two of you.

337
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,291
-You're on the same team.
-Sorry, I'm gonna have to go.

338
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,666
-What's the rush, Jane?
-Yeah.

339
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,750
-There's plenty of time left.
-Need to go home to do something.

340
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,416
I guess I'll see you.

341
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,375
See you then.

342
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,458
Goodbye.

343
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,791
Guess I'll see you later.

344
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,375
Bye-bye.

345
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,125
Cin!

346
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,750
-Huh?
-Peach needs a cab, too.

347
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,333
-Would do better if you let him tag along.
-Come on then.

348
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:09,666
Go on.

349
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,625
I'll see you, okay?

350
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,791
Bye-bye.

351
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,708
Come on.

352
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,666
Go.

353
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,583
Hurry.

354
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,000
Hey, dude, what's wrong with you?
I don't have COVID-19. I swear.

355
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,958
I think…

356
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,750
I think it's a side effect
of the Deep implant.

357
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,125
I think I might have…

358
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,333
butterflies in my stomach.

359
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,833
Which title?

360
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,625
ALL-NIGHTER LIVESTREAM WITH CUTIE CIN
CINDERELLA AFTER MIDNIGHT

361
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,958
Pick.

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Huh?

363
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,000
This title.

364
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:59,041
The All-Nighter Buddy,
A Livestream Marathon with the…

365
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,500
…one and only Cutie Cin.

366
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,791
Hmm. Okay.

367
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,916
But you know I guess that

368
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,416
whoever came up
with such a weird name like that

369
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,750
could either be a… a huge idiot

370
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,333
or a really crazy psycho lunatic.

371
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,541
Makes sense?

372
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,375
Uh…

373
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,708
I…

374
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,708
You… you really have to watch out.

375
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,708
Lots of psy… psychos running around.

376
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,833
It makes me worry a lot about you. A lot.

377
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,583
You worry about me?

378
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,000
Hey. You have a crush on me.

379
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,666
-I don't, I don't, I don't.
-What then?

380
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,916
I… what I mean is

381
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,791
we… we're friends
and so we have to watch out for each…

382
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,083
other.

383
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,875
Peach!

384
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,625
Don't forget to subscribe to my channel.

385
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,125
Bye. Bye. Blehh.

386
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,166
For you to know that I like you ♪ 

387
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,333
Here.

388
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:55,375
What is this?

389
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,375
Well, I did break your old one.

390
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,458
And what about the sim card?

391
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,416
You always ran out of data.

392
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,916
So I got you unlimited.
The best data plan.

393
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,958
Now you no longer have an excuse
for not replying to me.

394
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,666
But where did you get the money for this?

395
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,041
From a part-time job.

396
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,958
A job doing?

397
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:11,708
It seems a bit early for you.

398
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,958
Hello, Mom, what's up?

399
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,125
Cin,
you didn't answer your dad's calls.

400
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,083
Because he just kept calling me
all day long.

401
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,250
Well, he's really upset
after seeing your grades.

402
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:53,708
But, Ma, it's not like
I'm not doing the best that I can.

403
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,875
You know I never even wanted
to study Medicine.

404
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,250
Well then, you're just going to have
to try a little harder.

405
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,458
Your dad's family are all doctors.
So just do it for him.

406
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,583
-You know--
-It's not exactly genetic, is it?

407
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,083
Studying Communications
won't kill his good genes.

408
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,666
That's just great.
So no allowance for you this month then.

409
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,000
You're on your own, Cin.

410
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,291
Oh, well, that's fine then.

411
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,625
'Cause I can support myself. No problem.

412
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,708
Level 2 will take longer than Level 1.

413
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:26,416
So that we will get more
concentrated Qratonin.

414
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,500
How many days will it take?

415
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,166
Each person is different.

416
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,458
But based on your past performance,
I would guess…

417
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,250
about five days.

418
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,333
Hey. Five days. Can we do that?

419
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,500
Go ahead and tell him if you can't.

420
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:43,416
How much?

421
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,375
Five hundred thousand baht.

422
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:52,625
DEBT 165,784 BAHT

423
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,541
Win!

424
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,291
Oh, yeah.

425
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,458
Let's go.

426
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,333
Win!

427
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:29,416
Do a backdoor cut.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

428
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,375
Win.

429
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:37,708
Do it!

430
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,833
What's wrong, Win?
Are you all right, buddy?

431
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,291
Just take the kids.
Sucker got schooled.

432
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,375
No wonder his mom killed herself.

433
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,083
No wonder his mom killed herself.

434
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,750
Oh, oh.

435
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,833
-Let go.
-Oh. Hey.

436
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,458
-Come on.
-Stop it.

437
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,708
You all hear what he just said.

438
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:07,916
What the heck's going on?

439
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,833
Take it easy, man.

440
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,041
Have you gone nuts?
He didn't even say anything.

441
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,458
You all right, Win?
What's gotten into you?

442
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,583
Looks like he's gone mad.

443
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,875
Are you trying to drill a hole
into the lock?

444
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,416
June.

445
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,791
How about you clean it
the next time you use it?

446
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,333
It's gross.

447
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,541
Stop!

448
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:06,375
What? I'm trying to practice at home.
You told me that, didn't you?

449
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,166
Well, you had all day to practice that.

450
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,083
And you had all day to study.

451
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,666
Don't make me kick you out.

452
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,708
Hey.

453
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,041
What's with this mood swing,
all of a sudden?

454
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:19,000
Honestly, what you've been up to?

455
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:23,083
You're obsessively fussing
over the locks and the stove.

456
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,458
You've been checking on Gran
like a thousand times.

457
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,375
And if you couldn't tell,
it's getting worse.

458
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,833
Come on. Tell me.

459
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,708
What is it you do really?

460
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:38,916
I'm tutoring.

461
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,791
You really gonna expect me
to believe that?

462
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,916
Tutoring won't never bring in that much,

463
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,166
even if you did it 24 hours a day.

464
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,041
What I do is none of your damn business.

465
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:54,708
Like that, you're always getting grumpy
and yelling at me.

466
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:57,375
-I deserve to know what's going on.
-What the hell do you know?

467
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,333
I go to work,
so I can pay the goddamn bills.

468
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,791
Do you have any idea, any idea at all
how much sleep I've lost over this?

469
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:05,125
Quit changing the subject.

470
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,875
-I'm asking what you've been up to?
-Just leave me alone.

471
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,416
-Go check it. Make sure that it's correct.
-Okay.

472
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,375
Jane, come over here
and help me clean this up.

473
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,625
Are you okay, Jane?

474
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,458
I've had enough of this!

475
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,958
-The percentage is totally stuck up low.
-Shh.

476
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,958
And apart from us,
there are other people in on this.

477
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,416
-I've seen many other people on Deep.
-Huh?

478
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,833
How did you know that?

479
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,375
Their wristwatches.

480
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,750
But we're the only ones
who are on Level 2 now.

481
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,875
What a complete and total rip-off.

482
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,833
We look like zombies.

483
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,458
Ah, shit.

484
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,208
Last time I check,
the number kept going up.

485
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,208
Is thing broken or something?
Come on. Wake up, buddy.

486
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,541
Hey, Win, do you work out regularly?

487
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,000
Mm. Yeah, why?

488
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:04,458
We started Level 2 all at the same time,
right?

489
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,916
Our readings shouldn't have been
that much different.

490
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,708
And it should have all dropped
at the same rate.

491
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,833
But yours is clearly higher than ours.

492
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,125
I think it's got something to do
with our bodies.

493
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,000
Or more specifically,
how our body movements can affect it.

494
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,875
Keep moving and the number goes up.

495
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,666
I have an idea. I know what we can do.

496
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,333
Come on, not now.
My connection sucks.

497
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,375
So why don't you make the switch
to Finn Mobile?

498
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:35,000
Top Internet service. You can all use
my code to avail a discount.

499
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:38,750
And both you and I will be able to get
really big savings all the way.

500
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,166
I need you to go home and stay with Gran.
I'm not coming home tonight.

501
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,291
Huh? Say what?

502
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:52,541
I said you need to go home tonight
and be the one to take care of Grandma.

503
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,750
Uh, oh. Oh, all right. Yeah, I will.

504
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,583
Hey, no sleeping.

505
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:18,083
Can you believe that weirdo?
I had no idea he was rich.

506
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,500
Say cheese.

507
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,666
-Mm.
-Wake up.

508
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,791
And I never knew that
he was such a dope, too.

509
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,250
And look at you right now.

510
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,083
You're kinda crazy.

511
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,791
I've just been so stressed out lately.

512
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,166
So what do… what do you usually do?

513
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,708
Well, I study.

514
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,333
Oh, you study.

515
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:44,958
And then what?

516
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,250
And then I study.

517
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,125
Mm, So that's why
you're always top of the class.

518
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,916
But when you're not studying,
what do you do?

519
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,416
I also help out at home.

520
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:02,125
You help out with what exactly?

521
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:03,833
Well,

522
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:08,041
cooking, setting the tables,
selling the food.

523
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,541
Mm.

524
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,000
What about your parents?

525
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,291
Breaking news report.

526
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,083
-We've just received report of the murder.
-Jane?

527
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,791
The incident occurred
in a townhouse in Bangna District.

528
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,583
Authorities who went inside to investigate

529
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,708
-discovering the bodies of the husband…
-Jane?

530
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,750
Jane.

531
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:29,625
…there were no signs of forced entry.

532
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,916
Jane?

533
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,083
What about you?
What do you do when you're not drinking?

534
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,166
Mm, drink some more.

535
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:43,875
Then drink.

536
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,500
And drink.

537
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,208
And drink again.

538
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,583
And your parents don't have a problem
with that?

539
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,416
My parents?

540
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,458
Well, my mom is dead.

541
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,541
Hey. It's all right.

542
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,708
It was a long time ago.

543
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,333
I'm okay.

544
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:12,291
Hey, Jane, don't worry about us tonight.

545
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,583
You won't be falling asleep.

546
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:15,750
I've got a plan.

547
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,625
Oh, look at that. He's awake now.

548
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:29,708
You awake, you awake, you awake.

549
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,708
-Yeah.
-Great.

550
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,041
-Oh. One more?
-Yeah.

551
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:32,958
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

552
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,666
Okay. Just for now.

553
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,708
So Win comes up with a plan

554
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:40,125
to help us sail through the fourth night
without falling asleep.

555
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,250
He gets stimulant pills
and starts mixing them

556
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,416
into these sweet-looking mocktails.

557
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,041
Where did you get these?

558
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:09,000
It's courtesy of our Faculty of Pharmacy.

559
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:11,541
You know that Crenyl has known
to cause strokes, right?

560
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:14,875
Are we gonna die tonight?

561
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:26,958
Ooh.

562
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,458
Have you actually gone crazy?

563
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,250
Jane.

564
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,291
We need to make it through the night.

565
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,125
If we fall asleep,

566
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:36,208
then we're all dead.

567
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:40,250
There's nothing else that can help keep
our eyes wide open.

568
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,125
Fine. I'll just throw them away.

569
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,166
Jane.

570
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,041
What are you doing sitting here alone?

571
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,500
Don't you wanna go for a dance?

572
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,833
What? You can't dance.

573
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:53,000
Oh, it's all right, darling.

574
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,458
I'll teach you. Come on, get up.

575
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,875
Get up.

576
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:41,250
I don't really remember anything
other than that.

577
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,041
I had a really, really great time.

578
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,375
Hi, everyone, how you doing?

579
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:50,333
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

580
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:51,291
Let's go.

581
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,333
Hi, everyone.

582
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:55,333
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

583
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,750
Hi, everyone.

584
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,791
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

585
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:00,958
Hi, everyone.

586
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,083
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

587
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,208
Hi, everyone.

588
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:08,291
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

589
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,291
Hi, everyone.

590
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,458
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

591
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:13,708
Hi, everyone.

592
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,750
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

593
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,875
Hi, everyone.

594
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:21,083
Today, I'm going to give you a peek in
to what my everyday life looks like.

595
00:50:21,166 --> 00:50:24,541
Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone.
Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone.

596
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:31,416
Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone. Hi, everyone.

597
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,291
Hi, everyone.

598
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:41,375
I love you. I love you. I love you.

599
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,208
You have to watch out.

600
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,583
Lots of psychos running around.

601
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,875
Cin.

602
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,916
Cin. Cin.

603
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,416
Cin.

604
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:35,916
Cin.

605
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,000
-Cin!
-Hey, Peach.

606
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,541
what the fuck is this?

607
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:41,833
Well, answer me!

608
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,000
-I can't feel her pulse, guys.
-Oh, shit.

609
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:53,875
Cin.

610
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,541
Cin, just wake up.

611
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,333
Is Cin gonna die?

612
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,375
Will she be okay?

613
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,708
-She has to be okay.
-It's because of you!

614
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,291
Not the time, guys. Win!

615
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,375
-Win.
-Let me try.

616
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,250
Cin, please wake up.

617
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,041
Cin.

618
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,333
Please don't die.

619
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,000
Please don't die. Can you hear me, Cin?

620
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,250
-Don't die. Please.
-Peach.

621
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,791
How many seconds?

622
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,000
-Peach, how much time?
-Peach!

623
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,916
-Twenty seconds.
-Cin, please wake up.

624
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,541
Cin.

625
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,125
-Cin, please. Please.
-Cin.

626
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,916
How much time left?

627
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,083
There's only…

628
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,750
ten seconds.

629
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,041
Win, move.

630
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,458
We will not do it anymore.

631
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,458
Why?

632
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,541
Nobody's done it better than you guys.

633
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,708
Don't you see how bad it is?

634
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,375
I almost died.

635
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,208
But Deep Level 3

636
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:32,208
will bring you one million baht…

637
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,083
each.

638
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,208
Sorry.

639
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:25,333
After Cin's near-death experience,

640
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:29,791
we all decided
not to go back on Deep again.

641
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm going, Grandma.

642
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:08,625
Cin.

643
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:11,333
Cin!

644
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,583
I…

645
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,083
I did what I did…

646
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,250
because I like you.

647
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,208
Cin.

648
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,833
I'm…

649
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,125
I… I'm sorry.

650
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,208
Sorry for what?

651
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:45,083
Can you please stop following me
before I'll call security on you.

652
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:47,583
I…

653
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,291
I can explain everything.

654
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:53,458
I just…

655
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:56,708
boosted your likes

656
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,083
watched your clips again and again.

657
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,125
I did it to support you.
I only meant to help.

658
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,333
So that's why you went psycho?

659
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,333
I didn't mean…

660
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:16,125
Can we still be friends, please?

661
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,416
I don't think so.

662
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,750
Your scores
have dropped drastically, Jane.

663
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:36,625
I was under the impression
this was your favorite subject.

664
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,250
I just haven't had time to study lately.

665
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,208
Don't tell me
it's because of that research job

666
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,166
which I recommended to you earlier.

667
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,250
Yeah.

668
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:53,250
Come on, Jane,
if that's what's preventing you

669
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,833
from being able to study
and costing you your grade,

670
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,083
then why don't you quit?

671
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:00,166
I'm very concerned about your performance.

672
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,250
Actually, it's a lot more complicated.

673
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,333
But never mind that.

674
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,416
It doesn't matter because I already quit.

675
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:11,166
Med schools may demand a whole lot
from their students.

676
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:14,541
That a lot of people would die
to get the opportunity you've been given.

677
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:17,583
You're still young.
You can make money later on.

678
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:22,791
Jane.

679
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,958
I can't believe
I slept like a rock last night.

680
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:31,000
How did you wake up before a class?

681
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:32,916
I barely made it myself.

682
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:37,166
What are you up to later?

683
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,291
I have two tickets
for the Ed Sheeran concert.

684
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,083
You wanna come with me?

685
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:43,875
I don't think I can.

686
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,250
Come on, it'll only be a couple of hours.

687
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:48,166
I promise you.

688
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,458
Why don't you go and ask Peach and Cin?

689
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,458
No way. Those two have a lot to sort out.

690
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,041
You're trying to hit on me?

691
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:01,458
Mm-hmm.

692
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,166
Well, I don't think of you that way, Win.

693
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,000
So don't waste your time on me.

694
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,708
I study and take care of June and Grandma.

695
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:15,041
That's all.
I don't have time for anything else.

696
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:16,625
I'm sorry.

697
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:22,166
Make way please.

698
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,875
-Clear the way.
-Let us through. Let us through.

699
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,375
Move aside, please.

700
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,041
-Out of the way, people.
-Clear the way, please.

701
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,541
-Clear the way.
-Move aside.

702
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:33,583
-Make way, people. Come on.
-Move aside, please.

703
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,083
-Steady.
-Clear out. Please let us work.

704
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,458
Gran?

705
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:56,916
Gran?

706
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:02,666
Gran!

707
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:07,916
Jane.

708
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,083
Where's Gran? How was she?

709
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,916
She suffered a stroke
so we need to move her

710
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:15,250
to a different hospital.

711
01:00:15,833 --> 01:00:16,708
Why is that?

712
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:18,708
We can't afford it here, June.

713
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:22,208
I'll go and talk to the doctor
about the transfer.

714
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:39,625
I… Is this gonna cover it?

715
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:44,541
Where did you get this?

716
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,208
Turn around, June.

717
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:00,583
Yeah, so what?

718
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:02,875
How did you know about it?

719
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,000
You should have told me before you did it.

720
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:06,916
It's very dangerous.

721
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,208
Well, you did it too, right?

722
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:09,541
Which is why you shouldn't have.

723
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,708
People died in that experiment,
did you know that?

724
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,750
I only have to stay awake.

725
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,833
You're not the only one who can save her.

726
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:18,458
June, please don't be so arrogant.

727
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,000
That's bullshit, Jane.

728
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,541
I'm just trying to help Gran.

729
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,791
So you can do it but I can't, is that it?

730
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,333
She's not just your grandma.

731
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,791
Keep your voice down. We're in a hospital.

732
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:31,541
Oh, fuck it. I don't care.

733
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,083
June.

734
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,541
Mrs. Duangjai's family?

735
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:40,791
Can you please come in?

736
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,375
Where did you put Mom's stuff?

737
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,041
Tell me!

738
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,250
There's no reason to hang on to them.
She's gone.

739
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:43,083
Her things have to stay.
You can't just throw them away.

740
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:47,041
Why should it matter that she's gone?

741
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:48,833
What were you thinking?

742
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:52,000
I just don't want us
to be lingering around

743
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,458
stuck forever with her memory.

744
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:56,291
If it's out of sight, it's out of mind.

745
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:59,166
Without her things around,
we'll forget what happened and moved on.

746
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,250
Are you serious right now?

747
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:03,541
Then how come we didn't just do that
three years ago?

748
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,375
I would never forget her.

749
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,458
You can forget her on your own.

750
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,708
Don't expect me to forget her.

751
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:15,291
Or maybe it's…

752
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:18,375
because you couldn't save her, so…

753
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,666
you'd rather forget why she died.

754
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,375
I did everything I could, Win.

755
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,666
If you were in my shoes,
then you'd understand.

756
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,291
I tried everything.

757
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,708
But there was just no way your mother was.

758
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:34,458
She was just far beyond anyone's help
by that point.

759
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:35,916
Do you even hear yourself?

760
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:37,875
No wonder Mom killed herself.

761
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:38,833
Win!

762
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,625
What kind of person are you?

763
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,958
Just like that. You gave up.

764
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,500
If I had just been given the same chance…

765
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:03,958
she'd still be around.

766
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:36,291
The number you dialed
cannot be reached right now.

767
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,625
I only have to stay awake.

768
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,291
I'm just trying to help Gran.

769
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,875
-Sorry, Miss, you can't come in.
-Where is Dr. Hans?

770
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,041
You can't come inside.

771
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:52,583
No, wait.

772
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:54,041
Miss, wait.

773
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:57,375
Miss, you have to leave right now.
Please stop.

774
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,208
Why did you do this to me?

775
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,958
I didn't do anything.

776
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:10,583
This is your sister's decision.

777
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,166
Just like I said, I can help.
We need the money.

778
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,125
-So you can stop--
-Shut your mouth, June.

779
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:21,083
Take the chip off now
or I'll call the police.

780
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,333
You didn't read it carefully, did you?

781
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,250
That's unfortunate, and…

782
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,041
I'm sorry.

783
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:31,916
Let me tell you something.

784
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,625
Instead of trying to sue me,

785
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,000
why don't you bring your friends
back here?

786
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,541
Even if you give us a million,
no one will do it.

787
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:43,958
If you don't bring your friends back
for Deep Level 3,

788
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:47,500
I'm not going to remove the chip
from your sister.

789
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:48,708
And that means

790
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:50,750
she's going to die.

791
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,125
June, let's go.

792
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,416
Be hurry, Jane!

793
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,958
Your sister's Deep 3 treatment
has started.

794
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,708
Tick-tock.

795
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,625
Tick-tock.

796
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,000
Now you know what happened.

797
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,166
I'm pretty much at my wits' end here.

798
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,208
We all know that, Jane.

799
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:32,333
It's tough but you gotta remember,
we barely got pass Level 2.

800
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:35,750
Imagine Level 3,
we might as well just commit suicide.

801
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,208
But if we're careful every step,

802
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,208
there's still a chance we can beat it.

803
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,500
Without your help,
my sister will surely die.

804
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,958
Jane.

805
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,041
I… can't take the risk.

806
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:56,958
I don't… want to die myself either.

807
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,416
Sorry to be blunt but…

808
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:06,166
we're talking about risking everyone.

809
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,000
Four lives just to save one.
Sounds like a bad bet.

810
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:11,166
The only reason that
you're still breathing…

811
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,416
is because of Jane.

812
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,333
She saved your life and that's a fact.

813
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:20,291
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here.

814
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:24,291
It is risky…

815
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,375
but I will help her.

816
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,208
I can't. I'm sorry, Jane.

817
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,041
Cin, come on, I'm begging you.

818
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,916
I don't know what else I can do now.

819
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,833
I'm so sorry.

820
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,166
Hey, Peach.

821
01:07:58,833 --> 01:07:59,750
Hey, Peach!

822
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:03,833
Jane.

823
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,958
Don't you worry.
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

824
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,333
I just wasn't thinking straight.

825
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,541
And now, I've put everyone in trouble.

826
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,291
I understand, June.

827
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:39,125
We needed the money
for Grandma's treatment anyway.

828
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,500
All right?

829
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,625
I'm sorry, Jane.

830
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,833
I'm with you,
no matter what happens.

831
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,208
Yeah, the texture of this cream
is totally different.

832
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,208
If we were to compare it
to the other ones,

833
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:14,458
well, I'd say it's pretty light overall.
Safety is on the face.

834
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,083
Sounds like a term paper.

835
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,125
Hey, Peach.

836
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,833
I knew you'd come around.

837
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,375
Well, I'm your friend.

838
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:32,791
Jane.

839
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,916
There are three of us now.

840
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:38,416
I think we can negotiate with Dr. Hans.

841
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,166
Then let's go see him already.

842
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,291
You better not start without me.

843
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,500
I don't like being indebted to anyone.

844
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:10,666
Don't smile.

845
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:14,666
Want to go Deep?
Quick before I change my mind.

846
01:11:26,083 --> 01:11:28,250
Are you ready?

847
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:33,500
You have a plan, right? No turning back.
It's now or never.

848
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:38,708
Of course I do.

849
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,375
The plan is to get help
from someone we can trust.

850
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:47,125
I'll give you a dose Exerall every day.

851
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:48,833
It'll keep you alert.

852
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,458
I really appreciate you helping us.

853
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,708
Actually, I owe you an apology.

854
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:03,583
If only I didn't send you
to that research program.

855
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,666
It's okay, professor.

856
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,375
None of this was your fault. Trust me.

857
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,791
We made our own decisions,
and we'll own up to it.

858
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,291
Besides, we really should thank you
for allowing us to stay here.

859
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,208
Everyone,
feel free to make yourself at home.

860
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,541
This is old ward belonged to my father.
It's safe.

861
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:24,291
All the equipment is in good condition
and are working fine.

862
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,291
The intercom is over there.

863
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:30,458
Simply buzz for me
if you ever need any help.

864
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:31,875
Well, I have a class to teach now.

865
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,583
So make yourself at home.

866
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,958
Call me immediately
as soon as anything goes wrong.

867
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,333
Jane, you have my number, right?

868
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:39,791
Yeah, I do.

869
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,458
Really?

870
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,125
You really gonna do your online thing?

871
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,750
Yeah. I mean,
what else am I supposed to do here?

872
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,041
All right. Whatever.

873
01:13:21,666 --> 01:13:24,250
Now let me tell you
why Finn Mobile is so special.

874
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,500
It comes with a great
and complete package.

875
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:28,166
You pay less and get more.

876
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,375
With the maximum speed
of ten megabits per second.

877
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,791
You can enjoy movies, series,
and games with unlimited data,

878
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,541
plus all the other online services.

879
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,375
It's so easy and convenient. All right?

880
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,416
In the brutal murder case,

881
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,583
both husband and wife
were the house owners

882
01:15:56,666 --> 01:16:00,000
were found stabbed by a knife
and died at the scene.

883
01:16:08,208 --> 01:16:09,166
Win.

884
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,833
Win.

885
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:23,000
June. June.

886
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:32,875
Win.

887
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:34,541
Win.

888
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:36,000
Win.

889
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:39,416
June. June.

890
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:48,333
June. Please, June, wake up right now.

891
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,375
-June.
-Win.

892
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,958
Win.

893
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,958
Win.

894
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,250
Win.

895
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,541
Win.

896
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,791
Win.

897
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:12,250
June!

898
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,500
Jane!

899
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,625
Jane!

900
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,875
Jane, what's the matter?

901
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,500
Oh, shit.

902
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,375
You okay, Cin?

903
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,416
What happened?

904
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,166
Cin.

905
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:54,500
Cin.

906
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,750
Don't touch me, you psychopath!

907
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,416
Cin, please calm yourself.

908
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,750
Let me look at your wound.

909
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,166
My face looks like shit
because of your sister.

910
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,125
I've become a walking corpse

911
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:15,625
just because of you.

912
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:19,291
I'm in this fucking mess
over a mistake by this little shit.

913
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:20,958
Cin. Take it easy, okay?

914
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:22,583
Take it easy, my ass.

915
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:24,416
Take a good look
at what happened to my face!

916
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,416
Cin, you have to listen to me.

917
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,416
You need to pull yourself together.

918
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,750
What? You think this is the key?
You'll win her heart because of this?

919
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,750
Let me break it to you.

920
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,083
It really doesn't matter how hard you try,

921
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,333
she's never going to look at you twice.

922
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,250
Come on.

923
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,833
So you think being a nice guy,

924
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:49,875
trying to save her precious sister
and all that shit

925
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,375
will make you so fucking cool in her eyes?

926
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,458
-It's none of your business, okay?
-Win. Win. Win.

927
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,000
Win. Win. Win.

928
01:18:57,583 --> 01:19:00,541
Win, we have to stay calm.
We're all friends here, right?

929
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:02,458
We're friends, my ass!

930
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:06,791
What kind of a friend would mouth off
and attack Jane and her sister like that?

931
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:11,500
Let's just calmly sort this out.

932
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,208
You've never had any friends.

933
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
-So how would you know anything?
-Win.

934
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,500
No one wants to be friends
with a sick loser like you.

935
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:32,833
Win.

936
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:35,500
Don't do it, Win. Win.

937
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:38,416
Win. Stay calm, okay?

938
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:40,791
Are you out of your mind?

939
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,791
You want a piece of me, you prick. Huh?

940
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:49,750
Huh?

941
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,083
Win. Win, stop it, Win.

942
01:19:58,166 --> 01:19:59,458
-Get back!
-Win. Win.

943
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:02,625
You think you're tough, huh?

944
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,708
Huh? Huh?

945
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:07,791
What's the matter? Take this shot.

946
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,625
Professor, we're in trouble.

947
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:17,666
Professor, help us!

948
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,500
Professor!

949
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,708
Professor Nichcha, please! Professor!

950
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:28,708
Professor Nichcha?

951
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:21,166
Jane, if you're feeling up,
you can give them a call at this number.

952
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,083
Hello.

953
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:35,666
My name is Hans Miller.

954
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:40,958
Jane.

955
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,541
You're not supposed to be here.

956
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:38,875
Cin, call the police!

957
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:40,000
What?

958
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,541
Professor Nichcha is behind everything.

959
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,458
What was that?

960
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,166
Professor Nichcha is behind Deep.

961
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,708
Call the police now.

962
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:56,833
Shit, there's no signal.

963
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,708
Children…

964
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
you won't be getting any signal in there.

965
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,291
Signal's gone. There's nothing.

966
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,333
Move it.

967
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,416
Shit.

968
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,208
It's locked tight.

969
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:39,083
Professor, please let us out of here.
Don't do this, please.

970
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:41,333
Stop this. Professor, please!

971
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:44,125
I will let you out, don't worry.

972
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,166
Once I extract the chips from all of you.

973
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,125
Then come and get it now, bitch.

974
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:52,708
I'll only remove all your chips

975
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,958
once you have reached full percentage.

976
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,833
Fuck!

977
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,958
-Or when you're…
-Hey, Peach, help us.

978
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,166
…dead.

979
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,291
I know that you're watching us.

980
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:30,416
So you want the chips?

981
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,875
You're never getting them
'cause I'm gonna kill you.

982
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:33,916
Fuck you!

983
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,375
Bitch!

984
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:01,125
Win. Win. Win.

985
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,250
Win.

986
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:03,375
Win.

987
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,458
Win?

988
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,500
Win.

989
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:08,916
Win.

990
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:20,583
Win.

991
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,875
Win. Win.

992
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,583
-Win. Win. Win.
-Ma?

993
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,750
But how…

994
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,875
Imagine how lucky we were
to find some CCL.

995
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:40,000
Which can cause temporary cardiac arrest.

996
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,041
We're not going anywhere.

997
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,208
We certainly can't max out the chip,

998
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,291
but we can still fake our death.

999
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:11,791
So why the hell are you doing this to us?

1000
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:41,333
This is Jed.

1001
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:43,916
The love of my life from 24 years ago.

1002
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:47,791
Back then, he had used himself
as a subject for his own research

1003
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:49,583
on sleep deprivation.

1004
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:53,708
Extended sleeplessness drove him
into a fit of hallucination.

1005
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,291
Eventually,
he fell from a building.

1006
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,541
He survived but went into coma.

1007
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,583
Years after that,

1008
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,833
I found a practical way
to extract Qratonin

1009
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:07,541
from the brain of sleep-deprived humans.

1010
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,708
Jed responded positively
to the Qratonin treatment.

1011
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,958
But a Qratonin from a single person

1012
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,416
was just not enough to awaken him
from his coma.

1013
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,083
You're risking people's lives
for your own benefit.

1014
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:19,208
You call yourself human?

1015
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:21,458
I never intended for anyone to die
from this, Cin.

1016
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:24,833
But then someone did actually die.
What do you have to say about that?

1017
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:26,291
Jane,

1018
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:29,333
that was a momentary anomaly.

1019
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:30,416
It was a glitch.

1020
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,875
If she had followed the instruction,
she would've been fine.

1021
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:37,083
I have done everything I can for everyone,
and you know it.

1022
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:41,875
You know how important my students are.
To me, I care about them.

1023
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:46,750
I have always looked after the four of you
from the start.

1024
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:50,083
If I had really wanted you to die,

1025
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:52,000
then I wouldn't have brought you here,
right?

1026
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,458
You don't think
I've tried everything on myself too?

1027
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,416
Here. Why don't you take a look?

1028
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:09,541
All I ever wanted to achieve from this
was to bring back the man I love.

1029
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,291
So you really don't get it?

1030
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:15,208
You can't see how
what you're doing is wrong.

1031
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,291
Jane, you know what it's like.

1032
01:29:19,166 --> 01:29:21,500
How extremely painful it is

1033
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:23,125
to lose somebody you love.

1034
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:26,250
I know that you know, Jane.

1035
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:29,041
And if you were in my position,

1036
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,750
then you wouldn't have done
anything different!

1037
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:36,333
Let's hurry up and call the police.

1038
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,250
ANESTHETIC DRUG

1039
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,708
-Hey!
-Jane!

1040
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:53,500
Jane!

1041
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:55,083
Jane!

1042
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:59,833
-Somebody please help us.
-Hey, Peach, a little help.

1043
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:04,125
-Jane!
-Let me.

1044
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:06,041
Jane. Jane!

1045
01:30:06,125 --> 01:30:07,041
Jane.

1046
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:10,541
Jane!

1047
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:32,625
June, hand me that AED.

1048
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:43,875
-Jane!
-June, you take the pads out.

1049
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:47,208
Put one right over her left rib
and press firmly.

1050
01:30:47,291 --> 01:30:49,208
The other one on her right collarbone.

1051
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:07,791
Okay. Now move.

1052
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:15,291
How's Jane doing?

1053
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,458
Still unconscious.
We need some room.

1054
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,916
You did it.

1055
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:34,958
Jane!

1056
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,041
Jane!

1057
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,166
Wake up, Jane.

1058
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:11,500
I'm with you,
no matter what happens.

1059
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:17,125
Jane!

1060
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,416
You said you're with me
no matter what happens.

1061
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,416
Jane!

1062
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,125
Jane!

1063
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:43,416
Jane!

1064
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:55,541
After that,
Professor Nichcha was arrested.

1065
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:58,541
All the students who'd taken part in Deep

1066
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,500
had their chip implants removed.

1067
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:03,875
No one had gotten paid
for joining Level 3.

1068
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,958
All of your mother's stuff
that I had given away earlier,

1069
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:30,541
I promise you I'm gonna get it all back.

1070
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:45,666
I love you, son.

1071
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,291
Now what?

1072
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:56,208
Come on.

1073
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:01,041
What are you waiting for?

1074
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:01,958
It's heavy.

1075
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:23,041
What?

1076
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,458
Gran, you see that?

1077
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,708
She's so hard to please.

1078
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,041
You're a snitch.

1079
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,416
I'll tell on you.

1080
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,666
You got nothing.

1081
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:36,958
So, guys, I would like to tell all of you,
my loyal followers

1082
01:34:37,041 --> 01:34:38,541
to see my life as a case study.

1083
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:42,000
Follow your heart no matter what.
Life is very short, so what's the harm?

1084
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:44,208
Regardless of the outcome really,
it's all right.

1085
01:34:44,291 --> 01:34:46,250
At least you chose it, now that's freedom.

1086
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:48,750
Cin finally decided
to quit med school

1087
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,083
to study Communications.

1088
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:53,291
So no more sleeping pills for her.

1089
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,708
NITE NITE, GUYS.

1090
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,333
Go to sleep.

1091
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:19,625
Come on.

1092
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:29,041
Sleep.

1093
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,333
And Peach…

1094
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:40,583
he realized that
living with friends in the real world

1095
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:43,458
makes him just as happy
as in the virtual world.

1096
01:35:43,541 --> 01:35:45,000
Hey!

1097
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,291
-Win…
-Hey.

1098
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:49,500
Hey!

1099
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:54,583
You're in it, Win!

1100
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,791
Win!

1101
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:00,500
Hey!

1102
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:01,416
Take this.

1103
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:10,291
And finally,
everyone had chosen to sleep like a rock

1104
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:12,291
rather than to sleep like the dead

1105
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,875
never to wake up and see the sun again.
