1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,799
"First Love."

2
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,919
Does this mean…

3
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
What are you trying to say?

4
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,319
After you found out I like apples,
you bought them for me every day.

5
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
Do you remember that?

6
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,199
I thought you really wanted to eat
these stupid apples,

7
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,479
but they're just a reminder of Dad.

8
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,960
Then don't eat them.

9
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,879
I'm such a terrible mother.

10
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,439
Mom.

11
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
Let's go home.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,919
If you want
to stay in this house, I don't--

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,879
Is this Neung?

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,120
Can he tell me who I am?

15
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,400
He isn't here anymore.

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,199
MR. ANONT TANAKUL

17
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,680
Dad told me

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,159
that Neung and his friends
were going on a trip to the province

19
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,439
to celebrate getting into university.

20
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,840
But on the way to the train station,

21
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,400
he was hit by a car and he died.

22
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm…

23
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,319
sorry to hear that.

24
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,520
It's okay. It happened a long time ago.

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,599
Were you guys friends with him?

26
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,319
I wasn't.

27
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,599
I was his junior at school.

28
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,879
We were in the same club.

29
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,599
Dad said that he was close
with everyone in that club.

30
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,560
I would have thought everyone knew

31
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,919
he died ten years ago.

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,439
That's right. How could you not know?

33
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,599
We didn't stay in touch when he left.

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
The last time I saw him

35
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,080
was probably at graduation.

36
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,040
Neung.

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,519
What's up?

38
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,519
This is for you.

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,759
You got it for me?

40
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,800
When you leave,
you'll still play basketball, right?

41
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,759
You know me.

42
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,759
Thanks.

43
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Did you get a place
on the sports science course?

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, sports science.

45
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,319
Are you pleased?

46
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,439
Of course.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm a bit apprehensive too.

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
I'll be the only one there.

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Sho is taking management.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,199
Prab is going to Rangsit.

51
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,279
And as for Tarn,

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,879
he's going to Chiang Mai.

53
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,079
We're actually planning a graduation trip.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Where are all your friends?

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,959
Over there, saying goodbye to the girls.

56
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,240
What are those?

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,680
Are they for everyone in the club?

58
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,600
You're more generous than I thought.

59
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,399
That's why Tofu looked so familiar.

60
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
Because I've seen Neung here.

61
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
You've had no contact with him since then?

62
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,839
Didn't you even have his Facebook?

63
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,920
No, I didn't ask.

64
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,399
That's why

65
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,759
you didn't know.

66
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,480
If it weren't for Tofu looking like him,

67
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,199
you would never have known.

68
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,079
You should thank him.

69
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,720
After all that,
we still have no idea who Tofu is.

70
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,480
All we know for sure is

71
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,079
he has nothing to do with Neung,

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
despite them looking identical.

73
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,399
Why are you so chatty?

74
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,759
While we were talking,

75
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,399
your friend barely said a word.

76
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,199
You kept going,

77
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,519
even though it's none of your business.

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,600
Why don't you just insult me?

79
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Can I?

80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,519
I have to get going.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm meeting my family.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,480
Right. Today is your family day.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,279
You should leave.
I'm going to stay for a bit.

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay then.

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,720
How about I drive you?

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,839
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

87
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,040
I can call for a ride.

88
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,759
What for? Come with me.

89
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,759
-Let me take you.
-Let go.

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,519
MR. ANONT TANAKUL
BORN MARCH 1, 1991, DIED APRIL 11, 2009

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,439
Can you speed up? You're going too slow.

92
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,319
Hold on tight.
I'll get you there in no time.

93
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,439
Woah!

94
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,120
Hey.

95
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,040
Why did you stop? We're not there yet.

96
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
Give me a second. I'm taking an order.

97
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
Are you trying to annoy me?

98
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,079
Not at all.

99
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
We're going this way anyway.

100
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,120
We're going to pass the shop. See?

101
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,879
Let me make some money.

102
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,240
Seriously? If you wanted to make money,
why did you bring me with you?

103
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,879
Can't I do both?

104
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,399
You're making me late.
You said you would get me there quickly.

105
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm not going with you.

106
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,240
You're in a hurry. I get it.

107
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,040
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

108
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,879
Hey, slow down!

109
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,360
Touch arms.

110
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,120
My arm.

111
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,200
Does the teddy bear

112
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,000
mean so much to you?

113
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,440
It was a gift from someone special.

114
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
Neung must have been
a very important person to Nut.

115
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,759
What are you doing?

116
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
We're at a temple.

117
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,679
Why did you do that?

118
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,559
Let's go home.

119
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,759
When I was a teddy bear,
you liked hugging me.

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,039
Now that I'm human,
why don't you like it anymore?

121
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you don't like to be hugged.

122
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,159
It's not that, but we're in a temple.

123
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,840
What do you mean?

124
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,200
I forgot that you have amnesia.

125
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
Is hugging in a temple wrong?

126
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,759
It's inappropriate.

127
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,120
Can we hug elsewhere?

128
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,519
Yes.

129
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,759
I mean, no.

130
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,039
Why would you want to hug me?

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,639
You were sad. The only thing
I could think of doing was hug you.

132
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,480
You didn't need to do anything.
I'll be fine.

133
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,559
Isn't it better
when someone's there for you?

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
I don't like seeing you sad.

135
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Can I help you when you're sad?

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,840
When I'm with you,

137
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't get to be sad.

138
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,440
You just give me a headache.

139
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you have a headache again?

140
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,559
Do you want some medicine?

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
Nut.

142
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,639
Nut.

143
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
Hey!

144
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,039
Here.

145
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,720
Hey, wait.

146
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,039
Leaving just like that?

147
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,039
No goodbye?

148
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,200
I didn't ask you to drop me off.

149
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,919
But I did drop you off.

150
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,960
What do you want?

151
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,559
Do you want money?

152
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,919
No, I don't.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
I still have the 3,000 baht you gave me.

154
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,320
I'm not a money-grubber.

155
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,200
You were nice to me,
so I wanted to return the favor.

156
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,639
Then what is it

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,879
that you want?

158
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,240
Well…

159
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,080
I already know your name.
I also have your number.

160
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,480
What about…

161
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
Can I--

162
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,600
How about I thank you sincerely?
Is that enough?

163
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,399
Now, go away before I kick you
and your bike.

164
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,200
Fine, I'll go.

165
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,080
Don't enjoy lunch too much.

166
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,639
You're getting fat.

167
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,039
I'm going.

168
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,840
You punk.

169
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,360
Who's fat?

170
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,679
-Haven't you been here before?
-No.

171
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,919
That's good.

172
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm here, Mom.

173
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,879
Sit down.

174
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,759
Why did you order so much?

175
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,639
You said you were hungry.

176
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,559
Don't enjoy lunch too much.
You're getting fat.

177
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,840
Didn't you say you were with Nut?

178
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,240
Why didn't you invite him?

179
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,799
I asked, but he's busy.

180
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,279
Busy? He must be on a date.

181
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,639
Gen.

182
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,399
Your friend beat you to it.

183
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,720
You'll ruin my good name.

184
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,840
I told you I could introduce you
to handsome young soldiers,

185
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,919
but you refused.

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
Nice one.

187
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,559
Nut has an errand to run, not a date.

188
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,559
And I told you I could handle this myself.

189
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,480
Hey,

190
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,360
will I get to meet
your boyfriend before I die?

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,759
Why don't you tell me what your type is?

192
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,799
Why is it so difficult to find one?

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,519
Men in uniform are a no-no.

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,000
They're bossy

195
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,679
and they love to nag.

196
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,960
-Right, Mom?
-I totally agree.

197
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,559
I'm kidding.

199
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,039
You two are cruel.

200
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,720
I don't really have a type.

201
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,279
The only condition I have is

202
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
I won't date someone younger than me.

203
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,559
I see.

204
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,000
ANEUNG TANAKUL

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Who is he?

206
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,919
ANEUNG TANAKUL

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,840
What?

208
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,960
He added me.

209
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,039
How did he get my Facebook?

210
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,840
Hey, it's me!

211
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,120
I accepted the friend request
to Neung from Nut.

212
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,399
I know Neung's password.
I was on his profile.

213
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,720
I was going through Nut's feed

214
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,679
and your name popped up.

215
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,559
Go on. Accept my request.

216
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,279
ANEUNG TANAKUL

217
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,759
I know you're thinking of rejecting me.

218
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,039
You're a coward.

219
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,879
Why am I dancing to his tune?

220
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,440
ACCEPT

221
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,480
Dad.

222
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,879
Why did you press that?

223
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
To accept, obviously.

224
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
You were hesitating.

225
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,399
I know you.

226
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
If you really wanted to reject him,
you would have done so in the first place.

227
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,120
You were playing hard to get.

228
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,159
I…

229
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,879
I was about to hit reject.

230
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
Why did you press accept?

231
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,679
Let it be. It's done now.

232
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,159
Listen.

233
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
You said you could handle it yourself.

234
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,440
Does that mean
you've already found someone?

235
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,919
Who's the guy?

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,279
Mom.

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,320
I haven't found anybody.

238
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,360
And this guy is no one.

239
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,080
He's just an annoying kid.

240
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,960
He's younger?

241
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,600
Again?

242
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,639
Getting what you don't like, I see.

243
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,559
Keep eating.

244
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
-I'm eating
-Eat up.

245
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,759
I'm eating here.

246
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,320
ANEUNG TANAKUL

247
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Tasty?

248
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,159
Not really.

249
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,519
I meant the guy.

250
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
Dad.

251
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,399
I was about to ask if you meant the guy?

252
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,679
Dad.

253
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,720
Dad.

254
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,359
When did you come back?

255
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,160
Just now. I was about to text you.

256
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
Do you miss Neung?

257
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,440
I think of him all the time.

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,559
He passed away so suddenly.

259
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,640
Who would have known

260
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,240
that I would never get to hug him again?

261
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,880
Dad, you can hug me instead.

262
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,480
-Come on.
-Hold on.

263
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,079
Why so sentimental?

264
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,119
It doesn't suit you.

265
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,880
You started it.

266
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,400
Your mood swings get worse with age.

267
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,119
Come again?

268
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,319
What did you just say?

269
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,839
You just got back,
and you're pushing me around.

270
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,519
I should call the police to report
domestic violence in this house.

271
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,799
Do you see this badge?

272
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,799
Come here and report it to me.

273
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,279
Sure.

274
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,799
Dad.

275
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,720
You can hug me anytime.

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Whenever you feel like it.
Don't hold back.

277
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,759
You're the best, son.

278
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,920
Song is using Neung's account.
He accepted your request.

279
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,480
How did Gen know?

280
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,799
If it wasn't Neung…

281
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't think

282
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,480
of anyone else important
who gave Nut that gift.

283
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,880
Are you really not related?

284
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
Why do you look like him?

285
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,079
I think Nut only let me stay here

286
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,200
because I look like Neung.

287
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,720
Could it be

288
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,720
that his soul inhabited the teddy bear,

289
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,599
making Tofu a human?

290
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,519
But Tofu is still Tofu.

291
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,079
He's not possessed.

292
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,799
Little One,

293
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,839
stop watching those soap operas.

294
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,119
The plots are cliché,

295
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,920
and full of violence and patriotism.

296
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,000
We're talking about Tofu.
Stop changing the subject.

297
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,480
Precisely.

298
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,119
It's a waste of brainpower and time.

299
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,759
You should learn to let go if possible.

300
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,640
Stop arguing, everyone.

301
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,920
I just want to know what I should do next.

302
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,200
If you want my advice,

303
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,359
with Neung out of the question,
you should find the next one.

304
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,920
I think someone close to Nut
will have an answer

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,119
as to why you're like this.

306
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,880
Someone close to Nut?

307
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,319
Haven't you left yet?

308
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,799
No.

309
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,160
What's this?

310
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,599
Are you still drawing him?

311
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,279
Of course.

312
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,200
My page has gained more followers.

313
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,920
If I'm contacted by a sponsor,

314
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,880
I will no longer work
as your graphic designer.

315
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm going to become an influencer.

316
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I think you're still drawing him
because you can't get over him.

317
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,359
He's the first person I ever loved.

318
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,319
First love, you know?

319
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,279
Your first love is gay?

320
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,759
Uncle Juea!

321
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,880
As soon as you were rejected,

322
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,000
you've turned to gay romance.

323
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,079
How in the world?

324
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,680
It's in my blood. I can't help it.

325
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,079
This new assignment should be
right up your alley then.

326
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,319
What assignment?

327
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
The new series.

328
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,359
I sent you the detail ages ago.

329
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,559
I'm sorry, Uncle Juea.

330
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,759
I just got back from Chiang Mai.

331
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,640
I haven't had time to go over it.

332
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,240
Jeez. You have
no clue about the new series.

333
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Do you know that there's casting
scheduled for tomorrow?

334
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,960
Casting?

335
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,839
Turn off the lights when you go.

336
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,519
This isn't an action series.

337
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,759
It's a gay romance.

338
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,359
Get close.

339
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,599
Stand like this for a lighting check.

340
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,720
Ya, come here.

341
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,920
Their faces look so dark.

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
This is a gay romance.

343
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,559
I need innocent faces. Make them shine.

344
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

345
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,960
Quick.

346
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,440
Where's Nut?

347
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,880
I haven't seen him.

348
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,119
Definitely. I'm on my way.

349
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Mom, I'm off.

350
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,680
Nut, take this…

351
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,920
I'll bring it to him.

352
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,119
Nut.

353
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,519
Nut.

354
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,039
Nut.

355
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,839
Where to?

356
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
Follow that car.

357
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,160
No problem. Put on the helmet.

358
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,079
Put it on. Like this.

359
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Get on the bike

360
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,640
or we'll lose them.

361
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,359
Hurry up.

362
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,039
Hey.

363
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,759
Sit properly. I can't steer.

364
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,640
Am I not sitting properly?

365
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,960
Move back. You're squashing me.

366
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
This is so fun. It's like a movie.

367
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,720
How is it fun?
You're going to make us crash. Sit still.

368
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,319
There. Follow that car!

369
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,119
Nut.

370
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Nut.

371
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:10,200
Thanks.

372
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,920
Hold on.

373
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,400
Pay me first.

374
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,799
For what?

375
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,160
For the ride.

376
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,079
Well…

377
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,200
I don't have any money.

378
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
I didn't know I needed money.

379
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
Are you trying to play dumb?

380
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,920
Are you playing dumb?

381
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,799
-I'm not.
-Well?

382
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Excuse me.

383
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,880
What's going on?

384
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,440
This guy refused to pay.

385
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
Did he?

386
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,440
Don't you have any money?

387
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,559
So,

388
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
why are you here?

389
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I came to see Nut.

390
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,440
I see.

391
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
Are you here for the casting?

392
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,400
You better hurry.

393
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,400
It's starting soon.

394
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll take care of it.

395
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,079
Thank you.

396
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
No problem. You better hurry.

397
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,279
-How much?
-One hundred and fifty.

398
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,759
-One hundred and fifty?
-Yes.

399
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,720
Sorry, Juea.

400
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,599
What's wrong?

401
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,880
Look at who's casting
for our innocent gay romance.

402
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,440
Innocent, my ass.

403
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
They look nothing like their photos.

404
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,200
This is just…

405
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,839
Come here.

406
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,440
Yes?

407
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,759
They're nothing like their photos.

408
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,920
Look at this.

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,119
Is this really them?

410
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
These are the photos they sent.

411
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,039
But…

412
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,680
Nut.

413
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,039
Find other people or we're finished.

414
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,119
Yes, sir.

415
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,480
What?

416
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,920
He's fair, innocent,

417
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,319
and young.

418
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,559
-I'll take him.
-Tofu.

419
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,640
-You know him?
-Why are you here?

420
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
What?

421
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,880
I…

422
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,799
-Do you know him?
-Give me a sec.

423
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,000
Who is he?

424
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,759
What are you doing here?
Did you follow me?

425
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,119
Yes.

426
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,039
You forgot your lunchbox.

427
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,799
Thanks,

428
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,200
but don't bother next time.

429
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,920
It's just food. I can get something.

430
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,160
This is not just any lunchbox.

431
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,599
Your mom woke up early to prepare it.

432
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,759
You should eat this

433
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,440
or she will be sad.

434
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,799
Thanks.

435
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,680
Now that you've given it to me,
you should go.

436
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,079
How did you get here?

437
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,400
I--

438
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,160
Nut, who is this guy?

439
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,079
He's a relative from the province.

440
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,000
He's staying with us for a while.

441
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,319
I forgot something, so he brought it.

442
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,880
He's about to leave.

443
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,279
Wait.

444
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,960
Turn around.

445
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,839
Not bad. Come and cast.

446
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,359
Juea.

447
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm borrowing him.

448
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,920
It will be an innocent gay romance.

449
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,920
Awesome.

450
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,480
Will you introduce yourself?

451
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,240
My name is Tofu.

452
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
Is that it?

453
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,079
Do you want more?

454
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,039
Well…

455
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,440
Juea.

456
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,279
Can I talk to him?

457
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,599
Sure.

458
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,039
Do you know what's going on here?

459
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,000
Yes. You're looking for an actor, right?

460
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,000
That's right. Do you want to be an actor?

461
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,559
Is that why you came in here?

462
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,799
If I were an actor,

463
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,240
I would play a character, right?

464
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,519
Yes.

465
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,519
If I play a character written by you,

466
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,519
I'll get to see you more, won't I?

467
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,559
I'll get to know more about you
through your work.

468
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,559
I can also help you with it.

469
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,680
I'll give it a try.

470
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Are you two going to talk all day?
We're in a hurry.

471
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,440
Damn.

472
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,480
Listen.

473
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,039
Don't bother introducing yourself.

474
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,400
Just do as I say.

475
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,240
Sure.

476
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,799
Nut,

477
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,240
you can help me.

478
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
Move closer.

479
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,559
You're not even on screen.

480
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,799
Closer.

481
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,359
This is a gay romance series.

482
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,599
Closer.

483
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,400
Project your feelings.

484
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,319
You love him.

485
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,799
Smile.

486
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,920
Don't smirk. Look at his face.

487
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,119
You love each other. That's good.

488
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,440
Closer.

489
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,680
Nice.

490
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,160
Very nice.

491
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,119
Good.

492
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Down.

493
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,720
Smile, Tofu.

494
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,160
A sweet smile, Tofu.

495
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,880
Sweeter, Tofu.

496
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
Nut.

497
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,960
You smile too.

498
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,720
Move your face closer.

499
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,000
Good.

500
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Nut, behave.

501
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,920
Keep your faces close.

502
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,119
Gen, is Nut here today?

503
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,839
I'm sure he is.
He has high hopes for this series.

504
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,519
Really? I haven't read the synopsis.

505
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,440
His work is always good though.

506
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,319
It even got Uncle Juea to change his mind.

507
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,680
I don't need to read it
to know it would be great.

508
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,880
Here.

509
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,480
Read it.

510
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,279
I wonder if you'll still be a fan
after you've read it.

511
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,759
Also, for your sake,

512
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,400
I should tell you that the storyline
is based on Nut's life.

513
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,559
It's about

514
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,400
his first love.

515
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,319
His first love?

516
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,279
That's right. Does that hurt?

517
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,559
I'm cool.

518
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,839
Everyone has their first love.

519
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,799
It's in the past. I'm okay with it.

520
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,440
You'll see.

521
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,519
The character is in high school.

522
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,039
I want you to try this uniform on.

523
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Juea wants to see it.

524
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
Take this.

525
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,920
Do I go in there?

526
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,200
Yes, why?

527
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,279
Please let me handle this.

528
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,720
Tofu, will you hurry up and get changed?

529
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,480
Get in. I'll stand guard.

530
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,920
Stop dillydallying.

531
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,279
It's a gay love story?

532
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,640
Nut…

533
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,640
Nut is…

534
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,480
Tofu, are you done?

535
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,640
Yes, I'm done.

536
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,480
If you're done, come out.

537
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,519
Always dillydallying.

538
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,079
Why didn't you put on the pants?

539
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,559
How do I put them on?

540
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,359
It's not hard. Put them on, quickly.

541
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Are you done?

542
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,199
I've put them on. What next?

543
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,440
Pull the zipper up.

544
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,719
Pull the zipper up?

545
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,880
Yes. What's so difficult to understand?

546
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,079
Tofu, I meant the zipper
on your pants, not the tent.

547
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,960
What is it stuck on?

548
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,480
How…

549
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Oh, my gosh.

550
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:49,440
Look behind you.

551
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
Tofu, why aren't you wearing underwear?

552
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,320
Go in.

553
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
Nut.

554
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,280
Are you still angry?

555
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,880
I forgot that I should wear underwear.

556
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,119
You forgot to wear underwear?
Are you crazy?

557
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,800
It slipped my mind.

558
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,920
Your mom didn't tell me about it.

559
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
My mom probably forgot.

560
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,280
She even forgets about her own stuff.

561
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,199
Is your amnesia so serious

562
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,960
that you forgot the basics of living?

563
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,320
Tofu.

564
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,800
Get down.

565
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:48,440
Come here.

566
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,599
I'm sorry.

567
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,480
Why did you climb that? You shouldn't.

568
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,880
Tofu.

569
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,079
Since you've been at my house,

570
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,400
have you even showered
or brushed your teeth?

571
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,559
A little bit.

572
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,639
But I'm not sure if I did it correctly.

573
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,119
I don't remember.

574
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,320
Tofu,

575
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
you're disgusting.

576
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Nut.

577
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,360
Nut.

578
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,599
Tofu.

579
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,079
Why aren't you coming up?

580
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,119
The stairs are moving.

581
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,719
Wait there.

582
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:00,960
Tofu.

583
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,760
Why are you going up?

584
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,400
I told you to wait.

585
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,559
I couldn't wait.

586
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Tofu.

587
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,079
Once you get up, stay put.

588
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,039
Don't move.

589
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,599
Wait there.

590
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,599
Tofu.

591
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,519
I told you to wait.

592
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
Have you never used an escalator?

593
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,360
No, I haven't.

594
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,559
I told you to wait.
Why didn't you do that?

595
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,039
The stairs didn't stop.

596
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,440
The stairs wouldn't stop, but you could.

597
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,000
I met a lot of friends.

598
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Friends.

599
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,440
Hello.

600
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,679
Hello.

601
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,599
Tofu.

602
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,559
What are you doing?

603
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,840
TWO SCOOPS FOR 39 BAHT

604
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
In the soap operas I've seen,

605
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,079
the characters always love this.

606
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,559
Tofu.

607
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,719
Are you a child?

608
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,800
Teddy bears and ice cream.

609
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,719
Nut.

610
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,280
I want to eat some.

611
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,599
Gen.

612
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,079
Is Nut back yet?

613
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,960
No. He said you could go ahead and choose.

614
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,039
He's not fussed.

615
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,039
Not fussed?

616
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,559
I want his opinion.

617
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,440
Where is Prib?

618
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,199
I don't know where she went.

619
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,480
She just ran off.

620
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,239
My own niece suddenly goes missing.

621
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,880
Is anyone working?

622
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,199
-I can't contact any of them.
-So?

623
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,079
Do you not like any of the others?

624
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,360
What about Tofu?

625
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,480
He's too naive.

626
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,000
If one day he brings a worm with him,

627
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,639
I might puke.

628
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,239
Coffee, over here.

629
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,480
Where's my coffee?

630
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,639
-My bubble tea.
-Here you are.

631
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,000
-You.
-You.

632
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,639
Jesus.

633
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,280
What is this, reunion day or something?

634
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,480
Gen, is he your relative?

635
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,480
Relative my…

636
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,400
What?

637
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,400
He's just an acquaintance.

638
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,199
I see.

639
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,719
Come.

640
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:24,920
Excuse me.

641
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,960
Do you have other deliveries to make?

642
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,559
No.

643
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,719
We're casting for a series.

644
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,360
Are you interested in trying out?

645
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,679
With that face? Juea will say no.

646
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Right now, I would take a dog.

647
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,000
Juea.

648
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,000
What?

649
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,599
What do you say? Are you interested?

650
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,960
Yes, I'm interested.

651
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:53,880
Great.

652
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:55,440
No.

653
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,159
Finally, we're here.

654
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,039
Go choose some underwear.

655
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,079
I'll buy you a dozen pairs.

656
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,639
Go on.

657
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,760
Do you think these are too small?

658
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,000
Tofu.

659
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,280
Those are for girls, you idiot. Come on.

660
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,119
These are for guys.

661
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,400
Choose some.

662
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,440
But I don't know my size.

663
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,400
Do I have to measure you?

664
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:54,760
Take these.
Pick the ones you think will fit.

665
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,400
Or ask a salesperson.

666
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,199
Go on. You're wasting time.

667
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,840
All right.

668
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,800
Since we're here, get some clothes too.

669
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,559
No.

670
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,400
Nut.

671
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,039
How about this?

672
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,440
What's that?

673
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,079
It's a bow.

674
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,559
Why do you want that?

675
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,159
I have no words.

676
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,159
Do you remember how to use it?

677
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,840
I don't.

678
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:53,960
I knew it.

679
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,519
Look there.

680
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,760
Open your mouth.

681
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,519
Don't bite it.

682
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,320
Brush.

683
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,039
That's right.

684
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,880
All the way around.

685
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,800
Do you understand?

686
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,039
I understand.

687
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,119
Good.

688
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,559
Don't move your head. Keep still.

689
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,000
Brush like this.

690
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,760
Keep still. Up, down.

691
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,639
Then like this.

692
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,119
Here.

693
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,320
Is that for me?

694
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,679
I'm handing it to you.
Who else would it be for?

695
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,679
You can just call me next time.

696
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,960
Don't follow me to work.

697
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,639
I can call you?

698
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,800
If you want to call Kuenchai, be my guest.

699
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,079
No thanks.

700
00:45:58,559 --> 00:45:59,960
I'll only call you.

701
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:01,760
Even if I'm not with you,

702
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,639
at least, I can hear your voice.

703
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,800
Thanks.

704
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,599
I spent over 10,000 baht on you today.

705
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:19,119
You'll need to work your ass off
to pay me back.

706
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,639
Here you are.

707
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:24,840
Hey.

708
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,840
Tofu, stop.

709
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,280
Can't you make it work?

710
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:31,440
I've forgotten.

711
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Like this. Tap.

712
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:35,880
Then slide.

713
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,000
Now, you can press it, okay?

714
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:41,280
To make a call, go here.

715
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,280
I'll add my number.

716
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,320
Give it a try.

717
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,679
Good.

718
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,920
Hello, Na.

719
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,960
I haven't seen you in ages,

720
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,480
even though I live next door.

721
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,559
Can I have a word?

722
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:35,880
Come in.

723
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,079
I was just at the shopping mall
and I saw Nut.

724
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,199
At first, I thought you were with him.

725
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,599
But then I saw

726
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,320
that he was with Tofu.

727
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,719
Just the two of them.

728
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,880
I see.

729
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,519
Tofu went to Nut's office this morning
to bring him some stuff.

730
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,079
Tofu doesn't know his way around Bangkok.

731
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,559
I guess Nut will bring him home later.

732
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,119
They must have gone shopping
on the way home.

733
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:06,280
I see. They really care for each other.

734
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,119
That's normal for people
who live under the same roof.

735
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,679
They must care a lot for each other.

736
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,719
I saw them walking hand in hand,

737
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,000
like he's scared of losing Tofu.

738
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,039
I'm not trying to make you worry
or anything.

739
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,239
I'm just telling you what I saw.

740
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,519
If you don't believe me,

741
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:27,719
I have a video clip.

742
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,880
You've been by yourself for so many years.

743
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,760
Then Nut gets someone to care for you.

744
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,800
He seems to really like this one.

745
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,280
They seem awfully close.

746
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,159
Please excuse me.

747
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,760
It's time to feed my dog.

748
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:05,159
Wow.

749
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:06,880
Splendid.

750
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,760
Well done, Song.

751
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:13,239
Hey, Pern.

752
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,599
Get his number.

753
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:15,960
I have it already.

754
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,559
Okay. See you later.

755
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,039
Thank you very much.

756
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,719
I'll get going.

757
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,000
Goodbye.

758
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:26,880
Thank you.

759
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,880
Not to crush your dreams,

760
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,960
but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

761
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,000
I would stick to food delivery
if I were you.

762
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,719
You've taken half a day off.

763
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,920
That's income lost, customers lost.

764
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,679
I see.

765
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,760
Are you concerned about me?

766
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,719
No. I just said that
from the goodness of my heart.

767
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,480
If that's the case,

768
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,880
then thank you for your goodwill.

769
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,079
Now that I have the opportunity,

770
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,079
I want to give it a shot.

771
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:12,679
One more thing,

772
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,599
I didn't lose any customers.

773
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,920
In fact, I might even gain some.

774
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,280
I have to go now.

775
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,760
-Bye.
-See you next time.

776
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,440
If you don't get it,

777
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:29,239
don't forget to deliver our coffee.

778
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
I will.

779
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,239
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

780
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,920
Stop it.

781
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm leaving then.

782
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:40,480
See you soon.

783
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,719
No. I don't want to see you. Get lost.

784
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:49,280
Goodbye.

785
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,719
What is it, Prib?

786
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:30,039
If Juea finds out that you disappeared
to get drunk,

787
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,119
he'll kill you.

788
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,199
I'm not in the mood to work.

789
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,519
My heart is broken.

790
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,760
You are pranking me, aren't you?

791
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,920
Why didn't I know?

792
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,480
Why did no one tell me that Nut is gay?

793
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:49,559
Listen, Prib.

794
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:52,719
That's not something
you can just tell people.

795
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,679
You should notice these things yourself.

796
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:00,280
Once you find out about it,
you keep quiet.

797
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,440
People don't gossip about that.

798
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:08,000
But Gen…

799
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,719
Why did you put all this in here?

800
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,400
Will you eat it all?

801
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,599
Here.

802
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,800
This is cooked. Eat up.

803
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,639
Eat it. This one too.

804
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,639
Heartbreak won't kill you.

805
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,039
Why am I so doomed?

806
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,159
Everyone I like is gay.

807
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,599
Prib.

808
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,000
You are not doomed.

809
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,079
You're just dumb.

810
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,559
You say you like Nut,

811
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:48,920
but you've never noticed it.

812
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,639
Nut doesn't keep it a secret.

813
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:53,960
Whatever he is,

814
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,000
he doesn't hide it.

815
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,199
He just doesn't say it explicitly.

816
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,400
This thing can change, right?

817
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,039
I still have hope, don't I?

818
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,599
Are you insane?

819
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,519
It isn't a disease.

820
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,679
It doesn't just go away.

821
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,760
I know, but I want to give it a try.

822
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,719
I'm going to try.

823
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,719
I'll continue flirting with him
until he tells me to stop.

824
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,679
What is it about Nut
that you like so much?

825
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,360
So many things.

826
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:32,960
Hey, is that girl Juea's niece?

827
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:35,760
Yes. I heard she got a degree
in graphic design from Japan.

828
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,639
He hired her to do CGI on the new film.

829
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:40,840
Isn't it big-budget? Why are they
using a new graduate for the job?

830
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,800
Connections. Why else would she be hired?

831
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,039
Listen.

832
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,280
In this country,

833
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,800
you can never avoid favoritism completely.

834
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,599
Instead of gossiping about others,

835
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:59,280
do what you're paid to do.

836
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,840
Then they won't have to replace you.

837
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,559
If that's all you think about,

838
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,000
you won't go very far.

839
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,239
Here.

840
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,440
Looking to get close, are you?

841
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,280
Yes.

842
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,039
Here.

843
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:46,960
Take this.

844
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,119
I'm on my way.

845
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,159
I haven't had coffee yet.

846
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,719
Is that it?

847
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,159
Just that, and now you're in love?

848
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,239
So fickle.

849
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Exactly.

850
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:38,119
What the…

851
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,079
You again?

852
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,960
Our fates must be connected.
We've run into each other twice today.

853
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:54,760
Is this

854
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,400
destiny?

855
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,000
What?

856
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,599
Destiny, my ass.

857
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,679
It's more like Final Destination.

858
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,679
Stop being so corny. I don't want to puke.

859
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,599
What are you doing here?

860
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,760
I was delivering food
to a customer nearby.

861
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,719
I saw you sitting here, so I came over.

862
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
Are you a drug addict? A gambler?

863
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,039
Why do you work so much?

864
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,880
I'm earning an honest living.

865
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,440
Hello?

866
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,480
Can we get back to my problem?

867
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm still here.

868
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,320
Don't start on your issues yet.

869
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,480
Goodness.

870
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,719
Whatever you want to vent,

871
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,880
let it all out.

872
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,679
Once you're done, I'm leaving.

873
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,840
This kid annoys me.

874
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,360
Hey. Why are you being so mean?

875
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,000
When I'm with you, my heart is warm.

876
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,280
It's like being with an elderly relative.

877
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,599
Please pay attention to me.

878
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,320
Please listen to me.

879
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,000
What I want to say is,

880
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,559
Nut cares about me.

881
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:58,639
I can tell.

882
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,480
You can tell, can you? Dream on.

883
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,039
You're deluding yourself, idiot.

884
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:06,719
I'm not deluding myself.
He really cares about me.

885
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,360
That's totally fine.

886
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,519
You should cling to hope.

887
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,000
True love can be conquered with effort.

888
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,760
Good luck. You can do it.

889
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,719
Back off.

890
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,039
Back off.

891
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,360
Don't encourage her.

892
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,679
You'll cause me more problems.

893
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,800
Get your own.

894
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,920
Why is he doing this to me?

895
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
Prib.

896
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,000
See? Now, it's my problem.

897
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:43,760
-Why?
-Got you.

898
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,920
If your old bones are too weak, step back.
I can handle her.

899
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:52,119
Fine. If you want
to take her yourself, go ahead.

900
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,920
-Whoa.
-Hey.

901
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,000
Hey, don't ignore me.

902
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,360
Hey.

903
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,519
Don't ignore me.

904
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,239
Hang on.

905
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,400
Carry her to the car.

906
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,360
I will

907
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,440
drive her home.

908
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,679
Okay?

909
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,679
I'm going.

910
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,559
Thank you for buying me all this stuff.

911
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,880
I promise

912
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,880
I'll use them with care.

913
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,480
I'll keep them in good condition.

914
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,400
I hope so.

915
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,639
When you tried the clothes on,

916
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:48,760
you nearly tore them.

917
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:50,840
It was still new to me.

918
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:54,000
I've memorized everything you taught me.

919
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:58,079
Showering, brushing my teeth, washing.

920
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,599
I can put on my underwear
and zip myself up now.

921
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,800
I'll dress well

922
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,679
and smell good,

923
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,280
so you'll like me.

924
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,199
I didn't tell you to do those things
to appease me.

925
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,119
But I can't stand

926
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:17,679
seeing you so filthy.

927
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,239
I'll make you like me.

928
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,440
You're giving me a headache.

929
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:26,639
You have a headache?

930
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:29,000
I'll get you a pill.

931
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,599
Give me that.

932
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,239
Are you back already?

933
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,480
Were you lying the whole time?

934
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:13,480
You never took the pills.

935
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,039
That's why you're not better.

936
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,239
It has been four years.

937
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,559
You've been like this for four years, Mom.

938
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,679
The doctor said I was fine.

939
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,239
Why don't you believe me?

940
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:32,320
Nut noticed that I have trouble sleeping.

941
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,920
Sometimes,

942
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,159
I fall asleep on a chair waiting for him
when he comes home late.

943
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,440
He must have been worried

944
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:42,719
about my health.

945
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,039
Do you think so too?

946
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,400
My son must be right.

947
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,320
When I asked my husband to come with me,

948
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,480
he didn't say anything.

949
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,960
Your son must be worried about you,

950
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:04,840
so he wanted you to see me.

951
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,760
Maybe.

952
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,320
You were worried too, weren't you?

953
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,760
Well,

954
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,000
I'll prescribe you some medicine

955
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:18,920
to help you sleep.

956
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,119
Thank you.

957
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,039
Mom, if you really are fine,

958
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,360
why did the doctor give you these?

959
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,400
You're sick,

960
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:35,320
but you refuse to accept it.

961
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,719
Nut noticed that I have trouble sleeping.

962
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,239
Sometimes,

963
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,239
I fall asleep on a chair waiting for him
when he comes home late.

964
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,960
He must have been worried about my health.

965
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:51,000
He said that I have lost weight,

966
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,280
that I didn't seem as energetic.

967
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:55,920
Do you think so too?

968
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:03,039
Your mother has schizophrenia.

969
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,960
It's a psychological disorder.

970
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,400
Your mother's case is rare.

971
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,480
She experiences auditory
and visual hallucinations,

972
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,239
seeing things that aren't real.

973
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:15,400
What causes it?

974
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,920
It could be genetic.

975
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,960
However, if there's no family history,

976
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,039
it might have come from trauma.

977
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,679
Perhaps your mother was mentally frail

978
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,719
and came under intense pressure.

979
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,320
That could have caused this condition.

980
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:39,159
In the past, has your mother ever suffered
any particularly severe trauma?

981
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:42,519
She had a tough time when my dad died.

982
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,119
She was really upset.

983
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,559
Maybe that's why she sees him.

984
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:49,320
That could very well be the case.

985
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:54,559
Your mother's condition is linked
to something that happened in the past.

986
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,440
When the chemicals in the brain
go haywire,

987
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:00,760
the brain becomes unable
to process everything.

988
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:04,280
When her subconscious takes over,

989
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:08,719
she thinks she sees
what she feels subconsciously.

990
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,559
What can I do, doctor?

991
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:14,280
You don't have to worry.

992
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,480
I'll write a prescription for your mother
to take for a few weeks.

993
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,960
Her condition should start to improve.

994
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:23,559
I'll make another appointment
and we'll see how she's doing then.

995
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,599
Thank you.

996
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,719
Take these pills.

997
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,679
If you forget, call me.

998
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:35,280
I won't forget.

999
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,840
I'll have your dad remind me. Don't worry.

1000
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:44,480
Mom.

1001
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,480
I'm exhausted.

1002
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,119
I'm trying to help you

1003
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,400
to make things better.

1004
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,159
Why are you doing this?

1005
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,639
You're not helping me at all.

1006
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,719
I don't want to take them.

1007
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,480
Why not?

1008
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,840
I'm leaving, Mom.

1009
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:22,559
Don't forget these.

1010
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,440
I won't forget.

1011
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,239
I remember everything,
which pills to take, when, and how many.

1012
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,400
I also remember
that you're coming home late tonight.

1013
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,119
Okay then. I'm off to work now.

1014
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:38,840
Take your lunchbox.

1015
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,639
Dad?

1016
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,519
Where has he gone? He's never home.

1017
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,239
I don't want to lose your dad.

1018
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,320
If I take the pills, I won't see him.

1019
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,000
Mom, will you stop lying to yourself?

1020
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,960
Dad is no longer with us.

1021
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,280
He is dead.

1022
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,639
No.

1023
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:18,480
Dad is dead, Mom.

1024
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,280
No! He's with me. He's here.

1025
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,760
Nut, can you go easy on her?

1026
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,199
He is here with me every day.

1027
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,239
You don't believe me.

1028
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,920
I won't put up with this.

1029
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,000
If you don't take these pills,

1030
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:44,559
I'll take you to see the doctor

1031
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,880
for an alternative treatment.

1032
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,960
I won't go.

1033
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:49,800
-Yes, you will!
-I won't go!

1034
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,079
Yes, you will!

1035
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:53,920
Please calm down, Nut. You're scaring her.

1036
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,679
I won't go.

1037
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,679
If you want to stay this way,
then do as you please.

1038
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,480
I don't give a damn anymore.

1039
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,840
I'm sorry, Nut.

1040
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,000
I can't let go of your dad.

1041
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,239
Are you hungry?

1042
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:07,439
Hello?

1043
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,079
Will you…

1044
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,039
Please

1045
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,960
call Matana

1046
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:17,359
for me.

1047
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,399
I'm sorry.

1048
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,239
You got the wrong number.

1049
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,399
Are you all right?

1050
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:29,359
Who's calling?

1051
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,119
Madam?

1052
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,479
Madam?

1053
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:39,279
Hurry up.

1054
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,880
Quick. I'll go to the other side.

1055
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,880
Hurry.

1056
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,399
Go carefully. You drive.

1057
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,520
Thank you again for bringing her here.

1058
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,079
You're welcome.

1059
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:06,319
Well…

1060
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,079
This is Sibmeun.

1061
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,039
We're twins.

1062
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,039
Hello.

1063
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:13,479
Hello.

1064
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,000
When you called, he was with me.

1065
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,319
He helped carry you to the hospital.

1066
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:22,439
Thank you so much.

1067
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,399
I bought this for you.

1068
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,680
Thank you,

1069
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,720
but we couldn't finish the apples
you bought yesterday.

1070
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,840
My grandmother can't really chew on them.

1071
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,560
Na.

1072
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,359
Saen didn't buy them for me.

1073
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,640
Hello.

1074
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:02,880
You're awake.

1075
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,359
I am.

1076
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,199
I brought you some apples.

1077
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,520
Saen also brought us some apples.

1078
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,640
What a coincidence.

1079
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:51,159
Where are you?

1080
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,600
Mrs. Na.

1081
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,439
Where are you?

1082
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,279
Saen?

1083
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:11,239
Why are there two Mr. Saens?

1084
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:23,640
You changed the photo.

1085
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,199
Yes, I did.

1086
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,239
I saw her with it the other day.

1087
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,880
Mom.

1088
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,479
I pretended not to notice.

1089
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:44,560
I was biding my time.

1090
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:50,039
How could you do this to me?

1091
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:52,319
How could you do this to me?

1092
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,119
I could do even more!

1093
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,479
It's time to accept

1094
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,279
that Uncle Saen is not Dad!

1095
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:02,119
No. You're lying to me. I'm not listening.

1096
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:03,720
Listen to me!

1097
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,119
Uncle Saen is not Dad!

1098
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,760
Do you hear me?

1099
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,760
Which one is your dad then?

1100
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,800
Mom.

1101
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,680
Mom.

1102
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:25,279
Nut.

1103
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,520
Mom.

1104
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:31,960
Mom!

1105
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:34,479
Mom, come out!

1106
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,520
Mom!

1107
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,199
-Mrs. Na.
-Mom, come out!

1108
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,399
Mom!

1109
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,720
Mom!

1110
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,720
Mom!

1111
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:53,880
Mom!

1112
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:55,479
Mrs. Na, are you okay?

1113
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,159
Come with me.

1114
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,800
This is your fault.

1115
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,720
It's all your fault!

1116
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:11,119
How dare you ask Mom that question?

1117
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:13,720
Do you realize what you said?

1118
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,039
I only asked which one
was the real Mr. Saen.

1119
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,479
The one that was your dad.

1120
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,560
How dare you ask that question?

1121
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,399
I only have one dad.

1122
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:28,319
Remember, I only have one dad!

1123
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,920
Hey, wait.

1124
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,680
I heard Na screaming. What's going on?

1125
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,880
I don't know.

1126
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:36,359
Whose car is that?

1127
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,600
Excuse me.

1128
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,520
I came to see Nut.
Why are you gathering here?

1129
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,239
We…

1130
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:47,880
Remember, I only have one dad.

1131
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:49,680
-Nut?
-Hey.

1132
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:53,279
Hold on.

1133
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:54,279
Don't go in.

1134
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:57,239
Trespassing is under Section 362.

1135
01:17:57,319 --> 01:17:59,399
Trespassing without permission

1136
01:17:59,479 --> 01:18:00,800
can incur a year in jail.

1137
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,479
Or a fine of up to 20,000 baht.

1138
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,039
Or both jail time and a fine.

1139
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:05,239
-Got that?
-Got it?

1140
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,199
You shouldn't go in.

1141
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,920
Nut.

1142
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,920
What are you doing?

1143
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,039
-Let go!
-What's wrong?

1144
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:16,560
How dare you?

1145
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,199
Let go of me!

1146
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:19,239
Let go of me!

1147
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,640
No, I won't.

1148
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:22,000
What's happening?

1149
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:23,239
Wait.

1150
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:26,199
Take him away.
Talking now won't help. Go on.

1151
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,920
-Let me go!
-Take him.

1152
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,079
Let's go upstairs.

1153
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:31,159
I said let go of me.

1154
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,239
My goodness. Are you hurt?

1155
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:39,039
Tofu.

1156
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:41,159
What has gotten into you?

1157
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:42,840
-Move!
-No.

1158
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,840
Get out of my way!

1159
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,399
Will you calm the hell down?

1160
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:47,319
Calm down.

1161
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:48,640
How can I calm down?

1162
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,479
Didn't you hear? He was insinuating
that my mom had an affair.

1163
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,680
Would you let him off?

1164
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,199
Well, did she?

1165
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,439
-You.
-Hit me then.

1166
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:01,319
If hitting me will help you calm down,
go ahead and do it.

1167
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,920
Go on, hit me.

1168
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:13,439
If you're so sure

1169
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,239
that your mom is not like that,

1170
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,359
why are you getting so angry?

1171
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,920
Even you, her son,

1172
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,520
have doubts.

1173
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:25,159
Why are you getting angry with him?

1174
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,920
He has no right

1175
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,479
to question my mom like that.

1176
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,760
Who does he think he is

1177
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,640
to poke his nose into our business?

1178
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:37,159
If you had seen

1179
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,520
how my mom went mad after what he said,

1180
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:41,680
you wouldn't side with him.

1181
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:50,760
Do you really think it's Tofu's fault
that your mom is like that?

1182
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:52,920
Isn't it because of you?

1183
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:56,079
You wanted her
to come to terms with the truth,

1184
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,000
that's why you're doing this.

1185
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:02,239
Before you lay blame on other people,

1186
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:04,399
why don't you ask yourself

1187
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,600
who it is that's causing her
the most distress.

1188
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:29,119
Why?

1189
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:33,720
If Mom didn't love Dad,

1190
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,239
why did they get married?

1191
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,319
Nut shouldn't have done that.

1192
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,560
You two could have talked it out.

1193
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:32,279
He's very worried about his mom.

1194
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,319
What actually happened?

1195
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,079
Na seems to be in good health these days.

1196
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,039
What made her scream like that?

1197
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,600
It's because she saw this photo.

1198
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,359
I don't understand

1199
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,000
why there are two Mr. Saens.

1200
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,880
They're not two Mr. Saens.

1201
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:08,640
If you want to know,
I'll tell you about it.

1202
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,520
Come in.

1203
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,159
Mr. Saen?

1204
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:44,279
That's right.

1205
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,199
That's Saen, my husband.

1206
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:53,479
Does that mean--

1207
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,159
Na's husband is not Saen.

1208
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,880
He's Sibmeun,

1209
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,840
Saen's identical twin.

1210
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:10,000
These are photos from our wedding.

1211
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:23,920
I met Saen 30 years ago.

1212
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,560
At the time, my father
was expanding his business.

1213
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:31,159
Saen was an engineer
working on the new factory.

1214
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:34,439
My father asked me to manage the factory.

1215
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,560
That's how I met him.

1216
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,119
Come in.

1217
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,880
You called me. Is something wrong?

1218
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,079
Do you want the plans changed?

1219
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,439
I want to introduce you to someone.

1220
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,239
Hello, Mr. Saen.

1221
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,720
My name is Sajjaree.

1222
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,319
You can call me Jan.

1223
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,279
Nice to meet you.

1224
01:23:59,319 --> 01:24:01,680
Jan is my daughter.

1225
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,159
She has recently graduated.

1226
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,720
She will manage
the new factory we are building.

1227
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,560
In the future, if you have any issues,

1228
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,479
you can contact Jan directly.

1229
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,760
My father speaks very highly of you.

1230
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:18,239
I hope to receive
useful guidance from you.

1231
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,800
Me too.

1232
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:27,399
After that, we saw each other every day.

1233
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,359
We were attached at the hip.

1234
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,720
Saen taught me many things.

1235
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:34,159
He gave me advice on all kinds of things.

1236
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,720
Maybe because we were so similar.

1237
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,279
We shared many interests.

1238
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,720
With us joining forces, it wasn't long
before the factory was built.

1239
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:56,479
Thank you.

1240
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,479
I have many more projects

1241
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,079
that I would like you to help with.

1242
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,840
What's going on?

1243
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,560
I'm trying to convince Saen

1244
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,920
to stay on to help us manage the factory.

1245
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:15,840
The factory is already built.
What else do you want Mr. Saen to do?

1246
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:17,520
To be a stakeholder.

1247
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,760
Or do you want more?

1248
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,279
To tell you the truth,

1249
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,720
if you agree to work for us

1250
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,840
I'm willing to pay you
any salary you like.

1251
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,479
I admit

1252
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,399
that I was quite taken with him.

1253
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,359
Wasn't he dating Mrs. Na at the time?

1254
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:43,479
Yes.

1255
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:50,039
I wasn't aware that Saen
already had a girlfriend.

1256
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:54,239
After that,

1257
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:57,000
Saen resigned from his job

1258
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:00,279
and took a job
as assistant manager at our factory.

1259
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:04,439
I always thought he was single.

1260
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,399
I only found out later

1261
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:08,039
that he was dating Na.

1262
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,000
The first time I met her

1263
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,279
was when I came to Bangkok
for a seminar with Saen.

1264
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,439
Na.

1265
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,760
This is Jan, Mr. Sakon's daughter
that I told you about.

1266
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,439
Jan, this is Na,

1267
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,680
my girlfriend.

1268
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,199
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1269
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:39,640
A pleasure to meet you too.

1270
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:43,279
Have you eaten?

1271
01:26:44,119 --> 01:26:44,960
No.

1272
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:48,800
Na was pretty and very polite.

1273
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,600
While Saen was smart and kind.

1274
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:54,680
They were a perfect match.

1275
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:59,560
If they had married,
they would have had a happy life.

1276
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,079
Then what happened?

1277
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,439
How come he ended up marrying you?

1278
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,119
You think

1279
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,760
that I stole Saen from Na, don't you?

1280
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,560
I…

1281
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,880
This dish

1282
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:22,640
is really delicious.

1283
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,319
I'm returning this to you.

1284
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,159
What do you mean?

1285
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:28,920
Why won't Mom accept the truth?

1286
01:27:29,399 --> 01:27:30,920
Some truths

1287
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:33,359
are not easy to accept.

1288
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,800
Na.

1289
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:37,960
Excuse me.

1290
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,840
Mr. Saen?

1291
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,319
I used to think
that you might be a relative,

1292
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:44,279
even a sibling.

1293
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,199
But Neung's father doesn't know you.

1294
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:48,800
So, you're not their family.

1295
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:51,560
If I had a loving father like you,

1296
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,680
my mom and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

1297
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,920
If we could see the future,

1298
01:27:57,159 --> 01:27:59,359
no one would ever make a mistake.

1299
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:01,359
