1
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:52,802
NEW YORK

2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:10,069
I know that it's a lot of money.

3
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,822
Please believe me,

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,492
I'll pay back every single dime.

5
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,204
Please.

6
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,872
I…

7
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,124
I really need it.

8
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,876
Please. I'm begging you.

9
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,133
What!

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,595
So you'll let Rachel go blind?

11
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,212
Am I going to be blind?

12
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,805
No, honey.

13
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,850
I'll never let that happen.

14
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,227
You'll have a surgery.

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,355
And you'll be able to see like before.

16
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,815
Don't worry.

17
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,782
Hi, Ruja. It's me, Wichai.

18
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,992
Your dad's friend.

19
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
Remember me?

20
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,790
There's something important
I need to tell you.

21
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,419
I think you should come back to Thailand.

22
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,757
How did you find me?

23
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,756
Don't…

24
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,967
Don't go back!

25
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,395
Ruja.

26
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,899
We're here.

27
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,525
Let's get inside.

28
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,700
CHIANG MAI

29
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,818
Grandma's house is so big.

30
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,693
What's this room, mommy?

31
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,486
Dining room, honey.

32
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,278
Let's go.

33
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,451
Mommy, are we moving here?

34
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,163
No.

35
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
We're here just for a few days.

36
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
Hi, Da.

37
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,138
Welcome home, ma'am.

38
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,896
This is Rachel, my daughter.

39
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,189
Ruja.

40
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,942
Come to the studio with me.

41
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,237
Da can look after Rachel.

42
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,115
Now?

43
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,409
Yes. I'll have to leave soon.

44
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,202
It won't take long.

45
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,380
Can you stay with Da? I'll be right back.

46
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,841
But I want to come with you.

47
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,595
Kids are not allowed
in the studio, Rachel.

48
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,306
Stay here with me.

49
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,393
I'll show you your bedroom upstairs.
Want to see it?

50
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,900
Come on.

51
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,443
Wait.

52
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,654
Rachel has eye problems.

53
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,907
Please be very careful.

54
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,117
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,453
Let's go.

56
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,280
Ruja.

57
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,669
Come in.

58
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:29,248
Look here, Portrait of a Beauty,
Number One and Number Two.

59
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:46,140
Your father painted them
over 20 years ago.

60
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,187
Painting Number One
was sold to one of his fans for…

61
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,772
several million.

62
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,277
But it was returned to this studio…

63
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,908
because…

64
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,542
the owner killed all his family members
and then killed himself.

65
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,420
He left a note under the painting.

66
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,130
It said…

67
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,384
''I'm returning you to your creator.''

68
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,473
So, we got it back for free.

69
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,938
As for Number Two,
Pakorn kept it in good condition.

70
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,523
Said it wasn't for sale.

71
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,233
But now,

72
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,862
a millionaire is willing to pay a fortune

73
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,656
to buy both of them.

74
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,325
I need your permission first.

75
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,785
When will we get the money?

76
00:13:55,167 --> 00:14:00,130
Are you not even going to ask
how your father died?

77
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,432
Yummy, Rachel?

78
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,934
Yummy.

79
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,897
Let me ask you something.

80
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,067
How's your grandma Vipa doing?

81
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,736
Grandma died, from cancer.

82
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,323
Did she?

83
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,202
She didn't hang herself?

84
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,414
Pakorn, your father…

85
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,168
hung himself here.

86
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,880
From that beam.

87
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,224
What is "hang herself?"

88
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,813
Never mind. Forget it.

89
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,026
Forgive him, Ruja.

90
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,697
Think of these expensive paintings

91
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,866
as his redemption.

92
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,452
Are we done?

93
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,288
I want to get out of here.

94
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,691
Rachel, where're you going?

95
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234
I want to see mommy.

96
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,616
Where did you get that?

97
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,912
You gave it to me just now.

98
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,879
Let me have it back.

99
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,757
I'll wash it for you first.

100
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,346
You wait for your mommy here.
She'll be back soon.

101
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,639
One more thing.

102
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,392
The paintings have some cracks.

103
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,355
I want them fixed before we sell them.

104
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,193
My son is an art restorer,
he can take care of it.

105
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,737
If you think it's necessary, do it.

106
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,366
One more thing…

107
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,537
After his funeral,

108
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,165
I want to sell this house too.

109
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,001
Please see to it for me.

110
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,185
Mommy?

111
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,468
Rachel!

112
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,181
What are you doing?

113
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,060
Please don't hold it against me!

114
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,473
Mommy…

115
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,812
Grandpa's paintings. Why can't I see them?

116
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,607
They're scary.

117
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,233
How scary?

118
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:41,198
So scary that you'll have nightmares.

119
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,867
You don't like nightmares, do you?

120
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,414
Aren't you scared, mommy?

121
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,135
Why does dad paint you like that?

122
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,305
It's just an act.

123
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,016
Like in a play.

124
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,853
It helped dad create nice paintings.

125
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,608
But you cried.

126
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,406
It's nothing, Ruja.

127
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,078
But you must not go
into dad's studio again.

128
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,831
He needs to focus on his work.

129
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,458
Promise me, dear.

130
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,579
I miss your grandma, honey.

131
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,512
Don't cry, mommy.

132
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,725
Don't cry.

133
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,214
Rachel.

134
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,387
Rachel.

135
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,516
Mommy.

136
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,661
Mommy.

137
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,250
Mommy!

138
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,043
Rachel!

139
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,461
Rachel.

140
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,383
Rachel.

141
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,555
Rachel.

142
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,059
Rachel.

143
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,858
Rachel.

144
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,114
Rachel.

145
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:55,994
Rachel!

146
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,078
Rachel!

147
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,834
What's going on?

148
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,336
Have you seen Rachel?

149
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,420
Rachel.

150
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,463
Rachel.

151
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,590
Rachel!

152
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,175
Rachel!

153
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,551
Rachel!

154
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,178
Rachel.

155
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,846
Rachel.

156
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,889
Da.

157
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,226
Let's split up.

158
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,770
I'll look in the forest.

159
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:23,939
Rachel!

160
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,232
Rachel!

161
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,786
Rachel!

162
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,998
Rachel!

163
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,459
Rachel!

164
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
Rachel!

165
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,896
Rachel!

166
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,401
Are you in there?

167
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:17,993
Rachel!

168
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,959
Rachel!

169
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,636
Rachel!

170
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,097
I'm not playing with you!

171
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,435
Come out now!

172
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,239
Rachel!

173
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,785
Rachel!

174
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,675
Rachel!

175
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,653
Where were you? You scared me to death.

176
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,323
I took a walk and I met him.

177
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,492
Are you Ruja?

178
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,827
My name's Tim.

179
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,747
I'm here to fix the paintings,
my dad must have told you.

180
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,253
Where did you go for a walk?

181
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,884
Tell me where.

182
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,303
By the stream back there.

183
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,267
It's dangerous.

184
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,020
Don't do it again.

185
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,981
What would I do
if something happened to you?

186
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,608
I wasn't alone.

187
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,320
I went with the woman with a red scarf.

188
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,404
Stop lying.

189
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,448
I'm not lying.

190
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,491
Rachel.

191
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,501
I'm sorry.

192
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,005
Please don't do it again.

193
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,219
I'm sorry, honey.

194
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,156
Here.

195
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,115
Thank you.

196
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,996
Da,

197
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,916
what happened to your ankle?

198
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,003
Just a sprain. Nothing serious.

199
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,595
Excuse me.

200
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,473
What were you doing in the woods?

201
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,392
I paint landscapes.

202
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,604
My dad said there's a beautiful stream
behind the house.

203
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,565
So I went to look.

204
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,734
And luckily, I bumped into Rachel.

205
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,987
Rachel has eye problems.

206
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,573
It's not safe for her to wander around.

207
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,366
I see.

208
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,076
But thank you anyway.

209
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,954
Look…

210
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,207
I'll show you my sketches.

211
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,211
Even better, I'll draw you.

212
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,595
You don't have to please her.

213
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,930
It's okay. I really want to draw her.

214
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,223
Here we go.

215
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,663
Done.

216
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,666
Want to see it?

217
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,089
It's ugly.

218
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,636
I think it's pretty.

219
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,471
How about this?

220
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,225
Next time I'll draw you
like a princess. Okay?

221
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,561
I'm sorry.

222
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,357
How long will it take
to fix the paintings?

223
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,361
I need to see them
before I can answer that.

224
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,615
But I've heard the damages
are minor. Right?

225
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,678
Mommy, when will the rain stop?
I want to play outside.

226
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,305
Rachel.

227
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,517
Listen to mommy.

228
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:50,064
From now on, when you want to go outside
you have to ask me first.

229
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,108
Understand?

230
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,236
Can I go with Tim?

231
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,071
No, you can't.

232
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,782
But I like him.

233
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,496
I want him to draw my picture.

234
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:07,790
Ruja.

235
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,041
Tim.

236
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,668
Hi, Rachel.

237
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,795
How's it going?

238
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,175
Let me talk to your mommy for a second.

239
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,345
You should come see
something in the studio.

240
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,891
Can I come too?

241
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,271
Whatever it is,
you don't need my permission.

242
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,356
It's not about the restoration.

243
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,359
Believe me, you have to see it.

244
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,204
This.

245
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,962
I had no idea it was this bad.

246
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,423
Look at these cracks.

247
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,350
What's the matter?

248
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,230
Nothing.

249
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,325
What are you doing?

250
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,079
You'll ruin it even more.

251
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,915
I have to fix it anyway, right?

252
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,900
Put it back right now.

253
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,906
Don't you want to see what's underneath?

254
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,241
No.

255
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:09,078
It could be a big discovery,

256
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,873
may raise the value
of your father's paintings artistically--

257
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,918
I don't care. Okay? Put it back.

258
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,132
You should care.

259
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,759
If you want to sell it.

260
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,474
Or…

261
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,186
Do you think it's haunted?

262
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,859
Nonsense.

263
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,153
I'm kidding.

264
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,616
But I don't get it.

265
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,580
People always think of ghosts
when they see unexpected things.

266
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,249
But everything can be explained.

267
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,960
Listen…

268
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,379
You know the Mona Lisa?

269
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,009
You do.

270
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,389
They say when you lock your eyes with hers

271
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:15,394
her gaze will follow you
no matter where you walk in the room.

272
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,646
But it has nothing to do with ghosts.

273
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,899
The same with this painting.

274
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,901
Let's test it.

275
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,339
See for yourself
so you'll stop being afraid.

276
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
Let's try.

277
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,098
Look her in the eyes.

278
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,268
And walk this way.

279
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,920
Is she following you?

280
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,049
See? I told you.

281
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,195
What's wrong?

282
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,034
Just fix the damn thing.

283
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,680
Is this your dress, mommy?

284
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,516
Can I try it on?

285
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,479
Da!

286
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,981
You shouldn't let her play
with dirty clothes!

287
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,317
Burn them all. Come here.

288
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:16,594
Rachel.

289
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,637
Are you okay?

290
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,942
There's someone under the bed.

291
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,909
It's just you and me here.

292
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,587
Fine.

293
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,466
I'll look.

294
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,381
Mommy, I can't see.

295
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,725
Rachel!

296
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:32,646
Rachel!

297
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,607
Rachel.

298
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,029
Rachel.

299
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,489
Rachel.

300
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,588
Ruja! What's the matter?

301
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,881
Get me out of here.

302
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,717
-What's wrong?
-Just get me out of here!

303
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,093
It's pouring outside.

304
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,387
But I need to get out of here!

305
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,055
You have to help me!

306
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,182
Calm down.

307
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,558
Take it easy.

308
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,987
Have some tea.

309
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,044
Rachel.

310
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,050
This anklet has a magical power.

311
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,260
I'm giving it to you.

312
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,769
Let me put it on.

313
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,735
It came from a tribal village
in the hills.

314
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,239
They believe that
if you walk around wearing it,

315
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,158
the jingling sound can chase away demons.

316
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,701
Try it.

317
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,347
Thank you for the anklet.

318
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,564
You can paint, right?

319
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:42,025
How come you chose to be a restorer?

320
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,029
It pays well, so why not?

321
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,327
I wanted to be an artist.

322
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,582
Even had an exhibition once.

323
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,209
All my paintings were sold out.

324
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,966
Because my dad hired people
to buy them up.

325
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,053
It made me realize

326
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,724
that I could never
run away from his shadow.

327
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,852
So I decided to work with him instead.

328
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,191
I'm no different.

329
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,614
You're doing it for your daughter.

330
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,909
I'm sure Rachel is so proud of you.

331
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,837
Rachel likes you a lot.

332
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,672
I know.

333
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,883
Because I'm handsome.

334
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,578
Sorry, honey.

335
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,708
We have to go.

336
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,196
Tim.

337
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,489
Ruja.

338
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,414
I was about to come and get you.
You have to see this.

339
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,626
I don't want to go in there.
The rain's stopped, let just go.

340
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,170
Take a look first and then we can leave.

341
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,968
I don't want Rachel to go in there.

342
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,933
It's okay. I'm here with you.

343
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,562
Just a quick look.

344
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,993
Don't look.

345
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,913
Wait for me here.

346
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,792
Don't look at the paintings.

347
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,127
Promise?

348
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,170
Promise.

349
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,254
Good girl.

350
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,810
Did you rip it off?

351
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,396
I'm sorry.

352
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,650
I really wanted to know what's underneath.

353
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,780
You know what? This man--

354
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,032
Was the one who committed suicide.

355
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,950
How do you know?

356
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,452
You father told me.

357
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,045
I've been wondering
why he did what he did.

358
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,092
If we peel off the whole thing,
we might know the truth.

359
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,136
There is no truth whatsoever!

360
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,056
And it's none of my business.

361
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,351
Get me and my daughter out of here now!

362
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,505
Rachel!

363
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,638
Rachel!

364
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,892
Rachel!

365
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,310
Rachel!

366
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,062
Rachel!

367
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,898
Rachel!

368
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,067
Where are you?

369
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,318
Rachel!

370
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,336
Ruja.

371
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,842
Mommy.

372
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,931
Wait for me, mommy.

373
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,733
Mommy.

374
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,028
Mommy.

375
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,719
You're hurting me.

376
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,225
Da!

377
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,312
Ma'am.

378
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,314
Let her go.

379
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,651
I have no choice.

380
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,321
If I don't do it,

381
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,700
she won't leave me in peace.

382
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,287
What are you talking about?

383
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,415
Let her go right now.

384
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,292
No.

385
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,379
No. I can't! I have to do this!

386
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,423
Mommy, help me!

387
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,469
Mommy.

388
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:16,766
She's a just a kid,
she has nothing to do with this.

389
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,935
In that case…

390
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,147
you jump instead,

391
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,275
and I will let her go.

392
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,362
What are you talking about?

393
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,867
Please don't do this. I'm begging you.

394
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,244
No.

395
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,246
No.

396
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,123
I have to do it.

397
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,374
I have to!

398
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,257
Please don't hurt me.

399
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,386
I'll do anything for you.

400
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,138
Kill them all.

401
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,518
I have no choice.

402
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,562
Jump!

403
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,189
Jump!

404
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,819
Da…

405
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,321
Da.

406
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,947
Calm down, please.

407
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,073
I'm sorry.

408
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,909
I'm really sorry!

409
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,787
Help me, mommy.

410
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,332
Da!

411
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,335
Rachel!

412
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,983
Are you hurt?

413
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,302
You wait here. I'll be right back.

414
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,060
What are you doing?

415
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,687
I'm going to rip it to pieces!

416
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,813
Are you crazy?

417
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,023
It's all because of these damn paintings!

418
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,703
You think you can save me
by destroying the paintings?

419
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,290
Rachel, what's wrong with you?

420
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,926
What did you just say?

421
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,354
Rachel.

422
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,064
I'm not your fucking daughter.

423
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,863
Because of you and your evil family,

424
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,450
I have become like this!

425
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,619
Rachel.

426
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,565
Rachel!

427
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,067
Rachel!

428
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,210
Rachel!

429
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,814
Ruja.

430
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:14,707
Ruja.

431
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,086
What happened?

432
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,258
Get me and my daughter out of here.

433
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,305
What the hell's going on?

434
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,975
Please, get us out of here!

435
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,309
Boring.

436
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,938
I'll do anything…

437
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,067
to make you love me again.

438
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,447
Love?

439
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,243
How corny.

440
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,587
I can make you happy.

441
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,463
Like before.

442
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,277
Want to make me happy like before?

443
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:19,874
Rachel.

444
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,379
Don't move. It'll hurt more.

445
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:37,725
Want some?

446
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,604
Who are you?

447
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,026
Who the fuck are you?

448
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,663
Your mother was sexy.

449
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,958
Where's Rachel?

450
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,183
An artist's party can get pretty wild.

451
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,752
Tell me about these paintings.

452
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,423
Okay.

453
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,926
I'll tell you.

454
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,930
But promise me you won't hurt me.

455
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,518
Okay.

456
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,149
After that night's party…

457
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:16,115
Pakorn picked only two close friends
to stay for the real highlight.

458
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,660
Prang, his favorite model,

459
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,664
was a surprise he'd prepared for them.

460
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:28,461
Pakorn wanted the two guests
to take part in his artistic creation.

461
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,964
He's the first one who died,

462
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,344
along with his entire family.

463
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,440
Your son's lighter is actually cool.

464
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:46,455
Tim!

465
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,250
Tim!

466
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,508
Don't hurt me.

467
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,387
Tell me what you want!

468
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,347
I'll give you everything.

469
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,393
Just let me go.

470
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,186
Apologize to my mother.

471
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,347
Mom.

472
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,062
Mom, look at this.

473
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,453
Ruja.

474
01:12:16,081 --> 01:12:17,332
Listen to me.

475
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:19,877
Prang…

476
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,087
and her son

477
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,632
are bad people.

478
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,054
They are a ghost-worshipping hill-tribe.

479
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,972
They hurt your dad.

480
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,682
They hurt me.

481
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,351
And they will hurt you.

482
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,395
Ruja.

483
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,149
Ruja.

484
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,318
Ruja.

485
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:46,111
Ruja!

486
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:47,988
Listen to me.

487
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:53,577
We must not let them hurt us.

488
01:12:56,747 --> 01:13:02,086
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

489
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,464
Repeat after me.

490
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:12,012
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

491
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:16,767
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

492
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,562
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

493
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:51,301
You really didn't see it, Ruja?

494
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:24,520
Mom!

495
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,779
Dad, help mom!

496
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,116
Help her!

497
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,037
Dad, help her!

498
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,666
You'll be okay.

499
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,338
Somebody, help my mom.

500
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,592
Please, help my mom.

501
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,112
I still don't get it…

502
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:21,201
why dad didn't help mom that night.

503
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,747
But I knew

504
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,084
there's someone who could.

505
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,421
It's you, Ruja.

506
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,726
Help my mom, Ruja!

507
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,106
Help my mom!

508
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:01,325
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

509
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:06,288
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

510
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:10,959
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

511
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,393
I told you to stay away when I'm working.
Is that hard to understand?

512
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,478
Idiot!

513
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:34,900
Ruja.

514
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,611
Help, please.

515
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,577
Help my mom, Ruja.

516
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,621
You fucking idiot!

517
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:49,706
Ruja.

518
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:50,999
What's wrong?

519
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,376
Ruja.

520
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,088
Help my mom, Ruja.

521
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,415
I know you saw everything.

522
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,134
But you and your mother

523
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,845
just ran away.

524
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:56,648
You know what they did to us after that?

525
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:29,723
I've been waiting
to paint your beautiful face.

526
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,979
But you're in pretty bad shape right now.

527
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:50,702
Rachel!

528
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,204
Rachel!

529
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,872
Rachel!

530
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:54,831
Rachel!

531
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:58,001
Help me, mommy.

532
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,544
I'm here, honey.

533
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,426
Rachel!

534
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,720
Mommy is right here.

535
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:12,390
Please don't hurt her.

536
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:21,525
Don't hurt her.

537
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:25,820
Hurt me instead!

538
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,823
Do it to me!

539
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,159
You never knew how it feels

540
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:34,871
seeing your loved one
being tortured and killed

541
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,917
and that you can't do anything about it.

542
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,461
You will know now.

543
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,183
I'm sorry.

544
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,104
I'm sorry.

545
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,779
I'm really sorry.

546
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,409
Sorry?

547
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:19,124
You're sorry?

548
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,304
Soon you'll be very sorry.

549
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,651
Don't touch her!

550
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:48,695
Let her go now!

551
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,847
Wichai's son is going to erase
the truth under the painting of yours.

552
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,683
I'm doing this for you, Prang.

553
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:50,173
Mommy.

554
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,894
Mommy.

555
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,564
Mommy.

556
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:14,030
Mommy.

557
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,202
Mommy!

558
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,287
Mommy!

559
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,437
Mommy.

560
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:34,402
Ruja.

561
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:40,617
We must not let them hurt us.

562
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:47,540
If we pretend not to see them,
they cannot hurt us.

563
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,998
Listen to mommy, Rachel.

564
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:17,338
We only have each other now.

565
01:26:21,217 --> 01:26:23,595
I'll protect you with my own life.

566
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,391
No one can hurt you again.

567
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,145
I promise.

568
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:49,597
ONE MONTH BEFORE
