00:02.000 --> 00:04.840
<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:04.840 --> 00:07.920
<i>Just a normal girl,</i>
<i>with a normal life.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:10.960
<i>But there's something about me</i>
<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.520
<i>Because I've got a secret.</i>

00:12.520 --> 00:15.360

00:29.520 --> 00:32.400
Your class representative
is going to be handing you

00:32.400 --> 00:35.040
a questionnaire about
your options after school.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.600
Useless! I already know what I
want to be when school is over.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.040
Rich. Because I'm already rich!

00:41.040 --> 00:43.160
And the baker girl,
well, the baker girl...

00:43.160 --> 00:44.960
Oh! Just plain ridiculous! Yes!

00:44.960 --> 00:48.080
Being ridiculous would be
right up your alley, Marinette!

00:48.080 --> 00:50.600
Chloé, people are defined
by their choices,

00:50.600 --> 00:52.160
and what they decide to do.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.000
That's why I'm asking you
to start deciding

00:55.000 --> 00:56.560
what you want to do later on.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.360
It's not just about careers,

00:58.360 --> 00:59.880
but what you want out of life.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.480
If some of you aren't sure yet

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
what you want to do,

01:02.480 --> 01:03.640
the Paris Careers Expo

01:03.640 --> 01:05.000
will be held this weekend

01:05.000 --> 01:06.520
in various locations
around the city.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.880
You'll meet professionals
who'll discuss their careers.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.800
The document includes a map
of Paris with each location.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.920
How about superhero?
Does that count as a job?

01:17.920 --> 01:20.240
I'd add that you should
never let the context

01:20.240 --> 01:23.680
impose your costume on you.
You should choose it yourself.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.920
Speaking of which, I myself
will be present at a stand as...

01:32.440 --> 01:36.760
(Panting) The Owl! Hoo hoo!
Your daily righter of wrongs.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.160
(Panting)

01:41.880 --> 01:44.160
Don't you want
to continue to model?

01:44.160 --> 01:45.920
I don't think so, Plagg.
I'm doing it

01:45.920 --> 01:47.400
because my father asked me to

01:47.640 --> 01:49.920
and I realize I don't know
what else I'd want to do.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.720
I never asked myself
that question.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.680
What do think of Cat Noir
as a career?

01:54.920 --> 01:58.680
Well, since Ladybug keeps giving
Miraculous out to other holders,

01:58.680 --> 02:00.680
one day she probably
won't need me any more.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.640
Don't worry.
I will always be here for you.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.480
Hey, if you want we could even
open a cheese shop together.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.240
Just imagine. Plagg
and Cat Noir's Fromagerie!

02:10.240 --> 02:12.680
You can't eat cheese
if you're trying to sell it!

02:12.680 --> 02:14.480
Ah, you're right, good point.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.920
What's a job where you get
to eat cheese, then?

02:16.920 --> 02:19.280
Let's start by visiting
the food-trade booths.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.680
Come on, Plagg! It's time
to think about our future.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.680
True, Tikki,
my life is complicated,

02:28.680 --> 02:30.120
but at least one thing
is simple.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.760
I know what I want to do later!

02:31.760 --> 02:33.880
No need to go
to the Careers Expo for that!

02:33.880 --> 02:35.960
What's a "career,"
dear Guardian?

02:35.960 --> 02:39.560
Well, it's your job. Something
really important that you do

02:39.560 --> 02:41.360
and gives meaning to your life!

02:41.360 --> 02:43.920
So, your job is being
the Guardian of the Miraculous!

02:43.920 --> 02:45.840
Course not,
it's being a student!

02:45.840 --> 02:48.200
Not at all!
It's making presents for Adrien!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.760
- Well --
- Something important,

02:49.760 --> 02:51.160
like crafting the doll house

02:51.160 --> 02:52.560
to hide the Miracle Box!

02:52.560 --> 02:53.840
Or when she designed the alarm

02:53.840 --> 02:55.600
for this room! A masterpiece!

02:55.600 --> 02:58.000
- Sure, I love crafting, but --
- You don't get it!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.160
What gives meaning to her life
is to love Adrien or Luka.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.720
- That's her job!
- Luka has the guitar, right?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.760
Her real career is being Ladybug
and carve her name in history

03:06.760 --> 03:08.440
by her glorious feats,
of course!

03:08.440 --> 03:11.120
Silence, kwamis!
Let's listen to the Guardian.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.240
Marinette, what is
the real important thing

03:13.240 --> 03:15.120
that will bring meaning
to your life?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.440
Argh! I don't know any more!
I guess I'm not sure

03:19.440 --> 03:21.120
what my job
should be after all!

03:21.120 --> 03:22.840
Maybe you should go visit
a few booths

03:22.840 --> 03:24.200
at the Careers Expo.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.240
I guess so, Tikki.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.560
<i>Welcome to</i>
You've Gotta Be Kidding!

03:33.560 --> 03:36.360
<i>We're live at Careers Expo,</i>
<i>where I'll be introducing you</i>

03:36.360 --> 03:39.080
<i>to the most pointless jobs</i>
<i>ever! And to start off,</i>

03:39.080 --> 03:41.760
<i>here's a perfect example.</i>
<i>André the ice-cream maker!</i>

03:41.760 --> 03:44.120
<i>The ice-cream man</i>
<i>who's never around!</i>

03:44.280 --> 03:46.840
<i>Let me remind you how this</i>
<i>goes. He doesn't have a shop,</i>

03:46.840 --> 03:49.560
<i>no one knows where he is,</i>
<i>it takes forever to find him,</i>

03:49.560 --> 03:51.960
<i>and he gets to pick the flavor</i>
<i>of your ice cream.</i>

03:52.240 --> 03:54.400
<i>You've gotta be kidding, André!</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:56.920
<i>Give me one reason why I should</i>
<i>bother to chase after you</i>

03:56.920 --> 03:58.360
<i>when I could get my choice</i>

03:58.360 --> 04:00.160
<i>of ice cream</i>
<i>in any supermarket?</i>

04:00.160 --> 04:03.280
- (Laughter)
-<i> Well, people don't just come</i>

04:03.280 --> 04:04.640
<i>for ice cream.</i>

04:04.640 --> 04:06.120
<i>They come to share their love</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:07.840
<i>and experience</i>
<i>a magical moment.</i>

04:07.840 --> 04:09.800
<i>A supermarket</i>
<i>cannot do what I do.</i>

04:10.200 --> 04:13.600
<i>I am a creator</i>
<i>of magical moments.</i>

04:13.600 --> 04:17.200
<i>"Creator of magical moments"?</i>
<i>You've Gotta be Kidding?</i>

04:17.200 --> 04:20.520
<i>- That's not a real job!</i>
<i>- You're right, dear Alec,</i>

04:20.520 --> 04:23.560
<i>it's not a job...</i>
<i>it's a career.</i>

04:23.560 --> 04:24.960
(Gasps of astonishment)

04:26.800 --> 04:28.760
Yeah, you found me today!

04:28.760 --> 04:30.760
I have some ice-cream
just for you!

04:30.760 --> 04:33.080
Lime, for the sourness
you show on the outside,

04:33.080 --> 04:35.320
and chocolate-cinnamon
for the dreams

04:35.320 --> 04:36.680
that live inside of you.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.680
One day, you too will figure out

04:38.680 --> 04:40.240
what you really want to be.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.920
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

04:45.360 --> 04:48.320
André, how did you know making
ice cream would be your job?

04:48.320 --> 04:51.680
My dear Marinette, being
an ice-cream man isn't a "job".

04:51.680 --> 04:54.440
I used to have a job.
Every morning I would wake up

04:54.440 --> 04:56.440
and do something
I didn't like doing.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.240
The only enjoyable moment
for my day

04:58.400 --> 05:00.040
was when I'd come home
and concoct

05:00.040 --> 05:02.880
ice-cream flavors
that suited my mood.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.320
Until, one day, in the same way
that ice cream enchanted

05:06.320 --> 05:09.200
my daily life, I wondered
if my true calling would

05:09.200 --> 05:11.880
be to try and enchant
other people's lives too.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.120
That's what a truly successful
career is, a blend of flavors

05:15.120 --> 05:16.960
of what you can do,
what you love to do

05:16.960 --> 05:18.240
and what you can bring
to others.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.320
Strawberry and cherry
for the indecisive lady,

05:21.320 --> 05:24.640
pistachio and pecan
for the clear-sighted young man.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
- Who? What young man?
- Hello, Marinette!

05:27.000 --> 05:30.200
Aaah! Oh! Luka! (Nervous laugh)

05:30.200 --> 05:33.600
- Luka and I are just --
- Buddies. We're buddies!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.680
You don't necessarily
have to be in love

05:35.680 --> 05:37.760
to enjoy
your own scoop of magic!

05:38.360 --> 05:40.000
- Have a good day, André!
- Have a good day!

05:41.080 --> 05:42.800
I'm surprised to see you here.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.360
I thought you already knew
your future career.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.280
I do. I'm in charge
of my school's booth,

05:47.280 --> 05:49.720
where I tell people about being
a maker of stringed instruments.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.360
What about you?
Why are you here?

05:56.640 --> 05:58.840
Aren't you well on your way
to becoming a fashion designer?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.360
I don't know any more.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.360
So many careers interest me.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.440
Fashion, creation, decoration...

06:04.800 --> 06:07.200
You're lucky you know
exactly what you want to do.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.160
I just listened
to my inner voice.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.960
(Beautiful sound)

06:12.560 --> 06:14.680
This is
the first instrument I made.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.800
- It took me two years.
- Wow!

06:17.800 --> 06:21.320
<i>Two years to make one guitar</i>
<i>when you can download an app</i>

06:21.320 --> 06:22.880
<i>in two seconds to your phone?</i>

06:23.080 --> 06:25.160
(Tinny sound)

06:28.000 --> 06:31.560
<i>Yet another pointless job!</i>
<i>You've Gotta be Kidding!</i>

06:34.640 --> 06:35.560
Follow me.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.360
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

06:46.600 --> 06:52.400
(Gentle breeze
turns into heavenly music)

06:54.800 --> 06:56.880
<i>Musical instruments</i>
<i>fill the space,</i>

06:56.880 --> 06:58.920
<i>and space</i>
<i>fills the instruments.</i>

06:59.360 --> 07:02.000
<i>No phone in the world</i>
<i>will ever be able to do that.</i>

07:04.080 --> 07:05.640
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:07.760
Again? Argh!

07:08.640 --> 07:11.960
Whoa. You definitely have a gift
for finding the right words

07:11.960 --> 07:14.000
- at the right time!
- Adrien!

07:14.240 --> 07:16.920
- Uh, well, most of the time.
- No, Adrien.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.720
- He's behind you, Marinette!
- Aaah! How far away is he?

07:19.720 --> 07:21.720
- Did he see me?
- You still haven't told him

07:21.720 --> 07:25.000
- how you feel about him, right?
- Uh, well... not...

07:25.560 --> 07:27.520
Wait. He looks sad!

07:27.520 --> 07:29.400
Just one more reason
we should go talk to him.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.080
- Something wrong, Adrien?
- I just made the rounds

07:40.080 --> 07:41.760
to every stand at the Expo,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.720
and I still don't know
what I want to do.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.520
If I don't figure it out,
my father will decide

07:45.520 --> 07:46.760
for me again.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.280
I've always felt that modeling
wasn't your true inner music.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.800
I thought
it'd be simple this way,

08:03.800 --> 08:06.200
that I'd be content
to do what my father told me to,

08:06.200 --> 08:08.320
like you, Luka, who decided
to be a musician,

08:08.320 --> 08:10.520
like your father.
Or like you.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.000
You've always known
you wanted to be a designer.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.560
- But actually...
- It's way more complicated.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.200
(Laughter)

08:20.200 --> 08:22.760
I don't want to be a rock star
like my dad. I make music,

08:22.760 --> 08:25.400
but it's not my career,
it's my nature. What I want

08:25.400 --> 08:27.720
is for other people
to be able to feel that music.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.880
That's why I want to be
a stringed-instrument maker,

08:30.160 --> 08:32.640
so people can create emotions.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.920
I feel like
I always want to try new things,

08:34.920 --> 08:38.920
but what I want to do, what I
forget to do and what I must do,

08:38.920 --> 08:41.400
it's a lot, and I don't know...

08:41.400 --> 08:43.160
My father
arranges it all for me.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.560
But if I think about what
I really, actually want to do...

08:47.320 --> 08:49.200
nothing. My mind is empty!

08:49.400 --> 08:51.360
- I'm completely lost!
- I'm completely lost!

08:51.360 --> 08:54.400
There's no one way to become
Marinette or to become Adrien.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.120
To find out who you are, learn
to listen to your inner melody.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.160
Your inner music is
a little bit like a brass band

09:02.160 --> 09:04.960
where all the instruments
are playing a different tune!

09:05.280 --> 09:08.120
- I totally get why you're lost!
- (Laughter)

09:08.120 --> 09:10.360
But if you listen
a bit more closely,

09:10.360 --> 09:12.800
the music of your band
is really beautiful.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.400
You just need some time
to understand it.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.600
Your music sounds like it's
being muffled by someone else

09:18.600 --> 09:19.920
playing a sad piano tune.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.480
But your true melody
is a happy one.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.400
Pretty rock 'n' roll, actually!

09:27.800 --> 09:30.320
You two will find
what's already in front of you,

09:30.320 --> 09:33.320
but you can't hear it clearly.
Just let the melody flow.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.400
<i>Who on earth would want</i>
<i>to disguise themselves</i>

09:50.400 --> 09:52.400
<i>with such a ridiculous</i>
<i>fake hairdo?</i>

09:52.400 --> 09:56.360
<i>Louis XIV's reign is over!</i>
<i>You've Gotta be Kidding!</i>

09:56.360 --> 09:58.400
<i>A wig is never</i>
<i>a disguise, sir.</i>

09:58.400 --> 10:01.480
<i>On the contrary, it is</i>
<i>always very revealing.</i>

10:06.920 --> 10:09.400
When I was a kid,
I used to have long hair,

10:09.560 --> 10:11.440
but everyone made fun of me.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.160
That's why I shaved it all off.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.080
<i>I've made the wrong choices</i>
<i>all my life.</i>

10:15.080 --> 10:17.480
<i>My TV show is nothing personal.</i>
<i>I make fun of people</i>

10:17.480 --> 10:19.360
<i>the way they made fun</i>
<i>of me as a kid.</i>

10:19.520 --> 10:21.360
<i>I should have been</i>
<i>who I wanted to be,</i>

10:21.360 --> 10:23.840
<i>tried to change the world</i>
<i>instead of mocking it.</i>

10:24.240 --> 10:25.960
I've wasted my life!

10:28.400 --> 10:31.800
A man who has made bad choices
because of pressure from others.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.600
A wasted life
full of regrets and bitterness.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.160
What a perfect "job"
for my akuma.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.600
Go and give that remorseful
show host a new career

10:46.600 --> 10:48.160
that he won't regret!

10:56.240 --> 10:59.440
Wishmaker, I am Shadow Moth.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.800
The world didn't let you realize
your childhood dreams?

11:02.800 --> 11:04.920
From now on,
any person you touch

11:04.920 --> 11:07.600
will have to become
who they dreamed of being

11:07.600 --> 11:09.160
when they were a child.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.560
And when you attack
Ladybug and Cat Noir,

11:11.560 --> 11:14.040
their masks will fall
as their childhood dreams

11:14.040 --> 11:15.160
betray them.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.480
From now on,
I'll only be who I want to be!

11:18.480 --> 11:20.920
And thanks to me, everyone
will finally be able to do

11:20.920 --> 11:22.320
what they've always wanted!

11:25.920 --> 11:28.440
(Screaming)

11:31.480 --> 11:33.520
- Live your childhood dream!
- When I was a kid,

11:33.520 --> 11:34.760
I wanted to be Santa!

11:36.480 --> 11:41.080
My dream's come true!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

11:41.080 --> 11:43.920
Ho, ho, ho! I've always wanted
to make people happy!

11:44.160 --> 11:46.280
Even when it's not Christmas!

11:49.720 --> 11:52.280
Hey! I love your look!
Rock 'n' roll!

11:54.400 --> 11:56.120
Live your childhood dream!

11:56.120 --> 11:58.760
I finally get to live
my childhood dream! Awesome!

12:00.640 --> 12:02.160
Aaah!

12:04.160 --> 12:07.080
- Hey! Hi there, son!
- Dad?

12:07.080 --> 12:08.400
BOTH: Jagged Stone?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.120
Merry Christmas, everyone!

12:13.760 --> 12:15.600
This is a nightmare, right?

12:16.600 --> 12:20.000
- I will turn you to mush!
- Go hide behind that tree!

12:23.760 --> 12:25.160
Stay here, Marinette!

12:25.680 --> 12:28.120
So, robot, where's this must
you were promising?

12:30.800 --> 12:34.200
I've got to protect Luka.
Quick, Tikki, spots on!

12:43.840 --> 12:46.320
- You'll be safe here.
- Thank you, Ladybug!

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Marinette!

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
(Gasps) Marinette?

12:52.080 --> 12:53.000
Huh?

12:53.640 --> 12:56.200
Help me!
I don't know how to swim!

12:56.200 --> 12:57.600
Hold on, Dad, I'm coming!

13:00.800 --> 13:04.400
I always wanted
to be Grobototek.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.040
Yeah, but we're not living
in a video game!

13:10.600 --> 13:12.880
Destroyer of dreams.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.200
He's mistaking dreams
for reality!

13:19.200 --> 13:21.160
Live your childhood dream!

13:23.040 --> 13:25.280
- Live your childhood dream!
- As a child,

13:25.280 --> 13:27.480
I wanted to be a fireman
<i>and </i>a cowboy!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.720
Whoa! I knew it was possible!

13:30.320 --> 13:32.640
- Aaah! Aaah!
- Live --

13:32.640 --> 13:34.960
Why try and stop me?
I'm making people happy!

13:34.960 --> 13:37.480
Yes, but you're doing it
against their will!

13:37.480 --> 13:39.280
I want people
to live their dreams!

13:39.280 --> 13:41.040
Would you really
call this a dream?

13:41.040 --> 13:44.520
Look! Look! I'm a cucumber!
Woohoohoo!

13:45.680 --> 13:47.440
- Aaah!
- Try it!

13:47.440 --> 13:48.720
Let me be your wishmaker!

13:50.280 --> 13:52.720
If we get hit,
we'll reveal our identities.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.560
- What do you mean?
- When I was six,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.000
I wanted to be
the Knitting Fairy.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.440
She didn't wear a mask!

13:58.720 --> 14:00.040
The Knitting Fairy? Seriously?

14:02.280 --> 14:04.480
What about you?
What did you want to be?

14:05.240 --> 14:08.120
You're making fun of me, but are
too embarrassed to tell me!

14:12.280 --> 14:15.160
Actually, I don't know what
I wanted to be when I was a kid.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.080
You probably wanted to be
a magician or a fireman.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.160
- I can't remember.
- You must've just forgotten.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.480
If he hits one of us,
we'll need a second chance!

14:30.480 --> 14:32.640
- Viperion?
- I think we need the insurance!

14:32.640 --> 14:33.880
You go. I'll cover you!

14:38.560 --> 14:40.600
But, Dad,
crocodiles know how to swim!

14:40.600 --> 14:42.040
I didn't, when I was a kid!

14:42.400 --> 14:44.920
Hi, there, Croco Jagged.
I need a word with your son,

14:44.920 --> 14:46.240
if that's OK with you!

14:46.240 --> 14:47.760
Rock 'n' roll, Ladybug!

14:55.200 --> 14:58.320
- Nice to see you again, Luka.
- You too, Sass.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.440
Use your power now.
If Cat Noir or I get hit,

15:00.440 --> 15:02.480
come back to this exact moment.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.040
Understood, Ladybug!
Sass, scales slither!

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
Second chance!

15:31.160 --> 15:33.200
No one can know our identities.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.200
Count on me.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.360
Lucky charm!

15:42.320 --> 15:43.800
A dino-huggie?

15:43.800 --> 15:45.480
Saving the world
with a stuffed animal?

15:45.480 --> 15:46.320
I like that!

15:52.040 --> 15:55.000
Sure you don't want me to make
your childhood dream come true?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.240
Don't waste your breath,
I didn't have any!

15:58.240 --> 15:59.640
Every child has a dream!

15:59.640 --> 16:00.840
Maybe not everyone.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.960
You just need to get
your memory back.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.440
Just let me touch you

16:04.440 --> 16:06.480
and your dream
will be revealed to you!

16:07.360 --> 16:09.440
What a brilliant idea,
Wishmaker.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.960
Make his dreams come true

16:10.960 --> 16:13.400
and show me
Cat Noir's true face!

16:20.240 --> 16:21.200
Watch out, Cat Noir!

16:25.880 --> 16:28.240
Does this stuffed animal
mean anything to you?

16:31.640 --> 16:33.760
It's a dino-huggie!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.680
Live your childhood dream!

16:38.440 --> 16:41.800
Awesome! I always wanted to be
the Knitting Fairy in real life!

16:42.240 --> 16:44.080
Ma... Marinette?

16:45.480 --> 16:48.480
Ladybug is Adrien's classmate,
Marinette?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.840
At last, at long last!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.240
Second chance.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.240
No one can know
our secret identities.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.280
Lucky charm!

17:00.280 --> 17:02.400
- A dino-huggie?
- I've got the first part

17:02.400 --> 17:03.200
of the solution.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.320
What a brilliant idea!

17:05.320 --> 17:06.560
Make his dreams come true!

17:10.200 --> 17:11.160
Cat Noir, duck!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.080
Hey! It's a dino-huggie!

17:17.760 --> 17:19.520
Live your childhood dream!

17:22.240 --> 17:24.680
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be

17:24.680 --> 17:27.360
what my parents wanted me to be!

17:27.680 --> 17:30.240
Oh! My son?

17:30.480 --> 17:33.400
When I was a kid I wanted to be
in the dino-huggie gang!

17:33.400 --> 17:35.480
Then you're the answer
to defeating him!

17:35.720 --> 17:38.160
Sorry, Ladybug, but this isn't
the right moment yet.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.040
- Second chance.
- No one can know

17:40.040 --> 17:41.200
our secret identities.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.840
I promise that won't happen.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.600
Lucky charm!

17:45.520 --> 17:47.000
A dino-huggie?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.680
It's for a man with a red hat.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.600
His childhood dream
was to become one!

17:50.600 --> 17:51.800
Got it!

17:52.040 --> 17:53.800
What a brilliant idea,
Wishmaker.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.720
Watch out, Cat Noir!

17:59.760 --> 18:01.720
It's a dino-huggie!

18:02.400 --> 18:04.880
Whoa! I'm a dino-huggie!

18:04.880 --> 18:07.720
Look! Wishmaker needs
a great big dino hug!

18:10.320 --> 18:15.560
Big hug! Big hug! Big hug!
Big hug! Big hug!

18:15.560 --> 18:16.640
No!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.320
- Cat Noir, now!
- Cataclysm!

18:28.360 --> 18:30.560
No more evil-doing for you,
little akuma!

18:34.160 --> 18:36.400
Time to de-evilize!

18:39.680 --> 18:40.560
Gotcha!

18:41.800 --> 18:43.360
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:44.040 --> 18:46.560
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:48.480 --> 18:49.760
Ho, ho, ho!

18:55.280 --> 18:56.240
Ah!

19:05.840 --> 19:09.440
Alec, this will remind you
that our negative emotions

19:09.440 --> 19:12.320
make us vulnerable. I'm sure
it'll help you to stay positive.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.440
Thank you, Ladybug.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.640
ALL: Pound it!

19:17.840 --> 19:20.560
When I was a kid, I just
wanted people to be happy.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.480
So now I'll do what I should
have been doing all along,

19:23.480 --> 19:25.560
help people,
through a new TV show!

19:25.800 --> 19:27.880
What about you guys?
What are your dreams?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.080
Sorry, Alec,
but when you're a superhero,

19:30.080 --> 19:32.160
even your dreams
have to remain a secret.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.080
Bye, Alec!

19:35.840 --> 19:37.920
- Should I roll now?
- (Laughs)

19:38.400 --> 19:41.000
I haven't unmasked you yet,
Ladybug and Cat Noir,

19:41.440 --> 19:43.520
but the day will come
when I, too,

19:43.520 --> 19:46.200
will find a way
to make my dream come true!

19:50.280 --> 19:53.560
Thank you, Luka, thanks to you
our identities were preserved

19:53.560 --> 19:56.440
and no one discovered
who Cat Noir and I really are.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.200
Not even you, right?

20:02.800 --> 20:06.200
Not even me. Luckily, Wishmaker
never hit you or Cat Noir.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.920
(Sighs)

20:13.960 --> 20:15.200
Spots off.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.000
Luka!
Thank you for hiding me here.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.440
It was nothing, Marinette,

20:25.440 --> 20:26.920
you know
you can always count on me.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.800
Phew, you guys are OK!

20:29.200 --> 20:32.200
We're all OK,
thanks to Ladybug and Cat Noir!

20:33.280 --> 20:36.040
I may not remember my childhood
dreams, but that's OK.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.600
It's time to find
my inner music, like Luka said.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.160
- Plagg, what are you doing?
- I'm curious to hear

20:42.160 --> 20:44.800
what a camembert concerto
sounds like!

20:45.240 --> 20:47.560
(Laughter)

20:49.480 --> 20:51.080
(Sighs) You know what?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.760
I've decided
I'm gonna do it all.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.480
I'll be Ladybug,
I'll design clothes, jewelry,

20:55.480 --> 20:57.600
space rockets!
I'll be Luka's best friend

20:57.600 --> 20:59.160
and I will love Adrien!

20:59.160 --> 21:01.160
But how will you do it all
at the same time?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.280
I don't know how, yet.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.400
But, yes, I can do this!

21:05.400 --> 21:08.080
<i>Welcome to</i>
Live your Childhood Dream!

21:08.080 --> 21:10.320
<i>And now, we're going</i>
<i>to love one another!</i>

21:10.320 --> 21:12.600
<i>Starting with everyone</i>
<i>loving themselves!</i>

21:12.600 --> 21:14.640
<i>Because how will you</i>
<i>love other people</i>

21:14.640 --> 21:16.720
<i>if you don't love yourself?</i>

21:16.720 --> 21:20.280
<i>Welcome to</i>
Live your Childhood Dream!
