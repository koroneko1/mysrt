Characters, actions, occupations and events in this series are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

2
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:15,154
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

3
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:17,812
Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:25,838
Can you explain what a colorist is to you?

5
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:32,913
People may think a colorist designs the color scheme for a film.

6
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,705
To me,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,600
it’s the position that brings a film to life.

8
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:41,378
It emphasizes the moods of the scenes.

9
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:46,517
Let’s say in sad scenes, the sky doesn’t have to be blue.

10
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,017
It can be moss green.

11
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,320
Or…

12
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:01,560
If this room is too gloomy,

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,687
I can use my magic to make it brighter.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,690
It says here you analyze and categorize people into colors.

15
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:10,813
Try analyzing us.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,294
Are you sure?

17
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:13,201
Give it a shot.

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,470
Tell us what you think.

19
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:18,062
All right.

20
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,922
A man on the far left seems lively,

21
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,000
yet he’s having something on his mind.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,358
He reminds me of…

23
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:28,123
a rotten carrot orange.

24
00:01:32,944 --> 00:01:34,037
As for you,

25
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,923
you seem calm and passive.

26
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,429
You give me…

27
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:43,640
a pickled cucumber green.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,167
As for you,

29
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,561
you look serious.

30
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,053
You remind me of

31
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,400
a horse manure brown.

32
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:58,836
Brown like…

33
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,301
Brown like a horse shit. You know?

34
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,794
Brown like a horse shit.

35
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,921
I am sorry.

36
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,962
I talked too much.

37
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:19,486
Sorry.

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,000
Damn it!

39
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,280
I shouldn’t have said that.

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,850
My emotion right now is ocean blue.

41
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:30,587
Here we go again.

42
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,166
Emotions by colors.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,558
Come on.

44
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,630
It all boils down to your skills anyway.

45
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:37,946
You’ll get it.

46
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:38,827
True.

47
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:41,695
Besides, working is stressing out.

48
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:42,802
Look at me.

49
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:43,984
I’m an assistant director.

50
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:46,464
They work my ass off like a slave.

51
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,126
Shoot!

52
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,700
The series is on.

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,558
Puen is in it.

54
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,225
Come on, Gyo.

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,360
You can watch the rerun.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,729
I can’t.

57
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,224
I must help retweet.

58
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:59,546
This episode must be trending worldwide.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,227
You’re too much.

60
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,564
Lay,

61
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,344
you won’t forget the gift I asked you to make, will you?

62
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,060
Yeah.

63
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,680
I will do it tonight.

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,459
Great.

65
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:10,703
I need it tomorrow.

66
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,265
Time to watch it now.

67
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:12,998
Bye.

68
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,021
What is it?

69
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,002
Just hold it and follow me.

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,926
Well, come on!

71
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:32,803
Hold on.

72
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,960
Do we really have to do this?

73
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:36,846
We do.

74
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:41,597
If they know we’re fans, we’ll be asked to wait at the exit.

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,400
But I’m a VVVVIP fan.

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Therefore, I must get to welcome Puen on his first step at the airport.

77
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,124
Ahem!

78
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,731
Guys,

79
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,607
Puen is coming.

80
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,599
What?

81
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,345
That’s not Puen.

82
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,362
Guys, we’re at the wrong gate.

83
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,320
Puen is at a different gate.

84
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:51,882
Run!

85
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,414
Go!

86
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,551
Wait.

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,300
I need to pee.

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,528
You go ahead.

89
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,020
Make it quick then.

90
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,173
The gift is with you.

91
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,938
- Catch up with me.
- All right.

92
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:26,804
Are you Puen?

93
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:28,387
I am.

94
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,240
My friend is your fan.

95
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:35,626
She brought you a gift.

96
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:40,169
Here.

97
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:46,145
Congratulations on your international film.

98
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:54,560
Is it against the rules to give a gift to an artist directly?

99
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,211
No.

100
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,480
Just wondering if you washed your hands already.

101
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,587
I’m sorry.

102
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:03,919
I’ll do it now.

103
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,519
But I think…

104
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,400
It’s too late.

105
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,210
I’ll wash it for you and...

106
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,040
That’s okay.

107
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:26,120
I should wear it like this, right?

108
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:30,712
Almost right.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
It should be in the center.

110
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:35,359
Excuse me.

111
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,481
You have a big head.

112
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:06,989
The alpaca is now in the center.

113
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:13,485
So it’s supposed to be an alpaca?

114
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,570
Yes.

115
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,000
It doesn’t look like one?

116
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,490
Looks more like a llama.

117
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,061
Did your friend draw it?

118
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,600
Actually…

119
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,708
It’s cute.

120
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,440
I guess the one who drew it is very cute too.

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,880
Tell your friend I said thanks.

122
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,791
Puen.

123
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:47,368
I drew that.

124
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:50,479
Cute.

125
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,693
Damn it! I forgot to wash my hands.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,363
You were damn lucky to meet Puen up close.

127
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,520
Is he hot?

128
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:13,887
Yeah.

129
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:15,132
He is.

130
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,470
But I’m not his fan like you are.

131
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:19,759
Right now,

132
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,003
I’m just worried about the interview.

133
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,202
Wondering if I pass.

134
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,700
I dragged you to have fun, yet you still think about work.

135
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,629
You should do something else while waiting and put your mind at ease.

136
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,747
By the way, Joe is looking for a movie extra.

137
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,340
I told him you’re available.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,854
What?

139
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,038
Why didn’t you ask me first?

140
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:43,760
What role?

141
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:50,194
The hero will walk in from here.

142
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,426
Just be a corpse and lie down.

143
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:54,371
Why do I have to be a corpse?

144
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,880
You can use anyone.

145
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,393
Stop complaining.

146
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,366
Here he comes.

147
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,070
Shit!

148
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,994
That is Gyo’s sweetheart Puen!

149
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:24,246
Right.

150
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,589
That’s why she wanted you to join this set.

151
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,999
So you can take lots of his photos for her.

152
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,000
Work first. Talk later.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,674
Hey!

154
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,881
Everyone, get ready.

155
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:41,659
Sound.

156
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:42,529
Cameras.

157
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:44,467
[Mafia: The Movie]
Scene 2, cut 4, take 1.

158
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,339
Set and…

159
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:50,920
Action!

160
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,468
Hey!

161
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:56,114
Hey!

162
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,422
Hey!

163
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,171
Hey!

164
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,665
Hey, wake up!

165
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:03,991
Hey!

166
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:05,880
Hey!

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,779
Hey!

168
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:08,565
Hey!

169
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,874
Cut! Cut!

170
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,176
The corpse, why are you smiling?

171
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,160
Are you happy you’re dead?

172
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,485
I’m sorry.

173
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,760
He’s breathing right on my face and it tickled me.

174
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:27,846
That’s okay.

175
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,398
I’ll be about this close.

176
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,502
Close your eyes.

177
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:02,789
We’re ready.

178
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,331
You are.

179
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,683
Okay. Let’s focus.

180
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,313
Let’s continue.

181
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:10,905
A slate, please.

182
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,179
Take 2.

183
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,363
Ready?

184
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,545
Set and…

185
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,923
Action!

186
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,062
Hey!

187
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,533
Hey!

188
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:22,591
Hey!

189
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,389
Wake up!

190
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,439
Hey!

191
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,603
Hey!

192
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,422
Hey!

193
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:32,893
Cut!

194
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,905
Whose phone is it?

195
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,011
Sorry. It’s mine.

196
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,442
Holy shit!

197
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,469
BFB!

198
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,275
Can I please take this real quick?

199
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:49,210
Hello.

200
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:50,905
I’m with a movie set.

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,348
What?

202
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,468
I got the job!

203
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:55,746
Seriously?

204
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:57,972
Thank you.

205
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,767
Sure.

206
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,025
Yes!

207
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:21,086
Are you kidding me?

208
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:22,920
I know you’re a workhorse.

209
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:28,766
But you can’t bring your work here to celebrate your new job.

210
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,088
Come on.

211
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,668
Let’s go out. Our friends are waiting.

212
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,243
Your feet haven’t touched the sand yet.

213
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,790
Gyo has taken hundreds of photos while waiting for you.

214
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,091
Damn it.

215
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,159
I told you I start the job at BFB next week.

216
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,143
So I must finish my old tasks before that.

217
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,120
You’re this drunk and you can still work?

218
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,761
Yeah, I can.

219
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,665
Guys, you’re still here?

220
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:13,681
Come on. The sun is gorgeous.

221
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,477
I’m waiting for him.

222
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:15,217
Look!

223
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,206
Damn! That’s stunning.

224
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,266
Lay, let’s go.

225
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:23,860
This is stunning?

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,120
The sky is too pinky.

227
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:28,593
Again?

228
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,627
His attitude against pink.

229
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,254
Right.

230
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:35,565
The only pink he likes is bacon pink.

231
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,872
This is what you call beauty.

232
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,867
Look.

233
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:45,093
Any color of the sky is beautiful except black.

234
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,439
It’s getting dark here.

235
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:48,847
Come on, Lay.

236
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,501
You guys go ahead.

237
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,832
I’m working.

238
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,958
Let’s go.

239
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,097
Joe!

240
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:01,720
I haven’t finished!

241
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,776
I’m not done!

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Guys, let’s take a photo.

243
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,898
Photo time.

244
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,935
1, 2, 3.

245
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:22,515
Yeah!

246
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:35,360
Lay, don’t go too far. It’s dangerous.

247
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,792
I know.

248
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:40,273
Let me appreciate these beautiful colors a little longer.

249
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:41,956
Lay,

250
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,951
get back here.

251
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,567
You’re drunk.

252
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:47,651
All right.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,910
I’m coming.

254
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,607
Shit!

255
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,633
Cramp.

256
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,801
Help!

257
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:05,604
Tess!

258
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,696
You’re awake.

259
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:12,273
I was worried sick.

260
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,591
Your friends said you were in bad shape.

261
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,752
When are you going to quit causing trouble?

262
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,590
Last time, you hit someone with the car.

263
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,590
This time you got yourself into a bar fight.

264
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,155
You’re just--

265
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,215
Wait.

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,206
Who are you?

267
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,477
I’m not your son.

268
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,046
You, bastard!

269
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,920
Now you’re pretending to have amnesia?

270
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,880
Stop it. Don’t hit him.

271
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,928
He’s hurt enough.

272
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,500
Hold on a second.

273
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:50,120
I think there’s a misunderstanding here.

274
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,350
I get it.

275
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,245
This plan doesn’t work.

276
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:57,345
I…

277
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:58,286
Shh.

278
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,458
Just cry.

279
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,289
Look at you.

280
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,680
You must be in so much pain.

281
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:10,151
My son.

282
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,793
My poor son.

283
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:24,919
Don’t cry, baby.

284
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,681
Let’s go.

285
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,240
Don’t you run away.

286
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,577
What the hell is going on?

287
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:09,850
Shit!

288
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,639
Who’s that?

289
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:34,413
Excuse me.

290
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,225
May I take the patient out for an x-ray?

291
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,530
May I ask you something?

292
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,048
Do you believe in reincarnation?

293
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,388
I knew it.

294
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,615
You’re not Tess.

295
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:42,443
You’re someone else.

296
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:43,119
So you know?

297
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,971
You had an accident and woke up in a stranger's body

298
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:49,722
in a world that looks familiar but is not really home.

299
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,142
Am I right?

300
00:20:30,903 --> 00:20:32,322
Help!

301
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:33,600
There’s a patient running away.

302
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,918
Help!

303
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,049
Help!

304
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,095
Anybody.

305
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:55,808
Let me go.

306
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:57,504
I’m going to find my body.

307
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:58,550
Let go!

308
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:11,512
Hello, Tess.

309
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:14,536
What’s up, my dear friend Tess?

310
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,441
Who are you guys?

311
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,452
Your daddy, maybe.

312
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,646
Don’t bug him.

313
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:25,228
Well, look at him.

314
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:26,615
He’s in pain.

315
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,597
So?

316
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,434
Are you feeling better?

317
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:33,008
When you’re fully recovered, we will deal with those scums who beat you.

318
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,627
Are we friends?

319
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Amnesia, I see.

320
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:44,881
Your mom already told us you’d pull this shit.

321
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,286
Here.

322
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,154
A special gift from me.

323
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:53,398
Have a sip when you’re bored.

324
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,005
I hate to see you have alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

325
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:57,583
No.

326
00:21:58,278 --> 00:21:59,732
I don’t want Dad to chew me out again.

327
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:02,182
Tess.

328
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,945
When did you become afraid of your dad?

329
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:06,780
Just now.

330
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,779
Hey!

331
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,192
Don’t be afraid.

332
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,197
We’re never golden sons anyway.

333
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,578
It’s good we don’t finish university in four years.

334
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,401
Otherwise, we’d be taking on family businesses by now.

335
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:17,953
Damn boring.

336
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,852
Guys.

337
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,612
I have a question.

338
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:25,990
What is Qooqle?

339
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,810
I can’t find my name there.

340
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,961
And where is Google?

341
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,607
Google, my ass.

342
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,282
Qooqle is the right one.

343
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:38,852
If you can’t find it on Qooqle, then you can’t anywhere else.

344
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,313
What about Behind the Film Bangkok Company?

345
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:43,483
Do they exist?

346
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,568
Is it a filmmaking company?

347
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:48,268
I’ve never heard of it.

348
00:22:49,754 --> 00:22:52,223
The number one filmmaking company in this country.

349
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:54,993
Never heard of it?

350
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:00,492
Tess, listen to me.

351
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:03,627
There’s only one best filmmaking company here

352
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:05,412
and that is 26 Pictures.

353
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:06,283
And?

354
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:09,703
And, my freaking ass!

355
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:11,677
It’s your father’s company.

356
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:13,016
Are you okay, man?

357
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:14,396
Huh?

358
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,802
Excuse me.

359
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:21,292
May I take the patient out for an x-ray?

360
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I asked the radiologist about you.

361
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,328
He said you’re speedily recovering.

362
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:29,027
Really?

363
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,778
I feel like I’m going crazy.

364
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:34,362
You seem to have fun with your friends.

365
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:36,092
I look like I’m having fun?

366
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:38,949
Wait.

367
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:41,525
May I ask you something?

368
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:46,292
Do you believe in reincarnation?

369
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:47,759
Absolutely.

370
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:48,812
Why?

371
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:53,953
What about dying and switching bodies with other people?

372
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:57,563
I knew it.

373
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,387
I was right.

374
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:03,450
You’re laughing.

375
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,375
You must be thinking I’ve lost it.

376
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,896
No. It’s the opposite, actually.

377
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,584
It’s just that my theory is right.

378
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:13,605
You’re not Tess.

379
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:15,492
You’re someone else.

380
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:22,776
You had an accident and woke up in a stranger's body

381
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:25,548
in a world that looks familiar but is not really home.

382
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:26,899
Am I right?

383
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:28,760
So you know?

384
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:33,840
It’s not just you who is having this fate.

385
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:35,777
Remember one thing.

386
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:38,249
This isn’t only body switching.

387
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:41,292
But you traveled between universes to be in a new body.

388
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,992
Before we continue,

389
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,559
what’s your name in the other universe?

390
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,214
It’s Talay.

391
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,216
You don’t have to speak with me so politely.

392
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,399
Okay, Talay.

393
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,829
My name is Phuwadol.

394
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:10,360
I was a male nurse in that universe.

395
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,334
Then I got hit by a car and my soul traveled to this universe and now resides in the female nurse’s body.

396
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,698
For real?

397
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:19,222
Are there a lot of people who travel between universes?

398
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,775
From what I’ve seen in this hospital, not more than two people a year.

399
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,625
But those who I haven’t found,

400
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,264
I think it’s a lot.

401
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:31,653
Can any of them travel back to the old universe?

402
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,240
I’m in a rush.

403
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,882
I just got a new job.

404
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:38,912
Calm down, brother.

405
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,725
What’s your job?

406
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,347
I’m a colorist.

407
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:44,381
Colorist?

408
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,047
Like a color mixer?

409
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,106
Do you make house paints?

410
00:25:48,928 --> 00:25:50,082
No.

411
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,428
I adjust colors for films.

412
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,292
Pretty much like editing photo colors in applications.

413
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,079
So…

414
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:03,650
Will you tell me now if we can travel back home?

415
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:06,522
Can we? Well, we can.

416
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:09,309
But it’s gonna be a long story.

417
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:12,858
I will take you to a place and explain it to you there.

418
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,479
TWO WEEKS LATER

419
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,913
This is my place?

420
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:48,637
Don’t play dumb.

421
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:51,008
You have class this afternoon, don’t you?

422
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:54,532
But if you can’t, you can skip and rest.

423
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,731
Keep pampering him. That’s how he became a spoiled brat.

424
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:03,411
Get to class this afternoon.

425
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:05,798
Then I’ll send someone to take you to CT Scan.

426
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:07,848
You seem out of your mind.

427
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:11,828
We will leave now.

428
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:14,093
Take care, okay?

429
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,370
Come on, honey.

430
00:27:57,998 --> 00:27:58,742
Yes?

431
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:04,318
Hey.

432
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:08,283
My dad said the CT scan is tomorrow.

433
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,452
Why did you come so soon?

434
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,379
What CT scan?

435
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:17,082
I’m just taking you to a place you should know if you are to live here.

436
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:23,468
Wow!

437
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:26,292
They’re going so slow.

438
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:27,950
Can you honk the horn?

439
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,875
Relax. Let them.

440
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,331
They’re having a good time.

441
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:44,578
Wow!

442
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,488
Our country in this universe allows men to get married?

443
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:50,631
Of course.

444
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:53,209
Don’t tell me they still can’t in our universe.

445
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:54,911
No.

446
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,383
How has our country changed then?

447
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,804
Nothing has.

448
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:03,510
Sidewalks are crappy just the same.

449
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,157
Buses are as old as dinosaurs.

450
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:07,315
But the gas is now more costly.

451
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,097
What we have more are the SkyTrain lines.

452
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,264
That’s good.

453
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:15,631
No more traffic jams then?

454
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:18,356
The traffic is still bad.

455
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:21,640
The SkyTrain tickets are so pricey.

456
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,964
Who would use it?

457
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:27,103
I’ve been here for eight years.

458
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,142
I can’t believe nothing is better.

459
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:37,320
Come on.

460
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:05,272
(Keep looking at me like that…)

461
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,992
And I’ll kiss till you drop.

462
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:12,430
What is this?

463
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,723
Our password.

464
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:19,652
People who can access this building must know the password only folks from our universe know.

465
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,083
But you’ve been here for eight years.

466
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,037
That series was only a few years ago.

467
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:29,494
I update it every year asking from those who newly join.

468
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:35,326
Come.

469
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:06,659
Come on.

470
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,292
[Association of Thai Citizens in the Alternate World]

471
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:25,033
Come on, Talay.

472
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:39,895
Hi, Tess.

473
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,212
No.

474
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:44,061
Um…

475
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:45,308
Talay!

476
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:49,169
Welcome to…

477
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,675
Association of Thai Citizens in the Alternate World.

478
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:01,083
How do I start?

479
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,276
To return to the old universe, you must first

480
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:06,441
find someone who has traveled between universes like us.

481
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:09,783
We call the person we’re looking for ‘the portkey.’

482
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:14,966
You might start with something simple like I did.

483
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,453
My name is Joobjang.

484
00:32:47,623 --> 00:32:50,213
I’m the head of the association.

485
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,457
I’ve only heard of an Association of Thai Citizens in a Different Country.

486
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:57,093
Didn’t think there was one in a different universe.

487
00:32:57,702 --> 00:33:01,475
Can your association take me home?

488
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:04,596
Easy there.

489
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:08,733
This is where people who have traveled between universes gather.

490
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,609
In case we can help each other.

491
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,996
Did Phuwadol give you an intro to this universe?

492
00:33:14,653 --> 00:33:15,311
Yes.

493
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:19,635
According to Phuwadol, this is a parallel universe.

494
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,308
There are certain things that are not like those in our universe.

495
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:26,813
And I traveled between universes to live in a body of a guy named Tess.

496
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:31,221
And Tess traveled between universes to live in your body.

497
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,870
You two just switched universes.

498
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:35,161
What?

499
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,453
Then my life will be so f*cked up.

500
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:43,888
As for the question of how you travel back,

501
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:45,833
let me explain it to you.

502
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:51,363
To return to the old universe, you must first

503
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,697
find someone who has traveled between universes like us.

504
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,919
There will be something of that person that matches you.

505
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,693
Once you find that person, you will dream.

506
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:02,931
Dream?

507
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:04,186
Right.

508
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,825
Have you noticed that you haven't dreamed since you came here?

509
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:10,310
Universal travelers don’t dream.

510
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:13,028
People who usually live here can dream as usual.

511
00:34:14,772 --> 00:34:16,080
If we dream,

512
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,373
what will it be about?

513
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:20,487
It will be a place.

514
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:23,912
When you dream about a place, you must go there as soon as you wake up.

515
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,118
There’s a chance for you to return home.

516
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:29,102
And…

517
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:32,562
How do we know if that person matches us?

518
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:34,542
There will be a sign.

519
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:37,213
When you found one, you will feel it.

520
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:41,167
For example, you two may share the same interest.

521
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,669
You may both have moles or marks in the same area on your body.

522
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:47,619
You two might also have a brief memory together but you can’t remember it.

523
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:49,674
That means

524
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,067
if I come to this association,

525
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:54,010
I might find that person here.

526
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,649
Possibly.

527
00:34:55,896 --> 00:35:02,249
But there’s a 99.99% chance that the person we’re looking for is close to the owner of the body we’re in.

528
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:05,513
Even more difficult.

529
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:09,598
What if I can’t find that person?

530
00:35:10,447 --> 00:35:12,293
Do I die here in this universe?

531
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:14,733
Not always.

532
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:19,374
You might be lucky the person in your body dreams and can come back.

533
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,872
Then you can go back too.

534
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,324
But if he dies,

535
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:26,354
you die too.

536
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,843
Come on.

537
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,631
Don’t make a long face.

538
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:37,844
We will help each other.

539
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,610
How do I start?

540
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:47,116
We call the person we’re looking for ‘the portkey.’

541
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:52,166
To find the portkey, you might start with something simple like I did.

542
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:55,155
But it will a little embarrassing.

543
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,313
How?

544
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:11,093
[If you know me, come say hi.]

545
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,606
Doesn’t seem to work at all.

546
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:33,003
Tess.

547
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:35,613
Hey.

548
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,492
How have you been? Long time no see.

549
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:46,618
Hi.

550
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:48,906
How are you?

551
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,107
Good.

552
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,893
But I will go to England to study by the end of this year.

553
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:56,730
I heard you haven’t graduated yet.

554
00:36:56,934 --> 00:36:58,583
Well, you don’t need to hurry anyway.

555
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,961
Your dad is loaded.

556
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:05,213
I have a question.

557
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:06,835
Have you experienced death before?

558
00:37:09,454 --> 00:37:10,213
Tess,

559
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,092
if I said something that offended you,

560
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:14,470
I’m sorry.

561
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,622
I didn’t mean to. I love you, man.

562
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:18,261
See you.

563
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:19,867
Hey! I didn’t mean it that way.

564
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,558
(Hello.)

565
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:31,837
(I don’t think your idea works.)

566
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,853
(I will try looking through Tess’s yearbook instead.)

567
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:38,847
(Talk to you later.)

568
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:16,088
Pakorn?

569
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:30,820
Hi, Pakorn.

570
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:32,362
It’s me, Tess.

571
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:33,589
You--

572
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:38,329
What the heck?

573
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:44,413
My friend, I need help.

574
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:45,695
How did you get in?

575
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:47,481
You told us the combination.

576
00:38:48,113 --> 00:38:49,133
Let’s drink.

577
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,313
Fuse just got himself an ex.

578
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:51,292
Right.

579
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:54,809
Can we do that another time?

580
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,523
I’m busy today.

581
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:58,860
Bullshit!

582
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,589
Someone like you is busy?

583
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:01,669
Right.

584
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:04,613
We haven’t celebrated since you were discharged.

585
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:06,130
You love being in the crowd, don’t you?

586
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,433
Right.

587
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:10,131
Be in the crowd.

588
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:11,894
I might find my portkey.

589
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,067
I mean

590
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:16,245
my friends.

591
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:27,088
Are you serious?

592
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,893
It’s the bar where Tess got beaten up, isn’t it?

593
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,310
That’s the reason we’re here.

594
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:35,676
We might see them again here and finish them off.

595
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:37,344
Guys.

596
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:41,031
I got beaten up here?

597
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,573
Damn right.

598
00:39:46,305 --> 00:39:48,693
Can’t you remember anything?

599
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:59,300
You flirted with a girl here not knowing she wasn’t available.

600
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,021
Her boyfriend brought his friends to beat the crap out of you.

601
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,382
Lucky you.

602
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,666
Someone nice called an ambulance for you.

603
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:10,053
And that person was nice enough to wait until the ambulance came.

604
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:13,195
Who was it?

605
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,639
Go away.

606
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:17,815
I can’t let you check the video.

607
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,112
What?

608
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:20,990
It’s just for a second.

609
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:23,124
My friend wants to know who helped him.

610
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,431
Relax, man.

611
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,578
Let me handle this.

612
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:28,509
Hey!

613
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,373
I’m begging you.

614
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:37,480
Please help us.

615
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:39,246
Please.

616
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,773
Be kind to other human beings.

617
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,405
Please.

618
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:43,881
Just go.

619
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:48,984
Please.

620
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,008
Here.

621
00:40:50,623 --> 00:40:51,507
Will you help?

622
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,533
It’s all I have.

623
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,430
All right.

624
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,297
You have 10 minutes.

625
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,421
Make it quick.

626
00:40:58,714 --> 00:40:59,746
Chop-chop.

627
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:01,848
Damn. I’m broke.

628
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:06,022
Look here.

629
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:09,862
There!

630
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:32,960
Hello.

631
00:41:34,403 --> 00:41:36,986
Can you please call an ambulance here?

632
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:40,017
Please hurry. It’s bad.

633
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:43,479
Tess.

634
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:51,028
You’re curious about Tun. Right?

635
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,453
Do you know where he is or what he’s doing?

636
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:55,919
He shouldn’t be anywhere else.

637
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,359
There is Tun.

638
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,227
Hi, Tun!

639
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,169
Right here.

640
00:42:46,473 --> 00:42:47,304
Joe!

641
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:49,591
Easy there.

642
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,722
Who is Joe?

643
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:55,386
I’m Pramote.

644
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:57,569
Same old Pramote.

645
00:42:57,707 --> 00:42:59,272
Only he’s hotter now.

646
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:04,208
Not funny.

647
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:07,170
I’m just not wearing glasses and have long hair.

648
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,843
You don’t remember me now?

649
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:16,398
You asked me here because you’re curious about Tun. Right?

650
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:17,071
What is it?

651
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,790
Who is Tun?

652
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:20,536
What?

653
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:23,127
Tun.

654
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,999
Tun, aka Pakorn.

655
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,033
Student number 18 in class.

656
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,575
So Tun is Pakorn?

657
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:32,556
Right.

658
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,979
You normally call him Tun.

659
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:42,145
Actually, whatever questions you have, you can call him.

660
00:43:44,343 --> 00:43:46,343
I did but he hung up on me.

661
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,435
I don’t know why.

662
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:51,071
Do you know where he is or what he’s doing?

663
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,077
I guess I do.

664
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:54,199
These are...

665
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,694
his business cards.

666
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:59,009
Hold on.

667
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,591
Just Pakorn’s contact.

668
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:04,797
These are all his.

669
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,998
What?

670
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,010
Yes.

671
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:11,333
Did you forget he’s a screenwriter?

672
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:14,477
So he switches jobs all the time

673
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:17,271
to get inspiration to write his script.

674
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:19,185
That’s what he told me.

675
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:26,906
Do you have any idea where he is working today?

676
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:28,269
It’s Saturday.

677
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,674
He shouldn’t be anywhere else.

678
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:32,095
Here.

679
00:44:33,624 --> 00:44:34,820
At his older friend’s bar.

680
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,042
[Pakorn Aue-aungkul]

681
00:44:43,855 --> 00:44:46,271
You should take them all.

682
00:44:46,972 --> 00:44:47,938
Since I’ve brought them.

683
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:49,179
Here.

684
00:44:49,664 --> 00:44:50,406
Here.

685
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,402
Tun?

686
00:44:55,598 --> 00:44:57,230
He should be coming later tonight.

687
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,411
He won’t come now.

688
00:44:58,411 --> 00:44:59,107
Look.

689
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:00,654
It’s deserted here.

690
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:02,569
Life sucks!

691
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:04,736
Relax.

692
00:45:05,617 --> 00:45:06,582
Can I get a beer?

693
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:08,168
Wow.

694
00:45:08,698 --> 00:45:10,032
Luxurious choice!

695
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:12,231
Beer is luxurious?

696
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:14,401
It costs several times more than wine.

697
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:16,940
A poor guy like me drinks only wine.

698
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,523
Beer is once in a blue moon for me.

699
00:45:19,005 --> 00:45:20,906
Beer in my universe is so damn cheap.

700
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:22,371
How many cans?

701
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:27,681
Hey!

702
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,447
You will drink two all by yourself?

703
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:31,623
A heavyweight, huh?

704
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,473
This is one.

705
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,591
That’s two.

706
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:37,616
This is one. This is two.

707
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:40,326
So this is one. This is two…

708
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:41,747
There is Tun.

709
00:45:41,747 --> 00:45:42,563
Hi, Tun!

710
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,271
I’m gonna go play.

711
00:46:20,804 --> 00:46:22,143
What’s the hurry?

712
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:23,998
Don’t you come talk to your friend?

713
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:25,631
What’s with him?

714
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:29,399
Bartender, give me a beer.

715
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:32,603
Here.

716
00:46:34,027 --> 00:46:35,520
Pay attention.

717
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,204
He’s the best.

718
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:00,854
♪ Just when you lay eyes on me ♪

719
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,292
♪ I can’t feel my heart ♪

720
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:09,344
♪ Because I already gave all my heart to you ♪

721
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:15,553
♪ I have no idea how I can live ♪

722
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:17,827
Bro.

723
00:47:18,351 --> 00:47:19,544
You sure he’s the best?

724
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:22,173
The best at singing off-key.

725
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:25,991
If there’s a show searching for the most off-key singer, he wins.

726
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:33,243
Thank you.

727
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:57,769
I knew you’d run away.

728
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:01,071
Can we talk for a sec?

729
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:09,770
Hey!

730
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:10,827
Pakorn!

731
00:48:11,746 --> 00:48:13,038
I don’t want to talk to you.

732
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,478
Pakorn!

733
00:48:19,991 --> 00:48:20,876
Pakorn!

734
00:48:24,139 --> 00:48:25,082
Pakorn!

735
00:48:38,078 --> 00:48:39,116
Damn you!

736
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,882
Why did you run away?

737
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:47,551
Hot-headed as always.

738
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:52,180
Who?

739
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,474
How did you get in here?

740
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:57,814
Enough with that amnesia joke.

741
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,436
I’m Thanin, your big brother.

742
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,231
A guy who cleans after your shit.

743
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:09,848
Why are you here then?

744
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,855
Dad is furious you skipped class and the CT scan.

745
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,482
He sent me to scold you.

746
00:49:21,274 --> 00:49:22,311
Sorry about that.

747
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,918
I got something to deal with.

748
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:30,398
Tess.

749
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:34,751
I don’t want to order you around.

750
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,779
But please at least show up at the company.

751
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:39,032
Work sometimes so that Dad won’t get mad.

752
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,667
At the filmmaking company?

753
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:43,257
Hell yeah.

754
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,519
I know you don’t want to.

755
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:47,735
- But I…
- I’ll go.

756
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:58,867
Does our family really own this?

757
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:00,138
Of course.

758
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:04,469
How can I help?

759
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:08,351
Lots of people are coming to sell their movie projects.

760
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:11,523
I can only handle a few as I need to go see the editing process.

761
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,573
Sorry to keep you waiting.

762
00:50:13,665 --> 00:50:15,374
If you’re ready, let’s get started.

763
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:20,029
You.

764
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:26,933
You two know each other?

765
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:28,835
Should be easy then.

766
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:30,525
Something like that.

767
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:35,293
Actually, you can go to the editing.

768
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:38,511
I’ll listen to his presentation.

769
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:40,441
You think?

770
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:43,103
All right, then.

771
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:45,352
Take care of it.

772
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:46,403
I’ll be right back.

773
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:01,998
What are you doing?

774
00:51:02,111 --> 00:51:03,202
Preventing you from running away.

775
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,145
I have questions for you, Pakorn.

776
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:07,679
First,

777
00:51:07,955 --> 00:51:09,231
why are you avoiding me?

778
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:16,334
Second, when I got beaten up at the bar,

779
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:17,634
you helped me, didn’t you?

780
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:31,366
If we’re not talking about the screenplay, I’ll leave.

781
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:32,275
Wait.

782
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:36,478
Answer me.

783
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:42,005
I have nothing to say to you.

784
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:44,676
Damn it.

785
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:46,089
Let go.

786
00:51:46,089 --> 00:51:47,141
What the hell is wrong with you?

787
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:47,887
Let go.

788
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:48,801
I said let go!

789
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:03,693
Stay away from me.

790
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,123
I hate you.

791
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:13,332
Shit.

792
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,033
This is harder than I thought.

793
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:23,895
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

794
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:47,234
I’ll do anything to go back as soon as possible.

795
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:49,751
Have you found anyone who seems right?

796
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,621
There he is.

797
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,460
Is he the real Tun?

798
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:56,383
I think Pakorn is the one I’m looking for.

799
00:52:56,383 --> 00:53:00,134
Check again if he traveled between universes like you.

800
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:01,549
Shit!

801
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:04,479
What happened last night?

802
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:08,351
To be my wife, you must endure.
