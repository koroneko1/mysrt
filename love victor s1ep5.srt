1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:04,755
VICTOR: Dear Simon,
things have been pretty tense at home

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,798
since we learned the real reason
we left Texas.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,343
ISABEL: No way.
PILAR: What are you
freaking out about this time?

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,303
‐ Those aren't shorts.
They're denim underpants.

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,472
‐ People who have affairs
shouldn't be throwing stones.

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,266
ISABEL: You look like Madonna
in the "Like a Prayer" video.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,978
‐ Wow. That would really hurt my feelings
if I actually understood your references.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,022
[arguing continues]
VICTOR: Luckily, my family has me.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,816
For as long as I can remember,
I've been my family's fixer.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,944
There's no problem I can't smooth over

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,530
with a well‐timed joke,
a charming anecdote,

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,032
or, when all else fails... carbs.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,951
[indistinct arguing]
Who wants pancakes?

14
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,245
‐ Oh. I could go for pancakes.

15
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,246
‐ Banana for me.

16
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,665
‐ Oh, so Victor's allowed to
use the stove?

17
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,085
‐ Shh. Eat your pancakes.
‐ These smell so good, mijo. Thank you.

18
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,211
‐ You're welcome.

19
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,755
‐ Have you decided what you want to do
for your birthday this Saturday?

20
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,091
I thought we could throw you a party,

21
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,717
invite your friends over...

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,638
‐ That's okay. It's such short notice.
I'm sure everyone has plans, you know?

23
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,974
‐ Oh. Okay.

24
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,977
I just thought we could all use
a celebration around here.

25
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,854
ARMANDO: Yeah, all right.
See you soon, Mami. Bye.

26
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,022
‐ See you soon?
Why are you gonna see her soon?

27
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,525
‐ Oh, my parents wanna visit
for Victor's birthday this weekend.

28
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,987
‐ Yes! Finally!
Abuelita in the house!

29
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,114
ISABEL: Seriously, Armando?

30
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,575
Pilar is being horrible to me,
and now on top of that,

31
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,368
I'm gonna have your mom here hating me?
ARMANDO: Yes!

32
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,661
ISABEL: I can't even‐‐
ARMANDO: What's the problem?

33
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,246
ISABEL: You know what the problem is!
‐ Let's throw the party.

34
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,207
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun. I mean,

35
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,667
you guys can meet my friends,

36
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,129
and Abuela Nati and Tito
can celebrate with us.

37
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,257
‐ Our first party in our new home. Hmm?
[kissing noises]

38
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm so excited.

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,055
‐ Okay! Party time!

40
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,267
VICTOR: Maybe something fun
and distracting was exactly

41
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,811
what we needed to get
our family groove back.

42
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,855
‐ That is what we're gonna do.
I'm just excited about having a party

43
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,024
and meeting your friends.
Are they nice? I bet you they are.

44
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,192
Okay, piñatas...

Of course we'll be there, right?

56
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,521
‐ Uh, depends. Who else will be there?

57
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,273
An Insta‐models? Influencers? Kardashians?

58
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,485
‐ No. Just you guys, my family,
and my grandparents.

59
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,986
[laughs]

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,365
‐ Oh. Oh, you're serious.

61
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,450
‐ Victor's family is a delight.

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,036
I like to think of myself as
the third Salazar kid.

63
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,330
‐ Adrian's the third Salazar kid.

64
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,332
‐ Adrian.

65
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,293
‐ Um, this means I'm gonna
meet your parents?

66
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,795
‐ Yeah. Is that cool?

67
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,964
‐ Yeah.
‐ That's awesome.

68
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,677
‐ Okay, can you guys stop
gently smiling at each other?

69
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,470
We have some serious business to discuss.

70
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,431
Victor's party is going to blow
without some more bodies.

71
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,643
Uh, hey, Benji.
‐ Hey.

72
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,145
LAKE: Victor is having
a birthday on Saturday,

73
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,524
and his ratio of hot people to old people
is totally tragic.

74
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,109
Wanna come?

75
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,778
‐ I mean, only if you want to.
There's, there's no pressure.

76
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,447
‐ Sure, I'm in. I'll bring Derek.

77
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,909
I mean, if that's cool.
‐ Yeah. I love Derek.

78
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,619
‐ Great. We'll be there.

79
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,248
‐ Hey, guys, my break's over.

80
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,583
‐ Okay. Bye.

81
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,754
VICTOR: Dear Simon...
‐ Hey.

82
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,009
VICTOR: ...there's going to be an actual
out‐and‐proud gay couple at my house.

83
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,430
Here's hoping my grandfather's
gotten more...

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,725
open‐minded, since we left Texas.

85
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,394
‐ Why are you playing with a fairy wand?

86
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,605
‐ It's my Elsa wand, from Frozen.

87
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:53,984
It turns things into ice. Be ice, couch!

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,196
You're ice. You're ice...
‐ Do you let him play with girls' toys?

89
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,407
‐ What? Oh, no. Uh, that's actually a,
a hand‐me‐down from Pilar.

90
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,659
He usually uses it to, um, to sword fight.

91
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,745
Yeah, he's a very macho boy.
[screeches]

92
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,247
‐ [squealing] Hi!

93
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,417
‐ Tickle my back and tell me I'm guapo.
‐ Okay.

94
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:14,421
Every day I wish your mother
hadn't moved you across the country

95
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,631
for no reason at all.

96
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,009
‐ Actually, there is a really good reason
why we moved from Texas.

97
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,386
‐ Which is that Papi got a great new job,

98
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,013
and hooked us up with this sick apartment.

99
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,225
‐ Yes, it does look a little sick.
[laughs]

100
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,143
‐ Hola, Natalia.
‐ Hola.

101
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,561
ISABEL: Tito, ¿cómo estás?
TITO: Hola, mija.

102
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,104
NATALIA:
Oyeme, Victor.

103
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,774
What would you like me to
make you for your birthday?

104
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,735
Buñuelos, or Pasteles de Gloria?

105
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,532
‐ Actually, I'm gonna be making
a tres leches cake, just like yours.

106
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,326
‐ Oh. We'll see about that.

107
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,745
I thought you were joking on the phone.

108
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,413
Is she really baking?

109
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,375
‐ Abuela, did Papi tell you?

110
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,126
My new friends are coming to the party.

111
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,878
‐ [gasps] Oh!
ARMANDO: Oh, yeah. That's right.

112
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,339
We're all gonna get to meet the
mystery girl that Victor's been dating.

113
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,425
‐ Oh, so Victor finally has a novia, huh?

114
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,219
‐ Si. [chuckles]

115
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,598
‐ At least one of your boys is gonna
give me some great‐grandchildren.

116
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,102
ADRIAN:
Ice power! Ice! Ice! Ice!

117
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,062
Be ice, couch!

118
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,399
‐ It's too much eyeliner.

119
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,109
Okay, I need makeup that says,

120
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,944
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Salazar.

121
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,864
I'm Mia, a perfectly respectable girl
for your son to date."

122
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,282
‐ This totally says that,

123
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,701
while also hinting that
you have a wild side.

124
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,245
If they really love their son,
they'll want that for him.

125
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,371
[Mia groans]

126
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,831
Why are you so stressed about this?

127
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,249
‐ I guess...

128
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,376
Victor's family is like, his whole world,

129
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,129
and he's becoming a big part of my world,

130
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,423
so I just need them to like me.

131
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:42,509
‐ My God, you're like,
next level into him, aren't you?

132
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,678
‐ No, I'm‐‐ Maybe. I don't know. Stop.

133
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,222
‐ I wish I had a super sweet,
super cute boy

134
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,974
who wanted to parade me around.

135
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,059
‐ Oh, are you still bummed
it didn't work out with Andrew?

136
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,188
‐ Oh, no. No, I'm over that.

137
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:58,108
Andrew's just as blah
as all the other guys at Creekwood.

138
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,861
I want someone exciting. And spontaneous.

139
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,281
The kind of guy who isn't afraid
to do something crazy and unexpected,

140
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,492
like rob a bank.
‐ So, a criminal.

141
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,745
‐ It's not a crime
if you don't get caught.

142
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,955
‐ Mm, that's not at all how it works.

143
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,625
Do you really think
Victor's parents will like me?

144
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,044
‐ They will love you.
You're a parents' wet dream.

145
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,505
‐ And mostly because I don't
say things like that.

146
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,720
[soccer game playing on TV]
[Tito cheering]

147

[all yelling and cheering]

148
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,683
‐ Oh!

149
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,477
[doorbell rings]

150
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,187
‐ I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

151
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,439
FELIX:
Sports...

152
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,609
MIA and LAKE: Happy birthday!
‐ Hey, guys.

153
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,986
Thanks for coming. You look really nice.

154
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,946
[laughs]
‐ Right?

155
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,657
And the craziest part is she didn't even
think about the way she looked.

156
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,033
‐ Yeah.
‐ No, it didn't cross her mind.

157
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,284
‐ Shut up.

158
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,953
‐ The other guys‐‐ Oh, hey.

159
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,496
‐ This is Lake and Mia.

160
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,498
‐ Oh.
‐ Nice to meet you both.

161
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,375
Which one are you dating?

162
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,669
‐ [exhales]
Sorry. Mia.

163
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,255
‐ Oh. Ay, otra vez, otra vez.
‐ No!

164
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,549
‐ Come on.
Wait, they were totally off‐sides.

165
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,093
‐ Yes, thank you!
‐ Me encanta esta niña.

166
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,178
‐ Yeah, I don't know how you tricked her
into going out with you,

167
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,222
but, uh, do not screw it up.
[Victor laughing]

168
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,474
‐ I'll try not to, Papi.

169
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,393
‐ Oh, uh, should I meet your mom?

170
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,562
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

171
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,942
‐ Great mustache, by the way.
‐ Thank you. [chuckles]

172
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,447
VICTOR: Well, Simon,
looks like the fixer's done it again.

173
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,201
I hadn't seen my dad smile in days.

174
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,161
Until he met Mia.

175
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,663
ISABEL:
You have got to be kidding me.

176
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,914
You are not wearing that to this party.

177
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,500
‐ What? This is my house.
I can wear what I want in my house.

178
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,043
‐ No, you can't.

179
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,963
Because I can't have your abuela
giving me another lecture

180
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,840
on how I let you listen to devil music.

181
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,467
Now please, go to your room and change,

182
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,095
before she finishes putting on her makeup
and sees you.

183
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,681
‐ Fine. I'll go to my room,
but I'm not coming to this stupid party

184
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,683
just so we can all pretend
we're still a happy family.

185
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,560
‐ Pilar!
[door closes]

186
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,686
[sighs]

187
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,604
[clears throat]

188
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,733
‐ Uh, Mom, this is... this is Mia.

189
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,028
‐ Hi.
‐ Hello. I'm sorry you had to see that.

190
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,487
‐ No, it's fine.

191
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,575
My mom and I had a pretty
terrible relationship sometimes, too.

192
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,828
‐ We don't have a terrible relationship.
We just had a fight.

193
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,122
‐ No, of course. I, um, I‐‐
[clattering]

194
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,499
I meant, um, I don't know.

195
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,626
I don't know what I meant.
[Victor chuckles]

196
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,049
Wow. You really do not look like
you could have a 16‐year‐old son,

197
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,175
Mrs. Salazar.

198
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,635
‐ You speak Spanish.

199
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:33,847
‐ A little. Uh, my dad used to teach
summer sessions in Barcelona.

200
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,892
‐ Mia has traveled all over.
[chuckles]

201
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,525
‐ Mia, may I have a moment
alone with my son, please?

202
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,990
‐ She's nice, right?
‐ Yeah. Yeah, she seems great,

203
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,825
but we have a major emergency
on our hands.

204
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,494
I need to get another tres leches cake.

205
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,329
‐ What? Why?

206
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,540
‐ I forgot to get the third leche,

207
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,084
so I doubled up on the second leche,
thinking you wouldn't be able to tell,

208
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,837
but you can tell, Victor.
You can totally tell!

209
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,380
And if I don't fix this,

210
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,383
I am gonna be hearing about
how I tanked tres leches cake

211
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,884
from your abuela until she is dead.

212
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,678
Which might be today,
because I'm gonna murder her

213
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,263
for giving me so much crap about the cake.

214
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,056
‐ It's fine. It's fine.

215
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,268
Listen, scrap that cake.
I'll get a new one,

216
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,187
and abuela will never have to know.
Okay? Come here.

217
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,982
‐ Okay. Ay, mi vida.

218
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,568
You're always saving the day.

219
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,278
Okay. Ay.

220
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,322
VICTOR: Lake, would you be able
to do me a huge favor

221
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,950
and run to the Mexican bakery
and pick up a tres leches cake?

222
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,286
‐ Oh‐‐
‐ I'll come with you.

223
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,163
Uh, Victor's grandfather said
I'm no longer allowed to follow him around

224
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,666
with Google translate, so...

225
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,294
‐ [sighs] Fine, we'll go.
Just don't be weird.

226
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:48,213
‐ [with cockney accent]
Oh. I wouldn't dream of it, m'lady.

227
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,132
‐ And you failed.

228
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,761
[Lake sighs]

229
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,515
'Course I have to leave when
the one sexy person shows up.

230
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,268
No offense, Victor!

231
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,979
‐ Hey, Benji.

232
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,106
You made it.
‐ Hey.

233
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,234
A little something for the birthday boy.
[chuckles]

234
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,819
‐ You didn't have to get me a gift.

235
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,072
‐ I had to park in front of a hydrant.

236
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,033
So nobody set anything on fire.

237
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,910
‐ [laughs] Hey, man. Thanks for coming.

238
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,078
‐ Yeah. Anything this guy wants.

239
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,371
TITO:
Victor.

240
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,373
Who are your friends?

241
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,251
‐ Uh, oh, Tito, this is Benji,
my coworker,

242
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,922
and Derek, his, uh, band mate.
[chuckles]

243
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,966
TITO: Ah, ¿como los Bee Gees?
‐ Si. [chuckles]

244
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,306
‐ Seriously? "His band mate?"

245
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,016
‐ Well, you guys are in a band together.

246
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,768
‐ Yeah, well,
I prefer the term "boyfriend."

247
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,561
‐ No, no, of course. It's just‐‐

248
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,775
My family's going through
a hard time right now.

249
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,610
I just really need today to go well,

250
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,945
and if my grandfather makes a scene,

251
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,489
it'll lead to a fight between my parents,
and I just...

252
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,701
I'm just not sure how much more
fighting we can take.

253
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,456
‐ Whatever. Just... forget about it.

254
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,005
[indistinct chatter]

255
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,391
‐ Hola. We need your biggest
tres leches cake.

256
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,895
‐ Si. Es una cake emergencia.

257
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,440
‐ Look, as much as it pains me
not to help out two flustered kids

258
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,026
with their cake... "emergencia,"

259
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,363
this is the last one I got,
and I just sold it to that guy.

260
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,325
‐ Okay. Let me handle this.

261
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,995
[sighs] Hello, sir.

262
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,415
Uh, you seemed to have gotten
the last tres leches cake,

263
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,834
and I was hoping to buy it from you.

264
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,172
‐ Look, I'd love to help,
but it's an apology cake for my wife.

265
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,967
I called her sister "shrill"
and then tried to defend my point.

266
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,302
Way to go, Jeff.

267
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,261
‐ Sir.

268
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,146
‐ Hi. Sir, uh, today is my best friend
Victor's birthday.

269
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,690
This cake is his favorite dessert
in the whole wide world.

270
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,902
So, is there any chance you'd be
willing to take a different cake?

271
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,486
‐ No.

272
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,489
‐ Well, I'm, uh,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

273
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,242
[change clatters]
Lake, run. I said run! Go, go, go!

274
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,203
LAKE: Felix, what are you doing?
FELIX: Hurry, hurry!

275
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:31,168
‐ And my dad is president of a university.
‐ Oh, wow!

276
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,128
Que fancy.

277
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,589
You really struck the jackpot, niño.

278
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,968
Isabel, did you know that Mia
used to summer in Barcelona?

279
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,178
‐ So I've heard.

280
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,347
[soccer game playing on TV]

281
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,808
‐ Excuse me.

282
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,393
[distant metal music playing]

283
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,187
‐ No, no. Not today.

284
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,356
[screaming]
Not today, Pilar!

285
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:55,108
‐ Why do you let her play
that devil music in your house?

286
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,987
‐ I just screamed, "Not today, Pilar."

287
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,739
‐ It is her brother's birthday,

288
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,367
and you can't even get her
to come out of her room?

289
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,995
‐ Well, I could go talk to her,
if you want.

290
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,873
‐ Sure. Have at it.

291
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,962
TITO: Do you get paid?
‐ Just in tips and free bar nuts.

292
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,588
[chuckles]

293
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,590
‐ I bet you guys are cleaning up
with the ladies.

294
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,260
DEREK: [laughing]
Uh, no. Not really.

295
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,304
Actually, we are‐‐
‐ Too busy.

296
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,516
Between music and school,

297
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,351
who has the time to date?

298
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,564
‐ I'm gonna get my drink.

299
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,690
‐ Hey.
‐ Hmm?

300
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,526
TITO: Have you ever heard
of Frank Sinatra?
Now that's music.

301
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,072
‐ Y‐you didn't have to do that.

302
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,247
‐ I'm wearing heels!
‐ Come on!

303
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,003
‐ I cannot believe you did that.
It was like, straight out of a movie!

304
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,921
‐ I know. We were like Bonnie and Clyde.

305
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:02,050
But seriously, though, I think my heart
is going to explode. Here. Feel.

306
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,051
[sighs]

307

Dear Simon, against the odds,

I think my party actually brought
my family closer together.

But you might be right.

It was always, "Do better in school.
Run faster in soccer."
