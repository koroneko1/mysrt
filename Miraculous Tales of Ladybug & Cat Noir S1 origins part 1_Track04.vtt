&lrm;[Nooroo] <i>&lrm;Many centuries ago,</i>

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.380
<i>&lrm;magic jewels with extraordinary</i>

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.300
<i>&lrm;these were the Miraculous.</i>

<i>&lrm;for the good of the human race.</i>

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.980
<i>&lrm;Two of these Miraculous</i>
<i>&lrm;are more powerful than the others,</i>

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220
<i>&lrm;the earrings of the Ladybug</i>
<i>&lrm;with power of creation,</i>

<i>&lrm;which grants the power of destruction.</i>

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.740

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.900
<i>&lrm;whoever controls both these jewels</i>
<i>&lrm;will achieve absolute power.</i>

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.140
&lrm;I want that absolute power, Nooroo.
&lrm;I must have those Miraculous.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.460
&lrm;But nobody knows where they are.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.020
&lrm;I found you though, my little Nooroo.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.940
&lrm;Your Miraculous,
&lrm;remind me of its powers again.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.540
&lrm;The moth brooch allows you

&lrm;And, when it comes
&lrm;to luring superheroes,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
&lrm;what could be better
&lrm;than creating supervillains?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.220
&lrm;But master, the Miraculous
&lrm;aren't meant for evil purposes.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.140
&lrm;I must have this absolute power!

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.340
&lrm;Your Miraculous is in my control.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.180
&lrm;I am your master now!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.300
&lrm;And you must obey me.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.940
&lrm;Yes, master.

&lrm;Thank you for coming.
&lrm;See you next week.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.420
&lrm;Master, the Moth Miraculous,
&lrm;I felt its aura.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.540
&lrm;I thought it was lost forever.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.740
&lrm;But master, it's a negative aura.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020
&lrm;I fear it's in the hands of a dark power.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.740
&lrm;We must find Nooroo and his Miraculous.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.060
&lrm;If it's in the wrong hands,
&lrm;there's no telling what evil

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.180
&lrm;But you're right, Wayzz.
&lrm;I can no longer do it alone.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.020

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.940
&lrm;When there's a supervillain,
&lrm;a superhero's not far behind.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.380
&lrm;I'm not missing this.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.020
<i>&lrm;[screeching of tires]</i>

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.500
<i>&lrm;[roaring]</i>

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.180
&lrm;Who was 1st President of the 5th Republic?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.980
&lrm;People think it was De Gaulle

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.980
&lrm;but it was René Coty
&lrm;before the first elections.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.260
&lrm;Excellent, Adrien.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.060
&lrm;Give me a minute would you, Nathalie?

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.380
&lrm;Yes, sir.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.260
&lrm;You are not going to school.
&lrm;I've already told you.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.660
&lrm;But...

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.860
&lrm;I want you here
&lrm;so I can keep an eye on you

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.660
&lrm;not in that dangerous world.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.180
&lrm;It's not dangerous.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.500
&lrm;I'm always stuck here.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.700
&lrm;Why can't I go out and make friends?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.540
&lrm;You're not everyone else,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.620
&lrm;you're my son.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.460
&lrm;Continue.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.940
&lrm;We can stop for today if...

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.340

&lrm;[Roger] Ready?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.540
&lrm;[Roger] Fire!

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.820
<i>&lrm;All Parisians, stay at home</i>
<i>&lrm;until the situation's under control.</i>

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.820
<i>&lrm;As incredible as it seems,</i>

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.740
<i>&lrm;Paris is being attacked by a supervillain.</i>

<i>&lrm;I mean, the other arm.</i>

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.260
&lrm;I hate first days at school.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.900
&lrm;What's this doing here?

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.180
&lrm;Help, it's a giant bug!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.380
&lrm;A mouse... a bug-mouse.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.540
&lrm;Everything's OK. Don't be scared!

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.140
&lrm;Bug-mouse talks!

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.900
&lrm;No way. Like the genie in the lamp.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.780
&lrm;I met him once, so he grants wishes,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.540
&lrm;I'm way more personable.
&lrm;Plagg, nice to meet you.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.780
&lrm;Swanky.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.620
&lrm;[chomping] Don't touch that!

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.060
&lrm;Come back here.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.260
&lrm;It's so shiny. Can you eat this?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.820
&lrm;[chomping] No, you can't. What about this?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.540
&lrm;Marinette, I know everything
&lrm;seems a bit strange...

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.980
&lrm;OK, if you feel safer.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.180
&lrm;What are you?
&lrm;How do you know my name?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.060
&lrm;I'm a Kwami, and my name is Tikki.
&lrm;Now, just let me explain.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.180
&lrm;[chomping]

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.100
&lrm;[yelping]

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.140
&lrm;I still don't know why you're here.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.060
&lrm;I'm a Kwami. I grant powers.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.340
&lrm;Yours is the power of destruction. Got it?

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.540
&lrm;Good. Got anything to eat? I'm starving.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.460
&lrm;My dad's pranking me, right?

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.540
&lrm;Wait, he has no sense of humour.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.780
&lrm;He must never know I exist
&lrm;or anyone for that matter.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.940
&lrm;Mom! Dad!

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.140
&lrm;No, no, no.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.980
&lrm;I'm your friend, Marinette.
&lrm;You must trust me.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.780
&lrm;You're the only one
&lrm;who can stop Stoneheart.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.780
&lrm;Do you think they'll be up to it, master?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.060
&lrm;I only got it wrong once.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.780
&lrm;It will not happen again.
&lrm;At least I hope not.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.260
&lrm;This has to be a mistake.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.540
&lrm;The only superpower
&lrm;I could have is super-awkwardness.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.540
&lrm;I know. Alya would know.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.740
&lrm;I think she would. She loves superheroes.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.020
&lrm;She'd totally be up for it. Ask her.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.100
&lrm;Marinette, you're the chosen one.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.580
&lrm;I'm stuck here. I can't even go to school.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.700
&lrm;What good's a superhero
&lrm;imprisoned in his own house?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.460
&lrm;No good.
&lrm;That's why it's all going to change,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.940
&lrm;if you're willing to change.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.500
&lrm;OK, so all I do

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.140
&lrm;is break the object
&lrm;where that thingy is?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.900
&lrm;It's called an Akuma,
&lrm;which you must capture.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.260
&lrm;Got it. Capture it.
&lrm;What's that charm thing?

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.140
&lrm;Your lucky charm, it's your super-power.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.700
&lrm;This is all going too fast.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.580
&lrm;I won't be able to pull this off.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.340
&lrm;Trust yourself, Marinette.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.860
&lrm;Just say "Spots on".

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.260
&lrm;Spots on?

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.740
&lrm;What's happening?

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.700
&lrm;"Claws out", that's how you transform.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.820
&lrm;Got it.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.140
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.460
&lrm;Wait, I haven't finished...

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.300
&lrm;Too cool.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.420
&lrm;How does this thing come off?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.620
&lrm;Tikki? If you can hear me,
&lrm;I want my normal clothes back.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.380
&lrm;I'm not going anywhere.

&lrm;[Sabine] Marinette, did you get home OK?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.060
&lrm;Yeah, mom, just super.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.460
&lrm;Marinette? You in here?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.420
&lrm;[Sabine] Tom, we'd better call the school.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.540
&lrm;OK, I have special powers.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.020
&lrm;And apparently this amazing
&lrm;super yoyo thingy.

&lrm;[she yells]

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.220

&lrm;[Rose screams]

&lrm;It's not nice to pick on

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.300
&lrm;I guess you're talking about yourself.

&lrm;Everything's going to plan.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.500

&lrm;Where are you, partner?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.420
&lrm;I can't.
&lrm;I'm not going to be able to do it.

&lrm;The world is watching!

&lrm;Yes!

&lrm;Sorry I took so long.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.780
&lrm;It's cool, Wonderbug.
&lrm;Let's kick his rocky behind.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.380
&lrm;Wait. He gets bigger with every attack.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.260
&lrm;-We have to do something different.
&lrm;-What?

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.860
&lrm;I don't know.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.420
&lrm;Let's use our powers.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.740
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.660
&lrm;Apparently, I destroy whatever I touch.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.020
&lrm;I don't need a superpower for that.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.740
&lrm;[Ladybug] No, don't!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.100
&lrm;Cool, it's just you and me.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.780
&lrm;Time to rumble, soon-to-be rubble.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.140
&lrm;Wait!

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.180
&lrm;I guess I only get one shot
&lrm;to use my power.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.460
&lrm;And you only have 5 minutes
&lrm;before you change back.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.340
&lrm;Didn't your Kwami explain?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500
&lrm;I guess I was too excited.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.540
&lrm;Well, up to me?

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.860
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.020
&lrm;[Cat Noir sarcastically] Super power.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.500
&lrm;My Kwami said I must break the object

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.580
&lrm;where the Akuma is hiding.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.340
&lrm;He's made out of stone.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.340
&lrm;His hand, it's closed.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.820
&lrm;He never opens it.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.460
&lrm;It's like Russian dolls,

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.820
&lrm;the object is hidden in his fist.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.900
&lrm;What's your plan?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.420
&lrm;This.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.100
&lrm;[Ladybug] Don't resist, trust me.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.380
&lrm;[yelling] This girl's crazy!

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.100
&lrm;[Ladybug] Catch me if you can.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.500
&lrm;And now...

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.060
&lrm;Alya, the tap!

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.980
&lrm;This girl is awesome.
&lrm;She's crazy awesome.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.780
&lrm;What's going on? What am I doing here?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.140
&lrm;You were incredible, Miss...Bug Lady.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.140
&lrm;You did it.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.500
&lrm;We both did it.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.740
&lrm;Pound it!

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.940
&lrm;[Bleeping]

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.580
&lrm;You should go.
&lrm;Our identities must remain secret.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.260
&lrm;Farewell, milady,
&lrm;let's do this again soon.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.860
&lrm;Not too soon I hope.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.500
&lrm;"You haven't got the guts
&lrm;to tell Mylene you love her. Wuss!"

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.260
&lrm;Kim wrote it. He makes fun of me.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.900
&lrm;You shouldn't get so upset about this.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.140
&lrm;There's no shame
&lrm;in telling someone you love them.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.260
&lrm;How do you know my name, Miss?

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.060
&lrm;Uncanny, amazing, spectacular.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.300
&lrm;Will you be protecting Paris?
&lrm;How did you get your powers?

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.460
<i>&lrm;Did you get stung</i>
<i>&lrm;by a radioactive ladybug?</i>

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.980
<i>&lrm;I've got a ton of questions, Miss...?</i>

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.980
<i>&lrm;Ladybug, call me Ladybug.</i>

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.060
<i>&lrm;Ladybug...</i>

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.460
&lrm;Super awesome.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.900
<i>&lrm;Thanks to this amateur footage,</i>

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.220
<i>&lrm;Parisians now know who their heroes are.</i>

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.020
&lrm;I did it, Tikki.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.620
&lrm;You see, you were up to it.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.340
&lrm;[Sabine] Marinette, dinner!

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.660
<i>&lrm;We will be organising</i>
<i>&lrm;a huge celebration in honour of</i>

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.900
<i>&lrm;our city's new protectors,</i>
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.980
&lrm;Ladybug, her name is Ladybug.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.980
&lrm;[revolted] What is this?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.260
&lrm;Seriously? My personal chef made it.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.020
&lrm;If you expect me to get my energy back,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.580
&lrm;I need to eat something more... delicate.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.140
&lrm;OK, what?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.060
&lrm;[Sabine] Oh my!

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.140
<i>&lrm;Just as Paris is about to</i>
<i>&lrm;celebrate our new superheroes,</i>

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.820
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.300
<i>&lrm;a new wave of panic has hit the capital</i>

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.940
<i>&lrm;as people are turned into stone monsters.</i>

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.540
<i>&lrm;It's simply unbelievable.</i>

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.940
&lrm;Camembert cheese, fantastic.
&lrm;All he eats is camembert.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.460
&lrm;which means I'll smell like stinky cheese.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.500
<i>&lrm;The Stonebeings are still like statues.</i>

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.940
<i>&lrm;Police are perplexed. What will happen?</i>

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.660
<i>&lrm;Will they come to life?</i>

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.580
&lrm;Plagg, what's going on? We defeated him.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.180
&lrm;Did you capture the akuma?

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.220
&lrm;What's that got to do
&lrm;with the other Stonebeings?

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.540
<i>&lrm;An Akuma can multiply</i>
<i>&lrm;that's why it must be captured.</i>

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.700
<i>&lrm;If Ivan becomes negative again,</i>

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.020
<i>&lrm;the Akuma will turn him back</i>
<i>&lrm;into Stoneheart.</i>

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.740
&lrm;He'll use the Stonebeings as his army.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.420
&lrm;So that means this is all my fault?

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.540
&lrm;I knew it.
&lrm;I'm not cut out to be a superhero.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.980
&lrm;I'll keep messing up.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.260
&lrm;Keep calm. It was your first time.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.740
&lrm;You'll capture Stoneheart's Akuma

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.140
&lrm;and do it successfully.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.460
&lrm;I can't. I told you, I'm clumsy.
&lrm;I create disaster all the time.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.540
&lrm;I'll make things worse for everyone.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.340
&lrm;Cat Noir's better off alone, I'm quitting.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.420
&lrm;I can't do anything without Ladybug?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.340
&lrm;Only Ladybug can capture Akumas

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.500
&lrm;and repair damage
&lrm;caused by a supervillain.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.860
&lrm;If Cat Noir can't capture
&lrm;the Akumas, find another Ladybug.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.780
&lrm;I'm not cut out to be Ladybug.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.300
&lrm;I'm sorry, Tikki.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.220
&lrm;No, don't...

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.260
&lrm;Tikki?

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.580
&lrm;I'm really sorry, Tikki.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.700
&lrm;Ivan has a sensitive heart.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.860
&lrm;It won't be long

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.540
&lrm;before anger and sadness strike again.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.540
&lrm;and the Stonebeings will come alive.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.380
&lrm;Then we'll see how long
&lrm;you remain hidden, Ladybug.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.660
&lrm;Once I have your Miraculous,
&lrm;you will be powerless against me.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.060
<i>&lrm;Everyone will be powerless</i>
<i>&lrm;against me!</i>

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.260
<i>&lrm;I will have</i>

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.220
&lrm;absolute power!

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.100
