C. Berman.

"The still traumatized girl claims that
amidst the carnage she saw the witch."

1:12:21.583 --> 1:12:25.291

So, if she survived, I'm pretty sure--

1:12:25.375 --> 1:12:27.166

in the woods."

"Her heart had stopped
but local boy performed CPR."

What if this is it?

1:13:41.416 --> 1:13:44.500
What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:46.583
She survived by dying.

1:13:46.666 --> 1:13:49.666
What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!

1:13:49.750 --> 1:13:51.916
"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.416

-"Until you're dead."

-[pounding continues]
-It's just like Kate said. OK?

1:13:57.250 --> 1:13:58.791
The witch wants you dead.

1:13:58.875 --> 1:14:01.583
So… we kill you.

1:14:02.625 --> 1:14:06.541
And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.

[ominous music playing]

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:41.750
A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience

1:15:41.833 --> 1:15:45.375
in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.

1:15:45.458 --> 1:15:48.250
He was dead for two minutes.

1:15:48.333 --> 1:15:49.250
But…

1:15:51.041 --> 1:15:52.125
we got him back!

1:15:53.208 --> 1:15:54.250
[Deena] Kate.

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:56.875
It's time for your close-up.

1:16:00.833 --> 1:16:04.833
You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.

1:16:04.916 --> 1:16:07.958
You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.

1:16:08.916 --> 1:16:12.666
Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp way down.

1:16:12.750 --> 1:16:13.958
You may feel slightly sick.

1:16:16.083 --> 1:16:19.458
You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.

1:16:19.541 --> 1:16:22.583
That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,

1:16:22.666 --> 1:16:25.166
so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!

1:16:26.583 --> 1:16:28.541
-How many do we have?
-Tons. Like a thousand.

1:16:28.625 --> 1:16:29.833
Wait. EpiPens?

1:16:29.916 --> 1:16:32.375
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

1:16:32.458 --> 1:16:35.250
This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!

Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?

1:16:54.125 --> 1:16:56.458
You don't have to do this. You can leave.

1:16:57.125 --> 1:16:59.625
Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?

1:17:00.291 --> 1:17:01.666
We're ending this together.

1:17:04.333 --> 1:17:05.791

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:52.500
I know.

1:17:53.875 --> 1:17:56.333
She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.

1:17:56.416 --> 1:17:57.541
No! OK, well…

1:17:58.958 --> 1:18:00.750

1:18:00.833 --> 1:18:03.291

-So, see that in yourself, dude.

We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.

1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:21.250
Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.

1:18:21.333 --> 1:18:22.333

What if you can't bring me back?

1:18:43.666 --> 1:18:44.666

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:01.375

I feel like I have
another chance with you.

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:10.583
And I'm not gonna lose you again.

1:19:11.583 --> 1:19:13.500
Because you, and we,
