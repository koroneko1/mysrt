1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,164
<i>I'm just like you.</i>

2
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,417
<i>For the most part,
my life is totally normal.</i>

3
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,294
Happy birthday.
No!

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,550
<i>My dad was the annoyingly
handsome quarterback</i>

5
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,590
<i>who married
the hot valedictorian.</i>

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,509
<i>And, no, they didn't peak
in high school.</i>

7
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,550
<i>I have a sister
I actually like.</i>

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,930
<i>Not that I'd ever
tell her that.</i>

9
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,642
<i>And last year, and 200 episodes
of</i> Chopped <i>ago...</i>

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,347
<i>she decided
she wanted to be a chef.</i>

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,983
<i>Which means we're pretty much
all her test subjects now.</i>

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,157
Is it spicy, Jack?

13
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,119
Oh! Gracious. Oh, my gosh.

14
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,787
<i>And then
there's my friends.</i>

15
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,876
<i>Two of them, I've known since
pretty much the beginning of time.</i>

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,249
<i>- Or at least kindergarten.</i>
- No. No.

17
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,584
- Oh! Sorry!
- Okay. How 'bout that?

18
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,005
<i>One of them,
I just met a few months ago,</i>

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,631
<i>but it feels
like I've known her forever.</i>

20
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,130
<i>We do everything friends do.</i>

21
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,052
<i>We drink way too much
iced coffee,</i>

22
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:42,429
<i>watch bad '90s movies
and hang out at Waffle House</i>

23
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,727
<i>dreaming of college
and gorging on carbs.</i>

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,321
<i>So, like I said.</i>

25
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,573
<i>I'm just like you.</i>

26
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,114
<i>I have a totally,
perfectly normal life.</i>

27
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,122
<i>Except I have
one huge-ass secret.</i>

28
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,428
Hey! Morning! Oh!

29
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,396
- Hey!
- Sorry.

30
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,810
I didn't realize you
were masturbating.

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:31,937
Yeah, very funny.

32
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,355
Your sister's downstairs
making some

33
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,528
la-di-da pancake thing
she saw on <i>Top Chef,</i>

34
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,071
so we should
probably go eat that.

35
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,781
Great. I'll be down
in just a second.

36
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,822
Okay. Right after you finish
searching the internet for...

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,446
lingerie photos of Gigi Habib?

38
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,952
It's Hadid.

39
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,746
Right. I didn't realize
she was your girlfriend.

40
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,952
All right, finish up here.

41
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,379
You got me.

42
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,839
Morning, guys.

43
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,970
Simon,
have a seat, honey.

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,221
Morning, Simon.
You gotta eat your breakfast.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,222
Please don't tell me

46
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,019
that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day

47
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,063
because that is just so cliché.
You're better than that.

48
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,353
I was gonna say breakfast
lowers LDL cholesterol

49
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,230
and prevents
fluctuating glucose levels

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,777
that lead to type two diabetes.
Oh!

51
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,354
Touché.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,194
Nora. These are incredible.

53
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,283
Cornmeal pancakes
with blackberry compote.

54
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,494
But they're not crumbly enough.

55
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,579
Stop it. They're perfect.

56
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,915
Eat up, Bieber.

57
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,459
Okay, I didn't put
very much powder...

58
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,786
- See you, guys.
- See you, Simon.

59
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,745
Hey, honey. Be back
by seven! It's TV night.

60
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,551
Hey!

61
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,136
Morning!

62
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,309
It's Simon! I live right here!

63
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,600
I like your boots!

64
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,986
Okay, bye!

65
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,497
God damn.

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,176
Yo!
Yo!

67
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,224
Had the craziest dream
last night.

68
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,226
Hey, Nick, you have the
craziest dream every night.

69
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:35,849
<i>You don't understand.
I'm in this cave, right?</i>

70
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,023
<i>Or maybe it's in outer space.</i>

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,646
<i>David Beckham is there
with these two contact lenses</i>

72
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,112
and then like, blue one or
red one, like he's a sexy

73
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,564
Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

74
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,114
And I don't know
which one to pick.

75
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,737
I don't know what to do
with these things.

76
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,449
Oh, my God. Have you guys seen
<i>CreekSecrets</i> today?

77
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,537
First of all, you are obsessed
with that blog, so...

78
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,202
Okay, but apparently,
Becca Peterson

79
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,076
got caught giving Ryan O'Donovan
an HJ in the pool.

80
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,953
That's the real reason
they drained it.

81
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,879
- Man, our janitor needs a raise.
- Oh, my God.

82
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,581
And an HPV vaccine.

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,751
<i>Leah, I have this dream, right?</i>

84
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,210
<i>Nick, we have a rule, remember?</i>

85
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,966
<i>No analyzing dreams
before coffee.</i>

86
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,346
Hi, could we get
four iced coffees, please?

87
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,177
Oh, could you get Abby's
with milk? She likes milk.

88
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,604
One with milk.
What are you, her barista?

89
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,191
It's not hard
to remember "with milk."

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,856
Thank you.

91
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,330
Hey!

92
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,413
Hey.
Hey.

93
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,170
Oh, thank you.
I am figuratively dying.

94
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,044
So, Abby,
last night I dreamt

95
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,674
I put the wrong contacts
in my eyes.

96
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,885
- Another dream. You're like...
- Hmm.

97
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,052
You're like the love child of

98
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,597
Sigmund Freud
and Cristiano Ronaldo.

99
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,261
Oh, my God.
Thanks.

100
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,058
Now, look. I can't see anything

101
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,635
and I'm stumbling around
in this cave,

102
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,016
crashing into stuff,
and then, I wake up.

103
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,064
- That's it?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,650
Maybe it's something that
you're not seeing clearly.

105
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,443
Like something that's, like,
right in front of your face.

106
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,362
What am I not seeing?

107
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,815
No idea.

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,826
Ooh! Ooh!

109
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,984
We should be hot Pokémon
for Halloween.

110
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,157
Oh, yeah. But I get to be
slutty Charmander.

111
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,617
Cool scarf, Ethan.

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,452
Hope it doesn't get caught
in your vagina.

113
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,614
Great choice on
the cargo pants, by the way.

114
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,949
It looks like you got
gangbanged by a T.J. Maxx.

115
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,287
Whatever, fag.

116
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,790
Honestly, it's just

117
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,417
not even a challenge anymore.

118
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,714
Dicks.

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,632
Wish Ethan wouldn't make it
so easy for them.

120
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,089
Yeah, well, at my old school,

121
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,545
that would have been settled
with a knife fight.

122
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,758
Good morning, Creekwood High!

123
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,183
Come on, phones off!

124
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,722
There's a whole
world to look at!

125
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,682
You can look people
in the eyes!

126
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,143
Gah! Yeah.

127
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,732
Stop with the selfies.
You're not all that.

128
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,351
I'll see you guys at lunch.
Yeah.

129
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,945
Wow! Simonay.

130
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,650
Look at those new kicks,
my brother.

131
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,858
Where'd you get those? Where
could I get a pair of those?

132
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,113
I forget. Sorry.
You forget?

133
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,569
Come on, you gotta let me
know the brand!

134
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,995
I want to be sneaker brothers.

135
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,204
Oh, I see more phones!
Who took your phones now?

136
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,796
Me! Me! Me took your phones now!
You can get 'em at my office!

137
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,753
I can't believe we have to be
off book, in like, two weeks.

138
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,960
Seriously, Sally Bowles
never shuts the eff up.

139
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,631
Don't you wish
you were talentless like me?

140
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,837
Here. Let me show you
a thing or two.

141
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,172
Because then you could
just be living

142
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,848
the easy life as company member
number eight.

143
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,805
Well, well, well...

144
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,513
If it isn't my fellow thespians.

145
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,305
Hey, Martin.

146
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,649
Hey, Spier. Hey, Abby.

147
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,017
Hi.

148
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,066
Excited to rehearse
with you later.

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,571
Hey, uh, so, fun fact.

150
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,741
You know that <i>Cabaret</i> was
actually based off a play

151
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,817
called <i>I Am Camera?</i>

152
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,366
Then <i>I Am a Camera</i> was based
off this novel

153
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,988
called <i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i>

154
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,074
And <i>Goodbye to Berlin</i>
was actually based off

155
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,541
Christopher Isherwood's

156
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,748
early years in Berlin.

157
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,871
Wow. That's awesome.
I have homeroom.

158
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:27,876
Yeah. All right.

159
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,340
Well, I think she found
that interesting.

160
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,462
Bye, Martin.

161
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,460
Bye, big boy.

162
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,804
Suraj! Now.

163
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,800
Come on. You know the drill.

164
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,553
<i>I've had an inspiration.
How about</i> The Affair?

165
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,435
No. No. We cannot watch
<i>The Affair</i> as a family.

166
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,523
Why not?

167
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,142
Because it's all
about sex.

168
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,611
Oh, well, God forbid we should
watch people make love.

169
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,528
Oh, God.

170
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,068
Oh, my God.
You guys are so repressed.

171
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,326
Don't therapize us, okay?
We are not your patients.

172
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,573
- We're your family.
- That's true.

173
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,867
If you were my patients, you'd
be much more well-adjusted.

174
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,039
Oh. Nice therapy burn, baby.
Thank you.

175
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,167
She got you.
You know what?

176
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,119
We didn't see last week's
episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

177
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,004
How did that guy
even become the bachelor?

178
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,955
Why?

179
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,457
Well, he's clearly gay.

180
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,501
No, he's not.
Really?

181
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,502
- He's handsome.
- That date, where he took the girl

182
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,095
to the "make your
own perfume" place?

183
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,969
Dad! The producers
plan those dates.

184
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,095
He is so fruity.
He's so fruity.

185
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,385
He's a one-man pride parade.
Are you kidding me?

186
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,056
- He has more chemistry
- Just stop it.

187
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,434
with Chris Harrison
than any of those girls.

188
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,691
After this, I gotta
show you something.

189
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,693
Okay?
Let's watch <i>The Americans.</i>

190
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,612
Every single episode,
you here next to me.

191
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,356
So your mother decided
that we should make

192
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,907
each other anniversary
presents this year.

193
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,201
You know, so they came
from the heart, or some crap.

194
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,657
Anyway, I decided to come up
with this bad boy.

195
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,655
Look at this.

196
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,534
I present to you,
a Jack Spier production.

197
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,246
Wait, wait.

198
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,040
Look at that!

199
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,129
Oh, it's so good.

200
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,099
Look at this.
Wait, wait, wait.

201
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,307
Yup. Okay.

202
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,810
What are you...

203
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,559
Look, this is your
20th anniversary,

204
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,356
so I'm gonna be super real
with you right now.

205
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,650
This looks
like a fourth grader made it.

206
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,191
And not even the smartest
fourth grader in the class.

207
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,067
Just, like,
a deeply average fourth grader.

208
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,823
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

209
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,992
I got fade-ins.
I got dissolves.

210
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,660
- This is beautiful.
- Get up for a second.

211
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,116
I'll help you. Trust me.

212
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,034
We can make this good.
We just gotta put in...

213
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,412
you know, some home video.

214
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,795
Maybe put in some better music.

215
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,335
"Better music"? This was huge
when we were young.

216
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,674
Yeah. So was
Bill Cosby.

217
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,692
- Hey.
<i>- Have you seen the new post?</i>

218
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,312
No. What? Oh, my God.

219
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,858
You know, I'm never getting
back in that pool again.

220
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,153
<i>Wait, no. About the closeted
gay kid at school.</i>

221
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,111
What?

222
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,155
<i>Yeah, it's on</i> CreekSecrets.

223
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,586
<i>Who do you think it is?</i>

224
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,460
<i>I bet it's that sophomore
with the rimless glasses.</i>

225
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,419
<i>I get a vibe.</i>

226
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,091
<i>- Actually.</i>
- Hmm.

227
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,930
<i>Maybe it's Parker O'Malley.</i>

228
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,971
<i>I've heard he's, like,
obsessed with</i> Les Mis.

229
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,676
Oh, gosh. Jeez. I gotta go.

230
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,432
Bieber just took a dump
on the floor.

231
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,687
<i>Aw, Beebs.</i>

232
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,014
<i>- Feed him some rice...</i>
- Can I call you back?

233
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,395
<i>"Sometimes I feel like
I'm stuck on a Ferris wheel.</i>

234
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,280

00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,649

<i>Blue."</i>

240
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,212
Blue. Okay.

241
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,895
<i>Dear Blue,
I'm just like you.</i>

242
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,897
<i>For the most part,
my life is totally normal.</i>

243
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,475
<i>My dad was the annoyingly
handsome quarterback</i>

244
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,854
<i>who married the
hot valedictorian.</i>

245
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,277
<i>And no, they didn't
peak in high school.</i>

246
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,362
<i>I have a sister I actually like.
Not that I'd ever tell her that.</i>

247
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,231
<i>And then, there's my friends.</i>

248
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,533
<i>We do everything friends do.
We drink way too much...</i>

249
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,485
<i>So, like I said,
I'm just like you.</i>

250
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,072
<i>I have a totally,
perfectly normal life.</i>

251
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,490
<i>Except I have one
huge-ass secret.</i>

252
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,524
<i>Jacques.</i>

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,457
Hey. Morning.

254
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,090
Nothin'.

255
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,979
Math is what
we're talking about.

256
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,900
Can anyone answer for me
how we find the value

257
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,689
of "d-y by d-x"

258
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,979
that I have
written up on the board?

259
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,731
Does anyone want to...
Yes! Simon.

260
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,866
Can I go to the bathroom?

261
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,952
Sure, it's fine.

262
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,028
Thanks.

263
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,514
Simon. Simon.

264
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,148
- Yeah.
- Can I get some fries?

265
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,484
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Thanks.

266
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,565
I'm telling you,
the Oakwood Tigers

267
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,443
score so many goals
because they shave their legs.

268
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,357
Garrett, I'm not gonna
shave my legs.

269
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,530
It makes their kicks
more aerodynamic.

270
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,654
- We can just do extra burpees, man.
- Whatever, Bram.

271
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,454
Guys, I just found
a press-on nail in my salad.

272
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,869
Debbie.

273
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,588
Why is there no cell reception
at this school?

274
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,259
I swear to God.

275
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,098
Simonay, Simonay.
Hey.

276
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,229
What are you doing?
You can't text in the halls.

277
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,476
How many times
have I told you that?

278
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,395
I can't have all my students
Tindering it up.

279
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,350
That's my department.

280
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,561
Right.

281
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,565
It actually is.

282
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,529
I got a really hot date
on Tinder tonight.

283
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,197
She is cute!

284
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,786
"Ew! Vice principals can't go
on dates. That's gross."

285
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,287
We're people too, Simon.

286
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,330
We like to go out.
We like to have a good time.

287
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,409
We like to have sex.
That's not a big deal, right?

288
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,788
Yeah, no. No biggie at all.

289
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,461
Actually, you know,
I totally see you as a person.

290
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,754
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Yeah.

291
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,126
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

292
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,297
Seriously.
Yeah. Yeah.

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,500
Could I just get
my phone though?

294
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,005
No. Unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to keep it

295
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,051
until after play practice.

296
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,591
But you will get your precious

297
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,305
after play practice, okay?
I promise.

298
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,057
So how's play practice going?

299
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,884
- Great. Yeah, it's...
- How's Ms. Albright?

300
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,518
She's good.

301
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,471
She's good?
She doesn't like men.

302
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,332
Okay.

303
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,837
Those aren't actual claps.
My hands are tired!

304
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,172
Okay! All right.

305
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,761
That was...

306
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,514
Cal, help me. That was...

307
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,682
That was a start?

308
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,059
That was a start!
Is what it was.

309
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,306
That was a start.

310
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,938
You know, when Mr. Worth
told me that no student,

311
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,899
regardless of talent...

312
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,194
...was to be left out of
my production, I had my doubts.

313
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,111
Yes, I did.

314
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,989
Yeah.

315
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,204
That's it.
That's my whole speech.

316
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,451
Ms. Albright.

317
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,619
Hi.

318
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,543
That was the biggest train
wreck our stage has ever seen.

319
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,165
And Rob and Brianne
were practically

320
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,246
dry humping the whole song.

321
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,755
Oh, I saw.

322
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,218
Save the kissing
for the cast party. All right?

323
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,013
This is war. You're Nazis.
Okay? More anger.

324
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,717
Suraj, stop pretending
that trumpet is your penis!

325
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,135
My boy.

326
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,053
It is a rental.

327
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,434
I was an extra in <i>The Lion King,</i>
and this is where I am.

328
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,480
Hey. What time is it?

329
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,157
Ten minutes since the last time
you asked. Go.

330
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,951
One! Two! Three! Four!

331
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,789
I will kill you.

332
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,867
Oy, yoy, yoy, yoy, yo!

333
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,952
- Mr. Worth.
- Hey, what's up, my brother?

334
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,457
Hey, just here for my phone.

335
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,710
Oh, of course you are.
Of course you are.

336
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,215
How'd you enjoy
being unplugged?

337
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,338
It was great.

338
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,585
- Great, right?
- Yeah.

339
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,295
This isn't life, man.
This is plugged.

340
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,971
- This is unplugged.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,637
- Plugged. Unplugged.
- Yep.

342
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,927
All right, Simon, I know that
I'm hard on you. I really do.

343
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,227
Mm-hmm.

344
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,897
But it's only 'cause I really
see myself in you.

345
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,809
Uh... You know, I don't know
if I'd say that.

346
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,940
No, I see it, it's obvious.
It's obvious.

347
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,187
I know there's a lot

348
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,859
going on there, man.
Yup.

349
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,232
And I bet you
got a lot of questions.

350
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,908
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

351
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,868
No.
You know my policy.

352
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,119
What does it say?

353
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,614
- "Open door. Open ears."
- "Open door. Open ears."

354
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,911
There's nothing
you want to say?

355
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,618
- Nope.
- You sure?

356
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:50,869
Yeah.
Okay.

357
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,295
It's a great sign though.
Thank you.

358
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,588
Thank you.
Now don't text and drive.

359
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,915
That's how my cat got murdered.

360
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,462
Okay.

361
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,052
I'm just kidding.
I don't have cats. I got asthma.

362
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,526
<i>A secret, huh?</i>

363
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,274
<i>Is it the same as my secret?</i>

364
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,658
<i>If it is, when did you know?</i>

365
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,366
<i>Have you told anyone? Blue.</i>

366
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,740
Okay.

367
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,347
<i>No, Blue.
I haven't told anyone.</i>

368
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,221
<i>And, honestly, I can't even
really explain why.</i>

369
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,971
<i>Deep down, I know my family
would be fine with it.</i>

370
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,190
Hey, what rhymes
with "patriarchy"?

371
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,354
That says "patriachy" though.

372
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,060
Oh, shit.

373
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,193
<i>My mom's about
as liberal as they come.</i>

374
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,908
<i>And my dad isn't exactly
the macho type.</i>

375
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,945
<i>I mean, Creekwood's
resident out-gay kid</i>

376
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,119
<i>seems to be doing just fine.</i>

377
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,160
<i>When Ethan came out,
no one even cared.</i>

378
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,871
Guys, I have something
to tell you.

379
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,660
I'm gay.

380
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,831
Wow, really?
That's really great, Ethan.

381
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,632
Oh, my God. No way.

382
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,711
Oh, my God, you are?
I had no idea.

383
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,512
What a complete surprise!

384
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,931
Too much, Claire.

385
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,224
<i>As for how I knew
I was gay,</i>

386
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,013
<i>it was a bunch of
little things.</i>

387
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,349
<i>Like this one recurring dream</i>

388
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,272
<i>I kept having
about Daniel Radcliffe.</i>

389
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,318
<i>And then proceeded to have
every night for a month.</i>

390
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,576
<i>I was obsessed
with Panic! at the Disco.</i>

391
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,121
I can't. He's so cute.
He's so cute.

392
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,667
He's...

393
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,211
Come on,
he's like Jesus and chocolate.

394
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,080
Just look at him.

395
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,289
<i>Then I realized</i>

396
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,840
<i>it really wasn't
about the music.</i>

397
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,001
<i>And then there was
my first girlfriend.</i>

398
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,756
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

399
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,255
Wow. Thank you. Be right back.

400
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,306
<i>Wasn't my proudest moment.</i>

401
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,479
<i>How 'bout you?
How did you know?</i>

402
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,610
<i>Warmly, Jacques.</i>

403
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,658
<i>Fondly, Jacques.</i>

404
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,285
<i>Jacques.</i>

405
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,592
<i>Jacques, don't worry.</i>

406
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,677
<i>If your proudest moment
happened in middle school,</i>

407
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,103
<i>that would be pretty sad.</i>

408
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,976
<i>For me, I realized I liked guys</i>

409
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,056
<i>watching</i> Game of Thrones.

410
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,353
<i>My friends were all
holding their breath</i>

411
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,231
<i>waiting to see
the Dragon Princess's boobs.</i>

412
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,984
<i>I was crushing hard
on Jon Snow.</i>

413
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,361
<i>Well,
I've never told anyone</i>

414
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,989
<i>about my Daniel Radcliffe phase
so now we're even.</i>

415
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,323
<i>And for the record,</i>

416
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,946
<i>I think Jon Snow
is an excellent choice</i>

417
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,155
<i>for your sexual awakening.</i>

418
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,037
<i>So I guess, if I want
to find you at school</i>

419
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,038
<i>I just have to look for
the</i> Game of Thrones <i>fanatic.</i>

420
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:30,964
Wow.

421
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,175
<i>I was just listening to that
M83 song "Reunion,"</i>

422
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,555
<i>and it made me think of you.</i>

423
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,803
<i>You'll probably think
my music taste is lame.</i>

424
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,980
<i>Kind of have the same taste
as my Aunt Sally</i>

425
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,602
<i>who loves show tunes.</i>

426
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,692
<i>Obviously, some of the things
I've told you about myself</i>

427
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,278
<i>are things I've never
talked about with anyone.</i>

428
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,985
<i>There's something about you
that makes me want to open up.</i>

429
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,032
<i>And that's
slightly terrifying for me.</i>

430
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,109
<i>So I've been thinking,</i>

431
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,827
<i>maybe I should be
Jon Snow for Halloween.</i>

432
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,034
<i>What about you?
Who are you gonna be?</i>

433
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,499
<i>I'm not dressing up.</i>

434
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,617
<i>For me, Halloween's
all about the Oreos</i>

435
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,377
<i>with the orange frosting
in the middle.</i>

436
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,006
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

437
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,379
Wow. Look at that smile.
You're glowing, man.

438
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,425
No.
You are glowing.

439
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,377
You look happy.

440
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,587
Oh, just regular.

441
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,717
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

442
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,011
Me too. I'm a little meh.

443
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,260
Why "meh"?

444
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,851
Oh, I had my big Tinder date
last night. Oh, God.

445
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,936
She was not into it.

446
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,524
At. All.

447
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,982
- Oh, come on. Too soon.
- No.

448
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,397
The bell is a buzzkill.

449
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,739
- See you, Mr. Worth.
- All right.

450
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,905
Well, thank you
for your help, <i>Fräulein.</i>

451
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:34,861
You're welcome.

452
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,581
German accent for <i>Cabaret.</i>
Yup. Take care, Ms. Bradley.

453
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:40,909
Ladies.

454
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,042
Let's see what you got,
interwebs.

455
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,556
Here are your burnt tots,
because you have horrible taste.

456
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:56,716
Here's your green banana,

457
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,093
because you like
disgusting things.

458
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,678
Mm-hm.
- Wow, you guys are weird.

459
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,431
Yup. They're practically
Cantonese twins.

460
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,520
Siamese.
Yeah. Siamese.

461
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah, agree to disagree.

462
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,268
I don't think
that's one of those

463
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,353
things where you can
agree to disagree.

464
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,312
agree.
It's just right.

465
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,773
To each his own.

466
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,191
Oreos.

467
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,443
Man, I love those.

468
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,074
Halloween ones
are the best, right?

469
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,162
Yeah.

470
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,953
Er, so, guys, I have great news.

471
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,375
My aunt's boyfriend

472
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,453
just took off with her car
and all her jewelry.

473
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,037
Bram, that's
terrible news!

474
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,163
I know, but it's like,

475
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,418
the third time
it's happened to her.

476
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,882
She has really
bad taste in men.

477
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:34,046
Anyways, my mom is going down
to Orlando to deal with it

478
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,973
which means I get to throw
a Halloween party.

479
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,933
Awesome!
Yay!

480
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,884
Nice!

481
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,811
Thank you,
Bram's dumb-ass aunt!

482
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,267
All right, this is
gonna be epic, you guys.

483
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,098
I can bring
my karaoke machine.

484
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,517
All right, hey, guys,
Halloween party Friday night!

485
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,144
Friday night, Halloween party,
okay? Bram's house!

486
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,230
- You really set this in motion, man.
- I know, right?

487
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,230
Hey, little guy.

488
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,573
Me?
Halloween party.

489
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,693
Friday night.
Bram's house. Be there.

490
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,243
- You're gonna freak him out, man.
- Yeah.

491
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,074
I know.
He's, like, nine years old.

492
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,751
<i>Very relieved that
we're in agreement on Oreos.</i>

493
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,959
<i>That would have been
a deal-breaker for me.</i>

494
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,300
<i>On a totally different,
non-cookie related note...</i>

495
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,512
<i>is it weird that I have no idea
what you look like,</i>

496
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,560
but I can't stop thinking
about kissing you.

497
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,439
Simon. Simon.

498
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,941
Eyes on your own test.

499
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,616
Don't stop on my account,
Rob and Brianne.

500
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,368
That's the most action
I've seen in weeks.

501
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,826
What do we got here? Ah!
When we're done, it's gonna look

502
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,627
like a real German sex club.
Don't ask me how I know.

503
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,672
Hey! Hey!

504
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,092
The spray paint is for painting,
not for huffing.

505
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,044
You don't want
to get good at that.

506
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,137
Okay, do you guys think
I should dye my hair grey

507
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,180
- to play <i>Fräulein</i> Schneider?
- Sure.

508
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,758
Really? But my hair
is kind of like my thing.

509
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,343
I'm gonna go get a soda.

510
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:04,393
Do you want anything?

511
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,017
- No.
- You disgust me.

512
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,778
Simon! Hey, hey, hey.

513
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,283
Hey, Martin.
Buddy.

514
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,780
Hey, um, I used the computer
in the library right after you.

515
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:24,952
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

516
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,702
Well, I went to Gmail,
and it pulled up your account.

517
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,920
And I, uh, read
some of your emails.

518
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,209
I know
I probably shouldn't've,

519
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,006
but they were, like,
right there.

520
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,216
So you'll be interested
to know my brother's gay.

521
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,092
No. Martin, that wouldn't
interest me to know.

522
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,097
Okay. Don't worry.
I won't show anyone.

523
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,599
Show anyone what?

524
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,725
Did you print my emails
or something?

525
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,776
Oh, no, no.

526
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,854
I screenshot them.

527
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,276
- You screenshotted my emails?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

528
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,649
Let me talk to you for a second.

529
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,823
- Oh, Ms. Bradley.
- Hello, Martin.

530
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,200
- Did you feather your hair?
- No, Martin. Shh.

531
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,539
Looking good, huh?

532
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,415
This is a good section.

533
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,743
Jeez.

534
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,330
Now, why the hell
did you screenshot my emails?

535
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,716
Ah, well, you and Abby Susso
are good friends. Right?

536
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,755
Yeah. We know each other.

537
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,926
What does that have
to do with anything?

538
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,880
Well, I need you to help me
talk with her...

539
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,257
and hang out with her
and stuff, you know?

540
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,759
Why would I help you do that?

541
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,974
Are you blackmailing me?

542
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,019
Oh, shh! Okay. Don't be
so dramatic here, Simon.

543
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:32,974
Sup, Tyler?

544
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,105
What's up, Tyler?
Is that a Patagonia?

545
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,234
Nice. I just like her.

546
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,448
And I think
that you could help me.

547
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,740
Yeah, what if I say no, Martin?
I mean, what are you gonna do?

548
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,079
You gonna tell the whole school
that I'm...

549
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,201
You're gonna leak my emails?

550
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,908
You're gonna post 'em
on <i>CreekSecrets?</i>

551
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,868
I just think
that we're in a position here,

552
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,079
where we could help
each other out is all.

553
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,206
So think about it.

554
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,128
Good talk.

555
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,933
You know, I never thought
of a pepper

556
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,477
as being a vegetable...

557
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,641
...but it makes perfect sense.

558
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,765
I like the cilantro.
A little Mexican flair, huh?

559
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,191
Very creative, kiddo.

560
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,644
You hate the peppers.
Don't you?

561
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,195
No. The peppers are great.

562
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,907
I'm just gonna get some air.

563
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,663
<i>Jacques, I have to get
something off my chest.</i>

564
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,548
<i>The other day, you asked me
what I was wearing for Halloween</i>

565
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,843
<i>and I said
I wasn't dressing up.</i>

566
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,053
<i>I lied. Truth is,</i>

567
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,801
<i>I didn't want you to know
what I was wearing</i>

568
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,008
<i>because I don't want you
to know who I am.</i>

569
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,435
<i>Right now, these emails,
they feel like</i>

570
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,013
<i>this totally safe place.</i>

571
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,936
<i>I'm just not ready
for my whole world to change.</i>

572
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,483
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

573
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,656
<i>Yes, Blue. I understand.</i>

574
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,680
Okay, if you want me
to help you with Abby,

575
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,847
you cannot eat that.

576
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,341
So you're gonna help me?

577
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,767
Yeah.

578
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,933
Simon, that is fantastic news.

579
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,980
I really think that Abby and I
are meant to be together.

580
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,277
Really? Do you?
Mm-hmm.

581
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,774
It's not all about looks,
Simon.

582
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,277
Okay. So you're banking
on your great,

583
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,404
blackmaily personality
to get the job done?

584
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,575
Where are we going?

585
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,573
Your place.

586
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,821
We're gonna see
if you have anything

587
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,322
that doesn't scream
"punch me."

588
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,244
Actually, I've got swim lessons.

589
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,742
Cancel it!

590
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,828
Okay, I just have to
call my mom first.

591
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,005
She has to approve everybody
that comes in the house.

592
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,046
All right. Here we go.

593
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,179
All right. And here we are.

594
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,885
This is where the magic happens.

595
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,008
Wow.

596
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,636
Ooh. Correction.

597
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,347
This is where the magic happens.

598
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,813
I've been dabbling
in close-up illusions.

599
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,101
Does Abby like magic?

600
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,478
No. Martin, I don't think
she does like magic.

601
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,109
But, um,
there's a really thin line

602
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,987
between laughing with someone,
and laughing at someone.

603
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,660
And you are that line.

604
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,078
So, if you want
Abby to like you,

605
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,530
what you have to do
is you have to

606
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,031
make her see you
as more of a...

607
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,248
As sexy Martin!

608
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,085
Yeah! Yeah, I could be sexy.

609
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,372
You like dudes. Tell me.

610
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,965
What part of me
do you find the hottest?

611
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,127
- No. I'm not doing this.
- No. Come on.

612
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,631
No, Martin.
I don't want to answer that.

613
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,963
Look, if you said my shoulders

614
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,424
I would dress to accentuate.
You know?

615
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,433
You know what?
Here's your first tip.

616
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,468
Ripped.

617
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,469
Girls,

618
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,763
they don't want
to read your clothes.

619
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,307
I think you're wrong
about that one.

620
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,975
- How many of these do you have?
- Hey, can you...

621
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,237
Please, just stop! Hey! Stop!

622
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,236
Look, I don't want your help
in changing me.

623
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,202
I want your help in getting
Abby to like me for me.

624
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,031
Look. Um...

625
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,874
there's a party this Saturday.
At Bram's.

626
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,336
Do you want to go
with my friends and I?

627
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,674
Yes!

628
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,093
Yes! So simple.

629
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,425
Must be why
they call you Simple Simon.

630
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,348
Nobody calls me that, Martin.

631
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,552
Hey, uh, do you want to,
like, sleep over?

632
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,136
Nope.

633
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,530
Oh, hello.

634
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,400
Hey, what's up?

635
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,777
- Nice, right?
- Nick.

636
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,777
Good?

637
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,155
This is, like, a new level of
laziness, even for you.

638
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,829
What do you mean?
I'm Cristiano Ronaldo.

639
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,908
And you couldn't
even be bothered

640
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,334
to fill in the letters
on the back?

641
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,586
No, come on. Give me that.

642
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,752
You are a bully.

643
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,127
Hey. Don't
talk about Yoko that way, man.

644
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,717
Because if you do,
you're out of the band.

645
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,176
Who are you guys
supposed to be?

646
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,426
John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

647
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,978
Oh! I thought she was the girl
from <i>The Ring,</i>

648
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,355
and you were Jesus.

649
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,600
Jesus? No. Why would Jesus be
wearing a white suit?

650
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,942
I don't know. You tell me.

651
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,894
You're the one who decided to
dress up like fancy Jesus.

652
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,441
Oh, my God. Okay. Come here.

653
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:31,689
Turn around.
I'm here.

654
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,648
Turn around.
Okay.

655
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,405
Okay. Way better.
Is it good? Is it?

656
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,952
Yeah. Now, we need to do
something about this hair.

657
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,154
Maybe slick it back?

658
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,035
It doesn't do that.
It doesn't slick back.

659
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,866
Wonder Woman in the hizzy!

660
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,950
Hi!

661
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,493
I made up a catchphrase,

662
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,128
'cause Wonder Woman
doesn't have one.

663
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,539
"Hizzy" means house.

664
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,839
Yeah.
Yeah.

665
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,916
Right. Yeah.
Yeah.

666
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,294
Oh, Abby,
you look amazing.

667
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,469
Thank you!

668
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,968
Yeah.
You look awesome.

669
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,596
I'm gonna go make
those frozen pizzas.

670
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,345
- All right.
- Yeah, I'll help.

671
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,685
That's a nice costume,
for real.

672
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,983
Thank you.
What? Cristiano Ronaldo!

673
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:08,934
Nailed it.

674
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,146
Do you remember
when we went to school

675
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,229
dressed as Charlie's Angels?

676
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,776
Oh, my God, yes.

677
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,532
And Nick's balls fell out
of his booty shorts

678
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,110
when he, like, dropped down
to do the gun pose?

679
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,571
Mm. Do you miss
trick-or-treating?

680
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,911
What, you mean instead of, like,
going to loud parties

681
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,208
pretending to like
the taste of beer

682
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,580
and feeling too
self-conscious to dance?

683
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,579
I don't know why
you feel self-conscious.

684
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,913
I mean,

685
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,670
you are very clearly the coolest
person at our school.

686
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,337
I'm pretty sure you're
the only one who feels that way.

687
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,467
But thank you.

688
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,261
Who's that?

689
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,226
I invited Martin.

690
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,932
Martin Addison?
Why?

691
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,684
Is this a Make-A-Wish situation?

692
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,444
No, he's cool.

693
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,649
Hey.

694
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,112
Oh, looking sharp.

695
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,610
What the...

696
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,866
- Guys.
- What are you supposed to be?

697
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,285
Isn't it obvious?

698
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,242
Ah! I'm a Freudian slip.

699
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,629
Abby. Wonder Woman.

700
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,339
<i>Just pick a song already.</i>

701
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,887
Hey, Nick, uh,
can you not rush me?

702
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,303
Honestly, I can't
choose. There's so many.

703
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,259
That's like Netflix.

704
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,390
You know, trying to pick
a film on Netflix.

705
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,640
I'm like...
"Am I in an Apatow mood,

706
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,271
or am I in a Billy Wilder
mood?" You know?

707
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,273
Ooh, play Drake. Yes.

708
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,401
Uh, no. Drake is, like,
super played out at this point.

709
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,150
You can't play out a rap god.
Doesn't happen.

710
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,155
Impossible.
First of all,

711
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,448
he's not a rap god.

712
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,575
And second of all,
I'm looking for some Beyoncé.

713
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,122
Oh.
I just can't find "Lemonade."

714
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,995
Hey. Here's an
interesting question.

715
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:47,950
I love Beyoncé.

716
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,125
What makes you
guys feel nostalgic?

717
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,077
You do?

718
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,537
I mean, I think everybody
kinda likes Beyoncé.

719
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,507
Mine's grape soda makes me
feel very nostalgic.

720
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,630
What are you talking about?
What makes you feel nostalgic?

721
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,340
Hey, Abby.

722
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,509
I bet you're gonna have
the best costume tonight.

723
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,174
Thanks.
Nah, you're welcome.

724
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,304
What the hell, Spier?

725
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,814
Hey, why is Nick
still flirting with Abby?

726
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,016
I don't know, Martin.

727
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,604
Maybe you shouldn't
have worn a dress.

728
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,770
You look like a drag queen

729
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,400
rolled around
in magnetic poetry.

730
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,362
Hey, Abby!

731
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,319
Whenever you need a refill
of your drink,

732
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,987
I'll be
your designated bartender.

733
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,162
So don't worry.

734
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,283
Okay. Hey, Chloe,
come here!

735
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,954
Yo, yo, yo!

736
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,583
Hey. John Lennon?

737
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,163
- Yeah. You got it.
- Nice.

738
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,131
And, um, Nick you're...

739
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,250
You're Nick.

740
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,343
No. No. I'm Ronaldo.

741
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,384
- Oh. My bad.
- Obviously.

742
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,593
Who are you supposed to be?

743
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:47,142
Oh. Uh... I am post-presidency
Barack Obama.

744
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,520
So I'm just chillin' in
Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais,

745
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,766
writing memoirs and hoping
Trump doesn't destroy my legacy.

746
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,143
That's awesome.

747
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,812
Thanks. Now let's go
to the bar. Come on.

748
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,192
Yeah.

749
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,363
Hell yeah.

750
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,916
All right, we should
have a little toast.

751
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,963
No, thanks. I'm driving.
And Simon doesn't really drink.

752
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,461
No, I drink.
It's cool. I drink.

753
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,001
- All right, that's my man.
- Really?

754
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,382
You wouldn't even have a glass
of Manischewitz at Leah's Seder.

755
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,805
No, it's Halloween, man.
It's a special occasion.

756
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,428
True that.

757
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,096
Cheers.

758
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,564
You okay?

759
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,020
You're good at this.
You got this.

760
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,656
Abby is the hottest
Wonder Woman I have ever seen.

761
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,699
Yeah.

762
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,663
The shit that I would let her
do to me with that lasso.

763
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,077
Oh, I know, man.

764
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,534
Just, like, tie me up
with that thing.

765
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,081
You're not into Abby, are you?

766
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,329
No, no, no.

767
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,626
I mean, it's not like I...
She's cute...

768
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,628
Yeah.
...but she's just

769
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,840
not really my type.

770
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,213
Not because she's black.
I love black women.

771
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,723
Not like, you know, I have
a thing for black women,

772
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,550
I just love all women.

773
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,011
MARTIN

774
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,979
Oh, oh. Oh!
Oh!

775
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:17,350
Oh, hey.
Hey! Oh, hey.

776
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,436
Hey. Mm.

777
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,573
I'm gonna go ask her out.
What? No.

778
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,617
No? No?
No.

779
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,239
- You can't ask Abby out.
- Why not?

780
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:33,116
Because. She didn't tell you
about Jonathan?

781
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,332
She didn't tell you about that?
No

782
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,375
He's older.

783
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,749
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
In college.

784
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,292
He's really experienced.

785
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,417
You know I've only
had sex once, right?

786
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,418
I know that.

787
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,628
You know,
it's like no one tells you

788
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,803
how dark everything is

789
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,428
and how slippery everything
gets, and, you know,

790
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,849
the parts you think
are the right parts

791
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,096
are actually
the wrong parts and...

792
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,558
All right, I'm gonna go eat
my feelings away.

793
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,977
Man, I'm sorry...

794
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,433
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

795
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,819
Whoa, whoa.

796
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,826
- Hey, Simon!
- Hey.

797
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,236
Hey, you wanna play Beirut?

798
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,574
Yeah. Sure.

799
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,330
We just need two more people.

800
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,749
How about you and me,
and then, um...

801
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,660
Let me pour. I insist.

802
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,952
Abby and Martin?

803
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,917
- Okay, cool.
- Hey, Martin.

804
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:21,997
- Yeah.
- Abby.

805
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,461
Let's play Beirut.

806
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,133
No, I don't...
Yeah. Let's do it.

807
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,761
Come on, let's go.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

808
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,801
Good old competition.

809
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,757
Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

810
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,635
Beirut. Right?

811
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,640
Yes!

812
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,517
Okay. Have you ever played
Beirut before?

813
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,102
Uh, totally. Yeah.

814
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,811
Great. All right, so,
two reracks, no blowing

815
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:43,985
and two balls
in the cup means

816
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,188
that you have
to take three, okay?

817
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,359
Okay. Cool.

818
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,774
I thought we were talking
about a different game.

819
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,234
We'll just explain
as we go. Okay?

820
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,318
- Yeah.
- Okay. Got it.

821
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,323
Ready?

822
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,824
Maybe you should
take these...

823
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:54,868
Oh.

824
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,615
You'll see better.

825
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,083
Right?
Good idea. Yeah.

826
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,745
- All you.
- Raindrop!

827
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,671
Here we go, all right.
You got this one.

828
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,207
Oh, is that...
This is mine to drink?

829
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,668
God.

830
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:09,837
Oh!

831
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,589
All right.

832
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,266
Chug! Chug! Chug!

833
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,057
Do we need a handshake?
Is that...

834
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,350
You get one of these in

835
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,768
and we can totally
have a handshake.

836
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,812
Fly it away. Fly it away.

837
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,941
Chug, chug, chug.

838
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,528
- Sweet!
- All right.

839
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,863
Hey, Bram. It's me, Jacques.

840
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,529
Hey, Bram. I'm Jacques.

841
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,203
Hey, Barack. It's me, Jacques.

842
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:23,744
Why did I pick Jacques?

843
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,372
Yeah, no problem.

844
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:42,638
Oh.

845
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,599
I'm sorry, I thought
this was the bathroom.

846
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,769
Sorry.

847
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,699
- I'm starting to get so tired!
- I am so tired.

848
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,035
Hey, Martin, not now, man.
All right? I've had a big night.

849
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,162
Oh!

850
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,836
Really? Really?

851
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,967
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,636
Come on!

853
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,133
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

854
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,112
Okay, come on.
We gotta get you home.

855
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,405
Look, we're so close!

856
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,451
Oh, my God!

857
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,403
Wait, what?

858
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,996
Dude, my parents are still up.

859
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,240
Oh, God.

860
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,289
Oh...
Okay, you know what...

861
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,287
Come on.

862
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,831
I need you to think of
something really sad...

863
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:47,786
Uh-huh.

864
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,712
Like, the documentary
about how all the whales

865
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:50,755
hate living at SeaWorld.

866
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:51,873
Too sad!

867
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,129
God. Okay, then just,
you know what,

868
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,209
don't say anything at all...

869
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,632
And we'll ditch the barf shirt
till tomorrow.

870
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,588
Okay.

871
00:41:58,975 --> 00:41:59,965
- Si?
- Yeah.

872
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,933
Just as little as possible,

873
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,101
say as little as possible.

874
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,479
So how does that work?

875
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,360
I know, I remember
when I went to...

876
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,773
Hey, guys!

877
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,325
Hey!
Hey!

878
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:20,865
Come talk to us.
Hey!

879
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,871
How was the party?
It was really fun.

880
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:23,910
Was it?
Yeah.

881
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,323
Aces.

882
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,752
Huh.

883
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,464
Uh, well. Thanks for
letting me stay over.

884
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,041
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

885
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,043
You've been
staying over 10 years.

886
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,719
You don't have to thank us.

887
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,796
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

888
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,844
Stop. Shh!

889
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,387
John Lennon was wearing
a woman's sweater.

890
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,939
Mm.
And he's drunk.

891
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,899
Definitely.
So how do we feel about that?

892
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,726
Well, he didn't drive drunk,

893
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,277
and he's home
before curfew, so...

894
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,106
Good. That's what I thought
we thought.

895
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,694
Yeah, that's what
we think, right?

896
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,026
Yeah. We're good parents.

897
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,155
Yeah, we're good parents.
Right?

898
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,495
The room stopped spinning.

899
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,052
Do you ever feel weird?

900
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,178
Weird?
Yeah.

901
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,767
Sometimes I feel like
I'm always on the outside.

902
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,859
What do you mean?

903
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,146
Like tonight, you know...

904
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,822
I was at that party,
and it was fun, but...

905
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,322
it kinda felt like I was

906
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,240
watching it
from across the room.

907
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,623
I don't know,
there's this invisible line

908
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,746
that I have to cross to really
be a part of everything

909
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,419
and I just,
I can't ever cross it.

910
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,710
I feel that way
sometimes, too.

911
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,925
Not tonight you didn't.

912
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,677
Yeah, I was trying something.

913
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,006
Yeah, sometimes I think
it'd be so much easier

914
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,592
to be one of these people who
can just take a few shots

915
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,393
and then hook up
with whoever's closest.

916
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,063
Yeah, I guess
I'm just unlucky.

917
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,189
Unlucky?

918
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,691
Why?

919
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,188
Because I'm not
a casual person.

920
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,775
What kind of person are you?

921
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,166
I think I'm the kind of person
who is destined to care so much

922
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,993
about one person,
it nearly kills me.

923
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,378
Me too.

924
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,387
It's getting late.

925
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,275
Si?

926
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,285
Yeah?

927
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,486
Good night.

928
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,281
Good night.

929
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,304
<i>Dear Blue,</i>

930
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,973
<i>so one of my friends
likes the other,</i>

931
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,527
<i>and he has no idea.
I guess we all have secrets.</i>

932
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,068
<i>Anyway, I've been thinking about
why I haven't come out yet.</i>

933
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,824
<i>Maybe it's because
it doesn't seem fair</i>

934
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,573
<i>that only gay people
have to come out.</i>

935
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,074
<i>Why is straight the default?</i>

936
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,539
I have something
I need to tell you.

937
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,079
Mom, there's something
I have to tell you.

938
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,247
Can we talk?

939
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:57,415
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

940
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,088
I'm straight.

941
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,798
I'm sorry, Mom, it's true.

942
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,208
I like girls.

943
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,753
I like men.

944
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,096
You get that
from your daddy's side.

945
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,678
I'm in love with Nick.

946
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,595
I feel like I've been raising
a stranger.

947
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,096
Yes, absolutely, you have.

948
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,643
I'm heterosexual.

949
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,855
Oh, God. Help me, Jesus. Please.

950
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,694
<i>Or maybe it's because
I can't be sure</i>

951
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,399
<i>this whole "being gay" thing
is forever.</i>

952
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,065
<i>Or maybe it's that there's
not that much</i>

953
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,325
<i>of high school left and part
of me wants to hold on to</i>

954
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,744
<i>who I've always been
just a little longer.</i>

955
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,204
<i>And then, when I go to college
in Los Angeles,</i>

956
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,206
<i>I'll be gay and proud,
I promise.</i>

957
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,296
Yeah, maybe not that gay.

958
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,755
<i>I'm not sure
who I'm promising.</i>

959
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,640
<i>I'll keep ruminating.</i>

960
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,054
<i>Love, Jacques.</i>

961
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,938
Shit!

962
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,449
So, yeah,
after swimming with dolphins,

963
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,401
we fly to Saint Martin
for New Year's.

964
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,946
Anybody else,
Christmas in the Caribbean?

965
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,701
Staying here.

966
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:59,658
We have a classic
Spier tradition

967
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,535
of French toast
on Christmas Eve.

968
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,537
I'm going to an unheated
vacation house

969
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:04,542
in the middle of nowhere.

970
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,665
As is our bleak
family tradition.

971
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,839
Ow! Ow!

972
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,720
Oh, man. Oh.
You okay?

973
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,384
Oh, yeah, that's a paper cut.

974
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,258
Overdramatic.

975
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,137
Um, Simon, do you know
where the bandages are?

976
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,848
Yeah. They're just
in the supply closet.

977
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,683
Okay, do you mind showing me?

978
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,603
Be right back.

979
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,197
He's like a nurse, this man.

980
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,697
Okay, I don't actually have
a paper cut.

981
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,653
I know that, Martin.
You're a very bad actor.

982
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,576
What, you think this is funny?

983
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,493
Simon, look,
I don't wanna have to

984
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,373
leak your emails, all right?
But I will.

985
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,296
Look, you cannot
bring Blue into this, okay?

986
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,669
If he found out
that my emails got leaked,

987
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,216
he'd get totally freaked,
all right?

988
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,300
He'd never talk to me again.

989
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,920
Yeah, probably not, you know?

990
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,838
The Internet's a freaky place
to meet people.

991
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,465
Yo.
Hey!

992
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,424
Hey!

993
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,975
Fun movie! Freak.
<i>Freaky Friday.</i>

994
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,053
That's a fun movie!
Freaky, freak, freaky.

995
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,734
I need a Band-Aid.
Those programs are a bitch.

996
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,523
Erm, yo. Martin was having
trouble running his lines

997
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,326
and we were thinking we could go
to Waffle House and go over 'em.

998
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:18,494
- Really?
- Yeah.

999
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,446
That would be great.

1000
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,160
I'm insky.

1001
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,619
Good work, Spier.
Go to hell, Martin.

1002
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,963
<i>Jacques,
if I were a betting man,</i>

1003
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,341
<i>I'd say you were drunk emailing
me during that last letter.</i>

1004
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,430
<i>Don't worry. I liked it.</i>

1005
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,682
<i>As for coming out,
I know what you mean</i>

1006
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,979
<i>about wanting to wait
till college.</i>

1007
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,689
<i>But our emails
have inspired me.</i>

1008
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,768
<i>I'm going to tell my family.
So thanks, Jacques.</i>

1009
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,103
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

1010
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:07,827
Yeah.

1011
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,247
Hey!

1012
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,004
- Madame.
- Oh.

1013
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,671
Simon...

1014
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,507
How the thespians
rehearse, right?

1015
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,512
Hey, guys.

1016
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,267
What can I get you?

1017
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,104
Lyle! You guys know Lyle?
We have Latin together.

1018
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,518
I don't think so.

1019
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,023
Hi. How's it going?

1020
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,726
Actually, we had Bio together
last year?

1021
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,145
- Oh, really?
- It's Simon, right?

1022
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,193
Yeah. Yeah, sorry,
I don't, um...

1023
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,317
It's okay.
It was like a big class,

1024
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,784
and I have a good
memory for faces.

1025
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,491
What can I get you guys?

1026
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,538
Well, we plan
on being here for a while.

1027
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,450
So, we're gonna start off small
and go larger.

1028
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,292
Probably get some bacon first,
some sausage. I'd say...

1029
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,966
<i>"You're right. I'm much
too strange and extraordinary.</i>

1030
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,753
Much! And much too distracting!"

1031
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,178
Wow.

1032
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,715
And you never did any acting
at your old school?

1033
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,888
No. Can we get back to...

1034
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,561
And yet,
you're from D.C., right?

1035
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,013
Yeah. Can you give me
my next cue, though?

1036
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,769
So why
did you move here?

1037
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,142
Because my parents got divorced

1038
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,019
and my aunt found us
an apartment in her building.

1039
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,654
- Why'd they get divorced?
- Why does it matter, Martin?

1040
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,023
Are you writing
a book about girls

1041
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,528
from a broken home in D.C.?

1042
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:21,780
So?

1043
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,117
I thought that my dad

1044
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,832
was the greatest
person on the planet.

1045
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:33,334
But it turns out that he's
just a sad, tired loser

1046
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,874
who hates his job,
drinks way too much beer,

1047
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,296
and cheats on his wife.

1048
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,216
To make up for all the stuff
that I just mentioned, so...

1049
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,763
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1050
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,381
Yeah.

1051
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,425
You deserve the father
that you thought you had.

1052
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,683
You know what, Abby?

1053
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,312
You deserve
a goddamn superhero.

1054
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,356
Okay, thank you.
Let's get back to the...

1055
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,437
Say it.

1056
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,023
What?

1057
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,033
I wanna hear you say,

1058
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:06,120
"I, Abby Susso,
am an incredible young woman

1059
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,574
and deserve
a goddamn superhero."

1060
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,369
I'm not gonna say that, Martin.

1061
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,082
Okay. Well, um...

1062
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,456
I won't stop until you say it.

1063
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,249
Okay.

1064
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,086
What are you...
Excuse me.

1065
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,929
- Waffle House patrons!
- Martin. Martin, stop.

1066
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,597
- Pardon the interruption.
- Martin.

1067
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,058
I would just like to say
that Abby Susso here

1068
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,434
is an incredible young woman.

1069
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,636
Martin, please.

1070
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,813
And deserves
a goddamn superhero.

1071
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,148
- Okay, okay...
- That's right. Abby Susso!

1072
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,566
Abby Susso
I'm Abby Susso!

1073
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,477
- is an incredible young woman!
- I'm Abby Susso!

1074
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,071
Incredible young woman,
and deserves...

1075
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,948
A goddamn superhero.
A goddamn superhero.

1076
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,900
A goddamn superhero!
A goddamn superhero!

1077
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,618
A goddamn superhero!

1078
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,159
Yeah.

1079
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,169
All right.

1080
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,664
Breakthrough. Yeah.

1081
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,084
Okay, you can all go back
to your meals. Thank you.

1082
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,669
Please sit down. Please.

1083
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,219
Well...

1084
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,598
Well, let's get back to...

1085
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,270
my entrance into your song.
I'm gonna take five.

1086
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,228
"Ah, the Kit Kat Klub
proudly presents...

1087
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,271
I'll be right back.

1088
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,193
...a beautiful woman
coming straight from England."

1089
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,904
<i>Sally Bowles, everybody."</i>

1090
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,199
Hey.

1091
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,000
Were you in Bio when they did
that identifying leaves test?

1092
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,665
Yes. And Joel Winslow
ate that poison ivy.

1093
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,542
Because Doug Fogerty told him
it was pot.

1094
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,177
- Right.
- Poor Joel.

1095
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,671
I think he just wants
to be liked 'cause...

1096
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,471
you ever notice that he has
extra pens in his backpack?

1097
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:53,429
Like, you know,
he's just waiting for the day

1098
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,388
that someone comes up
to ask him for a pen?

1099
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,150
And then he can be that guy
to give 'em a pen.

1100
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,898
You see everything,
don't you, Simon?

1101
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,362
I don't know.

1102
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,066
But Simon means
"the one who hears"

1103
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,284
and Spier means
"the one who sees"

1104
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,578
so you put that all together

1105
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,407
and pretty sure that means
I was just destined

1106
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:14,749
to be up
in everybody's business.

1107
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,041
I've gotta get back inside

1108
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,459
and scrub down
some waffle irons.

1109
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,957
Duty calls.
Indeed.

1110
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,210
I'll see you in there.

1111
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,844
Yeah, I'll see ya.

1112
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,645
Hi.

1113
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,323
<i>So my dad's flying in
tonight for Hanukkah.</i>

1114
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,615
<i>If you are thinking,</i>

1115
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,113
<i>"But Hanukkah isn't
for another month!"</i>

1116
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,661
<i>Well, you are correct.</i>

1117
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,114
<i>Welcome to navigating
divorced parents.</i>

1118
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,411
<i>Take holidays
where you can get them.</i>

1119
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,411
<i>And my dad's staying at the
same crappy motel as always.</i>

1120
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,371
<i>We'll do all our
horribly awkward traditions.</i>

1121
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,171
<i>We'll light the menorah
and I'll silently pray</i>

1122
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,842
<i>that the sprinklers
don't go off.</i>

1123
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,632
<i>That's happened twice before.</i>

1124
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,682
Would you believe I'm
considering doubling down

1125
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,012
and turning
this whole awkward mess

1126
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,718
into a coming out thing?

1127
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,016
<i>Do you think I'm crazy?</i>

1128
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,640
<i>No, Blue,
I don't think you're crazy.</i>

1129
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,025
<i>I think you're crazy brave.</i>

1130
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,167
Honestly, Martin used to
annoy the crap out of me.

1131
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,337
But he's actually kind of
a cool person.

1132
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,549
I've been meaning to ask you
about your parents.

1133
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,630
I just didn't wanna say anything

1134
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,927
when we were actually
in the restaurant.

1135
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,842
I wasn't sure if you
wanted to talk about it.

1136
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,390
Yeah. No, I don't mention it
a lot

1137
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,097
because it kind of messes
with my image.

1138
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,266
What kind of image?

1139
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:05,318
The girl who is excited to start
a new school senior year.

1140
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,613
Girl whose life didn't
just end, like, three months ago,

1141
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,942
who's angry and sad
all the time.

1142
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,037
Girl who still believes in love.

1143
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,873
Come on.
You still believe in love.

1144
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:21,909
Maybe.

1145
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:23,878
Have you ever been in love?

1146
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:28,709
I think so.

1147
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:44,432
Abby.

1148
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:46,559
Yeah?

1149
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,938
I'm gay.

1150
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,775
Oh.

1151
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,074
You can't tell anyone though.

1152
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,369
Nobody really knows,

1153
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,329
and I don't really want people
to find out.

1154
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,830
I won't. I promise.

1155
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,119
Okay.

1156
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,418
You surprised?

1157
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,885
No.

1158
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,885
So you knew?
No.

1159
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,599
But you're not surprised?

1160
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,137
Do you want me
to be surprised?

1161
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,847
I don't know.

1162
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,141
Okay.

1163
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,189
Well, I love you.

1164
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,437
So...

1165
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,697
Love you, too.

1166
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,418
There's no one behind us.

1167
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:54,593
You don't have to put
your blinker on.

1168
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,636
Okay, just being safe.
Yeah.

1169
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,029
<i>Dear Blue, I hope
it goes okay with your dad.</i>

1170
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,774
<i>Whatever happens,
you inspired me.</i>

1171
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,030
<i>I came out
to my friend tonight.</i>

1172
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,907
<i>And I never would have
done that without you.</i>

1173
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,029
<i>Maybe we should ride
this bravery train</i>

1174
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,531
<i>and reveal our identities.</i>

1175
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,534
<i>I'm dying to know who you are.
Love, Jacques.</i>

1176
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,388
<i>I told my dad.</i>

1177
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,843
<i>It was insanely awkward.
But also, kind of fine.</i>

1178
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,516
<i>And you got it backwards.</i>

1179
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,689
<i>It's you who inspires me.</i>

1180
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,943
<i>But I'm sorry,</i>

1181
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,071
<i>I'm just not ready for us to
know each other's identities.</i>

1182
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,446
<i>Love, Blue.</i>

1183
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,662
Hey! What are you doing?
I'm a fry shark!

1184
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,661
Yeah!

1185
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,418
- That is good.
- You're a good fry shark.

1186
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,961
- Thank you, thank you.
- I like that.

1187
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,255
I didn't even know
you were coming near.

1188
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,089
- You know what day it is?
- What day is it?

1189
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,082
Must be Friday!

1190
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,042
Oh!

1191
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,710
I guess I'm being loved,
right? Right?

1192
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,345
Yeah.
Excuse me.

1193
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,297
Hey, what do you get
when you get black and Jewish?

1194
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,807
- What?
- Bluish.

1195
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,137
That's mean.
Simon?

1196
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,637
Since when does Abby find
Martin so goddamn funny?

1197
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,305
Yeah, it's crazy.

1198
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,232
You know,
this is stupid.

1199
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,854
I'm just gonna tell her
that I like her.

1200
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,900
And I've been thinking

1201
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:35,145
the whole sexual
experience thing,

1202
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,399
it's not that big of a deal.

1203
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,731
And, actually,
I've been practicing, right?

1204
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,156
I got this thing online.
It's really cool.

1205
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,071
It's called a pocket puss...
Abby likes Martin.

1206
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,320
She told me herself.

1207
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,822
But he's Martin.
I know.

1208
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,041
Look, I don't care.
I'm gonna try.

1209
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,161
Hey, wait, wait.
What about Leah?

1210
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,125
What about Leah?

1211
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:54,747
Dude.

1212
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,042
Leah's in love with you.

1213
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,256
No, she's not.

1214
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,632
Are you kidding me?

1215
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,179
I mean, come on.
The way she looks at you

1216
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,928
and how she's been all jealous
ever since Abby's been around?

1217
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,556
And she blushes every time
you come into the room.

1218
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,683
Look, you and Abby...

1219
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,811
it's never gonna happen.

1220
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,859
But you and Leah...

1221
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,232
I mean, you could be
incredible together.

1222
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,411
- Hey.
- What's up?

1223
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,036
So I have something
to tell you.

1224
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,423
Nick just asked me to get dinner
before the homecoming game.

1225
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,042
Okay.

1226
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,012
No, like, Si, he was like...

1227
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,764
He came up to me and he's like,
"Do you wanna go get dinner?"

1228
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:46,932
All right, and I was like,

1229
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,509
"Sure, are Abby and Simon in?"
And he was like

1230
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,771
"I was thinking it could just be
the two of us. Like, a date."

1231
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,015
That's amazing.

1232
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,308
It is?

1233
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:58,811
Yeah.

1234
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:00,946
Leah, come on.

1235
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,284
I know you're into him.

1236
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,444
What?

1237
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,909
All that stuff that
you were talking about

1238
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,247
the night after
Bram's party, about,

1239
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,662
you know,
being so into one person

1240
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:13,913
that it almost kills you.

1241
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:16,871
You were talking about Nick.

1242
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,374
Uh...

1243
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,256
So you think
I should go out with him?

1244
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,926
Yes. Yes.

1245
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,050
Okay.

1246
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:31,518
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1247
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,267
I promise you,
you're not gonna regret it.

1248
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,392
It's gonna be great!

1249
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,736
Let's pull out
your claws, Grizzlies!

1250
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,448
Oh!

1251
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,282
Simon, that Almont QB
is insanely hot.

1252
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,791
We can talk about stuff
like this now, you know.

1253
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,289
Yeah, I still don't know

1254
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,745
if I really quite
figured out how.

1255
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,795
Seriously?
Yeah.

1256
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,881
We gotta practice.
All right. Simon.

1257
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,171
Yeah?
Do you think

1258
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:11,009
that quarterback is lookin'
fine in those hot pants?

1259
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,643
He's lookin' pretty fine.

1260
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,107
No. No. No.

1261
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,941
Fine! Good.
Put your body into it.

1262
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,896
Fine!

1263
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,273
That was really good.

1264
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:26,483
That was so good.
Thanks.

1265
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,659
Hey, check it out.
It's the Waffle House guy.

1266
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,619
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:33,660
Whoa.

1268
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,289
Lyle?
I don't know. Could be.

1269
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,086
I don't know.
Do you think he's...

1270
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,253
I don't know.

1271
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,544
Okay, well,
you should talk to him.

1272
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:45,172
I'm gonna go get a coffee.
Look, you are fine!

1273
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,589
You got this.

1274
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:48,337
Hi.

1275
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:52,596
Hey. If it isn't
my favorite waiter.

1276
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,640
Ah, there he is.
The guy who sees everything.

1277
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:56,937
Yeah.

1278
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,223
Hey, I wouldn't have taken you
for a homecoming guy.

1279
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,691
Oh, just here for the coffee.

1280
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,148
Of course. Yeah, it's all
about the cappuccinos

1281
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,729
and camaraderie for this guy.

1282
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:11,910
I'm glad you're here.

1283
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:13,946
You are?

1284
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,781
Yeah.

1285
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,284
'Cause I wanted to
ask you something.

1286
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,332
I was gonna ask you
the other day

1287
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,756
and then I was, like,
too chickenshit.

1288
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,172
What's Abby's deal?

1289
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,967
I know you and her
hang out a lot.

1290
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,844
Are the two of you
like a thing, or...

1291
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,724
No.

1292
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,261
No, uh, we're just friends.

1293
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,146
I could never be just friends
with someone that hot.

1294
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,349
Yeah!
Every day is a struggle.

1295
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,774
I gotta go. I'll see ya.

1296
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,446
Hey! You!

1297
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,779
Little birdie told me
you're into bears!

1298
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:59,500
Dude! It's me!

1299
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,120
I'm the Creekwood bear.

1300
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,089
Of course you are.

1301
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,172
Thank you.

1302
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,583
Not a compliment.

1303
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,794
Hey, um... I figured out
my next move with Abby.

1304
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,629
Great, that's good for you,
Martin.

1305
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,423
I just wanted to run it by you
real quick.

1306
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,053
No, Martin, look.

1307
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,768
I've been helping you for weeks

1308
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,220
and I am sick and tired
of helping you

1309
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,304
mess with my friends' lives.

1310
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,559
So why don't you
just do that shit

1311
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,807
that you did at Waffle House?

1312
01:04:23,068 --> 01:04:24,149
That went great.

1313
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,435
So you're saying
I should go for it?

1314
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,607
It's kind of a big gesture.

1315
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,905
Go big or go home!
Right, Martin?

1316
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:31,906
Go big or go home.

1317
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,410
I like that.
Thanks for the pep talk, man!

1318
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,369
Gotta get amped up.

1319
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,955
Come on!

1320
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,547
We're gonna take ya!

1321
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,428
Ethan!

1322
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,721
I didn't know
you like football.

1323
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,936
He's just here
to check out the packages.

1324
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,263
Didn't your mother ever tell you

1325
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,440
not to grab your
micropenis in public?

1326
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,935
Could we get some hummus
for that baby carrot?

1327
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,606
Shut up, man.

1328
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,408
Hey, guys.
What's up? Hey.

1329
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,655
How was dinner?

1330
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,698
It was good.

1331
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,621
Yeah, uh, we got
soup dumplings.

1332
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,287
That dumpling place
I told you about?

1333
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,080
Yeah.

1334
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,006
You know, maybe you could go
with Martin.

1335
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,548
Why would I go with Martin?

1336
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:37,010
<i>Please stand
for the national anthem.</i>

1337
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,186
This goes out
to all the refugees.

1338
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,141
And my vocal coach,
Monica Lewis.

1339
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,641
Yeah!

1340
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:03,749
What the hell are you doing?

1341
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,498
Sorry. Hi.

1342
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,913
Hi, everyone.
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

1343
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,623
Why are we interrupting
the national anthem?

1344
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,003
<i>But I have something to say...</i>

1345
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,752
<i>that's a little more important
than the national anthem.</i>

1346
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,179
No offense, America.

1347
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:22,347
Abigail Katherine Susso...

1348
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,138
<i>when you transferred
to Creekwood High School,</i>

1349
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,682
just a short three
and a half months ago,

1350
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,227
you not only transferred
into a new school,

1351
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,481
you transferred your way
into a new heart

1352
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,988
belonging to me.
My heart. Right here.

1353
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,491
<i>And whether it was being
your partner in pong,</i>

1354
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,705
or your Waffle House warrior,

1355
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,958
I have cherished...

1356
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:51,505
the 135,300 minutes
that we've spent together.

1357
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,169
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

1358
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:58,012
135,301 minutes.

1359
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,765
<i>And I know that you're
this smart, talented</i>

1360
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,559
<i>perfect creature.</i>

1361
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:09,858
And, uh, I'm just a sweaty
schlub in a bear costume.

1362
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,359
But like old Bogie used to say,

1363
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:14,854
it's a "crazy mixed-up world."

1364
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,110
<i>So, Abby,</i>

1365
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:18,991
without further ado...

1366
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:22,365
will you go out with me?

1367
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,032
She's too hot for you, assface!

1368
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,084
Excuse me. Sorry.

1369
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,047
Just say yes. Say yes.

1370
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,124
Martin...

1371
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,051
I am so sorry.

1372
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,879
I don't feel that way about you.

1373
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:43,848
You don't?

1374
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,635
No.

1375
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,854
But I really like
hanging out with you

1376
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,934
and I don't know, maybe we could
still be friends, you know?

1377
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,484
Yeah, uh...

1378
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,563
Are those doves?

1379
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,869
No, no, hey, hey! Suraj!

1380
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,323
<i>Hey! No, no!
She said no! No, don't.</i>

1381
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,465
Yo, I thought you said
she liked him.

1382
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:22,171
Not the ceremonious
dove launch I was hoping for.

1383
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,553
But still uplifting to free
some birds.

1384
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:26,925
Yeah.

1385
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,845
Okay, uh...

1386
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,104
Enjoy the game.

1387
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,313
Nice try, Martin!
And way to go, Martin!

1388
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,315
You gave it a shot! Right?

1389
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,698
That was terrible.

1390
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,910
Don't worry, people will get
over it in a few weeks.

1391
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,186
<i>This is Donald J. Trump.</i>

1392

<i>Martin Addison can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

1393
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,066
Hey, Martin, it's Simon. Again.

1394
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,524
Um, look, I wanna make sure
you're doing all right.

1395
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,280
I know it's been tough
since, uh...

1396
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,200
Well, you know since when.
Um, listen. Just...

1397
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,574
Just give me a call back, okay?

1398
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:32,992
I just wanna make
sure you're okay.

1399
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,081
Hey! What you doin' in there?

1400
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,081
Really?

1401
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,341
I need you to help me decorate.
Untangle these for me, will ya?

1402
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,960
This is not cool. I'll be down
in a minute, okay?

1403
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,920
- What's not cool?
- I'll be down in a minute.

1404
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,051
The fact that you're on
a ladder next to my room!

1405
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,427
I can still clearly see you.

1406
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,849
All right, there you go.
Okay. Merry Christmas.

01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,297
<i>A dad and his gay son
pretending they like</i>

1420
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,470
<i>to fish and trying to find
things to talk about.</i>

1421
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,089
<i>It's gonna to be
an excruciating two weeks</i>

1422
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,216
<i>without you, Jacques.
Love, Blue.</i>

1423
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,301
<i>Sounds like you're
gonna need some good music.</i>

1424
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,307
<i>So I'm sending a list
of the seven best</i>

1425
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,312
<i>Christmas songs of all time.</i>

1426
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,144
<i>Of course it includes
David Bowie's</i>

1427
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,145
<i>"Little Drummer Boy,"</i>

1428
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,817
<i>and Smokey Robinson
& The Miracles'</i>

1429
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:41,859
<i>"Christmas Everyday,"</i>

1430
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,528
<i>but the number one song
you're gonna need,</i>

1431
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,982
<i>and trust me, I know this sounds
a little bit twee...</i>

1432
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,054
<i>- Si, have you seen it?</i>
- Hey.

1433
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,589
Seen what?

1434
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,007
CreekSecrets.

1435
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,802
<i>You need to look
at your computer right away.</i>

1436
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,898
<i>Dear fellow
Creekwood students,</i>

1437
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,522
<i>Simon Spier
has a secret male pen pal.</i>

1438
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:05,944
<i>Because he's gay.</i>

1439
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,606
<i>Interested parties
may contact him directly</i>

1440
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,611
<i>to discuss arrangements
for butt sex.</i>

1441
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,780
<i>Ladies need not apply.</i>

1442
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,449
<i>We should all probably be
talking about this</i>

1443
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,577
<i>instead of Martin Addison's
homecoming debacle</i>

1444
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,791
<i>which was actually
kind of sweet,</i>

1445
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,702
<i>and romantic,
if you think about it.</i>

1446
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,329
<i>Sincerely, Anonymous.</i>

1447
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,221
<i>Si, have you read it?</i>

1448
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,639
I can't talk right now.

1449
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,307
<i>- No. Si, wait!</i>
- I gotta go.

1450
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,301
Si?

1451
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:39,761
I saw it.

1452
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:43,182
I already reported it.
They're gonna take it down.

1453
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,357
It's too late.

1454
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,150
No, there's people
who've already seen it, so...

1455
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,610
it doesn't really matter.

1456
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,480
It's true.

1457
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:54,618
I'm... I'm gay.

1458
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,486
Oh...

1459
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,447
So what are you gonna do?

1460
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,657
I don't know.

1461
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,250
You could deny it.

1462
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,874
Why the hell would
I deny it, Nora?

1463
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,208
I'm not ashamed of it.

1464
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,666
You've just never really
said anything.

1465
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:09,791
So what?

1466
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,218
What does that have
to do with anything?

1467
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,420
What the hell are
you talking about?

1468
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,754
Sorry.

1469
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,887
<i>I know you're going
off the grid and you won't see</i>

1470
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,517
<i>this until you're back,
but something's happened.</i>

1471
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,807
<i>You're gonna find out
who I am.</i>

1472
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,942
<i>And someone posted our emails.</i>

1473
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,733
<i>Please don't freak out.
Please, Blue.</i>

1474
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,989
<i>I need you to promise me
you won't disappear.</i>

1475
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,311
Let me open my present.

1476
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,942
Honey, I'm trying to
tell you you need to shave.

1477
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,607
Does that mean
you're gonna keep cooking?

1478
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,408
Yeah, of course. I can
make dinner tonight, too.

1479
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:18,360
- Awesome.
- What's this for?

1480
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,486
Oh!

1481
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,704
This one, Sherlock.
There you go.

1482
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,203
What is it?

1483
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:31,085
Bluetooth headphones.

1484
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,757
Do you like the black?
Oh, I love it.

1485
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,259
Because I didn't
know if you liked...

1486
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:35,210
This is great.

1487
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,511
They have other colors.
He said he likes it.

1488
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,088
No, I love it.
Okay. I have the receipt.

1489
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,260
He's good.

1490
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,557
Actually, I did want to talk
to you guys about something.

1491
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:50,809
What is it?

1492
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,188
Uh, well...

1493
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,279
Let me guess...

1494
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,195
you got somebody pregnant.

1495
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,576
No, you're pregnant.

1496
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,614
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm pregnant.
- I knew it.

1497
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:04,744
He's got that glow about him,
baby.

1498
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,700
- Honey.
- No. Uh...

1499
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:13,878
I'm gay.

1500
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,127
Honey.

1501
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,303
And I don't want you guys to
think anything different.

1502
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:23,930
I'm still me.

1503
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,219
Of course you are.

1504
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:26,678
Oh, Simon.
Yeah.

1505
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,813
So you're gay?

1506
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,391
Which one of your
old girlfriends turned ya?

1507
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,226
Was it the one
with the big eyebrow...

1508
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,401
- Jack.
- Jesus Christ.

1509
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:35,854
Dad, can you ever
shut the hell up?

1510
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:36,813
I'm kidding.

1511
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,193
It's not funny.
I'm kidding, Nora.

1512
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,946
Just open up your gift. Please.

1513
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,490
It's okay, honey.

1514
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:47,995
- Nora, I got you this.
- Simon.

1515
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,326
That's for you.
No, that's for you.

1516
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,661
That's from me.

1517
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,799
It's a Cuisinart.

1518
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,844
I love it. Thank you, Simon.

1519
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:06,514
<i>Dear Blue,
happy New Year.</i>

1520
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,973
<i>I haven't heard from you,</i>

1521
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,351
<i>so I'm going to assume it's
because you have no service.</i>

1522
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,191
<i>I came out to my entire family
on Christmas.</i>

1523
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,809
<i>It didn't go great.</i>

1524
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,233
<i>And I've been avoiding
my friends the whole break</i>

1525
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,030
<i>for all sorts of reasons.</i>

1526
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,241
<i>Change is exhausting.</i>

1527
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,943
<i>I feel like there's
nowhere to hide</i>

1528
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,786
<i>from all the newness
of everything.</i>

1529
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,617
<i>Except here. With you.</i>

1530
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,331
<i>Please write to me.</i>

1531
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,042
<i>As soon as you get
even one bar of service.</i>

1532
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,252
Breakfast burrito?

1533
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:34,996
Thanks.

1534
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,338
Hey, Si.

1535
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:39,633
Come sit down.

1536
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,384
I'm gonna be late.

1537
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:15,954
Hey, guys.

1538
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:17,881
Hey, Simon, we need to talk.

1539
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,627
So Abby and I hung out
on New Year's Eve, and...

1540
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:23,837
you see, now we're together.

1541
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,347
- That's awesome. That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

1542
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,055
But then we got to talking
about why it took so long.

1543
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,096
Why did you tell Nick
that I have

1544
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:33,559
a boyfriend in college
named Jonathan?

1545
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,605
Why'd you make that up?

1546
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:35,724
Look, Martin...

1547
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,651
he was the one who wrote
that <i>CreekSecrets</i> post about me.

1548
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,858
He screenshotted my emails

1549
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,653
and he's been using them
to blackmail me for months.

1550
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,075
What does that have to do
with us, Simon?

1551
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,995
He told me that if I didn't
help him get with Abby,

1552
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:50,455
he'd out me.

1553
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,079
And I...

1554
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,544
That's why I had to
keep you guys apart.

1555
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,208
So you made up a bunch of lies.

1556
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,709
And that's why you convinced me
to go on that date with Leah?

1557
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,843
You know, to keep me away
from Abby?

1558
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,046
So, wait. Running lines
at Waffle House

1559
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,756
and beer pong at Bram's,

1560
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,137
all of that was just to
pawn me off on Martin?

1561
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,514
I'm not
a piece of meat, Simon.

1562
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,430
You know how hard it was
for me to start over.

1563
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:18,857
I trusted you.

1564
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:24,864
Hey, come on, Leah.
I'll take you to school.

1565
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,998
Leah. Leah, please.
Listen, listen.

1566
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,500
I know I messed up, okay?

1567
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:36,872
But I knew you were
in love with Nick.

1568
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,669
And I thought that maybe...
Just stop it!

1569
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:41,669
You know what? You are
insanely stupid, Simon.

1570
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,752
I was never in love with Nick.
I was in love with you!

1571
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,089
But...

1572
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,141
We're... We're us.

1573
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,510
Yeah, well...

1574
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:55,887
Sorry.

1575
01:18:58,484 --> 01:18:59,816
I've been trying to tell you.

1576
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:05,356
That night I slept over,
I was trying to tell you.

1577
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,867
You wanna know
the funniest part?

1578
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,079
It's that all these years, you
being so picky with girls,

1579
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:17,250
I thought that maybe it was
because you might like me, too.

1580
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,336
And then, you know, you told me
I should go out with Nick

1581
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,413
and I realized you were just
never gonna see me that way.

1582
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,051
I can deal with you
being gay, Si.

1583
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,716
But you set me up
to get my heart broken

1584
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,138
when you thought
I was in love with Nick

1585
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,552
and that just makes you cruel.

1586
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:02,370
You all right?

1587
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,413
Hanging in there.

1588
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,382
Uh, for the record,

1589
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,211
when I was saying that we have
a lot in common, you know,

1590
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,137
I wasn't really... That's not
what I was talking about.

1591
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:12,589
Gotcha.

1592
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,466
Just FYI, just for the record.

1593
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,801
Okay, great. Thanks.
All right.

1594
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,737
Hey, Jackie.

1595
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,482
Did you date me because you
think I look like a guy?

1596
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,652
No. No, I actually
broke up with you

1597
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,157
because you don't look
like a guy.

1598
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,873
Oh. Oh, okay. Thanks.

1599
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,325
Welcome.

1600
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,412
What did he say?

1601
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,012
Yeah! Hey, Creekwood!

1602
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:01,012
This one's for you, Spier.

1603
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,894
Hey, Ethan.

1604
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,733
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah.

1605
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,777
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1606
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,608
You like that,
don't you, Spier?

1607
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:15,485
Yeah.

1608
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,616
Oh, yeah, Ethan, Simon likey.

1609
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,869
You have something
you wanna say to me?

1610
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,629
I said do you have something
to say to me?

1611
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:28,790
I'll take it from here.

1612
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:29,832
Hey, Ms. Albright.

1613
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,216
Don't "Hey, Ms. Albright" me.

1614
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:33,090
We're not friends. You're not
gonna braid my hair

1615
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:34,174
or paint my nails.

1616
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,630
Get your ass
off the table now!

1617
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,300
You sweaty, hormonal virgins.

1618
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,593
You know what? You're about to
be suspended for so long,

1619
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,429
that by the time it's over,
you're gonna be

1620
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,147
the fat, bald, unhappily married

1621
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,227
wildly mediocre nobodies
you're destined to become.

1622
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,777
You can't talk to us like that.

1623
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,654
Actually, I can,
'cause I just did.

1624
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,481
And you know why?
Because you're just those two

1625
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:54,941
assholes that did
that shitty thing

1626
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,777
in front of the whole school.
And guess what?

1627
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,160
Nobody feels sorry for those
assholes, especially me.

1628
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,951
Now, walk.
Mr. Worth's office now.

1629
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:04,909
Bye.

1630
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,120
Uh-uh. That's mine now.

1631
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,835
I'mma sell it.
Get my tubes tied.

1632
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,479
Why does Mr. Worth
have to talk to us?

1633
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,144
I mean, can't we just
let this shit go?

1634
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,115
Hey, I'm sorry, Ethan.

1635
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,995
None of this ever happened
when just you were out.

1636
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,707
You know what they say,
one gay's a snooze,

1637
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,329
two's a hilarious hate crime.

1638
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,382
You could've told me
you were gay.

1639
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,674
I guess I didn't think
we had very much in common.

1640
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,923
You're telling me, Simon.

1641
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,474
It's not like your
all-hoodie wardrobe

1642
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,721
rocks my world.

1643
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,099
I don't know.

1644
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:12,064
Maybe I was jealous.

1645
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,779
You've been out
since you were 16.

1646
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,071
It always seemed
so easy for you.

1647
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:20,234
Easy?

1648
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,203
Are you kidding me?

1649
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,957
My mom still tells
my grandparents

1650
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,410
about all the girls I'm dating

1651
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:31,247
when we go over to their house
for dinner, every Sunday.

1652
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,624
She says it's 'cause
they're old and religious,

1653
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,626
and it's just easier that way.

1654
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,470
I don't know,
maybe that's true.

1655
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,307
But you should hear her voice
when she talks about the girls.

1656
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,773
All right, boys, come on in.

1657
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:52,733
Come on.

1658
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,520
All right,
just stand right here.

1659
01:23:58,242 --> 01:23:59,107
Get up.

1660
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,115
Okay, these gentlemen
have something

1661
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:05,447
that they would
like to say to you.

1662
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,248
We're sorry.
Our bad.

1663
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,200
That's right.
'Cause at Creekwood High,

1664
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,205
what do we believe in?

1665
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:11,415
Tolerance.

1666
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,000
And "tolerance" means
we respect

1667
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,798
Simon and Ethan's choice
to be boyfriends.

1668
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,500
We are not boyfriends.
Yeah. No.

1669
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,594
Hey, whatever you wanna call it,
it's fine with me. Seriously.

1670
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,805
We call it "two people

1671
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,598
that are not at all
romantically involved."

1672
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:25,971
Yeah, I get it.
Keepin' it casual, man.

1673
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,222
I can dig, seriously.

1674
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:31,974
Oh. Simon. Hey, can we talk?

1675
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,850
I don't have anything
to say to you.

1676
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,435
Please, please.
I just wanted to say

1677
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,485
that I was sorry, okay?

1678
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,188
I didn't know or think

1679
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,609
that people still
did shit like that.

1680
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,490
And I got in a lot of shit
for Homecoming,

1681
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,864
and I wanted everyone to focus
on something else, you know?

1682
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,445
I just didn't think
it was gonna be a big thing.

1683
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,197
I don't care if you didn't
think that my coming out

1684
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,782
was gonna be
a big thing, Martin.

1685
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,417
Look, you don't get to
decide that.

1686
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,878
I'm supposed to be the one
that decides when

1687
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,965
and where, and how and who knows
and how I get to say it.

1688
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,461
That's supposed to be
my thing!

1689
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,085
And you took that away
from me.

1690
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:03,922
So, look, can you please just
get the fuck away from me?

1691
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,007
<i>I saw the posts.
I know who you are.</i>

1692
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:40,875
Jacques a Dit.

1693
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,085
<i>That's what they call
Simon Says in France.</i>

1694
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:44,511
<i>Very clever.</i>

1695
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,556
<i>I'm sorry, Simon.
I can't do this anymore.</i>

1696
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,430
<i>- Please, Blue.
- I'm so sorry.</i>

1697
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,308
<i>You can't leave me alone.
Everything's falling apart.</i>

1698
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,857
I mean, I haven't
even talked to her.

1699
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,158
I haven't even
seen her at school.

1700
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,154
Anyway, I guess
I'll see you in class, right?

1701
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,370
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.

1702
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,573
Later.

1703
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:55,454
Hey.

1704
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:56,705
Hey, Simon.

1705
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,204
Is it you?

1706
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,249
Are you Blue?

1707
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:07,678
No. No, it's not me. Sorry.

1708
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,850
I know you've had
a crazy couple days.

1709
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:13,892
You wanna talk about it?

1710
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,471
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have asked.

1711
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,477
No, don't worry.
Sorry for bothering you.

1712
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,689
Did you know?

1713
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,064
I knew you had a secret.

1714
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,826
I mean, when you were little,
you were so carefree.

1715
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:21,457
But these last few years,
more and more...

1716
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,790
it's almost like I could
feel you holding your breath.

1717
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,387
I wanted to ask you
about it, but I...

1718
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,056
didn't wanna pry.

1719
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,726
Maybe I made a mistake.
No. No, Mom, you...

1720
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:47,903
You didn't make a mistake.

1721
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,447
Being gay is your thing.

1722
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,323
There are parts of it
you have to go through alone.

1723
01:28:58,834 --> 01:28:59,790
I hate that.

1724
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:04,207
As soon as you came out,
you said, "Mom, I'm still me."

1725
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,420
I need you to hear this.

1726
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,305
You are still you, Simon.

1727
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:21,437
And you are still the same son
who I love to tease,

1728
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:25,684
and who your father depends on
for just about everything.

1729
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,019
And you're the same brother

1730
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:31,113
who always compliments
his sister on her food,

1731
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,111
even when it sucks.

1732
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,075
But you get to exhale now,
Simon.

1733
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:44,543
You get to be more you
than you have been...

1734
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,539
in a very long time.

1735
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,844
You deserve
everything you want.

1736
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:13,777
My boy.

1737
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,125
Hey, Leah.

1738
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,713
Hey.
What's up?

1739
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:34,919
What are you doing?

1740
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:37,300
Just going for a run,
you know.

1741
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,305
Daily ritual.

1742
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,473
Yeah, you've never done that.

1743
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,259
Have, too.

1744
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,103
But you're wearing jeans.

1745
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:46,726
They're my running jeans.

1746
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,478
Simon, you're about to pass out.

1747
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,102
Okay, fine.
I'm not going for a run.

1748
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,896
Hey, Leah. Please, listen.

1749
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,276
Look, I know, okay?

1750
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,865
You didn't want anyone
to know you're gay.

1751
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:58,443
No, that wasn't just it.

1752
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,289
I fell in love with someone.

1753
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,246
That guy in the emails...

1754
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:09,119
I love him.

1755
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,707
And I knew that if Martin
leaked our emails,

1756
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:13,791
it'd scare him off.

1757
01:31:15,095 --> 01:31:15,960
I'm sorry.

1758
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,298
I know what I did
was messed up.

1759
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:25,094
You're my best friend.

1760
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,394
If I'm your best friend,

1761
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,222
then why did you come out
to Abby and not me?

1762
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:32,313
Think it was easier.

1763
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,733
I've known Abby for six months,

1764
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,283
and I've known you
for 13 years.

1765
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:42,946
And I knew that if I told you,

1766
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,780
that everything
was gonna be different.

1767
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,826
I really wanted things
to stay the same.

1768
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,127
Tell me about this guy
you love.

1769
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,762
You sure?
Yeah.

1770
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,633
It'll help me kill off
Hetero Simon in my mind.

1771
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:06,852
You don't have to kill him off.
He's dead, Si.

1772
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,312
Hacking him up with
a mental machete as we speak.

1773
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:13,939
All right. Fair enough.

1774
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,231
So, I call him Blue.

1775
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:29,746
Hey, Si.

1776
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:32,832
Yeah?

1777
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,761
How long have you known?

1778
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,892
Like, I really started to get it
when I was around...

1779
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:54,058
thirteen?

1780
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,068
Four years? Four years of...

1781
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:58,812
eating dinner together,

1782
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,443
four years of
going to movies together.

1783
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,408
Four years of
walking Bieber together.

1784
01:33:05,705 --> 01:33:06,786
I'm sorry.

1785
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:08,955
I shouldn't have missed it.

1786
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,117
No. Hey, no, Dad.

1787
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:12,626
All those stupid jokes...

1788
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,666
Well, I know
you didn't mean 'em.

1789
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,380
It doesn't matter.
I shouldn't have missed it.

1790
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,377
But...

1791
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:24,138
in case the message
got lost somewhere I just...

1792
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:27,762
I just want you to know
that I love you.

1793
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:31,436
And I'm really
proud of you.

1794
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:35,016
I wouldn't change anything
about you.

1795
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,437
Hey. Shit, Dad.

1796
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,190
Hey, stop crying.

1797
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,359
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1798
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,657
Oh, God.

1799
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,031
Come here.

1800
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:02,505
How's that video
for Mom coming?

1801
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:04,136
Good.
Good, good.

1802
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,300
Good.

1803
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:08,887
You don't know how to export it,

1804
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,176
do you?
Can you help me with that

1805
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,301
please?
Yeah.

1806
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:12,678
Okay.
Let's go.

1807
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:14,309
Hey.

1808
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:17,233
I thought maybe we could
sign up for Grindr together.

1809
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,027
You don't know
what Grindr is, do you?

1810
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:22,904
It's Facebook for gay people.

1811
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,690
Not what it is.

1812
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,911
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

1813
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:31,330
20 years of bliss.

1814
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,707
Did you guys do this?

1815
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,377
Simon and I did it, yeah.

1816
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,046
I just helped.
It was mostly me.

1817
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,631
Yeah, right.

1818
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,220
Really? Really?

1819
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:57,648
I can't believe
you did this.

1820
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,442
I panicked
and bought you a watch.

1821
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,019
That's okay.

1822
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:04,613
You can give me somethin' later
that I can't get in the store.

1823
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,232
That's really gross.

1824
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,233
Oh, guys, just look.
Sorry, just pay attention.

1825
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:10,152
Just look at baby Bieber!

1826
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,404
He was so cute!

1827
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,076
Just look at our baby!

1828
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:18,957

<i>I know you're funny

01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,003
Okay. They're not
paying me enough for this.

1885
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,341
Hi
- LEAH: Oh, my God.

1886
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:20,471
- Oh, my God!
- You were amazing.

1887
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,472
I'm not even kidding.

1888
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,015
You were, like, insane.
Thank you!

1889
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:24,642
What's up?
Baby!

1890
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,064
Yeah. Yeah.

1891
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:37,484
Hey, Simon.
Hey.

1892
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:42,781
Do you wanna go to
the carnival with us tonight?

1893
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:48,954
Yes.

1894
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,293
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1895
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:51,248
Yay!

1896
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:52,628
Get in here, Leah!

1897
01:38:53,177 --> 01:38:54,258
The love!

1898
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:55,718
Thank you.

1899
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:16,232
We'll be right here.
Yeah.

1900
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:17,782
Go get him.
All right.

1901
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,443
Yes!
Woo! Yeah!

1902
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:20,448
Go, Simon!

1903
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,245
Spier, Spier, Spier!
Woo!

1904
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:24,535
That should last a while.

1905
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:29,327
Oh, my God, look.

1906
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,209
I bet he's waiting
for the other gay kid.

1907
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:32,960
Where's Dana?
She'll love this.

1908
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:37,044
You got this, buddy.
Proud of you.

1909
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:40,263
Yeah, buddy!
Yeah!

1910
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:41,430
You got it! Woo!

1911
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,549
This is it.

1912
01:39:47,273 --> 01:39:48,138
Yeah!

1913
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:56,484
We love you, Simon!

1914
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,153
Yo. Can you just...
Come on, no.

1915
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:26,434
Go, Simon!

1916
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:34,317
Okay. That's your
last ride ticket, buddy.

1917
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:37,779
Wait. Wait!

1918
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,576
Simon, it's me.

1919
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:47,581
I'm Blue. I love you.

1920
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:49,954
No, you're not.

1921
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,918
No, I'm not. I just...

1922
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:55,122
This is so brutal.

1923
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:58,587
Here. I'll tell you what.

1924
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:01,670
I got a couple...
How much is it?

1925
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,224
It's four tickets, four bucks.
Perfect. Okay. There you go.

1926
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,216
Last one's on me.

1927
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:08,802
Got it.

1928
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,688
Last call for the Ferris wheel!

1929
01:41:15,278 --> 01:41:17,611
Oh, no, I can't watch.
I can't watch this, babe. No.

1930
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:19,362
This is awful.

1931
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:21,481
Okay, Dora.
Wait, wait.

1932
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:24,401
Can I sit there?

1933
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:26,865
I was kind of waiting
for somebody.

1934
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,281
Yeah, I know.

1935
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,416
It's Bram!

1936
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:42,586
It's you.

1937
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:45,297
It's me.

1938
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:50,185
But that night at the party...

1939
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:53,272
Yeah.
I was drunk and confused.

1940
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,815
And it ended, like,
a minute after you saw us.

1941
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,228
And you're Jewish.

1942
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,022
Yeah.

1943
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,028
Which is cool.

1944
01:42:05,202 --> 01:42:06,363
And I'm black, too.

1945
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:08,703
And gay.

1946
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:11,197
It's kind of crazy, huh?

1947
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,456
I didn't think you'd come.

1948
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:14,659
Me neither.

1949
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,296
Until I was walking towards you,
I didn't think I had it in me.

1950
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:40,853
Are you disappointed
that it's me?

1951
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:45,649
No.

1952
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:33,154
Hey.

1953

- Good morning!
- Ah, there he is!

1964
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,397
Morning, Simon.
Top of the morning, kid.

1965
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,565
What's this?

1966
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:10,863
Nora's specialty.
Mm, coconut?

1967
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,239
Yeah.
You look good.

1968
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:14,116
Have a good day, honey.
You too.

1969
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:15,617
Is it good?
It's delicious.

1970
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,532
I'll see you guys.
What, you're not gonna eat?

1971
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,575
Bye, Simon.

1972
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:33,052
Mornin'.
Hey, buddy.

1973
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,766
Good morning.
Hey!

1974
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:43,899
How you doin', Leah?

1975
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:45,318
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1976
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:57,827
Hey!

1977
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:06,164
Hey.

1978
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:11,962
Morning.
Morning.

1979
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:16,595
Everybody in?

1980
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:17,550
Yes.
Oh, yeah.

1981
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:18,852
All right, it's too beautiful
a day,

1982
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,936
so I think I'm gonna actually
take us on a little adventure.

1983
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:22,559
Yes!
Woo!

1984
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,016
That's exactly what I need!

1985
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:25,065
Yeah, adventure!
