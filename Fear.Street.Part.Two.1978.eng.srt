00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,458
[Cindy] Tommy!

690
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,541
Come on, they took everything!

691
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,958
["Ever Fallen In Love" playing]

692
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,666
[knocking on door]

693
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,916
Go away, Cindy!

694
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,875
It's me. It's Nick.

695
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,875
Go away, Nick!

696
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,375
Whoa.

697
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,833
-I like what you've done with the place.
-This wasn't me.

698
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,916
[Nick] I'm shocked.

699
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,583
"Ziggy is a witch bitch."

700
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,875
"Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell." Jeez.

701
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,083
Sheila?

702
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,625
Colonel Mustard.

703
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,250
-Oh, looks like blood.
-Yeah. I didn't have a pig, so…

704
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,458
Carrie. Cool.

705
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,375
You've read Carrie?

706
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,916
Yeah. Second favorite after Salem's Lot.

707
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,625
[Ziggy chuckles]

708
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,833
Still, I dunno,
paint seems a little pedestrian.

709
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?

710
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,416
Maybe.

711
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,875
Shouldn't you be, like,
turning me in or something?

712
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,541
Well, I should be supervising
Color War, uh…

713
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,333
-But noticed you were MIA and--
-So you decided to stalk me.

714
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,166
Check in on you.

715
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,208
Clearly you don't need my assistance.
All good. Go ahead.

716
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,375
"Carrie" on.

717
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,875
What's your idea?

718
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,000
[keys jingling]

719
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,541

00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,625
[Cindy] Alice!

721
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,541
Alice!

722
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,000
Come on, it's disgusting in here!

723
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,791
[Alice] We're close,
Berman, hang in there!

724
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,125
This was the best idea.

725
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,166
Yeah, but I still don't feel shit.

726
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,708
OK, so, take more.

727
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,416
Thank you.

728
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,083
L484.

729
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,458
-[Alice] Arnie!
-[Arnie] Wait up!

00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,541
[Cindy] Alice!

731
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,916
I swear to God… [gasps]

732
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:22,541
Shit!

733
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,000
-Oh, it's ruined now!
-You cursed again.

734
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,833
You want me to murder you?

735
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,958
-Babe, you OK?
-[Tommy] Yeah.

736
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,875
Yeah, I'm fine. [sniffs]

737
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,083
[Alice screams]

738
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
[Cindy] Alice?

739
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,875
[suspenseful music playing]

740
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,583
Watch your step.

741
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,833
[Tommy] Is someone digging a grave?

742
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,375
[Alice] Graves.

743
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,375
Mary.

744
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,875
Hey, where's the, uh…

745
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,500
The X's, look. Look.

746
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,583
Look, here. Here.

747
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,166
She was marking where she dug.

748
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,791
[Alice] "But without her hand,

749
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,166
her grip on the land holds firm

750
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,041
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

751
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,708
Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.

752
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,958
-To end the curse?
-That made her daughter lose her mind.

753
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,083
Guys, come on.

754
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,125
-[scoffs] This is silly.
-[Arnie] Yeah.

755
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,083
I gotta piss.

756
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,791
Hey, let me see that.

757
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
You can have it,

758
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,916
but first give me the drugs.

760
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,666
L484,

00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,291

[menacing music playing]

764
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,750
If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy,
those drugs are very dangerous.

765
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,708
[laughing] Oh my God!

766
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,291
What happened to you?

767
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,291
You remember when we used to have fun?

768
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,916
-Before you became a snitch?
-Just let it go already.

769
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,375
That's easy for you to say.

770
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,791
-You lying fucking Brutus.
-[Arnie] I found it!

771
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,000
I found the witch's house.

-[suspenseful music playing]
-[Alice and Arnie laughing]

773
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,208
Dude…

774
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Was I the only one expecting, like,
I dunno, a house made out of candy?

775
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,666
[Arnie] Maybe there's candy down here.

776
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,625

-Whoa!
-[Alice gasps, laughs]

[Alice and Arnie laughing]

780
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,083
Hey, Sarah,
you got any candy down there? [laughing]

781
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,333
We're high and hungry.

782
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,041
-Sarah Fier!
-OK, we've seen enough.

783
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright then, go home, Berman.

784
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,166
I didn't march all the way out here
for nothing, OK?

785
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,166
-[Alice laughing]
-Are you crazy? Alice!

786
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,458
Alice!

787
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,208
[Alice] Hey, someone's been down here.

788
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
Like, recently.

789
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,208
[chuckles]

790
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,166
[laughing] Look at all this witchy shit.

791
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,208
It's Sarah Fier!

792
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,750
Sarah Fier isn't real.

793
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,708
Well, someone lit that candle.

794
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here,
say something!

795
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,583
Maybe she's shy.

796
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,208
[Alice chuckles]

797
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,166
Ali… Alice! God!

[dramatic music playing]

800
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,041
Whoa!

801
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,750
It's some kind of, like, occult thing…

802
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,833
Like Devil worship.

803
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,958
-[Alice] It's kinky.
-[Arnie] Oh, yeah.

804
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,333
-[Alice laughing]
-It's the witch's mark.

805
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,250
The what?

806
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,375
[Cindy] "A deal was made with the Devil."

807
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,708
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone

808
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,708
in exchange for eternal life,

00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,500
scarring the soil beneath
with the witch's mark,

810
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,083
bringing Darkness upon the land."

811
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,250
[Arnie] That's it.

812
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
It's acetaminophen.

813
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,875
-Arnie, what are you talking about?
-[Arnie] L484.

814
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,125
It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol.
It's nothing.

815
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,375
Are you sure?

816
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,458
Positive.

817
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
[Arnie] Come on, Alice.
Let's get out of here.

818
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,833
Pretty sure Joan might still have
some weed if we pay her.

00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,333

[Arnie] We are out of here.

824
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,250
Let's go, man.

-I need to show you something.
-This place…

00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:56,916
-It keeps on going.
-Now!

[Alice] Cyrus Miller.

838
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,625
Billy Barker. Ruby Lane.

-Mary's daughter.
-Yeah.

840
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,708
Isaac Milton, Harry Rooker.

841
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,250
You don't have to go to fucking class
to know those names.

842
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,333
-The Shadyside Killers.
-Yeah.

843
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,958
Except one.

844
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,500
Tommy? Alice, this isn't funny.

845
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:29,916
What, you think I carved your boyfriend's
name into solid stone with my fingernails?

846
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,916
Someone else did this.

847
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:38,375
[Arnie] Tommy.

848
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,583

854
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,500
What the hell are you doing, man? Tommy…

855
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:08,208
[Cindy] Oh my God! No, no, Tommy! Stop!

856
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,625
Tommy, stop!

Here.

861
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:22,916
Help me.
