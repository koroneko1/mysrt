00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.440
Do this question and this one too.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.840
Also, do this whole page for next week.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.200
- Okay?
-Sure.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.530
That's all for today.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.530
I have to go pick up a girl.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.350
Is she your girlfriend, Teacher Mind?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.510
It's none of your business.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.170
By the way, you don't have to call me teacher.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.260
I feel old when you call me that.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.730
I want to apologize, Teacher--

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.530
Mind.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.350
For the misunderstanding.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.380
You don't look like...

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.770
Why? What do I look like?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.350
Well... You don't look like a medical student.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.110
What did you expect a medical student to look like?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.550
Nerdy?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.220
Wearing thick glasses?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.150
Wearing unfashionable clothes?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.800
Wearing a white medical gown as my university uniform?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.080
That's so cliche.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.240
You're so cool.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.040
But it's too bad...

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.240
What's bad?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.130
Nothing. It's just too bad that time flies way too fast.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.840
My mom told me to treat you to a meal.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.480
Are you crazy? Who would let a student do that?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.950
I have to go now. I can't keep my girl waiting.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.200
Don't forget to solve these problems I've given you.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.680
If the director is okay, I'll contact you.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.840
X, you're not going to Japan next week, right?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.240
I want to know, just in case.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.640
Okey-dokey.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.420
Q .

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.220
From what I heard, I think you'll get this job.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.930
Toy, just shut up.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.110
Let's go home.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.510
Let me finish this game first.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.060
No!

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.460
Let's go! It's getting dark soon.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460
Fine! Why do you always rushing me?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.220
Wait.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.800
I can't find my phone. I don't know where I left it.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.930
What does this have to do with us?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.340
Get out of the way!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.000
Wait. I...

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.140
Can I borrow your phone to call myself?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.750
Maybe...

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.800
my phone might be around here.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.440
Toy, let him borrow your phone.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.910
I will freaking die if I quit in the middle of the game!

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.910
Come on! Just help him.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.840
Thank you.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.680
That's it?

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.620
You've found it?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.600
Yes, it's vibrating inside my bag.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.760
Let's go.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.970
Q, wait for me!

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.500
Hey! Wait!

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.150
You want me to send you home?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570
I was waiting for you until my butt went numb.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.110
If I knew it would take so much time, I would stay at school and play basketball.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.330
Come on! I'll pay for the fuel.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.340
It's getting dark now. I don't want to go back home late.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.840
Exactly!

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.040
Your house and my house are in the opposite direction.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
If I have to drop you off and then go back home,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.750
won't it be better if I sleep over at your house?

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.580
Sure! I don't mind that.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.710
But I do mind!

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.310
I have to take my grandma to practice Tai Chi in the morning.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.330
You always have to get your way!

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.300
Hello, Mom.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.940
I'm going to stay at the condo near Watcharaphon road tonight.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.540
Don't worry. I have the key with me.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.750
He's going the same way as you. It's not that far from the highway.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.510
X!

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.620
- Toy!
- X!

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.370
Hold on!

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.060
Yes?

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.460
X, my friend's house is in that area too. Can you please drop him off?

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.000
Oh, sure. I've booked the taxi already.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.950
But, would Q be okay...

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.340
Never mind. I can go back by myself.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.950
You kept forcing me when I said I don't want to send you home.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.660
And now there's someone who could drop you off, but you don't want to go him.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.500
What's wrong with you?

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.350
We can go back together. We can keep each other company.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.220
That's the correct answer! I'll leave him in your care. I'm off!

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.280
Toy!

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.420
Someone seems to be strong when he's with his friends.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.660
But when he's alone,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.280
he turns into a scaredy-cat.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.970
Scared?

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.600
Who's scared?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.730
I just... I don't want to go with you. Do you understand?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.930
I. Don't. Want. To. Go. With. You.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.770
You don't want to go, or you're afraid to go.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.020
I don't want to go!

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.130
You're afraid.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.530
I don't want to go!

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.730
You're afraid.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.730
I said I don't want to go!

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.200
Hey.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.970
Hey.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.750
Hey.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.750
We've arrived?

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.440
Yes, we're here.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.110
Thanks.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.550
Why are you following me?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.260
Your friend told me to take care of you.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.550
I have to make sure that you arrive safely.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.700
Actually, your friend sure is a school athlete.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.110
You friend is a good "shipper."

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.710
It's called "feeder" in Sepak Takraw.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.350
Toy plays center.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.730
Do you even understand about sports and ball games?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.800
Why did you ring the bell?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.800
You've dropped me off already. Why don't you go home?

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.770
Hello. You're Q's mother, right?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.150
Yes, I am.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.100
My name is X. I'm in the same school as him.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.570
Ah.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.080
We went to the audition together.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.000
My condo is in this area too. So I asked Q to share the ride.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.480
It's already late. Have you guys eaten anything yet?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.840
Not yet.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.710
But it's okay.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.460
I have instant noodles at my condo. I can make it myself.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.060
Oh, no! You'll starve to death by the time you get back.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.510
Let's eat dinner together before you go back.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.880
Why did you invite him for dinner?

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.950
Q!

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.220
How could you say that? I've never taught you to be a heartless person.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.930
Come. Let's eat dinner together.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.660
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.420
Come in.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.860
So, he's here to get free food.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.800
- Thank you.
- Eat a lot.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.420
Here.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.860
Whoa!

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.150
They look so good!

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480
Alright, I'll dig into it!

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.080
Feel free to eat! You should eat a lot.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.860
How's today?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.660
How's the audition?

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.880
It was almost good.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.750
But someone around here showed up and ruined everything.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.040
Thank you.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.280
I guess that's my customer. Man, can you answer the call for me?

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.280
Of course, sis.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.530
Hello.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.260
Yes, yes.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.910
Bakery! This is a bakery shop.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.840
Huh?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.220
How many do you want?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.280
Can you speak slowly please?

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.820
What are you saying? Q, can you help him out?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.330
He's speaking in English. I don't understand.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.340
Hello.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.220
Yes, yes.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.750
We have many kinds.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.060
But brownie is our signature.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.280
Huh?

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.550
Again, please.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.620
We recommend almond.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.570
No, no. No salmon, Almond, you know? Not salmon!

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.060
Are you sure you understand what he's saying?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.840
Let me help you.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.480
Yes, please!

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.620
Hello, I'm so sorry for your inconvenience.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.170
May I help you?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.080
Yes, we have many bakeries of your choice.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.200
A dozen of almonds, isn't it?

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.530
What's your number?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.280
Zero, eight...

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.660
Thank you so much.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.330
Here you go.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.330
Thank you so much!

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.400
Eat a lot, son.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.080
Damn, he's the real deal.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.710
Oh, no! You don't have to do that. I'll take care of it.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.710
Just sit. I'll get a dessert for you.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.840
It's okay. Let me help you.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.340
I want to repay you for the delicious meal.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.140
It should be me who thank you for keeping my son company.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.770
You also helped me with the customer order.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.200
It would be great if Q's English skills were half as good as yours.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.620
I went to study abroad during primary school because of my dad's job.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.620
I just moved back a few years ago.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.200
So I can speak a little bit.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.660
You grew up aboard,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.020
but you're so polite and adorable.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.530
Please look after Q for me.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.840
Sure.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.620
Let's go eat a dessert before it gets too late. You should go back home and rest.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.370
Should I help--

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.350
It's okay. Let's go eat.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.600
This one is for you.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.000
If you like it, I'll ask Q to give it to you again.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.140
You don't have to. I don't want to bother you.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.140
Gosh! Stop trying to be considerate.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.970
Because consideration for others is a characteristic of a well-bred person.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.370
Q! What are you implying?

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.240
You better go now, give him a ride to the main street.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.930
Mom! He can book a taxi.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.400
Don't you talk back to me like that! It's hard to drive into this alley.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.350
It will be faster to get a taxi at the main street.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.680
Go now! Don't be lazy.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.530
Fine.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.620
I'll go now. Goodbye, Auntie. Goodbye, Uncle Man.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.510
- Come to visit us again. 
- Sure.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.930
You don't have to give me a ride.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.280
I've booked a taxi already.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.140
If you say so.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.940
I hope we will never see each other again.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.280
Wait a minute. I'm wondering why you don't want to see me again.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.600
We're in the same school.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.200
But even if you don't see me in person,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.460
you will see me on the posters around the school anyway.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.280
I've known you for only half a day,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.640
but I feel like you've already stolen so many things from my life.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.510
My role.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.950
My chance to be chosen as a delegate.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.260
Also, my mom and my uncle.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.130
I don't like you. Do you understand?

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.400
I don't like you!

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.000
That makes you dislike me?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.880
Is it because I've always defeated you?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.040
Why don't you try to defeat me?

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:43.950
That's so stupid.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.170
Why do I have to do that?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.640
I don't know too.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:55.170
Why don't you go back and think about whether you want to be a loser for the rest of your life or not?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.080
Why don't you go back and think about whether you want to be a loser for the rest of your life or not?

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.550
So, what's the challenge?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.060
Tell me.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.310
Are you sure?

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.600
Just tell me.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.930
I have one condition, it has to be fair.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.510
In the next three weeks, there will be a Net Idol Awards Ceremony.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.640
Do you know Mook, who made a school promo with me?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.840
She invited me to go to that event.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:28.820
So what?

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.510
If you can make Mook invite you instead,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.680
you win.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.350
How is this fair?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.620
You two know each other. Also, she had invited you.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.240
You already won.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.800
I rejected her.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.020
Why?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.330
Are you telling me that

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.680
you're a heartbreaker?

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.060
I have my own reasons.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.460
Anyway, Mook has to find another person to go with.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.990
What do you say?

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.220
Will you accept my challenge?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.370
If I win,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.910
what will I get?

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:17.930
Sometimes, the feeling you get when you win is already rewarding.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.110
You should think...

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.420
about what you want.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.930
I’d better go now.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.310
What does he want from me?

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.240
(X: Good luck)

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.770
Hey!

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.040
Where did he get my LINE ID?

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.970
You've found it?

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.950
Yes, it's vibrating inside my bag.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.350
Oh!

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.060
It must be!

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.460
(Q: Boo!!!)

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.460
You're going to hit on Mook

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.460
for 21 days?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.020
My goal is to make her invite me to the Net Idol Awards Ceremony.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.970
You guys have to help me!

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.820
How did you get yourself into this?

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.350
Do you know what he said to me?

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.930
Hm?

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.840
I can ask Mook to review your mom's bakery products for free.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.310
But I think she will be more proud if you do it yourself.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.860
Bro, what if my friend loses?

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.550
Whoever loses

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.840
must give what the winner wants

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.680
That's all.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.020
What do you want from my friend?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.460
You will know what I want if he loses.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.510
As for now, you better hurry before it's too late.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.350
What do you guys say? Will you help me?

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.400
A challenge like this gets my blood pumping!

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.800
I'm in!

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.510
Fine, I'm in it too.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.950
Let the 21-Day Mission begins.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.350
There's me!

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:09.200
There's you!

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.150
This is...

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.040
Go!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:18.040
the reason that my life begins to change after 21 days.
