1
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,416
Help.

2
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,416
I need help.

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,833
Help.

4
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,583
Help.

5
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Help.

6
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,208
Pee Mak.

7
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,458
A long time has passed.

8
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,500
And still no help has come to our rescue.

9
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,208
The enemy have surrounded us.

10
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,291
Our forces...

11
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,541
have taken heavy casualties.
Thus, dying in droves.

12
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,583
Should this persist,

13
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,125
I fear that...

14
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,041
we shall certainly be defeated.

15
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:07,833
Why the hell are you talking like that?

16
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,375
That's so lame.

17
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,041
Are you from the middle ages?

18
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,875
Private Mak is injured.

19
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,083
Mak!

20
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,333
How bad is it, doc?

21
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,500
You'll be okay.

22
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:32,916
You just sprained your leg.

23
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,708
Sprained my leg?

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,916
You bastard!

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,041
From the sound of your groaning,

26
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,208
I thought you broke your spleen.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,250
Am I going to make it back home
to Phra Khanong?

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,666
My wife, Nak, probably gave birth already.

29
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,875
Are we really going to die here?

30
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,708
Damn it!

31
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,666
Why are you all giving up?

32
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,083
Haven't you heard
about the Battle of Thermopylae?

33
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,833
King Leonidas.

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,625
Stelios.

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,375
They were all outnumbered
by thousands of enemies.

36
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,541
But in the end, didn't everybody die?

37
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,541
Really?

38
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,041
Sorry.

39
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,916
I haven't got to that part.

40
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,291
Take Rocky for example, then.

41
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,291
Rocky road?

42
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,083
That's yummy. Where is it?

43
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,250
Where is it?

44
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,333
Oh, gosh!

45
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,916
How about The Last Samurai?

46
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,083
During his final battle,
he fought so hard his blade shattered.

47
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,333
He didn't even think of giving up.

48
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,958
We still have our swords here.

49
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,750
We're not missing any limbs.

50
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:04,958
Asshole!

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,708
Forgive me.

52
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,625
Just all our swords, then.

53
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,625
Do we not have a fighting chance?

54
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,875
-Yes!
-Yes!

55
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,875
Kill them!

56
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,458
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

57
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,541
Shit!

58
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,166
They've got guns. I forgot.

59
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,791
Are you okay, Mak?

60
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,500
Hey, Shin.

61
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,500
Since we are all going to die anyway,

62
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,583
can I ask you something?

63
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,625
What's with your hair?

64
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,708
When I was little,
there was a cholera outbreak.

65
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,583
I almost died.

66
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,041
So my mother swore to God if I survived,

67
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,291
I would keep this hairdo
for the rest of my life.

68
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,916
I would rather die than live
with that ugly topknot hairdo.

69
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,166
It looks like a dog's talus.

70
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,666
What about yours?

71
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,333
I'm a trendsetter!

72
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,250
Stop shooting already! Damn it!

73
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,375
Mak, do you have any last words?

74
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,833
No, I don't.

75
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,166
I will make it back to see my wife
and my baby no matter what.

76
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,208
I will not allow myself to die here.

77
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,916
Nor will all of you.

78
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,875
Pee Mak.

79
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,750
Pee Mak.

80
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,000
Pee Mak.

81
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,875
Why did you come out?
I told you to go inside. Hurry!

82
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,250
Pee Mak.

83
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,500
Pee Mak.

84
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,125
Pee Mak.

85
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,166
Pee Mak.

86
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,541
There are too many people playing.

87
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,666
I won't deal you in.

88
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,625
Come on, man.

89
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,958
No cash, no chance to play.

90
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:48,666
Let's deal.

91
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,166
Are you going to shuffle until dawn?

92
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,416
Why don't you go put on a card show?

93
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,875
Is your dad David Blaine?

94
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,791
Hurry up! Come on.

95
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,833
What the hell?

96
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,958
A double.

97
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:06,958
Shit. I got zero.

98
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,708
I got one! Pay up.

99
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,041
What's wrong?

100
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,375
My wound hurts.

101
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,708
I can't believe you survived.

102
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,625
You must be invincible.

103
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,750
I must thank all of you
for bringing me all the way here.

104
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,500
We are the ones who should be grateful.

105
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,916
Without you,
we would all be dead by now, Mak.

106
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,000
Actually, my name is pronounced

107
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,208
"Mark" with the R sound.

108
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,208
Merk?

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,625
It's fine. You can call me Mak.

110
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,041
The only person
who calls me Mark is my daddy.

111
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,958
But he went back
to the United States of America

112
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,333
with the missionaries.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,583
Everyone in my village calls me Mak.

114
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,583
What the hell?

115
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
Hey, guys. We made it to Phra Khanong.

116
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:58,791
We're here?

117
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,416
Finally.

118
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,875
Where is everybody?

119
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,958
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

120
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:38,916
Nak!

121
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,166
Nak!

122
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,583
Nak, honey!

123
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,208
I'm back!

124
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,750
Nak!

125
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,333
Is Nak taking a dump?

126
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Nak!

127
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,333
Where were you?

128
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
I was really worried.

129
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,875
I thought I would never see you again.

130
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,458
Don't cry, baby.

131
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,708
You won't look handsome.

132
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,083
You know,

133
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,916
when I was at war,

134
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
I missed you so much.

135
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,208
I missed you a lot.

136
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,708
I missed you so, so very much.

137
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,666
I missed you more than anyone
in the whole world.

138
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,750
Man, Mak is whipped.

139
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,875
Baby, did you miss me at all?

140
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,583
No.

141
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,333
Why not?

142
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,541
You don't love me anymore?

143
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,125
You crazy man.

144
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,541
Of course I do.

145
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,958
You're joking with me?

146
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,125
Don't joke like that.

147
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,708
So cheesy.

148
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,250
Nak, what about our baby?

149
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,083
He's playing over there.

150
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,083
Let me see. Come to Daddy.

151
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,083
Wow, he is handsome just like his Daddy!

152
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,125
I named him after your favorite name.

153
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,375
Really, Nak?

154
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,791
Dang!

155
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,583
Dang, my boy.

156
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,958
What's so cool about the name Dang?

157
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,625
I know.

158
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,666
Even my servant has a cooler name.

159
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,208
Hey, you guys.

160
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,125
This is my wife, Nak.

161
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,041
Hello there.

162
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,083
Nak. These are my friends.

163
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,208
This is Aey,

164
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,833
Ter, Puek, and that's Shin.

165
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,500
So, what are you guys going to do now?

166
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,416
I guess tonight will be difficult
to find a boat out.

167
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,708
We'll stay here for a night.

168
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,666
Why just one night?

169
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,375
Why don't you all stay here
until the war is over?

170
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,750
The house across the canal is empty
ever since my aunt passed away.

171
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,625
There's a boat for you to use too.

172
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,708
Jeez.

173
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,125
Will his aunt come to haunt us?

174
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,125
Shin. She will definitely haunt you
until your hair falls out.

175
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,375
We'll stay here for just a night.
We don't want to be a bother.

176
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,291
Come on.

177
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,291
They are welcoming us
and you just turn them down?

178
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,750
You have no manners, Aey.

179
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,708
Right?

180
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,625
Mak's wife is so damn beautiful.

181
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,458
Easy, man. That's our friend's wife.

182
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,458
You know, I am a very bad soldier.

183
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,083
How come?

184
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,416
When I was at war,

185
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,666
I never thought of Siam.

186
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,375
I never thought about my country.

187
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,166
All I thought about was you.

188
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,416
This soldier should be executed
by a firing squad.

189
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,625
Yes.

190
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,833
You should be.

191
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,791
You know something?

192
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,333
I waited for you at the pier everyday.

193
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,541
I am here now.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,375
I promise you.

195
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,791
I won't go anywhere again.

196
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,541
Hey.

197
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,500
Nak.

198
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,500
Our house has fireflies as well?

199
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,791
That's so beautiful.

200
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,333
That's a filth-eating spirit.

201
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,333
What?

202
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,750
Nak!

203
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,541
Why are you joking with me like that?

204
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,208
You know I am scared of ghosts.

205
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,833
What are you looking for?

206
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,250
I'll put my Buddha amulet back on.

207
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,083
The doctor took it off
when they bandaged me.

208
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,916
Goodness.

209
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,833
There's a lot of blood on it.
Just put it away for now.

210
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,291
Let me clean it for you first.

211
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
Okay.

212
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,166
My wife is the sweetest person in Siam.

213
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,458
And you smell great too.

214
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:15,000
At this temple

215
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:24,041
There are

216
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:30,375
Seven palm trees

217
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,375
The hill myna

218
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:40,458
Is out

219
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:48,250
But has not returned

220
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,375
Hey, guys. Look.
They aren't scared of people at all.

221
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,333
Cute, huh?

222
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,291
Yes. So cute.

223
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,583
-"Cute" my ass!
-Damn!

224
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,416
Why do you have to be
an animal lover this early?

225
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,875
Can't you see we're all sleeping here?

226
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,875
How can anybody sleep
with you chirping away?

227
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
This damn gluttonous bird too.
Go. Go eat somewhere else.

228
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Go. Fly out of my house.

229
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,083
Hey! Wake up, you guys.

230
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,666
You're here early.

231
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,458
The market will close if we're late.

232
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,583
What's on the boat?

233
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,791
The bodies of soldiers
who died in the war.

234
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,791
The cemetery is full.

235
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,291
So we must return the bodies
to their families

236
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,916
to be buried at home.

237
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,791
Hey!

238
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:36,791
Keep rowing.

239
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,041
Jeez.

240
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,291
Snakehead.

241
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,166
Fresh fish. We have them in all sizes.

242
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,958
The market is very crowded today.

243
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,375
Hello.

244
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,333
Snacks.

245
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,916
-We got sticky cakes and cookies too.
-Miss Nim.

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,041
Miss Nim.

247
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,791
May I have two cookies
and two coconut milk custards?

248
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,333
-Mak.
-Yes?

249
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,500
We're all out!

250
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,958
-Hey!
-Hey.

251
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,916
Damn it.

252
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,583
We won't get to eat any.

253
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,583
Mr. Aum.

254
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,166
-Mak.
-I want to buy some fish for Nak.

255
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,833
Not for sale.

256
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,291
Today's a Buddhist holy day.
I am releasing them for merit.

257
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,291
Rejoice. Go on.

258
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,875
Get out of my way.

259
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:40,833
Hey!

260
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,708
Do you think he did that right?

261
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,000
What's gotten into him?

262
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,500
LIQUOR SHOP

263
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,416
Mrs. Priek.

264
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,458
Wake up. You have customers.

265
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,708
Mrs. Priek.

266
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,083
You don't remember me?

267
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,666
Do you have a job for me?

268
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,583
No.

269
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,208
You punk.

270
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:17,750
How many staff do you think
a small liquor shop need?

271
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,291
You think I need a salesperson,

272
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,916
a mixologist, a waitress,

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,375
a hostess,

274
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,125
a bartender, a dishwasher, and a busboy?

275
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,125
I got them all.

276
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,750
Drink up, dear.

277
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,250
She's even got an escort.

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,666
Very good.

279
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,791
You look familiar.

280
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,458
I am Mak.

281
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,875
I just got back from the war.

282
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,625
If I hadn't met Nak first,
I would've hit on you.

283
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,083
You're so damn pretty.

284
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,666
As pretty as your ghost!

285
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,833
You really don't know, Mak?

286
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,083
If you want to know the truth,

287
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,125
go bend down, look between the legs,
and you'll see that Nak and your kid are--

288
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,375
Mom.

289
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,708
-Be quiet.
-Ping.

290
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,833
You're drunk now. Go rest.

291
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,041
-I'm not drunk.
-Mom!

292
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,416
-Why did you stop me? I'm not drunk.
-Go. Get up.

293
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,958
I'm sorry. My mom talks nonsense
when she's drunk.

294
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,583
-Get inside.
-Nak!

295
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,625
Nak. Let her come. I'm not scared!

296
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,583
Nak! Let her come!

297
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,958
What's wrong with her?

298
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,625
Everyone is acting weird, don't you think?

299
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,625
Yes. What did Mrs. Priek mean, anyway?

300
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,166
Why do you have to look between the legs?

301
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,583
Yoga exercise?

302
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,708
My mom once told me,

303
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,375
if you look at someone between the legs,

304
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,916
you can tell if they're ghosts.

305
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,708
You mean...

306
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
Nak is a ghost?

307
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,875
That's crazy.

308
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,750
She's too hot to be a ghost.

309
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,833
Right.

310
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,416
If she can be that beautiful,

311
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,416
I would take her even if she's a ghost.

312
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,625
Why did Mrs. Priek talk to Mak like that?

313
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,166
Because she was wasted.

314
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,625
So she just blabbered on about things.

315
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,708
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

316
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,666
Where the hell is Mak, anyway?

317
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,916
How come he isn't here drinking with us?

318
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,166
Aey, you idiot.

319
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,333
You're spilling all the booze.

320
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,541
You go and get Mak here.

321
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,500
Hurry up.

322
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,291
Why me?

323
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,500
Because you drank the least.

324
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,166
It's been over an hour
yet you can't even finish one glass.

325
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,125
That's right.

326
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,875
We are all drunk. So you go.

327
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:44,833
Right.

328
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,041
That was my bad.

329
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:47,916
-Hey, don't waste it.
-Hurry up.

330
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,333
Mak.

331
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,291
Mak.

332
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,416
Nak, is Mak here?

333
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,958
Hey, Shin.

334
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,416
Nak.

335
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,041
Is Mak here?

336
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,083
He's sleeping.

337
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,958
I will wake him for you.

338
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,333
Please come in first.

339
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,333
Where is Dang?

340
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,333
Nak.

341
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,416
Are you okay?

342
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,625
You ran out of coconut husks?

343
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,791
What the hell is wrong with you, Shin?

344
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,708
Puek. Slap me, please?

345
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,125
That's hard.

346
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,666
You told me to.

347
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,500
Where the hell is Mak, anyway?

348
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,958
How come he isn't here drinking with us?

349
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,500
Aey, you idiot.

350
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,958
You're spilling all the booze.

351
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,250
Shit. Déjà vu.

352
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,166
What déjà vu?

353
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,958
You go and get Mak. Hurry up.

354
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,375
No. Why me?

355
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,000
What are you scared of?

356
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:29,958
If Nak is really a ghost,
then you just seduce her.

357
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,875
There's no such thing as ghosts.

358
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,291
You want to bet?

359
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,708
You won't get me this time.

360
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,416
The drums of war sound off
Like rolling thunder

361
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,625
As we set out to protect our homeland

362
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:18,333
Our thirst for battle is great 

363
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,875
Even though there are no elephant rides

364
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:25,125
Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts
Of love for my beautiful dearest

365
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:29,666
Roused to the point of release
I raise my white flag in sweet surrender

366
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,625
And polish my sword

367
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,083
What the fuck?

368
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,375
What's with you, Shin?

369
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,875
Where is Mak?

370
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,041
Nak is a ghost!

371
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,208
Nak is really a ghost!

372
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,458
What are you babbling about?

373
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,416
If you're drunk, go vomit somewhere else.

374
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Seriously! I went up to Mak's house.

375
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,791
His house looks run-down and abandoned.

376
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,708
Hey.

377
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:52,125
Maybe Nak is feeling lazy.

378
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,750
But the crib was swinging by itself.

379
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,875
Hey.

380
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,500
The wind was pretty strong.

381
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:57,958
You are imagining things.

382
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,958
I'm not!

383
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,625
I saw Nak upstairs,

384
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,708
but she was able to reach to the ground
to grab a lime.

385
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,208
Hey.

386
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,875
Maybe one of her arms is longer
than the other?

387
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:18,166
Don't you know it's possible for our arms
not to have the same length?

388
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,125
Look at mine. See? Not the same.

389
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:29,583
Or maybe Nak was just using a long stick
to get the lime.

390
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,208
You're drunk
and your imagination got the best of you.

391
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,166
Yes.

392
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,291
Hey.

393
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,083
Did you memorize our marching song, Shin?

394
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,833
Let's dance. Ready?

395
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,791
The drums of war sound off
Like rolling thunder

396
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,291
As we set out to protect our homeland

397
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,208
Our thirst for battle is great
Even though there are no elephant rides

398
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,791
Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts
Of love for my beautiful dearest

399
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,458
Mak.

400
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,166
Can't we sleep a bit longer?

401
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,041
Come on. Help me out.

402
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,458
I don't know what's going on
with the townsfolk.

403
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,791
Only you guys are willing to help.

404
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,041
Hey, Shin.

405
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,916
Aren't you done freaking out?

406
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,458
What's wrong, Ter? Get up and help us.

407
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,833
Get up and help us.

408
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,000
Right, Ter.

409
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,041
Go get an ax and help Puek.

410
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,750
Ask Nak where it is.

411
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,625
What the fuck?

412
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,708
I went up to Mak's house.

413
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,000
His house looks run-down and abandoned.

414
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:23,666
My mom once told me,

415
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,875
if you look at someone between the legs,

416
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:28,250
you can tell if they're ghosts.

417
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,583
Um, I...

418
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,625
I'm looking for an ax.
Do you know where it is?

419
00:30:58,791 --> 00:30:59,750
Shin.

420
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,791
I did look between the legs,
but I didn't see anything.

421
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,250
So stop freaking out.

422
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,166
-Really?
-Yes.

423
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:08,875
How is that possible?

424
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,375
My god!

425
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:50,416
Shit.

426
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,416
Damn it!

427
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,125
I'm not even done yet.

428
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,583
Holy shit!

429
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,750
Shit. I saw a...

430
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,500
Ter. What happened to your face?

431
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,166
I saw a...

432
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:23,583
What?

433
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,708
There's a... behind the house.

434
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,000
What the hell is he talking about?

435
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,291
Thank you.

436
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,416
Oh, my god.

437
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,791
Nak is a...

438
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,625
What are you saying, Ter?
Are you talking dirty?

439
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,000
Nak

440
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,125
is

441
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:52,500
a...

442
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,666
What am I?

443
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:04,000
What is wrong with your face, Ter?

444
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,625
Did you get stung by bees, Ter?

445
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,625
My mom told me
to use limewater to heal bee stings.

446
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,000
Nak, can you make some?

447
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,125
I'll see what I can do.

448
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,958
Thank you.

449
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:23,875
Watch your step.

450
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,208
Nak is...

451
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,791
I saw her body behind the house.

452
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,416
She really is a...

453
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,625
Ter, stop being silly.

454
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:40,666
Right.

455
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,833
What are you saying?

456
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,708
I can't understand your nonsense talk.

457
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,916
NAK IS A GHOST

458
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,875
Guys, it's raining.

459
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,583
Come take cover inside.

460
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,083
Ter.

461
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,875
What happened to your face?

462
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:31,916
What paper is that?

463
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,166
Bee sting.

464
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,583
-Let me see.
-See what?

465
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,583
The paper.

466
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,875
What paper? There's no paper.

467
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:52,875
Ter.

468
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:53,833
Bee sting.

469
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,500
-I want to see the paper.
-It was a bee sting.

470
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,291
-Let me see it now.
-Hey.

471
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,291
-Ter.
-Hey.

472
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,500
-Ter.
-Hey.

473
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,125
He said "It's about to rain.
He has clothes drying outside,

474
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:20,083
so he'll go home now."

475
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,041
How did you make sense of that, Puek?

476
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,458
I don't know.

477
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:27,000
Let's go get the damn clothes already.
I can't take it anymore.

478
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,916
Gosh! I almost had a fling with a ghost.

479
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,750
What are you doing?

480
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,750
I'm packing my stuff to leave.

481
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:41,875
We can't stay here.

482
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,416
Are you sure, Ter?

483
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,541
Of course. I saw it with my own eyes.

484
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,208
The ruby ring is exactly like Nak's.

485
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,625
Is it a big ruby?

486
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,416
Jerk. That's not the point.

487
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,000
Then, how come when you looked
between the legs, you didn't see anything?

488
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:57,125
How would I know?

489
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,208
I looked between her legs and saw nothing

490
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,250
except her honey pot.

491
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,250
What?

492
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,458
I mean the honey pot in the kitchen.

493
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,125
-Oh, right.
-You idiot!

494
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,791
You're supposed to look
between your own legs!

495
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,791
Is that so?

496
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,875
Then, why didn't you say so?

497
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,000
What?

498
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,833
Do you think Mak got the message?

499
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:24,916
Of course.

500
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,916
He looked really shocked.

501
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:37,166
Look. He just went inside.

502
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,541
I know the truth now.

503
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,041
Why didn't you tell me?

504
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,875
Did you think I would be disgusted?

505
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,000
Who told you?

506
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,958
That's not important, Nak.

507
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:10,000
Didn't we promise each other
there would be no secret between us?

508
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,916
I didn't know how to tell you.

509
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:24,708
What if you couldn't take it?

510
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,916
I couldn't risk it.

511
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,500
How could I not take it?

512
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,375
I used to be like that too.

513
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,958
Hey. If he knows the truth,
how come he still looks so in love?

514
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,125
I know.

515
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,625
Shit. I know why.

516
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,708
It says Nak is "gross," not a ghost.

517
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,416
If she is gross,

518
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,083
then what's the big deal?

519
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,250
But if you're really gross,
that's disgusting.

520
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,708
You've never had an underarm zit?
I had one last year and it was--

521
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,750
Hey! What are you guys talking about?

522
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:04,583
Let's pack up and get out of here.

523
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,208
Let's go pack up now.

524
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,666
What are you lingering there for, Ter?
Hurry!

525
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,791
I can't abandon him.

526
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,833
What now?

527
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,666
Are we really going to leave Mak
with a ghost?

528
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,958
Can I not go?

529
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:41,916
No.

530
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,000
You're the one who saw Nak
with her long arm.

531
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,416
You have to tell Mak.

532
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,375
How can someone that beautiful be a ghost?

533
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,166
Anyone here?

534
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,958
Anybody home?

535
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,375
Hey, Ping.

536
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,291
Why are you crying?

537
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,666
Can anyone help me slaughter my cow?

538
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,041
I sympathize with you.

539
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,041
You must really love your cow.

540
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,625
But people can eat anything
when they're starving.

541
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,750
Don't worry about it.

542
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,958
-I once ate my own dog--
-It's not like that.

543
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,750
It's to feed people at the funeral.

544
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,625
Whose funeral is it?

545
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,083
My mom's.

546
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,625
Mrs. Priek is dead?

547
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,250
That day at the market,

548
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,541
she told Mak about Nak.

549
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,541
So, Nak got angry and killed her.

550
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:38,375
Her body had just surfaced this morning.

551
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,291
Shin and Ter.

552
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:40,250
Damn it.

553
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:51,916
Mak.

554
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,625
Mak.

555
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,375
Hey.

556
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:56,958
What's up?

557
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,125
Mak.

558
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,416
I have something to tell you.

559
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:04,666
Do you know that your wife...

560
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,541
Your wife is--

561
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,625
Beautiful!

562
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,791
What?

563
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:31,291
Right. I wanted to say
that your wife is very good-looking.

564
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,791
She's like a pageant queen.

565
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,583
I just couldn't wait to tell you.

566
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,958
You guys are so sweet.

567
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,083
You didn't have to
make a big deal out of it.

568
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:45,250
Now, we have to tell you
about important stuff like this.

569
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,166
Next time, there's no need to rush.

570
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,541
My wife will still be pretty tomorrow.

571
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,750
-See you.
-Mak.

572
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,750
Why don't you invite your friends up here
to eat something first?

573
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,916
Make yourself at home, guys.
No need to be too formal.

574
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,041
Go ahead.

575
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,250
Everything is delicious.

576
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:10,833
Go on.

577
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,041
I saw your mouth watering. So, eat up.

578
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,666
We are full already.

579
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,958
-Really?
-Yes.

580
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:26,125
Yes. There was a buffet at the market.

581
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,291
That's too bad.

582
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,083
Nak will be sad.

583
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,333
She worked so hard in the kitchen.

584
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,375
-How about next time?
-Up to you, man.

585
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,208
I can eat by myself.
You guys are missing out.

586
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,291
We shouldn't have eaten so much.

587
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,541
On second thought,
it wouldn't hurt to have a bite.

588
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,708
Wow, this dish looks good.

589
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,000
I'll try some.

590
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,083
Go ahead.

591
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,833
Very nice. So delicious.

592
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,291
I told you.

593
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,000
You guys should try some.

594
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,583
-What?
-Try this.

595
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,625
-Try it.
-Puek, go on.

596
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,791
-Just try it.
-Eat up.

597
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:32,875
-Right. Just try it.
-Eat up.

598
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,458
Where did you learn to cook, Nak?

599
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,291
Le Cordon Bleu?

600
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,541
Shin, why don't you eat anything?

601
00:42:56,416 --> 00:43:00,041
Right, Shin. This one is yours.

602
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,583
Oh, that is Nak's signature dish.

603
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,125
Go for it, Shin.

604
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:10,625
Hey.

605
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,833
Big bite, man.

606
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,125
How was it?

607
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,708
Damn good!

608
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,666
My Nak is the best cook.

609
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,541
Hey! Does anyone want to hold Dang?

610
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,500
My Dang. My son.

611
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,833
Peekaboo! What's up, baby?

612
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,625
You want to play with Mr. Shin?

613
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,083
Right, Shin. You love kids, right?

614
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,000
Let's play with Mr. Shin.

615
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,958
Here you go, man.

616
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:20,750
Oh, dear.

617
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,750
Hey, Shin.

618
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,333
Dang really likes you.

619
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,416
"Kiss me, Mr. Shin."

620
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,833
"Kiss me, Mr. Shin."

621
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,958
"Kiss me, Mr. Shin."

622
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:46,750
He can't stop smiling.
Come here. Come to Daddy.

623
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,750
-Go back.
-"Go back" what?

624
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,208
Go back home!

625
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,583
What are you guys doing?

626
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:02,583
I know.

627
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,166
You guys...

628
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,958
feel like playing charades?

629
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,208
Like we did during the war, right?
Okay. I like that idea.

630
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,458
Nak, let's play charades.

631
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:15,291
-What charades?
-Let's do it.

632
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:25,125
Hurry up, Shin.

633
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,708
Just watch me.

634
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,291
Throw?

635
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:35,791
Javelin?

636
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,166
Athlete?

637
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,166
Throw?

638
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,583
Throw away?

639
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:44,708
Trout?

640
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:46,916
No?

641
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,375
Trout?

642
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:50,791
What is it?

643
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,166
Kitchen.

644
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,333
Kitchen?

645
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,916
Oh, a cook?

646
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,500
A beautiful cook?

647
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,541
Damn. Then, what is it?

648
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,750
Nak's kitchen?

649
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,666
Mak's kitchen.

650
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:05,666
No.

651
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,958
Mak and Nak's kitchen?

652
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,041
No?

653
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,458
Will he ever guess it right
in this lifetime?

654
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,375
A pan?

655
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:13,708
A knife?

656
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:14,958
A spear?

657
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,958
-Correct!
-I told you so.

658
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,166
What spear?

659
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,291
Body?

660
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,041
Armpit?

661
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:24,833
Armpit hair?

662
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,750
-No.
-Sweaty armpit?

663
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,750
Smelly armpit?

664
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,833
No.

665
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,125
Bumpy armpits.

666
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,416
-Not that one.
-Not that either?

667
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,416
Gosh.

668
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,916
I wonder what Mak's IQ really is?

669
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,291
What is it? A bed?

670
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,208
A bed, right?

671
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,416
A bamboo bed?

672
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,958
-Correct!
-"A spear near the bed."

673
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:46,875
That's right!

674
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:50,125
-Yes!
-You're good, man.

675
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,666
Who the heck came up with this phrase?

676
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,583
Your dad must be Shakespeare.
That one was difficult.

677
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,375
-A bird?
-Flying?

678
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,583
A bat?

679
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,958
-A shirt?
-Correct!

680
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:07,458
-A shirt.
-We're almost there.

681
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,291
A dog?

682
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:11,791
A tongue?

683
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,500
Tonguefish?

684
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,416
Tonguefish wearing a shirt?

685
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,083
What the hell is that?

686
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,208
What is it, Ter?

687
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:23,375
-What?
-Damn.

688
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,250
-Nak?
-No.

689
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,250
Beautiful?

690
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,250
Sexy?

691
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,166
What is it?

692
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,083
A woman?

693
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,166
A wife?

694
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,375
I got it.

695
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,916
Dead.

696
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,875
Desert.

697
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:42,791
Correct!

698
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,500
It's so easy, Ter.
This is a shirt and that's a dead girl.

699
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,458
Dead shirt, pronounced as "desert."

700
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,875
No, that can't be right.

701
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,833
Shin's answer is wrong, right?

702
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,208
Yes. Shin is wrong.

703
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,166
How can it be wrong?

704
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,500
This is a shirt and she is dead.
So it's dead shirt, or desert.

705
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:12,166
"Yay" my ass.

706
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,000
What is going on?

707
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,625
So what is the answer?

708
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,291
Let me see the paper.

709
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,875
What are you doing, Ter?

710
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,125
I'm hungry again.

711
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:25,666
I just realized

712
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,750
I left the rice in the pot at home.
I better go check.

713
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,833
Yes. I meant to remind you.

714
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:32,625
Let's go before it burns. Quick. Let's go.

715
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,250
-What about the shirt?
-Forget about it.

716
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:36,291
Won't you tell us the answer first?

717
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,541
-What the hell?
-Hurry up, Shin!

718
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,000
-I already gave the right answer.
-"Right" my ass. That was close.

719
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,041
Hold on.

720
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,833
Shin, hurry up!

721
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:56,583
Shin, come on!

722
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,666
Wait up!

723
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,708
Holy shit!

724
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:01,041
Shin, hurry up!

725
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:03,833
Hey, wait up.

726
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:07,500
-Ter! Hurry!
-Ter!

727
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,000
She's right behind you!

728
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:14,458
-Come on, Ter. Hurry!
-Come on, Ter.

729
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,875
Untie the boat. Let's go!

730
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,583
Paddle hard.

731
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,166
Why the hell are we turning?

732
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,708
Shit! We're circling back around.

733
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:36,791
Go that way!

734
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,166
Why are you turning again?

735
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,958
Where are you guys going in such a hurry?

736
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,666
Don't you want to finish the game?

737
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:54,083
I didn't get a chance to play yet.

738
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:56,541
What phrase would you act out?

739
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,125
MYOB.

740
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,041
Puek, what does it mean?

741
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,333
It means "mind your own business."
Did you have to ask?

742
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,416
Just go!

743
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,208
Damn, I think Nak is on to us now.

744
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,291
She won't let us live for sure.

745
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:30,708
What's that?

746
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,833
You go check.

747
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:58,166
Get out of my aunt's house right now!

748
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,416
What's wrong with you, Mak?

749
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,583
You guys are no different
than the townsfolk

750
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,833
who think that my wife is a ghost.

751
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,458
You have to listen to us, man.

752
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,708
Your wife is really dead.

753
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:09,125
Everybody knows it.

754
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,708
My wife is not dead.

755
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:12,458
Ping lied to all the villagers.

756
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,458
They said when I was at war,

757
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:16,583
Ping tried to seduce Nak.

758
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,958
When I didn't show any interest,

759
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,583
he bad-mouthed me

760
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,708
by telling all kinds of lies.

761
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,125
Everyone believed him.

762
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,166
And now everybody hates me.

763
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,291
I get the picture, man.

764
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,500
You didn't have to change your voice.

765
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,541
So, that's it.

766
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:46,958
Ping fooled all of you too.

767
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:48,416
No, you're the one who is being fooled.

768
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,625
Watch your mouth!

769
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:51,041
Stop being an idiot!

770
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:52,625
Just listen to us.

771
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,458
We're trying to tell you the truth

772
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,791
because you are our friend.

773
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,125
I don't need friends like you!

774
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:00,541
Mak!

775
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,291
Mak!

776
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:07,625
I think...

777
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,125
we need to take drastic measures.

778
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,625
I kicked all of them out.

779
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:33,125
What did your friends say?

780
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,583
I don't care what they said.

781
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,083
They cannot talk about you like that.

782
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:55,750
If you are really a ghost,

783
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,666
I should be able to go through you, right?

784
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,708
Let me try.

785
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Hey!

786
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,458
Hey, I can go through you.

787
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:06,833
Hey!

788
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,208
This is so cool.

789
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,291
This is super cool.

790
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,500
-Hey!
-Enough.

791
00:53:14,916 --> 00:53:16,333
What did you do?

792
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,500
Look at you. You're all dirty.

793
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,416
So what else have you cooked for me?

794
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,500
Your cooking is as good as always.

795
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,333
Nak, my love, is so pretty.

796
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,041
How can you be a ghost, right?

797
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,833
Wait up!

798
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,083
A ghost.

799
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:15,958
Why don't you try to scare me?

800
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:17,666
Stick your tongue out.

801
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,250
Scare me.

802
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:22,166
You are no fun. Boo.

803
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,333
Damn fatso.
I'm going to smack you in the head.

804
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,416
Are you going to wear this mask all night?

805
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,250
Why not?

806
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:32,875
It's kind of funny.

807
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,375
Okay.

808
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:43,583
I begin to get sad
Looking far across the sky

809
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:51,000
It's nearly dawn, the light is faint

810
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:58,333
I know our time is coming to an end

811
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:01,166
My heart is breaking

812
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:06,541
But what else am I going to do?

813
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:11,333
I want to cry

814
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,333
And beg time to go by slowly

815
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:20,666
I need more time

816
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,958
Let's look at each other more

817
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:32,833
I want to stop the time

818
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:37,708
Before we say goodbye forever

819
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,916
Won't Dang cry if he wakes up
and doesn't see anyone there?

820
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,458
Don't worry.

821
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,541
Dang never wakes up
in the middle of the night.

822
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:52,708
Look, honey.

823
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:55,916
Ten cents per ball.

824
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,750
If you can knock them all down,
you win a doll.

825
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,291
Baby, watch this.

826
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,250
I'm just warming up.

827
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,375
This next one will hit for sure.

828
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:10,916
Almost.

829
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,333
This is the one.

830
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:16,625
Go.

831
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,500
Hit it.

832
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,416
Baby, look at the fireworks.

833
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,375
See that, Nak?

834
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:52,916
I told you I have good aim.

835
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,208
I'll go get you a doll.

836
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,708
Told you. I've had good aim
since I was a kid.

837
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,083
The line is so long.

838
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,208
I think we'll have to skip this ride.

839
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,333
Let's go get on other rides.

840
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,125
Hey.

841
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,125
-Is that her?
-Look.

842
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,375
The line is gone now.

843
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,291
You're right.

844
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,208
Nak.

845
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,833
Do you love me?

846
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,958
What kind of question is that?

847
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,708
What's wrong with that?

848
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,583
You don't love me anymore?

849
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,458
Of course I do.

850
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,000
Do you love me a lot?

851
00:57:58,791 --> 00:57:59,708
Lots and lots.

852
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,000
You love me lots and lots like jelly tots?

853
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:11,500
Hey, baby. Look.

854
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,458
There's a haunted house too.

855
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:15,500
Let's go in there after this.

856
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,791
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

857
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,583
Who, me?

858
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,583
Where?

859
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,791
Come on out. Ghosts?
I'm not scared of them.

860
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:37,875
Baby.

861
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,083
If one day I die,

862
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,750
can you live without me?

863
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,250
Why are you asking me this?

864
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,708
Just tell me. I want to know.

865
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,791
No.

866
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:00,791
If anyone is going to die,

867
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,375
then let that person be me.

868
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,166
If I don't have you, I can't go on living.

869
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,583
But if I die first,

870
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,375
you'd be able to find a new husband easily

871
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,666
with that big butt of yours.

872
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:42,583
HAUNTED HOUSE

873
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:44,375
-Please keep the doll for me.
-Okay.

874
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,625
Let's go, baby.

875
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,083
What kind of a goddamn ghost goes
to a haunted house?

876
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,208
Who will be scaring who?

877
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,666
I brought some powerful magic.

878
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,041
What is it?

879
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,708
I got this holy rice from a monk.

880
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:05,375
-It's very sacred.
-That's good.

881
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,125
By the way, where is Aey?

882
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:09,875
Where is he?

883
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:10,875
Hey.

884
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,125
Where have you been, Aey?

885
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,916
Well, I had diarrhea.

886
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,625
You were gone for a long time.

887
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Don't be scared, baby.

888
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:42,708
Come play with me.

889
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:08,083
I think I screamed too loud,
so I scared him away.

890
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,583
Sorry, Mak. This is for your own good.

891
01:01:24,875 --> 01:01:27,375
-Come play with me.
-Shin, you keep watch.

892
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,500
-Hurry up, Ter.
-Puek, hold his legs.

893
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:43,208
It's stuck.

894
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,083
Shit.

895
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,000
She's on to us.

896
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,041
What are we going to do?
The door is stuck.

897
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Shit.

898
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:02,916
It's too late. She is coming.

899
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,541
What now?

900
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,041
I have no idea.

901
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,375
Hey.

902
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,458
Why are you jumping?

903
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:01,541
That other boy was so damn energetic.

904
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,000
Come play with me.

905
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:14,291
Come play with me.

906
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,041
Come play with me.

907
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,666
Come play with me.

908
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,166
Come play with me.

909
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,916
Actually, you don't have to play.

910
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,958
Up to you.

911
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,750
You think Nak was really fooled by this?

912
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:18,125
What's with all these decorations?

913
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:24,791
What the hell is this?

914
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Hey!

915
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,250
You guys aren't customers!

916
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:45,958
Or did you get off work already?

917
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,041
Why doesn't anybody tell me?

918
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:52,041
Damn it! Letting me hang
upside down that long

919
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,125
might give me a stroke and kill me.

920
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,125
Let's go home, then.

921
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,208
Come on.

922
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:02,500
You there. It's time to go home.

923
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,166
The one who dressed up as Nak's ghost.

924
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,916
What a trendy costume.

925
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,750
Are you new here?

926
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:11,583
Let's go home.

927
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,125
Ter. Where is the holy rice?
The rice. Hurry!

928
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,708
-Take it out.
-Come on.

929
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,458
Hey!

930
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,041
What the hell are you screaming for?

931
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,041
It's just a fake hand.

932
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,791
You freaked me out with your screaming.
Take a look.

933
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:59,166
-Hey. Untie him.
-Come on.

934
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,666
What is going on with you?

935
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,125
Nak is really a ghost.

936
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,708
What ghost? It's all in your heads.

937
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,458
Just like this hand.

938
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,333
Mak, come here.

939
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:25,541
What is it now?

940
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,166
Shit. You scared me.

941
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,333
Holy shit.

942
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:50,666
A lizard.

943
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,708
I thought you saw

944
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:53,791
her!

945
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,208
There are otters around here?

946
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,541
You guys still won't let go
of this nonsense?

947
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:05,583
We are telling you the truth.

948
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:08,291
If you don't believe us,
try looking at Nak between your legs.

949
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:10,750
I did, and I saw nothing.

950
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,125
Maybe you didn't do it right.

951
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,125
You have to look down
between your own legs,

952
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,791
not between Nak's legs.

953
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:17,875
Of course.

954
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,583
Who would be that stupid?

955
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,875
My wife is not dead yet.

956
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,541
Hey, Mak. Wait up.

957
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,291
Where are you going?

958
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:37,041
How could he look between the legs
and not see anything?

959
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:40,916
Mak!

960
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,000
Mak! Where are you?

961
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,041
Mak!

962
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,541
Is this Mak's blood?

963
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,333
Shit.

964
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,083
Help.

965
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,791
Mak, is that you?

966
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,916
Are you okay?

967
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:16,666
Help me.

968
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:18,916
I'm hurt.

969
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:21,166
Help me, please.

970
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,291
Hey, Mak.

971
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,041
Help.

972
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,125
Help me.

973
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,625
Mak.

974
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,416
What's wrong?

975
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:35,791
My wound hurts.

976
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:37,375
Where?

977
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,708
Gosh. You're bleeding out.

978
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,666
You've had this wound for so long.
How come it's not healed yet?

979
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,625
Do you have something to pressure it?

980
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,083
Shin.

981
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,458
Something isn't right here.

982
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,875
You're right.

983
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:53,083
Isn't it way past the rainy season?

984
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,875
You idiot. Not about that.

985
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:58,500
I meant how Mak looked down
between his legs saw nothing.

986
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:02,583
So it means...

987
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:04,958
Nak is still alive?

988
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:09,500
But the body I saw in the backyard...

989
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,958
has the exact same ring as Nak's.

990
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,791
Shit. I remember now.

991
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:19,416
The ring that I saw is on the ring finger
on the left hand.

992
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,291
So what?

993
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,041
It's a wedding ring.

994
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,291
So that means...

995
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,666
Mak should be wearing one too.

996
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:43,625
Softly.

997
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:49,916
Ter, what are you doing?

998
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,666
What the hell are you doing, Ter?
You're hurting him!

999
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,000
Ter! Mak's wound is still raw.

1000
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,833
Shit, Mak! You scared me.

1001
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:19,375
I thought you had your ring on.

1002
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,916
My wedding ring?

1003
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,291
My hand hurts,
so I wear it around my neck instead.

1004
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,750
These are the bodies of soldiers
who died in the war.

1005
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:34,750
The cemetery is full now.

1006
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:37,291
So we have to return the bodies
to their family to be buried at home.

1007
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,916
You've had this wound for so long.
How come it's not healed yet?

1008
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:46,583
I will make it back to see my wife
and my baby no matter what.

1009
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,458
It's him!

1010
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:03,791
-What's wrong?
-Run!

1011
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,666
Ter, what the hell?

1012
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,125
What's the matter with you?

1013
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,041
Wait for me!

1014
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,958
Hurry up!

1015
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:30,125
Shit. That was Mak's body in the backyard?

1016
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,875
We've been living with a ghost
all this time?

1017
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:37,000
So Nak was really slandered, then.

1018
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:40,833
What about when I saw Nak's arm stretch
to the ground to grab a lime?

1019
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:47,416
Or...

1020
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:52,625
Maybe Nak was just using a long stick
to get the lime.

1021
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:57,541
It must've been that spear.

1022
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,083
Damn it.

1023
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:01,291
Are you sure

1024
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,208
that Nak is alive?

1025
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,500
We must take her with us, then.

1026
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,583
Why do you even bother about that?

1027
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:12,416
Come on.

1028
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,208
How can we leave her like that?

1029
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:17,041
She's all alone and so vulnerable.

1030
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,958
I don't care. No matter what...

1031
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,875
Nak and I will run away together.

1032
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:23,958
What?

1033
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,666
I mean run away with us.

1034
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,458
You womanizer!

1035
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,625
I want no part in this.

1036
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:31,166
Hey.

1037
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,958
Puek does have a point, though.

1038
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,541
You too, Ter?

1039
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,625
If one day

1040
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:40,375
Nak is haunted to death...

1041
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,708
We are all partly to blame

1042
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,416
for not doing anything to help her.

1043
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,416
The living can't stay with the dead.

1044
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,875
Hurry.

1045
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,708
Nak!

1046
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,208
Nak!

1047
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,083
Nak.

1048
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,875
It's been a while. How are you?

1049
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,833
I'm so sick of those villagers.

1050
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,416
Idiots.

1051
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,416
How could they believe Ping's lie?

1052
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,333
I tried to talk to them
but they wouldn't listen.

1053
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:34,500
Just now, I busted more than a few lips
on your behalf.

1054
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,541
Please accept our apology.

1055
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,291
Now, we have no doubt
that you're really alive.

1056
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:44,041
That's okay.

1057
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,500
Shin. What are you scared of now?

1058
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:51,583
Come here.

1059
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,625
Come here.

1060
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,041
Try and touch her. Trust me.

1061
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:58,458
Come on.

1062
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,083
You can touch her. See?

1063
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:09,166
What kind of ghost has such smooth skin?

1064
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,875
Why does she eat dried leaves
for food, then?

1065
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,166
Damn you.

1066
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,333
She's health-conscious.

1067
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:18,083
How do you think
she keeps her nice figure?

1068
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:21,000
Everyone eats organic food now.

1069
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,416
That's why you look like a model, right?

1070
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:26,083
But there were worms too.

1071
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:28,666
You idiot.

1072
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,875
Organic means no insecticide
so there are worms.

1073
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,375
That's how you know it's safe to eat.

1074
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,250
Have you ever studied
health education in school?

1075
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,791
Where is Pee Mak?

1076
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:46,291
Well, the war front has made its way here.

1077
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,125
It's very dangerous.

1078
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:51,916
Mak told us to take you with us first.

1079
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,541
That's right.

1080
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:57,500
Why didn't Pee Mak come with you?

1081
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,166
The path is very rough.

1082
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,416
So he's preparing provisions for us
at the waterfront.

1083
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,583
That's right.

1084
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,458
Let me get Dang for you.

1085
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,958
Let's get in the boat.

1086
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:11,708
-Come on, Nak.
-Hurry up, Shin.

1087
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,125
Not too far now.
Mak should be around here.

1088
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,875
Puek, the boat is sinking.

1089
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,833
Holy shit.

1090
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,375
-It's carrying too much weight.
-What?

1091
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,291
What should we do?

1092
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:33,041
Just toss things we don't need out.

1093
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,625
Okay. Throw it out, Shin!

1094
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:40,291
-Sit still.
-Shit!

1095
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,041
What now?
The water is getting inside the boat.

1096
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,875
What else can we toss out?

1097
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,708
Uh, is Dang necessary?

1098
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,416
I guess he is.

1099
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,208
-The paddles. Give me the paddles.
-What?

1100
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,791
-Hand me the paddles now.
-Here.

1101
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,500
How's that?

1102
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:04,708
The boat isn't sinking anymore!

1103
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,666
It's good that the boat stopped sinking.

1104
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,500
But how are we going to paddle now,
you moron?

1105
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,541
Why did you toss them out?

1106
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,625
They are so far now.

1107
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:23,083
Should we swim to the shore?

1108
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,166
I can't swim.

1109
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,708
Shit. It's Mak.

1110
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:36,833
Pee Mak!

1111
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:40,791
Where are you going?

1112
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,500
Mak, leave us alone.

1113
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,708
You're dead. Just let us go.

1114
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,458
What are you talking about?

1115
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:57,708
Mak died during the war
but he doesn't know yet.

1116
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:59,666
Right. Forget about him, Nak.

1117
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,041
You can find a new boyfriend now.

1118
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,208
Am I not right?

1119
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,708
What the hell is wrong with you all?

1120
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,458
-Where are you taking my wife?
-Pee Mak.

1121
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:13,833
Let's go.

1122
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,708
-Hurry. There he comes!
-Mak.

1123
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,916
-Shit.
-Come on.

1124
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,541
Pee Mak!

1125
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,500
Pee Mak.

1126
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,541
Pee Mak!

1127
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:28,333
Pee Mak!

1128
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,916
Pee Mak!

1129
01:17:32,541 --> 01:17:33,500
Pee Mak!

1130
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,958
-Where did he go?
-I don't know.

1131
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,875
Help. Help me.

1132
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,875
Pee Mak!

1133
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:41,833
Hey. Can ghosts drown?

1134
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:43,791
Don't let him fool you.

1135
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,083
Pee Mak!

1136
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,333
Help me! I have a muscle cramp.

1137
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:47,916
-Pee Mak!
-He has cramps.

1138
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,708
-Help me.
-Ghosts can have cramps?

1139
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,875
Please help him.

1140
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,125
He must have taken an acting lesson.

1141
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,791
-Help me!
-His acting coach must be Ang Lee, then.

1142
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:58,875
He's not dead. Help him!

1143
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,625
Give me your hand, Mak!

1144
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:01,791
-Come here.
-Mak.

1145
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,833
Pee Mak.

1146
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:05,250
-Calm down.
-Are you all right?

1147
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,458
What the hell?
Why did you run away from me?

1148
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:12,000
We thought you were a ghost.

1149
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,083
Why did you scream
when we threw the holy rice at you?

1150
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:17,791
You threw the rice right at my wound!

1151
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:19,958
If it were you, you would scream too.

1152
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,416
Shit! We got the same problem again.

1153
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,166
The boat is sinking
because of too much weight!

1154
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,833
Dang is still necessary, right?

1155
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:33,041
Sure, he is.

1156
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,458
Let's paddle to the shore.

1157
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,875
Come on. Faster.

1158
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,916
Come on.

1159
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:45,875
Paddle. The boat is taking on water.

1160
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,125
Hurry up!

1161
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,458
Wait.

1162
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,750
Wait for what?

1163
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:54,750
The boat is sinking.

1164
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,166
At first, I thought Nak was a ghost
and Mak was human.

1165
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,041
Then, it turns out Nak is human
and Mak is a ghost.

1166
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:02,375
And now Mak isn't a ghost after all.
He's just human.

1167
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,875
So who is a ghost and who is human?

1168
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,583
Ter, what the hell are you rambling about?

1169
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:12,541
Right.

1170
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:14,333
You lost me since your first sentence.

1171
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,083
Plus, their names are so damn similar,
Mak and Nak.

1172
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,291
That's right.

1173
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,666
If Nak is still alive,

1174
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:23,791
and Mak is still alive,

1175
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,208
then, whose body is it in the backyard?

1176
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,583
Aey.

1177
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,583
Why do you have that ring?

1178
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:07,541
Aey is a ghost!

1179
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:12,500
How come every time we realize something,
there are always flashes of lightning?

1180
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:14,250
Damn it, who cares?

1181
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:16,250
Ter, kick him overboard!

1182
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:20,583
Come on. Let's go!

1183
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:23,291
-The boat is taking on water.
-Let's go.

1184
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:26,625
-Hurry!
-Keep rowing.

1185
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:33,083
Aey, I am sorry.
It wasn't me who kicked you. It was Ter.

1186
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,625
Shake him off!

1187
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,458
Come on!

1188
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,208
Hurry!

1189
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,541
Paddle harder. We're not moving.

1190
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,833
-Faster!
-Faster!

1191
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:46,791
Damn it!

1192
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,166
Paddling with our hands
to escape is no use.

1193
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:50,916
Here you go.

1194
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,583
-Thanks.
-Give it to me. I will paddle.

1195
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,166
Give me the paddle. I will do it.

1196
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:59,208
Give it your best shot, Ter. Row.

1197
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,541
Why don't you keep rowing, Ter?

1198
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,458
Ter, why did you stop?

1199
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,666
-Ter, keep rowing.
-Hurry.

1200
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,500
Aey will catch up with us.

1201
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,666
What's with you, Ter?

1202
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:24,375
Don't stand up, man.
The boat will flip over.

1203
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:26,583
What the hell?

1204
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,541
Why are you standing, Ter?

1205
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:37,708
Mak, move.

1206
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,291
What's with you?

1207
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,000
Shin, move.

1208
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,416
-Me too?
-Yes. Move aside.

1209
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,166
-Which way?
-To your right.

1210
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,125
Fine.

1211
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:46,958
-Only Puak?
-Shin, you move to the left.

1212
01:21:47,041 --> 01:21:48,375
Left? My left or your left?

1213
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:49,375
Just pick one!

1214
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:50,708
-Which side?
-It doesn't matter.

1215
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:51,625
Whose left side?

1216
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:53,416
The left hand that you use
to wipe your ass!

1217
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,708
-Which way?
-My wound hurts.

1218
01:21:54,791 --> 01:21:56,250
Why did you move back, Mak?

1219
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,875
-Move!
-Move where?

1220
01:21:57,958 --> 01:21:59,250
-To the right.
-Okay.

1221
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:01,333
Shin, bend to the left. Left.

1222
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,583
-Which way?
-Whichever way you want.

1223
01:22:03,666 --> 01:22:05,208
-Which side?
-What is this?

1224
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,291
You idiots! Bend down!

1225
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:10,583
Bend your head down to your feet.
Hurry. Bend lower.

1226
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:12,416
I'm sore now.

1227
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,666
Damn it!

1228
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:17,958
The drums of war sound off
Like rolling thunder

1229
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:20,041
As we set out to protect our homeland

1230
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:22,958
Why are you singing now?

1231
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,708
I know.

1232
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:27,708
And why am I dancing along?

1233
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:31,250
Roused to the point of release
I raise my white flag in sweet surrender

1234
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:33,291
And polish my sword

1235
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,541
Nak is a ghost!

1236
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:38,583
Let's go!

1237
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:56,250
Mak, jump! Hurry!

1238
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:58,000
Mak!

1239
01:22:58,083 --> 01:22:59,250
Mak!

1240
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,250
Me too!

1241
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:08,708
Mak! Come on. Let's go.

1242
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:15,833
Let's go.

1243
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,375
Ter, hurry.

1244
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,833
Give me your hand, Ter. Come on!

1245
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,000
-Hurry, Mak.
-Come here.

1246
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,125
Mak!

1247
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,458
Shin, jump now!

1248
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:26,416
Hurry! Jump!

1249
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,541
Shin!

1250
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:30,083
Just jump, Shin!

1251
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,375
Jump!

1252
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:34,708
I told you, I can't swim.

1253
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:37,500
Just jump now!

1254
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,708
-Jump now, Shin!
-Hurry!

1255
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,541
-Help me.
-Come on.

1256
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:01,083
Didn't you say you can't swim?

1257
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,916
You swam like Michael Phelps.

1258
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,833
Nak!

1259
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:05,208
Mak, let's get out of here.

1260
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,333
I am not going!

1261
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,250
Are you crazy? I'm sorry, man.

1262
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,833
What the hell? That hurts!

1263
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:13,125
How come you didn't pass out?

1264
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,208
I see it always works in movies.

1265
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:16,583
What the hell is wrong with you?

1266
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:19,208
Puek!

1267
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,333
-Is he dead?
-I don't know.

1268
01:24:21,875 --> 01:24:24,583
Just drag him away. Run. Hurry!

1269
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,625
-Run!
-Hurry up!

1270
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,625
Let's go.

1271
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,541
What should we do now, father?

1272
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:59,458
Remember, no matter what happens,

1273
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:03,750
do not step outside the enchanted thread.

1274
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,791
We don't receive a lot of donation lately.

1275
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,500
We've been waiting for months
to get it fixed.

1276
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,291
Father!

1277
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,833
I almost shit my pants.

1278
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,250
I just did.

1279
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:52,375
Father, what's next?

1280
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:55,958
Don't worry. I will handle this.

1281
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:57,416
Nak!

1282
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,583
Mak, don't!

1283
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:02,000
Listen to me, baby.

1284
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,041
Don't listen to her.

1285
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,791
God, you're a ghost!

1286
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,625
Stop with the sweet talk already!

1287
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,458
Get rid of her, father!

1288
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:10,166
Ter.

1289
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:11,583
Hand me the holy water.

1290
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,916
Don't hurt my wife!

1291
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,083
Don't. Don't hurt my wife! Let me go!

1292
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:22,583
Nak!

1293
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:24,708
-Get her, father.
-Pee Mak.

1294
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:25,875
Please help me.

1295
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,250
-Mak, don't!
-Nak!

1296
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,375
Nak!

1297
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:32,708
Let me go!

1298
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,291
Damn it, Ter!

1299
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,750
-You spilled it all.
-It's okay.

1300
01:26:44,583 --> 01:26:46,125
Shin, hand me the holy rice.

1301
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:48,083
Let me go!

1302
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:49,458
Nak!

1303
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:50,958
Nak!

1304
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,333
-Shin.
-Nak.

1305
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:02,625
Guys, look. They're so tame.
They're eating out of my palm.

1306
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,750
How about you have a taste of my feet?

1307
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:06,750
This isn't the time
to go all animal-lover on us!

1308
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:07,708
That's okay.

1309
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:11,791
As long as we stay inside the holy thread,
we will be--

1310
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,000
Father!

1311
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,333
-What the hell?
-Whose hand is it?

1312
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:30,916
Shit! Tell me which way to go.

1313
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,416
Is that you, Shin?

1314
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,791
What is this?

1315
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,000
It's time for me to go.

1316
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,458
The monk already made it over the wall.

1317
01:27:58,375 --> 01:28:00,291
Turn the other way.
I'm getting the creeps.

1318
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,291
-Hurry.
-Nak!

1319
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,958
-Pee Mak.
-Nak.

1320
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,875
-Pee Mak.
-Nak.

1321
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,958
-Pee Mak.
-Nak.

1322
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,083
Pee Mak.

1323
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:12,041
Jeez! Enough already!

1324
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,291
This isn't some name-calling game.

1325
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:16,625
Let's go that way.

1326
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:23,125
-Aey!
-Aey!

1327
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:38,833
Please let us go, Aey.

1328
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,333
At least we used to be friends.

1329
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,916
I didn't do anything to you, you know.

1330
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:47,916
Ter! Why did you kick him off the boat?
I told you not to.

1331
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,333
I'm not a ghost.

1332
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,000
I don't believe you.
Don't come any closer.

1333
01:28:53,791 --> 01:28:55,250
Don't push me!

1334
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:56,208
Nak!

1335
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,375
What should we do now, Ter?

1336
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,583
Puek, you are still wet, right?

1337
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:03,041
Of course. Why?

1338
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:04,916
Shin. Mak.

1339
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,500
I will count to three,
then you push Puek towards Aey.

1340
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,250
-One.
-Can we talk about this first?

1341
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,208
-Two.
-Shit.

1342
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:13,250
-Three!
-I hate you all!

1343
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,166
-Everyone, jump on him.
-What's that for?

1344
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:26,250
See? You said you were human,

1345
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:28,125
but you screamed
once the holy water touched you.

1346
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:30,708
I screamed because you guys are on top
of me and it hurts!

1347
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:33,041
Disgusting!

1348
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:35,916
Come on! Get up!

1349
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Get up!

1350
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,083
Fuck!

1351
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,500
How come the holy water didn't hurt you
like it did Nak?

1352
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:43,291
I told you I am not a ghost.

1353
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,666
How come you got the ring?

1354
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,583
Well...

1355
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,125
I needed some money.

1356
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:53,750
I saw it with my own eyes.
The ruby ring is exactly like Nak's.

1357
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,541
Is it a big ruby?

1358
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:11,375
Where is he?

1359
01:30:12,791 --> 01:30:14,000
Where have you been, Aey?

1360
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:15,833
Well, I had diarrhea.

1361
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:17,791
I'm sorry.

1362
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:19,666
I needed the money to gamble.

1363
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:27,333
I was mistaken. I'm sorry, man.

1364
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,916
I thought you were a ghost for so long,

1365
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,625
when in truth

1366
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:33,833
you're just a casino junkie.

1367
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:36,791
You too.

1368
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,875
You watch too many movies
and always make assumptions.

1369
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:41,375
Are you guys forgetting something?

1370
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,333
What?

1371
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:49,833
That Nak is still standing here.

1372
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:01,666
Nak!

1373
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:04,833
Mak, let's go. Run!

1374
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:05,916
Let's go.

1375
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:10,625
The door can't be opened.

1376
01:31:10,708 --> 01:31:12,166
It's stuck.

1377
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:15,625
This one is stuck too.

1378
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:17,958
Jeez, Nak.

1379
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:19,458
Please just let us go.

1380
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:21,750
You are a ghost,
so stay in your own world.

1381
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,125
You cannot be with the living.

1382
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:25,750
It's unnatural. It's sacrilegious.

1383
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,291
It won't work out. It's not okay.

1384
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:29,666
Don't you understand?

1385
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,458
Don't mess with me!

1386
01:31:41,416 --> 01:31:42,583
What's happening?

1387
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:52,666
Nak disappeared.

1388
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:12,583
This one is stuck too.

1389
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:16,791
What are we going to do?

1390
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:26,291
If I make it out alive,

1391
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:29,666
I will donate a lot of money
to get this damn roof fixed.

1392
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,500
Puek.

1393
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,083
That isn't the roof leaking.

1394
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,125
Mak, run!

1395
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:56,625
Nak.

1396
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,958
Please don't hurt us. We're scared.

1397
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,458
I'm already scared as hell
when you come in your normal form.

1398
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:05,625
Now you're hanging upside down
like Spiderman.

1399
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:08,208
Why do you keep getting
between Pee Mak and I?

1400
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,666
What have I ever done to you?

1401
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,166
Because you are a mean ghost.

1402
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,416
Why did you kill Mrs. Priek?

1403
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,625
I didn't kill her.

1404
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:17,041
She was drunk, fell in the water,
and drowned by herself.

1405
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,083
I don't believe you!

1406
01:33:18,583 --> 01:33:20,833
You're beautiful,
but you're a big fat liar!

1407
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:22,750
I told you, I didn't kill her!

1408
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:29,625
Let's go.

1409
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,791
I just want to be with the person I love.

1410
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,416
Why do you guys have to get in the way?

1411
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,041
This isn't love.

1412
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,333
This is selfishness.

1413
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:42,416
Right. Mak can't go anywhere anymore.

1414
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,083
The townsfolk are all scared of him.

1415
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,458
I am scared too.

1416
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:47,708
Why don't you go
where you're supposed to go?

1417
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah. Mak's aunt died
and she didn't come back.

1418
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:52,625
Neither did Mrs. Priek.

1419
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:55,333
They have probably been reincarnated
and got new husbands by now.

1420
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,500
You're already dead.

1421
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:57,958
How can you be with Mak?

1422
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:12,083
If I can't be with Pee Mak in this world,

1423
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,291
then Pee Mak must go with me.

1424
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:26,416
What the hell are you standing
there for, Mak?

1425
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Mak!

1426
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:40,208
-Let's go.
-Mak!

1427
01:35:36,833 --> 01:35:38,625
Are you that scared of me?

1428
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,083
I am so sorry.

1429
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:54,750
If I ever hurt you,

1430
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,375
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

1431
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,791
Don't cry, baby.

1432
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,583
You won't look handsome.

1433
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,291
I am so sorry...

1434
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,000
for lying to you all this time.

1435
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:35,833
I just wanted to be with you
as long as I could,

1436
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,791
even if it's just for one more day.

1437
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:58,375
Do you still remember
what we talked about on the Ferris wheel?

1438
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:02,416
I am sorry...

1439
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:08,291
that you don't get to die before me.

1440
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:33,125
Please promise me.

1441
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:37,500
When I am gone,

1442
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:41,916
you will have to carry on.

1443
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:56,416
Nak.

1444
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:00,208
You don't have to go anywhere.

1445
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,041
You said you lied to me.

1446
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,958
You didn't lie to me at all.

1447
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,958
Even though I am a fool,

1448
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:16,875
I'm not stupid enough
to not know that my wife is dead.

1449
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,041
I will go see your friends off.

1450
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:07,833
Nak!

1451
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:17,250
Nak!

1452
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,375
Nak!

1453
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:24,458
What did you do?

1454
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:27,250
Look at you. You're all dirty.

1455
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:30,541
So what else have you cooked for me?

1456
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:45,875
Your cooking is as good as always.

1457
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,416
Nak, my love, is so pretty.

1458
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,541
How can you be a ghost,

1459
01:39:53,333 --> 01:39:54,208
right?

1460
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:06,833
I knew it
since when we were playing charades.

1461
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:13,583
Even if all the townsfolk avoid me

1462
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:16,250
and nobody wants to be my friend,

1463
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,916
and even if I have to eat
dried leaves everyday,

1464
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,958
I would still want to be with you.

1465
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:36,916
Thank you.

1466
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:41,500
But it is impossible.

1467
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:42,875
Why not?

1468
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:47,041
We can just pretend
that nothing has changed.

1469
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,708
All this time, we did fine together,
didn't we?

1470
01:40:50,791 --> 01:40:52,458
But I'm dead.

1471
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:57,833
The living and the dead...

1472
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:01,125
can't stay together.

1473
01:41:01,208 --> 01:41:02,583
It's unnatural.

1474
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,125
If that's so,

1475
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:09,250
then love is also an unnatural thing.

1476
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:12,708
When I was at war...

1477
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,083
Mak, do you have any last words?

1478
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:17,250
I should have died that day.

1479
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:19,541
No one thought I would make it.

1480
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,083
But I found my way back to you.

1481
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,125
Help.

1482
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:51,125
Help.

1483
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:52,750
Help.

1484
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:57,166
Help.

1485
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:59,208
Help.

1486
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,750
Pee Mak.

1487
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:22,625
Even though you're already dead,

1488
01:42:25,375 --> 01:42:27,416
you are still able to come back for me.

1489
01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:36,666
You also used your powers
to help me hit those cans

1490
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,666
and won a doll for Dang.

1491
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:44,583
Is it wrong

1492
01:42:45,458 --> 01:42:47,125
that we love each other this much?

1493
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,333
Aren't you scared of me?

1494
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:59,333
You know I am terrified of ghosts.

1495
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:04,333
But I am more terrified
of living without you.

1496
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:16,125
Just one thing though.

1497
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,041
Don't ever hang upside down...

1498
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,250
like that again.

1499
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:23,458
I almost had a heart attack.

1500
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:36,458
Damn.

1501
01:43:37,458 --> 01:43:38,375
I am really moved.

1502
01:43:43,958 --> 01:43:45,416
I promise you.

1503
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:48,958
No matter what happens,

1504
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:52,541
we will be friends forever.

1505
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:53,541
That's right.

1506
01:43:54,416 --> 01:43:56,125
If you all die and become ghosts,

1507
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,916
I won't be afraid.

1508
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:01,625
But I remember you kicked me off the boat.

1509
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,583
Come on.

1510
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,833
Love you.

1511
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:36,541
Nak.

1512
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:38,583
Do you love me?

1513
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,041
I do.

1514
01:44:42,083 --> 01:44:43,250
How much?

1515
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:46,291
I love Pee Mak lots and lots.

1516
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:49,333
I love you

1517
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,791
heaps and heaps too.

1518
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:18,583
Nak.

1519
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:21,833
Nak.

1520
01:45:28,583 --> 01:45:33,250
Let's look at each other more

1521
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:37,916
I want to stop the time

1522
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Before we say goodbye forever

1523
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:54,125
Baby, I love you.

1524
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:58,000
Give me your hand to hold

1525
01:45:58,083 --> 01:46:01,458
And to keep my heart warm

1526
01:46:02,791 --> 01:46:05,625
Let me look in your eyes

1527
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:09,791
So I will never be lonely

1528
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:14,291
Let me have your love to inspire me
To make my dreams come true

1529
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:16,166
The roof isn't leaking anymore, father.

1530
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,416
Let us know
if there is anything else we can do.

1531
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:20,750
Keep up the good work, baby!

1532
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,250
Watch your hand.

1533
01:46:23,250 --> 01:46:24,166
What?

1534
01:46:24,625 --> 01:46:25,500
Horn?

1535
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:26,416
Hair?

1536
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,333
You? She?

1537
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:30,083
-Does she mean head?
-Oh, really?

1538
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,291
-There is head in the phrase.
-Watermelon head?

1539
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:34,125
-Exploding head?
-Potato head?

1540
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:35,208
What kind of head?

1541
01:46:36,458 --> 01:46:37,500
Airhead?

1542
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:38,416
Headless?

1543
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,666
Headless. Pee Mak is correct!

1544
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,000
This is the first time I got it right!

1545
01:46:44,083 --> 01:46:45,041
Shin!

1546
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:46,041
Hey!

1547
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:47,916
Hey, aren't you happy for me?

1548
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,166
HAUNTED HOUSE
SCARIER THAN EVER

1549
01:46:57,708 --> 01:47:00,958
Come play with me.

1550
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:13,666
Wow, that was so realistic.

1551
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:14,708
I know.

1552
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:17,250
Thank you.

1553
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,916
Come on. Hurry up.

1554
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:27,625
Watch this. I'll show you.

1555
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:32,000
You'll never hit the target.
You throw like a blind man.

1556
01:47:32,083 --> 01:47:34,750
This time don't help me, okay?

1557
01:47:47,125 --> 01:47:47,958
Everybody.

1558
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:49,000
WE DON'T WANT NAK THE GHOST

1559
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:51,166
Mak has really gone too far.

1560
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,291
-Yes!
-Yes!

1561
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:55,916
We can't let this unnatural behavior
go on in our village.

1562
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,708
-That's right!
-We can't allow it!

1563
01:47:57,875 --> 01:47:59,000
-No way!
-No way!

1564
01:47:59,083 --> 01:48:01,458
Tonight, we will get rid of it.

1565
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:03,458
Does anyone want to come with me?

1566
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:04,541
-Yes!
-Yes!

1567
01:48:04,916 --> 01:48:06,958
I want to go too.

1568
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:09,916
GET OUT
GHOST SHOULDN'T LIVE WITH HUMANS

1569
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:15,458
Shit.

1570
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:19,250
Better hurry before you miss out.

1571
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,458
Go on. Hurry up.
