ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,385
I'm really okay.

3
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:14,386
Cha Hyun-su.

4
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:16,514
I need to speak with you.

5
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:19,558
What?

6
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,104
Why are you only taking him?

7
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,106
What about me?

8
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:31,737
You're just being used.

9
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:42,915
Hey!

10
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,084
Hey!

11
00:01:46,418 --> 00:01:47,753
Let me out, too!

12
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,260
It's vital the front gate be
properly barricaded, but it hasn't been.

13
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,513
And we only have wooden planks and chains
blocking the stairs.

14
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,182
Monsters could get through at any moment.

15
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,896
The same goes for where you were just now.

16
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,568
Why do you think I took your side?

17
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,571
I'll be straightforward.

18
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:15,990
You'll be taking on all the dangerous work
from now on.

19
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:18,033
If you don't want to,
then I can't help you.

20
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:20,703
What do you mean?

21
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,289
The guy in Room 1408.

22
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:25,875
Can you bring him here?

23
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,842
It was spring.

24
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:19,762
The flowers were so pretty.

25
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,099
All I wanted was to show my daughter
the pretty flowers.

26
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,519
Truly,

27
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,230
it was just for one second, but…

28
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,778
You must miss her a lot.

29
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:40,366
The day she first called me "mom,"

30
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,577
the day she first turned over by herself…

31
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,329
I was so touched

32
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,749
by such small things…

33
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:54,129
Seeing those chubby cheeks…

34
00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,343
made me feel like I had everything.

35
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:03,847
You have children?

36
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:07,768
I used to.

37
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,899
Before this happened to my leg.

38
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:22,157
I want…

39
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:26,704
the same thing as Hyun-su.

40
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,584
If I turn, please…

41
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:35,170
kill me.

42
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,081
I can't do as you asked.

43
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:16,378
I don't think

44
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:21,216
I can take care of them without you.

45
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,055
Is that so?

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,294
Is she not in there?

47
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:02,883
No.

48
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,178
She's gone.

49
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,397
We should let her go now.

50
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:41,672
KIM YEONG-SU, KIM SU-YEONG

51
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,137
Wait.

52
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,141
I heard you're a gangster.

53
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,560
Don't gangsters do anything for money?

54
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:56,395
I'll give you everything I have.

55
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,148
Just help me go outside.

56
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:03,360
I…

57
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,750
Move.

58
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:23,547
I… No, you can't…

59
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,965
Open the door.

60
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:30,220
Is this okay?

61
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:32,306
I don't think we can stop him.

62
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,060
You're not supposed to…

63
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:57,956
Wait.

64
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,270
Is this it?

65
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:22,856
Do you want me to starve?

66
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:25,484
You're glad I'm locked up in here,
aren't you?

67
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:27,736
I bet you're really enjoying this.

68
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:37,246
If I turn into a monster,
I'll eat you up first.

69
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,998
So do something, you stupid cow!

70
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:42,417
We have to save food!

71
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,335
Says who?

72
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:45,837
All that food is mine.

73
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,843
They said we're all going to share it.

74
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:56,014
Don't be ridiculous! You bitch!

75
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,398
You should hold it in.

76
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,234
I do it, too.

77
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,631
Rescuing Han Du-sik is the main goal.

78
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,259
The kids are secondary.

79
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,928
Focus on the main goal.

80
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,972
If things go south,

81
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,142
leave the kids.

82
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,320
Are you playing with people's lives?

83
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:56,241
Then who should I have sent?

84
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,660
It was the best option.

85
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,705
We need that man in Room 1408.

86
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:04,833
And I've decided not to hesitate
any longer.

87
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,794
Let go of me.

88
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:12,341
I'm sure there's another way
besides using other people.

89
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,767
What I'm using is the golden hour.

90
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:30,275
Cha Hyun-su was critically injured,
but he woke up in just a few hours.

91
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:35,155
If willpower can affect the turning stage,

92
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,536
and he can fight it,

93
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,378
then he will be the strongest weapon
we have.

94
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,963
This is what we call a weapon.

95
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:53,340
He's still human.

96
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:55,884
I agree.

97
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,637
For now.

98
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,640
And you sent him to die?

99
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,393
It would be best if you
become accustomed to using

100
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,353
people on the verge of turning
into monsters.

101
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:08,563
You really are twisted.

102
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:13,694
I don't think you understand

103
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,529
how dangerous our situation is.

104
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,073
What did you think

105
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,534
about the voting results?

106
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,416
They're marked with Xs.

107
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,544
I was thinking of secretly switching them.

108
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:34,756
-But I didn't need to.
-So you didn't switch the votes?

109
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,508
It was unexpected.

110
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:41,054
I didn't think people would vote
to let Hyun-su stay.

111
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:44,099
That's because you made them feel guilty,
talking about murder.

112
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,357
Do you really think they voted not to
kick him out because of their conscience?

113
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,110
Well, the man with the sword
and the girl with the bat

114
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,237
may have felt close to him
because they were together.

115
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,822
But the others?

116
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,409
It's not easy to accept someone
you don't know,

117
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:05,704
especially when your life is at risk.

118
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:10,208
So what's your point?

119
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:11,418
You still don't get it?

120
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,879
Cha Hyun-su and Kim Seok-hyeon.

121
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:17,174
Do you think
they're the only ones turning?

122
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,470
No. Everyone's scared.

123
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:24,556
Because they don't know when they'll turn.

124
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:29,811
There was someone who knew about this
before the government announcement.

125
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:32,147
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

126
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,941
It was a blog I found by accident
on the internet.

127
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,443
What did it say?

128
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:38,570
-Despair.
-What?

129
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:40,822
It said it's a curse.

130
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,533
And that humans will never overcome it.

131
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:46,411
You believe a stupid blog post
when you don't even know who wrote it?

132
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:52,751
Under the circumstances, we shouldn't
ignore even the smallest clues.

133
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,461
CRUCRU
THIS ISN'T A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

134
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:57,297
CRUCRU

135
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,632
What's "Crucru"?

136
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,760
-Is it your blog?
-Hey, Yi-kyung.

137
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:02,969
Well…

138
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:04,971
When is it?

139
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,098
Our wedding photoshoot?

140
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,016
What?

141
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,101
Did you write you don't want
to get married?

142
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:13,438
No, it's nothing like that.

143
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:24,533
-Where are you going?
-There will be more infected people soon.

144
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:26,827
-So?
-So it's not going to be safe here either.

145
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,370
It's still safer than the outside.

146
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:30,580
-Do you want to come?
-To where?

147
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:32,874
A way to survival.

148
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,336
Ji-su.

149
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:48,515
I think

150
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,059
there's a monster here.

151
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,811
Let's kill it.

152
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:54,354
We can kill it.

153
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:01,820
You're scared, aren't you?

154
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:22,549
Sir!

155
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:27,470
Don't come!

156
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:28,597
Don't come near!

157
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,558
Don't come, Sang-wook!

158
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,173
Move.

159
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:08,219
Are you trying to burn
the whole building down, sir?

160
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:12,307
We can put out the fire later.
You're so harsh.

161
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,142
It will take ages to get
to the first floor.

162
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:18,396
My goodness. I'm not sure anyone
will still be alive by then.

163
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,361
Be careful.

164
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,366
Who's there?

165
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,426
He's alive.

166
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:52,305
The monster left him alive?

167
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:05,527
What are you doing?

168
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,709
I couldn't reach my son's hand.

169
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,628
I couldn't do anything

170
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,338
when the monster took my son.

171
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,049
It was too fast.

172
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,387
If I had caught my son's hand…

173
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,515
If I'd been able to reach that far,

174
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,103
would my son be still alive?

175
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,688
I can't forgive myself.

176
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,023
I'm having nightmares every day.

177
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:45,525
The monster in my head is telling me
that it's all my fault.

178
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:49,195
Maybe it will be better
to just become a monster.

179
00:16:51,948 --> 00:16:54,492
No! It's my fault. I should've
held onto him!

180
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,870
I should've kept my son next to me!

181
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:59,956
No! There was nothing I could do.

182
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,168
It's not my fault.

183
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:09,716
GREEN HOME BARBER SHOP

184
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,052
Shouldn't we do something about her?

185
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:13,803
Just leave her be.

186
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,722
She never associated
with people like us anyway.

187
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,892
She even sent her daughter
to a school in Gangnam.

188
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,646
She should've sent her
to a school close by.

189
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,829
-Are you awake now?
-I don't need any of that.

190
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:44,084
Yes, you do.

191
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,211
Your bleeding has stopped,
but you're still injured.

192
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,221
Is it okay to let him go like that?

193
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,264
There's no need to worry about him.

194
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:00,016
I bet he could take on a tiger by himself.

195
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:05,146
You look pretty hurt, too.

196
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:08,149
No, I'm fine.

197
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,652
Move that hand.
It'll get infected if you don't treat it.

198
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:13,154
I'll do it myself. Give me a bandage.

199
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:16,449
Move that hand, kid.

200
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:20,120
You're turning, aren't you?

201
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,457
Yu-ri, get away from him.

202
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:27,627
Put that hand away!

203
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,881
Or else I'll make sure your heart
never beats again.

204
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:45,061
Get out.

205
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,313
I wouldn't have helped you
if I knew you were a monster.

206
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:48,982
Get out!

207
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,543
You have such a bad hobby.

208
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,926
I was just kidding.

209
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,511
You don't have to leave.

210
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:23,099
Why would I be scared of that
when I'm going to die soon, anyway?

211
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,476
-Pardon?
-Yu-ri.

212
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,811
You stay here.

213
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:30,857
You're going to the 14th floor, right?
And you said there are little kids there.

214
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:33,067
Yes, that's right.

215
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:36,613
Don't you need someone
who's not afraid of death?

216
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,115
-Sir!
-You're fired.

217
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:42,285
You've done well nursing an old man

218
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,745
with a bad temper.

219
00:19:44,996 --> 00:19:47,957
I want to play superhero before I die.

220
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,710
Can you let me join you?

221
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,338
You're just acting tough.

222
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:54,464
What?

223
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:56,633
Don't fool yourself.

224
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:58,343
No one really wants to die.

225
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:05,683
Is becoming rude one of the symptoms
of turning into a monster?

226
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,436
Let me give you some advice, kid.

227
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:11,564
Not being afraid of death

228
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:13,775
and wanting to die are different things.

229
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:18,613
I'm planning on living longer than anyone.

230
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,258
What are you doing?

231
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,513
What are you hiding back there?

232
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:51,854
Hey. Are you crazy?

233
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,442
You really…

234
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,487
don't care about me.

235
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,490
What?

236
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:07,620
If I become a monster,

237
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,457
I'm sure I'll kill you.

238
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,959
You stupid bitch!

239
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,752
But…

240
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:22,010
I don't want to kill you
when I'm a monster.

241
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,806
That won't make me happy at all.

242
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:31,894
Jeez. You're talking nonsense.

243
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:33,187
My gosh.

244
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:44,657
Ma'am.

245
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,871
Is that man outside the door?

246
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:53,374
No, he went upstairs.

247
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:55,960
So don't worry.

248
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:08,431
He went upstairs?

249
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,192
Shit!

250
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,240
Son of a bitch…

251
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:31,287
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

252
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,903
Son of a bitch…

253
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:57,308
Have you been well?

254
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,564
What about the lady?

255
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:06,108
SURVIVORS, TURNING, DEAD

256
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,319
TURNING: CHA HYUN-SU,
KIM SEOK-HYEON, CHOI YUN-JAE

257
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,711
SURVIVORS: LEE EUN-HYEOK,
LEE EUN-YU, YOON JI-SU

258
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,260
Is anyone hearing this?

259
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:38,432
We're in despair right now.

260
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:41,602
We don't know

261
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,272
what to do, what's happening,

262
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:48,025
or how long we can survive this.

263
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,532
But we are still alive.

264
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,076
PREGNANT

265
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,995
We can't overcome this despair.

266
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,372
But…

267
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:05,126
I'm sure there is an end.

268
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,673
And we will hold out and fight

269
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,717
until that end.

270
00:26:13,676 --> 00:26:15,011
Rest in peace.

271
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:18,681
I'm going to fight a little longer.

272
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:21,183
We

273
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,436
will survive.

274
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:44,332
Hey!

275
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:49,503
Over here! I don't think I'm turning!

276
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:52,715
Come and look at this!

277
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,176
Please help me!

278
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:57,261
Look!

279
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:02,516
Help me!

280
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,022
My goodness. You must've been scared.

281
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,440
Take care of him.

282
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,400
Why were you in there?

283
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:13,736
-Just in case.
-I would've lost my mind.

284
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,279
-I'm out now, so it's fine.
-Right…

285
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:17,615
Are you really cool
or just pretending to be?

286
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:20,284
Hey, Yun-jae is kind and patient.

287
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,370
-Are you a fan of Hanwha Eagles?
-Yes.

288
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:23,371
How did you know?

289
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,122
I can tell he's from Chungcheong Province.

290
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:27,249
But you're not using
any Chungcheong dialect.

291
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,918
I lived in Seoul for a long time.

292
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,506
What is he so nervous about?

293
00:27:34,298 --> 00:27:37,343
-I guess it was really tough for him.
-Maybe.

294
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:40,054
Amazing. You guys are such hypocrites.

295
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,516
You pretended not to notice
when he was obviously

296
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,226
beaten up by someone,

297
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:46,811
but now you're acting all nice.

298
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:53,734
She hit way too close to home.

299
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:55,486
I feel like shit now. Damn it.

300
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:20,553
Hey.

301
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:24,098
That stupid gangster!

302
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,100
He's going to hear you.

303
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:58,591
He's a murderer.

304
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,427
That man's a murderer!

305
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,149
You fucking murderer.

306
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:17,985
He has no criminal record

307
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:19,695
and has no motive.

308
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,822
There isn't any evidence
to prove it was intentional.

309
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,742
And as his future shows great promise,

310
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:27,286
the court has decided
on the following sentence.

311
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:33,250
The accused, Hwang Seung-jae,

312
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:36,462
is sentenced to 11 months in prison
and 2 years of supervised probation.

313
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:41,258
You shouldn't die like that.

314
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:45,054
You shouldn't die peacefully.

315
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,683
No…

316
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,812
You don't deserve a humane death.

317
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:02,404
You…

318
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:08,244
You fucking murderer…

319
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:09,787
You don't deserve to live.

320
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:08,692
Why…

321
00:35:33,402 --> 00:35:34,778
I LOVE YOU
DAD, MOM, KAPO

322
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:37,698
Su-yeong, why aren't they
bringing back our dad?

323
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:41,368
They can't

324
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,037
bring Dad here.

325
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:47,499
They said it will be too sad
for us if they bring him here.

326
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,587
That doesn't make sense!

327
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:30,185
PARK MIN-JU

328
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,568
Grandpa…

329
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:02,843
LEE SU-UNG

330
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:05,220
We were born human,

331
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:07,723
so we should die as humans.

332
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:29,619
Are you okay?

333
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:33,665
I should be strong

334
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,876
since I'm a mother.

335
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,224
What are you going to do now?

336
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:54,269
What do you mean?

337
00:38:54,353 --> 00:38:56,146
It's not something
you can deal with alone.

338
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:57,647
It's not something to brag about.

339
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:02,569
I'll deal with this on my own.

340
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:06,656
Yi-kyung…

341
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,748
I still want to congratulate you.

342
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,002
Dinosaurs used to rule the earth,

343
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:22,089
but they went extinct
about 66 million years ago.

344
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:27,260
But this also proves that there is
a possibility humans

345
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:29,638
could also go extinct at any moment.

346
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:41,900
However, our ancestors
changed in order to survive,

347
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:46,321
and called it "evolution."

348
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:56,540
But if we humans are forced
to face an apocalypse,

349
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:58,166
will we…

350
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:02,587
choose another form of evolution?

351
00:40:06,383 --> 00:40:07,926
Or will we choose to remain human?

352
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:02,856
