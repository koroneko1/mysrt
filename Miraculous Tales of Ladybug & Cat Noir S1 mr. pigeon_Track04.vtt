&lrm;You have one day to work
&lrm;on a fashion piece of your own design.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.420
&lrm;In ten hours, your presentation

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.180
&lrm;will be judged
&lrm;by the great fashion designer

&lrm;Gabriel Agreste,
&lrm;the father of our student Adrien.

&lrm;Adrien will model the winning design.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.460
&lrm;And now, this year's theme: derby hats.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.340
&lrm;Derby hats?

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.340

&lrm;I don't have any derby hat design.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.140
&lrm;I've got top hats, caps, two-horned hats.

&lrm;A beret? I'm your girl.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.700
&lrm;A sombrero? No problemo. But a derby?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.580
&lrm;It won't even matter,
&lrm;I'll probably make a fool of myself,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.020
&lrm;give him a concussion
&lrm;and Adrien will hate me.

&lrm;I'll never be a great fashion designer.

&lrm;There must be something in here.

&lrm;Forget it, I'll probably mess
&lrm;everything up in the end.

&lrm;[Adrien] Wow, Alya! Awesome designs.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.540
&lrm;I didn't know you had such skills.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.260
&lrm;Thanks, but I can't take the credit.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740
&lrm;These sick designs belong to Marinette.

&lrm;You're super talented.
&lrm;You have a good chance of winning.

&lrm;I mean... thanks?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.300
&lrm;Sure. Good luck, maybe I'll be wearing

&lrm;Did you hear how impressed Adrien was?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.780
&lrm;Of course I heard.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.540
&lrm;Her? Win the contest? As if.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.100
&lrm;Adrien will convince his father
&lrm;to award me the winner.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.700
&lrm;I'm sure he will, Chloe.
&lrm;You're a born champion.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.700
&lrm;Yours is sure to be the best.

&lrm;Yeah, it is.

&lrm;Scram, winged rats.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.860
&lrm;How many times do you need
&lrm;to be told Mr. Ramier?

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.140
&lrm;No... feeding... the pigeons!

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.220
&lrm;It's forbidden.

&lrm;They'll leave their waste everywhere!

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.500
&lrm;Who's going to feed my poor pigeons?

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.060
&lrm;Mr. Ramier, you're banned
&lrm;from every park in Paris.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.420
&lrm;Leave or I'll call the authorities.

&lrm;[Tikki] What a unique character.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.300
&lrm;He was like a human bird.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.660
&lrm;All he needed was a feather jacket
&lrm;to complete the look.

&lrm;A feather jacket?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.700

&lrm;Neither this police officer

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.700
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Excellent.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.820
&lrm;Take their Miraculouses.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.820
&lrm;Your Miraculouses. Give them to me

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.380
&lrm;or face the wrath of my feathered friends.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.700

&lrm;[banging]

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.060
&lrm;On the count of three,
&lrm;my pigeons will open fire.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.140
&lrm;You can save your sorry skins

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.820
&lrm;by handing me your Miraculous. One, two...

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.540
&lrm;Cat Noir, the bars.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.060
&lrm;Cataclysm!

&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Well, well, the pigeon is a chicken.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.100
&lrm;Me? I'm not flying away.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.740
&lrm;I'm just killing two birds with one stone.

&lrm;Merry Christmas!

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.460
&lrm;I'm not done with you yet.

&lrm;[beeping]

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.220
&lrm;I've got to go
&lrm;before my identity is revealed.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.140
&lrm;You wouldn't want
&lrm;to let the cat out the bag.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.900
&lrm;Ha, ha, very funny.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.020
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.580
&lrm;I'm in great danger of losing money
&lrm;if my guests leave Paris.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.620
&lrm;Get rid of those pigeons.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.180
&lrm;Before we do, I have an urgent need.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.980
&lrm;An urgent need? I see.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.660
&lrm;Head to the Royal Suite.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.780
&lrm;There's paper in there.
&lrm;Perhaps you'd prefer a litter tray?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.500
&lrm;No need for litter.
&lrm;But could I have some camembert?

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.180
&lrm;Sorry, emergency.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.380
&lrm;[knocking]

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.620
&lrm;-How do you like your camembert?
&lrm;-Runny.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.820
&lrm;[knocking]

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.660
&lrm;-Unpasteurized Saint-Claquos.
&lrm;-Thanks.

&lrm;[Plagg screams]

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.460
&lrm;The exhaustion. My poor aching body.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.980
&lrm;I can't move a muscle.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.500
&lrm;[Adrien] You wanna bet?

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.220
&lrm;[gasping]

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.860
&lrm;My gooeyness...

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.980
&lrm;Eat up, Ladybug needs help.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.300
&lrm;I can get a much better view from up here.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.140
&lrm;They're flying in the same direction.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.060
&lrm;Better follow them.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.660
&lrm;[Elevator beeps]

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.500
&lrm;-Ready when you are.
&lrm;-Let's go.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.940
&lrm;That's where Mr. Pigeon keeps
&lrm;the park keepers.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.140
&lrm;The Grand Palais.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.700
&lrm;[he begins to sneeze]

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.380
&lrm;My pigeon radar is on alert.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.380
&lrm;Either your radar's on the brink
&lrm;or the park keepers are unattended.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.700
&lrm;Let's set the cat among the pigeons.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.380
&lrm;Hold up, kitty. It's too easy.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.020
&lrm;I've got a plan.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.300
&lrm;[Mr. Pigeon] Perfect timing.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.180
&lrm;We're ready to greet them.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.900
&lrm;They're going to fall right into my trap.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.500
&lrm;It won't be long
&lrm;before you get your Miraculouses.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.380
&lrm;I can't wait, my dear Pigeon.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.460
&lrm;[Ladybug] If we destroy that bird call,
&lrm;we'll capture the Akuma.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.420
&lrm;You open the window,
&lrm;I grab him and you snag the bird call.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.180
&lrm;Early bird gets the worm.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.220

&lrm;Diddle-dee-dee, come closer.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.540
&lrm;I have a bone to "peck" with you.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.940
&lrm;I'd be honored.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.940
&lrm;[yelling]

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.260

&lrm;[evil giggle]

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.980
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.060
&lrm;A coin? What am I supposed
&lrm;to do with that?

&lrm;[tinkling]

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.660
&lrm;You can't buy yourself out of here.

&lrm;Cat Noir!

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.260
&lrm;[Ladybug] Snack time, pigeons.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.100
&lrm;[yelling]

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.980
&lrm;My bird call. No!

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.700
&lrm;Cat Noir, grab it.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.500

&lrm;-Yes.
&lrm;-Ouch.

&lrm;[desperate cooing]

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.340
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.940
&lrm;Time to de-evilize.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.300
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.580
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

&lrm;Pound it.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.940
&lrm;Wretched pigeons, wretched Ladybug!

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.740

&lrm;Hello, Mr. Damocles,
&lrm;I am Mr. Agreste's assistant.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.700

<i>&lrm;Adrien, take Nathalie around.</i>

&lrm;They have poured their hearts
&lrm;and souls into their projects.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.620
&lrm;Where have you been? You got your hat?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.380
&lrm;Yep, here.

&lrm;[she gasps]

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.300
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-But it's the same as Chloe's.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.380
&lrm;What?

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.300
&lrm;Hi, Mr. Agreste, I'm Chloe Bourgeois.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.300
&lrm;You know my father, the Mayor.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.980
&lrm;That thieving little brat!

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.660
&lrm;-Shall I take care of it?
&lrm;-I think I can handle this.

&lrm;No fair!

&lrm;I apologize for the situation.

&lrm;But I can prove
