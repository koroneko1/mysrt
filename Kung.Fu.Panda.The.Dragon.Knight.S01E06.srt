00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,535
[Po gasps]

357
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,166
Oh my gosh! Is that the whip?

358
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,420
[stirring music plays]

359
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,505
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

360
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,007
This place is built to protect this whip.

361
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,550
No way it's just sitting here.

362
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:04,096
As soon as we grab it, there's gonna be
flying arrows, the floor'll drop out…

363
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,224
This whole place will crumble!
We're just gonna have to run for it.

364
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,558
How do you know that?

365
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,395
You know,
standard treasure-grabbing protocol.

366
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,063
Alright.

367
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,442
I'm ready.

368
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,155
[suspenseful music plays]

369
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,074
[whimpers]

370
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,411
[grunting]

371
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,121
[crunching, chewing]

373
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,794
[swallows]

374
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
Nervous eater.

375
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,923
[suspenseful music resumes]

376
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,488
[Po] Huh.

377
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,867
I guess this treasure
doesn't know the protocol. [chuckles]

378
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,201
No traps.

379
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
[cackling]

380
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,083
[female voice] There are no traps!

381
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:20,839
But there is something far worse
for those who wish to wield the whip.

382
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,009
Me!

383
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,595
[laughs]

384
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,066
[laughs]
