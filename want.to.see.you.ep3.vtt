00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.890
[Episode 3]

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.100
You can sit and join us.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.640
It's dangerous! Too dangerous!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.780
I was scolded for not closing the gate!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.160
Why are you laughing?

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.020
Uh... Nothing, brother.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.340
I'm blind, not deaf.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.140
Phuc told me that...

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.900
He told you what?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.660
He told me that

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.860
you are quite a picky eater

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.460
so you need to be spoon-fed to eat more.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.120
Me?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.640
Who else could it be?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.380
Do it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.520
Yes?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.640
You want to spoon-feed me, right?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.580
Hurry.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.820
The food won't be good when it gets cold.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.240
Do it carefully.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.080
Open your mouth so I can do it.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.720
I'm starting to doubt your educational level.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.340
Say "A".

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.120
"A" what?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.700
Say "A", please!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.640
A...

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.820
"A" what?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.260
Just say it!

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.700
Can I say "B"?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.500
If you say "B", I'll make you a smoothie to drink.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.520
Hurry! "A".

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.180
If you don't talk back, won't you be happy?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.160
No!

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.820
Ah...

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340
Are you trying to fool me?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.420
Now, say "mom".

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.800
"Mom..."

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.500
"Mom" what?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.900
I just call it "Mum".

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.080
Just say it. "Mom!"

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.740
Hurry!

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.860
Mom...

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.480
Can't you do it properly?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.400
Did you bite your tongue?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.520
You deserve it!

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.000
I should tie your tongue.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.960
I dare you!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.500
Why do you think I won't do it?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.020
You're talking too much!

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.860
Am I your son?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.320
If you were my son, I'd kill you already!

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.840
You dare?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.420
I don't. That's why you're still alive.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.200
You're so good. It's almost finished.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.040
Let's clean your mouth.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.500
I remember hiring a helper,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.520
not a kindergarten teacher.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.080
You're talking too much!

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.800
You took so long with that bowl.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.760
One night, when the moon casts light on the whole world,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.700
ten daughters of the village chief...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.000
Your voice is boring.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I would prefer listening to the radio.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.240
I won't continue, then!

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.580
Jerk!

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.040
Huh? Where's Duy?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.520
He's been at the restaurant since this afternoon.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.180
You're home, but you don't know that?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.780
What do you want to do tomorrow?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.220
What do you mean by that?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.300
I mean hanging out!

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.120
We'll go outside to hang out!

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.940
My conditions are like this. How can I go?

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.340
If you don't walk more, how can your legs recover?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.440
Whatever you do, you can't change it.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.460
You're young but so pessimistic!

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.820
I will never be able to walk again.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.640
Just like my eyes, I will never see anything again.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.340
The light comes from here.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.380
As long as it still beats,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.900
your life still goes on.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.700
Why don't you close the door when you sleep?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.460
What if I enter your room,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.040
and I see you naked?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.980
In Korea or Japan, they have public bathrooms.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.440
It's normal for men to see each other's bodies.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.500
You answer my question first.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.680
Why don't you close the door while you sleep?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.660
I'm afraid.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.620
I want to hear human sounds.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.420
Since my accident, I've always been alone.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.600
Being alone is very scary.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.540
So I want to hear human sounds, even just the sound of a breath.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.460
It helps me not feel lonely.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.580
Do you know that, every time I open my eyes, all I see is darkness.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.240
How scary could it be to me?

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.940
You wouldn't understand it.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.180
I do. I understand.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.960
Thach.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.520
Do you know why our eyes are at the front?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.880
Because God wants us to move forward.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.040
The future is what matters.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.220
What's over, just forget it.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.340
It's good that we're still alive.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.100
It's really good to be alive.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.940
What are you two doing?

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.960
A helper thinks he can have a chance with his boss!

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.780
An ugly toad thinks it can be with a swan!

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.520
Linh!

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.920
He only wants to use you!

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.620
I don't know whether he does that or not,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.440
but I know you do.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.940
You're pretty, but your words are nonsense!

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.060
Whose words are nonsense?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.420
Do you want to get slapped?

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.940
Can you stop it?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.280
Whatever you do, I won't sign the deed of gift for my restaurant!

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.060
If you don't let me take management, who will do it?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.700
My brother is back.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.300
Why do I have to give it to an outsider like you?

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.540
I can't understand.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.600
I've been by your side for so long, but you still think of me as an outsider?

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.560
I should have beaten him to death.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.160
What have you done to my brother?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.180
She hit me with a stick.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.280
Duy?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.160
Are you okay?

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080
I'm still alive.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.120
Your force of the hit was really strong!

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.060
Yes! I am out of my mind!

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.540
How can I do nothing and let my child be born without a father?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.420
What did you say?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.440
I'm pregnant.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.840
Pregnant? When?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.600
I've just known it recently.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.620
That's why I insisted you sign the paper.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.360
You know I don't have a family, a house.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.740
How can I raise my child when I give birth to it?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.060
Are you telling the truth?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.840
I swear!

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.900
Don't swear!

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.460
Duy. Take her to the hospital to check tomorrow.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.600
Despising me like that is enough!

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.120
Look for yourself!

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.140
The result of the pregnancy test is positive.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.640
You don't remember when you started to sleep with me?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.040
Where is my room now?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.540
Since you found out that my brother went blind,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.240
you left him.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.400
Now you're back and demanding the restaurant.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.520
What are you thinking?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.440
I gave all my youth to your brother.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.320
A restaurant is not a big thing!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.540
You are the one who despises yourself!

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.860
You can't trick him, so now you use the baby to force him?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.560
I only want to take what my child and I deserve.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.220
What's wrong with it?

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.380
Let me tell you this.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.240
If I find out that the baby is not his,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.020
you won't be done with me.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.840
It could be good news.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.780
I don't believe that she's pregnant.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.340
How dare she!

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.920
Please calm down.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.700
Who does she think she is to fool me?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.480
Why didn't you expose her there?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.880
You could just expose her there.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.020
No.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.460
I can't.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.520
Am I not miserable enough?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.220
Brother!

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.180
Don't be like that!

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.420
How could she?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.080
How dare she did that!

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.320
Brother.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.540
That d*mn woman!

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.600
Brother!

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.820
That sl*t!

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.380
Can you just stop it?

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.620
She dared to fool me!

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.140
You're hurting yourself!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600
Godd*mn her!

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.920
Slowly.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.260
Stand still.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.580
Why are you taking me out here?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.780
To walk!

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.820
Today, I'm not in the mood to do anything.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.060
I want to tell you a secret.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.940
A sensational secret!

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.580
But... If you want to hear it, you must come to me.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.500
Okay.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.080
No stick!

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.300
Just take it slowly. I'm right in front of you.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.500
Let me take you some water!

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.600
It's so fresh!

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.260
The wind is so cool!

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.580
I mean your hand is fresh.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.120
You wear a watch?

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.160
Yes.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.640
No ring. So, you're single.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.660
Where did you take that from?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.020
I want to believe it's true.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.720
Wake me when it's meal time.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.500
If you lean on me like this, how can I prepare the meal?

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.340
You can do anything as long as you don't leave me.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.900
Are this Cinderella and his prince?

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.880
Oh, my dear Thach.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.420
So romantic!

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.660
Someone would be very happy to see this!
