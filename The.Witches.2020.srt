- All right, then.

Where were we?

5
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,311
Oh, yeah, that's right.

6
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,500
Now I remember.

7
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:33,751
"A note about witches."

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,959
See, here's the
thing about them.

9
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,125
They're real!

10
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:42,876
Witches are as real
as a rock in your shoe.

11
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,459
That's the first thing
you need to know.

12
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,709
The second thing
you need to know,

13
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,626
they're here!

14
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:53,751
And they live amongst us...

In every big city,
in every small town.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,042
For all you know,

19
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,061
a witch might be living right

20
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:10,042
next door to you right now.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,584
They everywhere!

22
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,167
A witch might be a nurse,

23
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,393
or your teacher, and you can bet

28
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,959
And here's the
most important thing.

29

The most important thing.

30
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,792
Witches hate children!

31
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,834
A witch spends all her time

32
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:47,459
thinking up ways
to destroy children.

33
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,334
That's all she thinks about.

this horrible child?"

[squishing]

36
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,186
A witch gets the same pleasure

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,334
from squishing a child

38

You want something to eat?

I just fried some wings.

Feel that you can't go on

Because all of
your hope Is gone

And your life is filled

Is just an illusion

And your world
around Is tumblin' down

What you waiting for?

143
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,042
Don't feel like eating.

144
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,894
And I don't feel like wasting

145
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:09,667
all this good food.

146
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:12,019
- What, you think I'm supposed
- to feel sorry for you?

147
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,709
Well, I don't.

148
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,125
Do I feel bad?

149
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,209
Yeah.

150
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,042
But not sorry.

151
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,976
- Sometimes, whatever the good
- Lord needs to teach us

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,083
Comes in ways we don't see.

153
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,560
But it doesn't mean
we're not supposed

154
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,459
to learn something.

155
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,751
Look here.

00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,751
This was my baby.

157
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,394
I'd do anything

158
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,000
for her to be here right now.

159
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,500
But the Man Above
had another plan for her.

160
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:43,542
And whether it seems
fair to me or not,

161
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:44,834
it doesn't matter.

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,125
Sometimes life isn't fair.

163
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,584
It's a hard lesson
for folks to learn

164
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,290
and most people don't have to

165
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:54,959
learn it this young.

166
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,000

You like cake?

Well, corn bread
is basically cake.

Mmm-hmm.

It's a she.

180
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,792

Uh-huh.

185
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,876
Well, tell me.

186
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,667
Don't be keeping me in suspense.

187
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:30,751
Aisy.

188
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:32,042
Lazy?

189
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,311
- Well, that mouse
- is full of nothing but energy.

190
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,542
She runs all the
time in that wheel.

191
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:38,042
Not "lazy."

192
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,542
Daisy.

193
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:42,250
"Daisy." Oh.

194
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,417
I like it.

195
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,792
That's a perfect name for her.

196
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:48,375
Close your eyes, honey.

197
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,626
[upbeat music playing]

198
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:55,373
[man singing]  It's your thing

199
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,250
Do what you wanna do

200
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:02,709
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

201
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,042
It's your thing

202
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,292
Do what you wanna do

203
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,417
I can't tell you
Who to sock it to

204
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,061
[older Hero]

205
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,667
And somehow, she did it.

206
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:18,894
Little by little,
with a tug here

207
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:21,101
and a pull there, she brought me

208
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,000
out of my sadness.

209
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,459
[both laughing]

210
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:25,727
- [man singing]
-  Oh, you need love now

211
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,542
Just as bad as I do

212
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:27,626
[older Hero] But even though

213
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:31,125
my own darkness
was being lifted,

214
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,915
there was another dark shadow

215
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,667
looming nearby.

216
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:37,209
Very nearby.

217
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:41,999
I didn't know it, but
I was about to meet

218
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:44,751
my first witch.

219
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,667
Curses. [hissing]

220
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,209
[coughing]

221
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,459
[man singing]  All right

222
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,334
Lord have mercy!

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,334
[Grandma] Raymond.

224
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,375
Raymond.

225
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,125
You call these fresh?

226
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,250
But we just got them in.

227
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:13,792
When? Last year?

228
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:15,125
Look at how yellow they are.

229
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,250
And those brown
spots around the edges.

230
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:19,209
I'm not gonna waste
good bacon drippings

231
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,918
on these shriveled-up weeds.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,185
Can you get me some fresh greens

233
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,209
if you don't mind?

234
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,417
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,375
I'll see what we
have in the back.

236
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:26,459
You do that.

237
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,000
[TV playing indistinctly]

238
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,519
Grandma, can I get these nails

239
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:31,000
to make Daisy a house?

240
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,102
-[Grandma] Hmm.

241
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,167
-[doorbell jingles]

242
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,626
Well, these aren't galvanized.

243
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,000
You have to use galvanized nails

244
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,292
so they won't rust.

245
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,417
But galvanized
costs .35 cents more.

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,792
Safety first.

247
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:42,876
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,059
You cut yourself
on a rusty nail,

249
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,083
you can get lockjaw.

250
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,417
Yes, ma'am.

251
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,018
And then I'd have to
flush out your system

252
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:49,922
- with liver oil, garlic juice,
- Tabasco sauce.

253
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,894
- You wouldn't want to go
- through that now, would you?

254
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:52,959
No, ma'am.

255
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,248
Good.

256
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,500
Remember, safety first.

257
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,209
[coughing]

258
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:58,915
[older Hero] Grandma knew how

259
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,584
to fix all kinds of ailments.

260
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,373
She learned from her grandma

261
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:04,125
how to use herbs and potions

262
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,000
and strange incantations

263
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,834
to make sick people good as new.

264
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:11,167
Here in Alabama,
where she grew up,

265
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,918
Grandma was known as a healer.

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,375
[whispering] Galvanized.

267
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,876
[in raspy voice] Boy.

268
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,709
[drawling] Boy.

269
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:31,334
Do you like sweets?

270
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,042
[snake hissing]

271
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:38,000
She is tame.

272
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:42,876
Very sweet.

273
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,375
[hissing]

274
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,292
Give her a kiss.

275
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,792
[Grandma coughing]

276
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:00,959
[Grandma] Young man.

277
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,792
You want those nails,
you better come on...

278
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,375
[continues coughing]

279
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,334
Yes, Raymond,
that's more like it.

280
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,518
- [Hero] Grandma,
- I need to tell you something!

281
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,584
Not now, son.

282
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,976
But, Grandma...
[coughs] I thought

283
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,083
you wanted those nails.

284
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,834
Forget it. Let's just go.

285
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:22,584
[continues coughing]

286
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,375
Yeah.

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,584
Let's just go.

288
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,667
[thunder rumbling]

289
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:35,417
Hey.

290
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:41,375
Son, what were
you trying to tell me

291
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,542
in the grocery
store this morning?

292
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:47,292
You were shaking like a leaf.

293
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,209
Don't worry about that, Grandma.

294
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,667
I just want you to feel better.

295
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,959
I feel fine.

296
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,643
- You just tell me
- what you were trying to say.

297
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,867
- Looked like you were about
- to have a conniption fit.

298
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,561
[sighs heavily]

299
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,125
I don't know what I saw.

300
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,959
It was a scary lady.

301
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:03,292
She called to me.

302
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,167
But when she did,
when she talked,

303
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,000
her mouth... Was
she wearing gloves?

304
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,584
Long ones, up to her elbows?

305
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,042
Was she wearing a hat?

306
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,748
It looked like she had a towel

307
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:19,417
on her head or something.

308
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,810
And when she
talked, did her voice

309
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,334
sound ugly and scratchy

310
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,936
like an outhouse door

311
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,500
swinging on a rusty hinge?

312
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,959
Oh. [sighs]

313
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,209
I feared this was happening.

314
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,852
That lady you saw in

315
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,667
the grocery store was no lady.

316
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:40,167
What you saw was a witch.

317
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,417
[thunder claps]

318
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,584
A witch?

319
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,042
That's right.

320
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,248
A no-good, rotten, low-down,

321
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:49,417
sneaky, sneaky witch.

322
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,542
Okay. Okay.

323
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,000
Is this you and
your church friends

324
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,500
trying to play a joke on me?

325
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,500
'Cause if it is,
it's not very funny.

326
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:57,792
Listen, child.

327
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:00,542
Witches ain't
nothing to joke about.

328
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,540
I've known children
who no longer exist

329
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:05,042
as children on this earth.

330
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,042
They were turned, transformed,

331
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,959
taken by witches.

332
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,936
- -[thunder claps]
- -[Hero gasps]

333
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:16,250
I can tell you about Alice Blue.

334
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:19,876
Well, Alice Blue and
I were best friends.

335
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,542
We lived across the
street from each other.

336
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,020
We were like sisters.

337
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,459
Inseparable.

338
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,165
We did everything together,

339
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,834
even our chores.

340
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,959
But Alice was a lollygagger.

341
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,167
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.

342
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,167
It's almost suppertime.

343
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,292
[steam hisses]

344
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,957
[Grandma] Alice did something

345
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:54,876
no child should ever do.

346
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,083
She took candy from a stranger.

347
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,167
[ominous music playing]

348
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,894
I got so scared,
I tore out of there

349
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:03,768
like greased lightning,
and hightailed it

350
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,584
straight home.

351
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,167
I never should
have left Alice alone.

352
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,000
I knew I shouldn't have.

353
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
But I was so scared.

354
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,876
Later that night,

355
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,375
when I saw Alice alive,

356
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,540
I was as happy as a mouse

357
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,667
in a bucket of cheese.

358
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,626
But the very next morning,

359
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,375
all that happiness went away

360
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,667
because it happened.

361
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,895
- [whispers]
- She started turning.

362
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:49,959
[shrieks]

363
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,584
[clucking]

364
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,751

[clucking]

366
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,375
[crows]

367
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,582
Alice was chicken-afied.

368
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,751
Chicken-alified.

369
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,834
[clucking continues]

370
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:20,542
Lordy!

371
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:22,959
Look at the size
of that chicken.

372
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,876
Y'all seen where
Alice run off to?

373
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:29,042
She's right... there.

374
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,834
[woman] What you
talking about, child?

375
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,334
Where'd she go?

376
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,959
[Grandma] I tried to
explain what I saw,

377
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,707
but everybody was looking

378
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,417
at me like I was crazy.

379
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,709
Finally, I just
shut up about it.

380
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,602
Although, I made it
a point to visit Alice

381
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,000
in her coop every day.

382
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,792
[chicken groans]

383
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:50,876
Hi, Alice.

384
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,751
[clucking]

385
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,876
[Grandma] Alice even laid eggs.

386
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,000
Big green ones.

387
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,000
Biggest green eggs I ever seen.

388
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,834
People said they were delicious.

389
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,167
What about the witch?

390
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,375
What about her?

391
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,584
Did she go away?

392
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,918
Oh, my, no.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,561
- Once a witch come
- into your life, it never...

394
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,584
[thunder cracking]

395
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:23,959
[whispers] Never...
Oh, my, Lord in Heaven.

396
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:26,542
What am I thinking?

397
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:28,834
I just told you we
saw a witch today.

398
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,125
A witch in the grocery store.

399
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,853
And what am I doing?

400
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:32,935
Sitting here like
I'm blind in one eye

401
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,042
and can't see out the other,

402
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,542
wasting precious
time lollygagging.

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,918
[thunder continues rumbling]

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
[older Hero] Always wondered

405
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,584
what Grandma kept
in that locked closet.

406
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,749
Turns out it was full of

407
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,270
medicinal herbs and
elixirs, and old books

408
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,626
about ancient healing.

409
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,145
Now, my mom always
said Grandma was sort of

410
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,584
a country-type healer.

411
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,876
But now I was starting to think

412
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:08,584
she might be a voodoo priestess.

413
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,125
Child, we need to leave.

414
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,644
-Leave?

415
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,125
-That's right, leave.

416
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,459
It's not safe for us here.

417
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:15,834
But where we gonna go?

418
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,792
I'll call my cousin, Eston.

419
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,459
Have him make a
reservation for us

420
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,918
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,120
- He was the executive chef
- there for over 30 years.

422
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,603
- He's got pull there.
- [chuckles]

423
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,459
He's a star.

424
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,667
His cooking put that
hotel on the map.

425
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,145
It's the swankiest resort

426
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,584
in all of Alabama.

427
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,894
You'll be telling your grandkids

428
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,876
about your stay in this hotel.

429
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,709
[Hero] How do you
know we'll be safe there?

430
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,686
Because, child, ain't nothing

431
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,707
but rich white folks
at the Grand Orleans

432
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:47,959
Imperial Island Hotel.

433
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,292
And witches only
prey on the poor,

434
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,250
the overlooked,
the kids they think

435
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,643
- nobody's gonna make a fuss
- about if they go missing.

436
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,751
Go pack!

437
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,623
[Hero] Grandma, are there

438
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,000
witches in every city?

439
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,665
[Grandma] Every city,

440
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,292
every state, every country.

441
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,167
And there's a secret
society of witches

442
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,918
in every country called a coven.

443
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,582
That's just like a Rotary Club

444
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:18,209
but for witches.

445
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,000
They all get
together in one place

446
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,083
and gossip about
who they put spells on,

447
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,500
or trade potion
secrets, and whatnot.

448
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:27,477
But most important,
they receive orders

449
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,000
from the Grand High Witch.

450
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,292
The Grand High Witch?

451
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,459
The Grand High Witch, yeah.

452
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,876
She's the ruler of them all.

453
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,209
All-powerful, pure evil,

454
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:39,417
and without a stitch of mercy.

455
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,042
Yeah. Legend has
it, she was hatched

456
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,292
on the frozen tundra of Norway.

457
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,250
Now, take a look at that.

458
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,810
What, you just gonna stand there

459
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,334
and stare at me all day?

460
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,000
Can I help you?

461
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,581
You can unload this car while

462
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,125
I check in to this here hotel.

463
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,250
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:18,709
Here's the key.

465
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:23,751
Oh, and... No.

466
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:26,125
You keep your money, ma'am.

467
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:28,042
And enjoy yourself.

468
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,375
I think I will.

469
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:32,936
- [older Hero] Grandma was right
- About this hotel.

470
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,834
It sure was fancy.

471
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,125
She brought us to
the Gulf of Mexico

472
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:39,167
to get away from that witch.

473
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,686
But she had no idea what

474
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,167
we were about to step into.

475
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,959
[Daisy sniffing]

476
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:47,853
- [whispers]
- Be careful with the mouse.

477
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:50,393
- -[man] No.
- -[woman] For God's sake,

478
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,727
- I think you're being
- extremely unreasonable.

479
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,143
- [man] No, Deidre.
- For the last time,

480
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,476
I will not have that
woman in my house.

481
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,560
[woman] Oh, she's
very good company.

482
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,751
[man] Absolutely not, Deidre.

483
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,209
[woman] Oh, for God's sake,

484
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:00,667
Bruno, your face.

485
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,000
Obviously can't
take you anywhere.

486
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,061
[receptionist]

487
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,125
Here you are, ma'am.

488
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,334
Come on, we got our key.

489
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,417
We are in room 766.

490
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,209
[Hero] Sounds like a good room.

491
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,542
[Grandma coughing]

492
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:25,436
- -You okay, Grandma?
- -[coughs]

493
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,959
That's the first
time you coughed

494
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,125
since we left the house.

495
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,060
- -Can I help you, madam?
- -[coughs]

496
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,834
Oh! You must be Eston's cousins.

497
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:35,959
Yes, he insisted that
you stay in room 766.

498
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,334
That's the Magnolia.

499
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,103
This is one of

500
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,834
our most lovely junior suites.

501
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,000
[Grandma chuckles]

502
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:46,209
And aren't you a
lucky fella? Hmm?

503
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,393
It's not every day that
a young gentleman

504
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,959
such as yourself is fortunate

505
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,623
to come and stay in such

506
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,417
a fine hotel as this now, is it?

507
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,751
Come on, Gatsby.

508
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:57,918
Let's go.

509
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,209
Let's go find our room.

510
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:00,667
Would you like me to show you?

511
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,476
- -It's on the fourth floor.
- -[Grandma] Mmm.

512
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,477
- [Hero] Grandma,
- if we're on the fourth floor,

513
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,209
Why is it number 7-6-6?

514
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,560
- Because the man who built
- this hotel was a numerologist.

515
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,417
He believed numbers
have meaning.

516
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,584
I know a little something
about numbers.

517
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,957
Seven and six together

518
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:15,292
means a test is coming.

519
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,334
Two sixes mean abundance.

520
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,061
So, it look like

521
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:20,751
a big test might be coming.

522
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:27,083
[marching with
synchronized steps]

523
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,792
Well, hello there.

524
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:47,500
The Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel

525
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,728
welcomes you and your lovely

526
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,918
group of benefactresses.

527
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,895
Uh, I would just like to say

528
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,727
that we applaud
your innumerable,

529
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,500
uh, philanthropic...

530
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,542
- acts and, um...
- [cat purring]

531
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,125
And, um...

532
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,561
I'm sorry, madam,
but the hotel has

533
00:25:11,585 --> 00:25:13,292
a very strict no-pet policy.

534
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,560
- [with Eastern European accent]
- You seem like the sort of man

535
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:17,250
Who loves a precious.

536
00:25:17,334 --> 00:25:18,667
Don't you, Mister...

537
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,477
- Stringer. R. J. Stringer III.
- Hotel Manager.

538
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,500
Thank you for
making an exception,

539
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:25,059
- -Mr. R. J. The Hotel Manager.
- -Stringer.

540
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,290
Yes, but I haven't yet...

541
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:27,542
But I didn't agree...

542
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,292
So, tell me something, Mister...

543
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,895
- -Stringy?
- -Stringer.

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,250
Hotel man.

545
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,394
- -Manager.
- -The third.

546
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,811
-Yeah.

547
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,167
-I know you love kitties.

548
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,248
-[cat hisses]

549
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:40,292
-[chuckles uneasily]

550
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:46,250
But what do you
think of... mice?

551
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,334
Mice?

552
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,334
Yeah. Mice.

553
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,626
What would you
do if there were mice

554
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,292
running all around
in this hotel?

555
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,852
Well, I can assure you,
madam, there would

556
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,792
never be any mice...

557
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,582
[shushes] But if there were?

558
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,334
Hypothetically?

559
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,959
Mmm. Oh, hypothetically.

560
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,709
Yes, I suppose,
well, I would, uh...

561
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,334
I would call the exterminator.

562
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,209
Exactly!

563
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,626
You see, girls?

564
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:20,292
He would call the exterminator!

565
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,519
Just like any normal
human with his head

566
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:26,561
screwed on right,
he would exterminate

567
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,542
those brats.

568
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:32,167
Uh... Rats.

569
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,417
We would exterminate the rats.

570
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
[Grandma] Evil.

571
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,250
[thunder crashing]

572
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,643
There's no other
way to describe them.

573
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,834
Pure, unvarnished evil.

574
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,167
That's what witches are.

575
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,686
-[thunder cracking]

576
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,167
-[Grandma coughing]

577
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,226
- [hoarsely] Now, you see
- this here cough of mine?

578
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,209
It was likely brought
on by a witch.

579
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,477
- Probably that one you saw
- in the grocery store.

580
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,834
Really? A witch can
make you cough?

581
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:04,584
Oh, you bet your
sweet patootie they can.

582
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,540
Grandma, how can
you tell a real witch from

583
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:08,459
a normal lady?

584
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,519
Well, first of all, witches

585
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:12,542
aren't really women at all.

586
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:15,459
They're demons in human shape.

587
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,959
That's why if you
look closely at a witch,

588
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,686
you'll notice the corners

589
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,375
of her mouth is elongated,

590
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,125
stretching almost
up to her ears,

591
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,749
and that's usually hidden

592
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,334
with pancake makeup.

593
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,207
And a real witch always

594
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,042
wears gloves. Always.

595
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,250
Because a real witch
doesn't have hands.

596
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,334
She's got claws.

597
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,459
[Hero] Claws?

598
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:37,959
[thunder cracking]

599
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,667
And they don't have toes. Ooh.

600
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:42,125
Their ugly feet look like

601
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,959
their toes got chopped
off with an axe.

602
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,209
And all witches are bald.

603
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:49,584
As bald as a boiled egg.

604
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,959
So, they wear wigs.

605
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:53,167
And it gives them nasty sores.

606
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,727
"Wig rash,"

607
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,250
the witches call it.

608
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:59,083
Mmm! And it makes them crazy.

609
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,584
So, gloves, wigs.

610
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,918
Is that everything?

611
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,250
Nose-holes.

612
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:05,374
-Nose-holes?

613
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,459
-Yeah. Nostrils.

614
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,250
Nose-holes.

615
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,874
Witches have larger nose-holes

616
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,459
than normal people.

617
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,959
When they need
to sniff out a child,

618
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,459
those nose-holes can grow out

619
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:18,250
as big as eight
inches in diameter.

620
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,751
[thunder cracks]

621
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:21,353
But, mind you, children

622
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,918
smell horrible to witches.

623
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,918
[Hero] Even if the
kid just had a bath?

624
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,269
[chuckles]

625
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,584
That makes it worse.

626
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:29,332
A freshly clean kid smells

627
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:31,042
like dog poop to a witch.

628
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,186
-Dog poop?

629
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,292
-That's right.

630
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,083
And the cleaner the kid,

631
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,834
the poopier he
smells to a witch.

632
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:39,167
Maybe I should
stop taking baths.

633
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,375
Child, don't test me.

634
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:43,373
Can a witch come in here

635
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:45,125
and get us while we sleep?

636
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,083
No.

637
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,709
Not at all.

638
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,959
Witches never
do silly things like

639
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,248
climbing drainpipes or

640
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,500
breaking into people's houses.

641
00:28:56,584 --> 00:29:00,000
Besides, they have
no idea where we are.

642
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,083
Okay, but I'm
still a little scared.

643
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,542
Over here, come on, little man.

644
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,083
There we go.

645
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,584
Get some sleep.

646
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:20,000
[thunder rumbling]

647
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,792
[hisses]

648
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:57,876
[cat purring]

649
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:01,542
Hmm?

650
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,667
Really?

651
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,042
[wincing]

652
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:26,375
Mmm.

653
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:27,769
-[thunder cracking]

654
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,125
-[chuckles]

655
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,209
[people chattering in distance]

656
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,375
[older Hero] The next morning,

657
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,394
- the sun was shining and the air was crisp
- and clear.

658
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,207
I kept quiet as a mouse

659
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,959
so Grandma could sleep in,

660
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,561
and I took it upon
myself to order her

661
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:47,209
some room service breakfast.

662
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:50,334
[Grandma] Mmm, mmm, mmm.

663
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,751
Here's your breakfast, Grandma.

664
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,959
Scrambled eggs,
chicken fried steak,

665
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,375
hominy grits, pecan sticky buns,

666
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:01,020
rhubarb strawberry
jam, and a pitcher

667
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,751
of sweet iced tea with mint.

668
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:05,751
Oh, that sure smells special.

669
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,709
Oh, mercy, I slept in late.

670
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,125
Phew.

671
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:13,853
- Well, thank you for ordering
- me breakfast, darling.

672
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,519
- I gave the room service guy
- a half a dollar tip.

673
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:17,792
Was that okay?

674
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,250
That's mighty
gentlemanly of you.

675
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:20,667
[coughs]

676
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,751
Grandma, are you okay?

677
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,352
- I'm fine.
- Just a little tickle.

678
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,250
Grab Grandma that
glass of tea. [coughs]

679
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,644
- And listen, Grandma's gonna
- take it easy today.

680
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:32,352
- But I want you to get outside
- and run around.

681
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,394
Go down to the water.

682
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:37,375
Have fun.

683
00:31:37,459 --> 00:31:38,728
I was thinking I would do

684
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,042
some training with Daisy.

685
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,918
Oh! Well, take her with.

686
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,960
- Just don't let her get
- too close to the water.

687
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,626
I wouldn't want some
big old sea snake

688
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:46,834
to grab ahold of her.

689
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:48,125
Sea snake?

690
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,561
I'm just joshing.

691
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:50,959
There ain't no sea snakes.

692
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,292
You go on now. Have fun.

693
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,873
And don't worry about me.

694
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,417
I'm fine.

695
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,959
[older Hero] Even though I knew

696
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,459
Grandma was kidding
about the sea snakes,

697
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,584
I didn't wanna take any chances,

698
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,626
so we stayed inside.

699
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,334
And wouldn't you know,

700
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,811
we came upon the big ballroom

701
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:09,250
where it turns out

702
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,918
the International Society

703
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,311
for the Prevention of Cruelty

704
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:13,393
to Children folks
were gonna have

705
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:16,000
their conference.

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,209
[door creaking]

707
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,083
Hey!

708
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,626
You there!

709
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,000
And what are you doing?

710
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,209
Breaking and entering?

711
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,792
Looking for a quiet spot.

712
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,083
For what?

713
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,167
Training.

714
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,209
Training what?

715
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,853
Cool. Super.

716
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,542
What's his name?

717
00:32:37,626 --> 00:32:39,124
It's a she.

718
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:40,667
And her name is Daisy.

719
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,311
- -Can I hold her?
- -[Daisy squeaking]

720
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:46,375
She's not too comfortable
around strangers.

721
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:49,000
Can she do any
tricks or anything?

722
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,959
We were just about
to do some training.

723
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,334
Wanna watch?

724
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:53,751
What time is it?

725
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:55,582
A nice lady told me

726
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,375
to meet her here at 12:25.

727
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:59,124
She said she would give me

728
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:00,834
six bars of Swiss chocolate.

729
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,144
What's your name?

730
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,626
I'm... Bruno Jenkins!

731
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,749
- I've been looking for you
- everywhere, young man.

732
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,125
Your father is furious.

733
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:09,417
Hello, Mother.

734
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,167
This is my new friend.

735
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,834
Nice to meet you.

736
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:15,584
Look at your
hands, they're filthy!

737
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,165
Look at your shirt!

738
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:18,709
It's a complete mess!

739
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:19,811
- -Come with me.
- -Ow!

740
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:21,250
What have you been doing?

741
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,167
Running around in
a sausage factory?

742
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,792
[door creaking]

743
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,709
[older Hero] The room
was completely empty.

744
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,478
A perfect place for me

745
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:49,209
and Daisy to do our training.

746
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:52,040
And I figured, if
all the Prevention

747
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:54,417
of Cruelty to Children
people showed up,

748
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,125
they would probably look kindly

749
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,685
on a young mouse
trainer who was just

750
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,626
going about his business.

751
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,626
[clangs]

752
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:20,751
Jeez, that scared
the crap out of me.

753
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
[switches clicking]

754
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,417
So, here we are.

755
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,667
Here is the Le Grand
Imperial Ballroom

756
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:51,042
or Le Salon
Grande, as we call it.

757
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,792
Well, actually we
call it the Mural Room

758
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,393
because of all these
beautiful murals...

759
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:55,957
I was told there is only

760
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:57,542
one door in and out, yeah?

761
00:34:57,626 --> 00:34:58,876
Yeah. Yes.

762
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,686
There's, uh, only that door

763
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,834
there, in and out,
and which, of course,

764
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,667
does not make the
fire marshal very happy.

765
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:09,375
So, don't you go
starting any fires.

766
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:14,751
This room will do.

767
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:19,374
[Mr. Stringer] Right,
so... [marching with

768
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:20,584
[synchronized steps]

769
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,393
Yeah, so, if there's any...

770
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,518
Is there anything
else -that you ladies...

771
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:29,584
-No.

772
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,686
- -No?
- -Bye-bye.

773
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,125
Oh, all right.

774
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:36,834
[sniffing]

775
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:55,000
[woman] Saoirse,
secure the room!

776
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:06,375
Okay, you so-called ladies.

777
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:09,167
Prepare for removal.

778
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:27,873
-[whispers] Wake up.

779
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,083
-[snake hissing]

780
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,542
[hissing]

781
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:48,709
[sniffing]

782
00:36:54,209 --> 00:36:55,292
[grunts]

783
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:10,626
Okay, you trussed-up succubines,

784
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:14,334
you may remove your gloves.

785
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,978
[dramatically]

786
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,626
You may remove your shoes.

787
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:48,500
And... you may remove your wigs!

788
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,459
[sighing in relief]

789
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,186
[whispers]

790
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,667
They're all witches.

791
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,894
[older Hero] My blood
ran cold as I started

792
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:19,042
to get real scared.

793
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,957
Here I was, trapped
in a room with a bunch

794
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,334
of bald-headed witches!

795
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,500
And the mean one,
the bald-head honcho

796
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,334
who was standing right above me,

797
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,792
the one who was
giving all the orders,

798
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:34,792
as soon as I got
a good look at her,

799
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:38,250
I knew instantly
who she had to be.

800
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,250
[crunches]

801
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:41,959
She's the Grand High Witch.

802
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,250
[thuds]

803
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,584
[snarls]

804
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,834
[croakily] Witches.

805
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,000
Witches.

806
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:08,709
You are a heap of
good-for-nothing worms!

807
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,686
[in normal voice]

808
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,584
This morning, I'm
having my breakfast

809
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,582
and I'm looking out

810
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,542
the window, at the beach,

811
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,834
and what am I seeing? Hmm?

812
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:28,000
[croakily] What am I seeing?

813
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,102
[in normal voice]

814
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm seeing dozens...
I'm seeing hundreds...

815
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,478
I'm seeing hundreds

816
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:36,918
of repulsive little brats

817
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,353
playing in the sand,
and it's putting me

818
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:41,876
right off my food!

819
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:49,042
So...

820
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:56,542
Here are my orders.

821
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:04,209
I want every
child in the world...

822
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:08,792
rubbed out!

823
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:14,375
Squashed, squirted,
and frittered!

824
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:18,125
Your Excellency,
do you have a plan?

825
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:22,125
How can we possibly
wipe out every child?

826
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:23,375
[witch yelps]

827
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,209
[witches gasp]

828
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,042
That was actually
a good question.

829
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:40,626
Insubordinate but
a good question.

830
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:45,292
Of course I have a plan.

831
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,936
I want each of you to return

832
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,542
to your pathetic little town.

833
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:53,500
And open... [inhales sharply]

834
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,584
a candy store.

835
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:00,334
And in this store you will sell

836
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:05,459
only the highest
quality, tastiest candy.

837
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:09,667
Now, you're probably wondering,

838
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:11,103
"Where do I get the money

839
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:12,500
to buy a candy shop?"

840
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:17,542
Well, I have
thought of that too.

841
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:22,542
In my room, room number 666,

842
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,167
I have a steamer trunk

843
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,667
filled with brand-new,
crisp $100 bills!

844
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,459
Room 666.

845
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:32,061
[Grand High Witch]

846
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:34,626
Remember that room number 666

847
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,542
and your shops will sell

848
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:40,334
only the highest
quality, tastiest candy.

849
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,292
And...

850
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,083
We use Formula Number 86

851
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:54,709
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!

852
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,459
[witches] Ooh!

853
00:41:56,542 --> 00:42:00,709
One drop of Mouse
Maker in a piece of candy

854
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,417
will transform
a dirty little child

855
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,959
into a mouse in one hour!

856
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,584
[witches] Ah!

857
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:12,186
Two drops will
transform the disgusting

858
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,250
little brat in 30 minutes.

859
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:18,375
And three drops
is instantaneous.

860
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:21,209
An instant mouse!

861
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,042
[rattling]

862
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,792
[giggling] Oh.

863
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:28,959
Oh, no, no, no.

864
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,374
-[rattling continues]

865
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:31,751
-[shushing]

866
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,292
Shut up.

867
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,459
So, less than an hour ago,

868
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,644
I found a repulsive smelly

869
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:50,311
little boy in the
lobby and I gave him

870
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,792
an outrageously expensive

871
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,542
bar of Swiss chocolate.

872
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:55,686
A chocolate bar

873
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,792
that was laced with one drop

874
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,375
- of my Number 86...
- Oh, no.

875
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:01,018
- [Grand High Witch] ...Delayed
- Action Mouse Maker potion!

876
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,125
Bruno.

877
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:03,959
And I told the
greedy little brat

878
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:07,292
to meet me here at 12:25.

879
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:10,167
So, in less than 10 minutes,

880
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,311
all you pathetic witches will

881
00:43:13,335 --> 00:43:16,417
see what a true genius I am!

882
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,123
[witches chanting]

883
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:19,792
Genius! Genius! Genius!

884
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,291
-[cackling]

885
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:22,751
-[witches continue chanting]

886
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,209
Quiet!

887
00:43:33,292 --> 00:43:34,500
[chanting stops]

888
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:36,375
[sniffing]

889
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,876
[continues sniffing]

890
00:43:55,918 --> 00:43:57,167
[growls]

891
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,417
[witches gasping]

892
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,375
[snake hissing]

893
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,643
- -[knocking at door]
- -[Bruno] Where's my chocolate?

894
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:16,626
It's the greedy little cretin.

895
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:19,109
- -Quick! Put on your wigs!
- -[Bruno] Hey, are you in there?

896
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,500
Welcome, you...

897
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:28,500
fine, handsome man. [sniffs]

898
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,083
We've been waiting.

899
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,751
[Grand High Witch] Darling boy.

900
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:36,500
I have your chocolate for you.

901
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:47,918
[Grand High Witch whistles]

902
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:55,876
You promised me
six bars of chocolate.

903
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,500
I only see one in your hand.

904
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:01,834
Hmm... You see, ladies,

905
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:04,291
not only is he fat and stupid

906
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:06,709
but greedy too. [chuckles]

907
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,019
-[witches snicker]

908
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:09,292
-Mmm.

909
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:18,083
[witches gasp in awe]

910
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,623
[Grand High Witch]

911
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,125
That's right, little man.

912
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:24,876
Here is your
delicious chocolate.

913
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,603
Come and get it.

914
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:28,292
Come and get it.

915
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,918
Get ready, girls.

916
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,125

00:54:36,584 --> 00:54:38,459
They everywhere!

1101
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,834
[squeals]

1102
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,792
[chambermaid
screaming and sobbing]

1103
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,918
[gasps]

1104
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Grandma, it's me.

1105
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,751
Grandma, it's me, your grandson.

1106
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,042
My grandson... Is that you, boy?

1107
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:02,209
Yes, Grandma, it's me.

1108
00:55:02,292 --> 00:55:04,250
Oh... Oh.

1109
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:07,292
Is it really you?

1110
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,834
It's really me.

1111
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:11,019
- -What happened?
- -It was the Grand High Witch.

1112
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,209
The Grand High Witch?

1113
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,083
Oh, Lord, not the
Grand High Witch.

1114
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,834
Yes. She mouse-afied me.

1115
00:55:15,918 --> 00:55:17,709
And the whole hotel
is full of witches.

1116
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,792
- They're having a witch
- convention or something.

1117
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:21,124
You been through so much,

1118
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:22,417
you don't need this.

1119
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,292
Grandma's so, so sorry.

1120
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:25,876
Grandma, please
get off the floor

1121
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:28,042
and put me on the coffee table.

1122
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,123
-How do I do that?

1123
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:30,167
-Pick me up.

1124
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,292
Pick you up?

1125
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,792
Yeah, just like I pick up Daisy.

1126
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:35,959
Right.

1127
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,834
I can't believe this
happened to you.

1128
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:44,042
Believe me, things
could be a lot worse.

1129
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,918
They could?

1130
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,626
[Hero] Oh, Grandma, by the way,

1131
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:50,083
this is my friend,
Bruno Jenkins.

1132
00:55:51,542 --> 00:55:53,018
He's now a mouse
too, but he used to be

1133
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,834
a chubby, little English kid.

1134
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,582
You could've just stopped at,

1135
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,292
"This is my friend, Bruno."

1136
00:55:58,375 --> 00:55:59,751
[Grandma] I'm so sorry, Bruno.

1137
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:02,500
Those nasty, evil
witches got you too, huh?

1138
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:04,751
Yes. They got me
good and proper.

1139
00:56:04,834 --> 00:56:06,542
It's been an awful day.

1140
00:56:06,626 --> 00:56:07,666
-Anybody else hungry?

1141
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,751
-Ahem!

1142
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,186
Oh, and Daisy used to be

1143
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,584
a kid... A girl too.

1144
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,476
- [Grandma] Why didn't you
- say something before, darling?

1145
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,334
Because it can be very dangerous

1146
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,834
for a mouse to talk.

1147
00:56:16,918 --> 00:56:18,416
Most people don't understand

1148
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,959
and they get scared.

1149
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,000
I almost said
something the other night

1150
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,435
when you told the
story about Alice Blue

1151
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:25,626
getting turned into a chicken,

1152
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,751
but I thought better of it.

1153
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,207
So, some wicked, evil witch

1154
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:30,626
mouse-afied you.

1155
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:32,417
Yes, ma'am, four months ago.

1156
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,311
On the very same afternoon

1157
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:36,167
I ran away from the orphanage.

1158
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,459
Well, what happened
was, a kind lady...

1159
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:40,250
Well, I thought she was kind.

1160
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:42,709
Anyway, she offered
me a chocolate bar,

1161
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:44,459
and before I knew it, poof!

1162
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,500
I was transformed.

1163
00:56:46,584 --> 00:56:49,144
- Then, faster than a hot knife
- cuts through butter,

1164
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,832
A panhandler scoops me up

1165
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:52,459
and sells me to a pet store

1166
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,709
so he could buy food.

1167
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:56,042
Yum!

1168
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:58,626
I'm so sorry, Daisy.

1169
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:00,918
Mary. Uh, my real name is Mary.

1170
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,334
Mary. That's a pretty name.

1171
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:03,834
Excuse me.

1172
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:05,270
All this talk about food

1173
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:06,667
is making me really hungry.

1174
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:08,292
Can I have one of those grapes?

1175
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,542
[Grandma] So, it was
the Grand High Witch,

1176
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:15,375
and she's in this very hotel?

1177
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:17,040
We got to do something to turn

1178
00:57:17,064 --> 00:57:18,667
you back. Make this right.

1179
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:20,936
- The Grand High Witch
- has a room full of potion.

1180
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,375
And she's gonna use it

1181
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:24,352
- to turn every kid in the world
- into a mouse.

1182
00:57:24,459 --> 00:57:25,834
We have to help them.

1183
00:57:25,918 --> 00:57:27,436
- -[doorbell rings]
- -[Bruno gasps]

1184
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,686
- -Who is it?
- -[man] Hotel maintenance.

1185
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:31,626
[whispers] Quick, hide.

1186
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,417
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.

1187
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Keep your heads down.

1188
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:47,209
Yes.

1189
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:48,792
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,

1190
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:50,852
- but we got a report of
- a possible rodent infestation.

1191
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,124
Rodent infestation?

1192
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:53,417
In a hotel this expensive?

1193
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,584
That's crazier than a
hog on slaughter day.

1194
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:57,728
- Yes, ma'am.
- It's probably nothing.

1195
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:59,375
The maid who said
she saw the rodents

1196
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:01,644
- has a tendency to be
- a bit high-strung. [chuckles]

1197
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:01,751
-Mmm.

1198
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:03,602
-But, to be on the
safe side, I thought

1199
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:04,709
I'd lay these here traps,

1200
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:06,102
- -if you don't mind.
- -Okay.

1201
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:08,102
- -We put them in all the rooms.
- -Mmm-hmm.

1202
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:10,542
Just to be safe.

1203
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:14,125
So, uh, what are they? Mice?

1204
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:15,459
Oh. No, ma'am.

1205
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:16,853
Maid said she saw

1206
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:18,209
a swarm of huge, ugly rats.

1207
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:20,042
At least a dozen of them.

1208
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:21,751
Goodness, a dozen?

1209
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:23,334
Well, it's like I said,

1210
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,873
she has a tendency to be

1211
00:58:24,897 --> 00:58:26,375
a bit high-strung. [chuckles]

1212
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,417
[sniffs]

1213
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,918
Fresh Wisconsin cheddar.

1214
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,334
Drives them rodents plumb crazy.

1215
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,751
They can't resist it.

1216
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,209
[Bruno] Mmm... [grunts]

1217
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,790
Anyway, you hear any

1218
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:46,334
of these traps start snapping,

1219
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:47,417
give me a call.

1220
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,918
I sure will.

1221
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,250
[man] That's right.

1222
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:51,749
Don't you know anything?

1223
00:58:51,773 --> 00:58:53,209
Grapes can hurt a mouse.

1224
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,584
[Grandma] All right, you three.

1225
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,500
You stay away from
those traps, you hear?

1226
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:58,895
If we could just get our hands

1227
00:58:58,919 --> 00:58:58,976
on some of that
potion, I might be able

1228
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,417
to reverse-engineer it.

1229
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,186
- Make it a potion
- that turns mice into children.

1230
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,790
I always travel with

1231
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:07,334
my anti-hex herbs and salts.

1232
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,707
But whoever knows where

1233
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:10,042
that wicked, evil witch is.

1234
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,542
We do. She's in room 666.

1235
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:14,292
We heard her tell
all those witches

1236
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:17,834
to meet her in room
666 right after dinner.

1237
00:59:17,918 --> 00:59:19,500
And we're in room 766.

1238
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,626
Room 666 is right below us.

1239
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,000
Good Lord!

1240
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,083
- That evil sorceress is living
- right beneath us?

1241
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,792
Yes. And here's what we do.

1242
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:28,811
We wait for the Grand High

1243
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:28,894
Witch to leave her
room, then we use

1244
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:30,751
Grandma's knitting wool

1245
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:31,959
as a rope to lower me down

1246
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:33,459
to the Grand High
Witch's balcony.

1247
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,959
I grab a bottle of potion,

1248
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:37,811
Grandma hoists me back up,

1249
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:37,894
she reverses the
spell, and ta-da!

1250
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:40,459
We're kids again.

1251
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:43,626
Young man, you think
all that up just now?

1252
00:59:43,709 --> 00:59:46,626
Popped right into my head.

1253
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:47,999
-[kids screaming playfully]

1254
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:49,334
-[beach crowd chattering]

1255
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,459
[splutters]

1256
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:56,876
[retches]

1257
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,165
[Grand High Witch]

1258
00:59:58,189 --> 00:59:59,417
Vile, filthy brats.

1259
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,083
You make me puke!

1260
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:06,834
[groans] Hades,
it's getting so bad,

1261
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:10,709
I can't even enjoy a
glass of wormwood.

1262
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:12,918
She's the Grand
High Witch, all right.

1263
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,125
[both gasp]

1264
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,394
- -[Hades meows]
- -[groans]

1265
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:32,542
Grandma, that's the potion.

1266
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:34,042
She's keeping it on ice.

1267
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:37,626
Yeah, it's exactly what we need.

1268
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:39,459
[Grand High Witch] Hades, come.

1269
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:40,832
-[Hades growls]

1270
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:42,167
-We are late for tea.

1271
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:46,584
Teatime. Perfect.

1272
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,394
Now look, all we need

1273
01:00:52,418 --> 01:00:53,709
is one bottle of potion.

1274
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:56,352
- So, grab one as fast
- as you can and hurry on back.

1275
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:57,853
No telling when that monster

1276
01:00:57,877 --> 01:00:59,292
is fixing to return.

1277
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:03,542
I know you're
likely scared, baby.

1278
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,959
I'm not scared, Grandma.

1279
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,375
I don't know why,

1280
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,352
but ever since I was turned

1281
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:08,435
into a small
mouse, little things

1282
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:10,792
don't scare me anymore.

1283
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,417
Okay. Hold on tight.

1284
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:28,542
[sniffing]

1285
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,751
[Hero grunting]

1286
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:46,959
[grunts]

1287
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:00,751

1288

[doorknob clicks]

1291
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:19,876
[Hero gasps]

1292
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:23,792
[door closes]

1293
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:26,375

[Hades growling]

1295
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,561
[Grand High Witch]

1296
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:31,643
I can't believe they
won't let my precious

1297
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:34,459
into the dining room.

1298
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,375
This fleabag, roach-trap hotel

1299
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:40,167
discriminates
against everything.

1300
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,061
Money.

1301
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:46,959
Money, money, money.

1302
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:50,581
Oh, Hades, why,
in this disgusting

1303
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:54,020
human world, do you need money

1304
01:02:54,044 --> 01:02:55,876
for everything?

1305
01:03:01,959 --> 01:03:03,334
[coughs]

1306
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:06,083
[sighs]

[gags]

1308
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:12,417
Disgusting, filthy lucre.

1309
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,334
[whimpers and sniffles]

1310
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:33,542
[blubbering]

1311
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,500
[grunts]

1312
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,375
He's ready.

1313
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,584
[gasping]

1314
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,083
[both gasp]

1315
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:04,876
Well, well, well, well.

1316
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:09,209
Why is this wool here, I wonder?

1317
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,083
Oh. [chuckles nervously] Hello.

1318
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:15,394
- I just dropped my knitting
- over the balcony.

1319
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,918
But it's all right.

1320
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,561
- Thank goodness I still have
- a hold of it on this end.

1321
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,292
Well, I'm just gonna
go ahead on and...

1322
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,083
And pull it on up.

1323
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,959
I'll be out of your way.

1324
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:26,207
-Let go.

1325
01:04:26,231 --> 01:04:27,417
-[breathing shakily]

1326
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
I know you.

1327
01:04:29,584 --> 01:04:31,375
Me?

1328
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:32,542
I don't think so.

1329
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:34,292
I have seen you before.

1330
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,709
I remember your face.

1331
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:38,918
You mighta seen me
in the lobby, maybe.

1332
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1333
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,542
Not in the lobby.

1334
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:46,249
I remember you from...
- [doorbell dings]

1335
01:04:46,273 --> 01:04:47,667
-[yells] What? Who is it?

1336
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:47,751
[Mr. Stringer]

1337
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,417
It's Mr. Stringer
III, Hotel Manager.

1338
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,584
[Grand High Witch] Curses!

1339
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:55,834
[scoffs]

1340
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:01,185
- [Mr. Stringer]
- You want me to remove

1341
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:02,626
The children from the beach?

1342
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:04,351
- [Grand High Witch]
- I want them removed.

1343
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,769
- [Mr. Stringer] Well, I'll...
- I'll see what I can do.

1344
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:09,959
Madam, I procured
this, uh, for you today.

1345
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,167
I thought you might like it.

1346
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,250
It's a kitty carrier.

1347
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:15,978
And I thought you
could put your feline

1348
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:17,226
friend in there and
you can transport him

1349
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:19,125
all over the hotel,

1350
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:22,709
including the dining room.

1351
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:24,459
Thought you might like that.

1352
01:05:26,709 --> 01:05:31,249
Well, let me tell you something,

1353
01:05:31,273 --> 01:05:34,209
Mister Cat-Cage-Procurer.

1354
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:37,790
I will never, ever
allow my precious puss

1355
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:40,292
to be... [Hades yowls]

1356
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:44,334
[Hades growls and purrs]

1357
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:45,790
Well, look at that.

1358
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:47,209
He likes it in there.

1359
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:49,292
[grunts quietly]

1360
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,918
Oh, madam, I almost forgot.

1361
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,250
Regarding your ladies'
dinner this evening,

1362
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,042
we have neglected
to select a soup.

1363
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,500
Now, there are two choices.

1364
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:01,083
One is our Cajun
spice crab Creole,

1365
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,686
and the other one is our

1366
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,250
plantation kitchen split pea.

1367
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:06,499
[inhales sharply]

1368
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:08,709
Which one is cheaper?

1369
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:11,751
Well, madam, I'm
sure you will appreciate

1370
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,125
that the crab is
fresh and it is...

1371
01:06:14,209 --> 01:06:15,374
-[shouts] Which one?

1372
01:06:15,398 --> 01:06:16,584
-[groans]

1373
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:18,375
[sighs]

1374
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:20,061
Plantation kitchen split pea.

1375
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:21,709
That's the one.

1376
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:25,250
Then we will have
the split pea soup.

1377
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:27,042
Yes, madam.

1378
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,667
[Grand High Witch] And...

1379
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,250
no garlic in the soup.

1380
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:35,209
No what?

1381
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:37,918
Garlic.

1382
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,584
No garlic?

1383
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,417
Did I stutter?

1384
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,834
No garlic.

1385
01:06:47,918 --> 01:06:52,165
My women, all
suffer from a selective

1386
01:06:52,189 --> 01:06:54,834
food avoidance disorder.

1387
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:56,292
Picky eaters.

1388
01:06:57,918 --> 01:06:59,228
Yes, madam.

1389
01:06:59,252 --> 01:07:00,584
As you wish.

1390
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,584
I will inform the chef.

1391
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,876
You do that.

1392
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:07,876
I'll let myself out.

1393
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:10,042
You do that.

1394
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:19,018
Well, my precious,
since you enjoy being

1395
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:24,226
in that cage so much,
-you can stay in it!

1396
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,417
-[snarls]

1397
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,584
Traitor!

1398
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,500
[Grandma] Mouse Maker potion.

1399
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:42,000
A drop of hyssop...

1400
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,083
[fizzing]

1401
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:50,083
A smidgen of mugwort...

1402
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:55,540
And now, a dash
of healing water,

1403
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:56,751
straight from Lourdes.

1404
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:58,353
This is the most powerful

1405
01:07:58,377 --> 01:07:59,918
healing water there is.

1406
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,500
Okay.

1407
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:08,792
Now let's all join hands
and bow our heads.

1408
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,209
[liquid fizzing]

1409
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Well, I'll be...

1410
01:08:43,751 --> 01:08:46,834
Not much more to
say than that. [sighs]

1411
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:49,417
We had to try something, kids.

1412
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,602
This witch's
power is far greater

1413
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:56,626
than my little home remedies.

1414
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:58,459
Evil power.

1415
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,792
[Grandma] And strong.

1416
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:03,626
Much stronger than me.

1417
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:05,709
Please don't cry, Grandma.

1418
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:06,918
It'll be okay.

1419
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,792
[Grandma] I'm sorry, children.

1420
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,209
It's not your fault, Grandma.

1421
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:13,542
Sometimes things just happen.

1422
01:09:13,626 --> 01:09:15,751
Yeah, they do.

1423
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:20,626
I actually don't
mind being a mouse.

1424
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,935
- I get to hang out
- with my new friends all day,

1425
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,542
Don't have to go
to school anymore,

1426
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:27,143
and I don't have to
learn how to drive,

1427
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,311
which means I'll never

1428
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:29,500
get into an accident.

1429
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:31,436
Oh, child.

1430
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,334
Come here.

1431
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:35,500
Grandma, will you
still take care of me?

1432
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:36,792
Even if I stay a mouse?

1433
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:38,876
[Grandma] Of
course I will, darling.

1434
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:40,417
Doesn't matter who you are

1435
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,584
or what you look like,

1436
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,751
so long as somebody loves you.

1437
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:45,959
And I always will.

1438
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:52,250
What about my friends?

1439
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:54,584
Can they stay too?

1440
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:56,459
Well, of course.

1441
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,101
If they want to,
but don't forget,

1442
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,250
they all have loved
ones who miss them.

1443
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:02,083
I'm not so sure about that.

1444
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,248
Don't be a fool.

1445
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:04,375
I'm sure they love you.

1446
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,792
My mother thinks I'm clumsy,

1447
01:10:06,876 --> 01:10:08,332
and my father complains

1448
01:10:08,356 --> 01:10:09,834
that I'm always hungry.

1449
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,351
Well, maybe this will
help them love you

1450
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,292
for who you are,
not for who you ain't.

1451
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,375
You're fortunate to
have parents, Bruno.

1452
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:19,000
Some of us don't.

1453
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,792
But we're gonna be okay.

1454
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:22,083
We have Grandma.

1455
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,751
And she'll always be our family.

1456
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:27,292
And for that we
are very blessed.

1457
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,709
But what I wanna know

1458
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,144
is why are we standing

1459
01:10:30,168 --> 01:10:31,542
around here lollygagging?

1460
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:34,102
How are we gonna stop

1461
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:34,185
those horrible
witches from turning

1462
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,876
more children into mice?

1463
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:38,667
She's right.

1464
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:40,584
We got to do something.

1465
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,292
I know what we'll do.

1466
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,957
I sneak into the kitchen with

1467
01:10:43,981 --> 01:10:45,584
the Number 86 Mouse Maker,

1468
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:47,769
- then I slip the potion
- into the witches' pea soup

1469
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,542
And turn them all into mice.

1470
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:51,626
Are you sure about
this, little man?

1471
01:10:51,709 --> 01:10:54,060
- This sounds like
- it could be a very dangerous

1472
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,292
And scary mission.

1473
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:58,542
Trust me, Grandma,
I can handle it.

1474
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,792
[dramatic music playing]

1475
01:11:08,918 --> 01:11:10,167
I'll meet you in the lobby bar.

1476
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,000
Bruno and Daisy know which vent.

1477
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,459
Be careful, darling.

1478
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,834
I will, Grandma.

1479
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:40,042
[sous chef] Hurry up there!

1480
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:42,250
[chef] The pea soup is ready.

1481
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:43,626
No garlic.

1482
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:44,977
[sous chef] I got the soup,

1483
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,876
no garlic, Chef,
coming right up.

1484
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:49,292
[chef] Where are my prawns?

1485
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:51,250
This is not a prawn,
this is a shrimp.

1486
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:53,685
- You don't know the difference
- between a shrimp and a prawn?

1487
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,040
Count the pincers.

1488
01:11:56,064 --> 01:11:58,417
Un, deux. One, two.

1489
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,751
Let's start ladling
out that soup.

1490
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,459
Come on, you people.

1491
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:04,622
- -[chef rushing in French]
- -[sous chef] Yes, Chef.

1492
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:08,584
[grunting]

1493
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,101
- [chef in English]
- What are you doing, huh?

1494
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,476
[sous chef] I'm getting
the prawns ready.

1495
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,042
[chef] Don't tell
me that's a prawn.

1496
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,602
- -I'm a crustacean expert.
- -[sous chef] This is a prawn.

1497
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:15,852
- [chef] I've been
- sauteing prawns for 30 years

1498
01:12:15,876 --> 01:12:17,083
And I only use butter.

1499
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,810
- -[sous chef] Only butter?
- -[chef] Never oil.

1500
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,227
- I don't give a damn
- about what nutritionists say.

1501
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:23,709
They are the
ruination of cuisine.

1502
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:26,751
Always butter, butter only.

1503
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:28,751
[chef speaking French]

1504
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,957
[in English]

1505
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,459
Where are my prawns?

1506
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:37,936
Who do I have to get

1507
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,375
some prawns around here?

1508
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:41,876
[chef shouts in French]

1509
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:43,959
- [in English] Let's start
- ladling out that soup.

1510
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:47,083
[sous chef] Yes, Chef.

1511
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:48,250
[chef] Are you crying?

1512
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:49,351
There's no crying in my kitchen.

1513
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,542
[gasps]

1514
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:54,417
Chef, this soup
needs some garlic.

1515
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,915
Absolutely no garlic.

1516
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,375
Stringer's orders.

1517
01:12:57,459 --> 01:12:58,918
Grease fire.

1518
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,160
- [sous chef] We got fire
- blankets under those sinks.

1519
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,352
- [chef] Are those my prawns
- that just exploded?

1520
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:06,542
[grunts]

1521
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:10,186
- Forget the prawn, just throw
- some shrimp in there.

1522
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:15,250
- You idiots don't know how...
- [bubbling]

1523
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:18,751
[chuckles]

1524
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:20,603
Someone get me a sharp knife

1525
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:22,417
so that I can kill myself.

1526
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,792
[chef grunts]

1527
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:29,584
Somebody call an exterminator.

1528
01:13:32,918 --> 01:13:36,292
Look, there's my
mother and father.

1529
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:42,459
That's your mother and father?

1530
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:45,500
As I live and breathe.

1531
01:13:45,584 --> 01:13:48,269
- Bruno, I think it's time
- to say hello to your parents.

1532
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,624
Are you mad?

1533
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:50,918
Right here in the bar?

1534
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,834
There's no time
like the present.

1535
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:03,626
[Grandma clears throat]

1536
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:06,876
Excuse me, are you
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?

1537
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:08,959
Can we help you?

1538
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:12,791
I'm afraid I have some,
well, strange news

1539
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,751
about your son, Bruno.

1540
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:16,228
What about Bruno?

1541
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:17,667
Where is he?

1542
01:14:17,751 --> 01:14:19,436
Maybe we can go somewhere

1543
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,167
a bit more private.

1544
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,519
- [Mr. Jenkins] Private?
- Why do we have to be private?

1545
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,709
It's not an easy thing
for him to explain.

1546
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:28,352
- He'd be much more comfortable
- we all went up to your room.

1547
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:29,751
No, no, look here, madam,

1548
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:31,754
- I'm perfectly comfortable
- exactly where I am.

1549
01:14:31,792 --> 01:14:33,561
So, either you tell me

1550
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:33,643
where I can find
Bruno or you just

1551
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:36,167
leave us alone now.

1552
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,959
[Grandma] Well...

1553
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:41,019
- -got him right here.
- -[shrieks]

1554
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,959
That's a mouse! A mouse!

1555
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:45,000
What in God's name
is wrong with you?

1556
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,876
Get that filthy
rodent out of here!

1557
01:14:46,959 --> 01:14:48,417
No, no, no, no. This is Bruno.

1558
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,860
- -Bruno, say something to them.
- -[Mrs. Jenkins screaming]

1559
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:53,353
"Say something"?

1560
01:14:53,377 --> 01:14:54,459
Are you insane?

1561
01:14:54,542 --> 01:14:56,876
Get away from us
before I call the manager.

1562
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,039
- Quit all this hollering.
- This is your son, Bruno.

1563
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,209
Manager! Someone
get me the manager.

1564
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:03,101
- This woman has just scared
- my wife half to death.

1565
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,353
She's walking around

1566
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:05,626
with rats in her handbag.

1567
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,167
[sighs]

1568
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,125
Bruno, why didn't
you say something?

1569
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,977
My father hates it when I talk

1570
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:14,500
with my mouth full.

1571
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:16,584
[Hero] Psst! Grandma.

1572
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:17,751
Down here.

1573
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:19,207
There you are.

1574
01:15:19,231 --> 01:15:20,626
Thank the Lord.

1575
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:21,876
So, how'd it go?

1576
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:24,542
Soup is on.

1577
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:34,918
Look! The pea soup.

1578
01:15:36,459 --> 01:15:39,334
[waiter] Here we
are, garlic free.

1579
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,707
Excuse me, madam,

1580
01:15:43,731 --> 01:15:45,417
may I have a word with you?

1581
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,751
Please, this way.

1582
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,209
Just over here.

1583
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,395
Um... You wouldn't happen

1584
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:56,876
to be carrying around a mouse

1585
01:15:56,959 --> 01:15:58,709
on your person now, would you?

1586
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:00,227
- -A mouse?
- -Mmm-hmm.

1587
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:02,310
- Why on earth would I
- be carrying around a mouse?

1588
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:02,334
Does this have anything to do

1589
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:04,685
with all the rat
traps being set up

1590
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:05,959
all over this hotel?

1591
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:07,334
Rat traps?

1592
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:09,226
- Is this your pathetic idea
- of a smoke screen?

1593
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,144
- Accusing your guests
- of carrying around mice

1594
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:14,102
- To hide the fact that this
- hotel has a mouse infestation.

1595
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:15,709
Shh. No... Shh. What?

1596
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:17,000
I'll tell you this.

1597
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,626
For what this
hotel is costing me,

1598
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:20,292
I better not see a single mouse.

1599
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,209
Not even a tiny, cute one.

1600
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:24,834
Yes, madam. I'm so...

1601
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,292
My mistake. I'm sorry.

1602
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:28,250
Luther.

1603
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,728
- Would you please show
- this lady to our finest table?

1604
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:31,874
Certainly.

1605
01:16:31,898 --> 01:16:32,959
This way.

1606
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:35,811
Apologies,
madam, -I, it's just...

1607
01:16:35,835 --> 01:16:36,835
-[Grandma] Mmm.

1608
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:43,626
Our finest table, madam.

1609
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:46,102
Oh, uh, thank you, Luther.

1610
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:46,185
I'm sure your finest table

1611
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:48,709
in this lovely establishment

1612
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:51,000
is this one right here
next to the kitchen.

1613
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,000
I always prefer a
table near the exit

1614
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:55,542
so I can get out fast.

1615
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,311
- -Of course.
- -[Grandma] Mmm.

1616
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,375
[footsteps approaching]

1617
01:17:16,334 --> 01:17:17,500
[Bruno grunts]

1618
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,686
- [Hero whispers]
- Check it out.

1619
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,667
They love the soup.

1620
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,250
[waiter] Have you decided?

1621
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:37,542
Uh, yes, I think I'll
have the jambalaya.

1622
01:17:37,626 --> 01:17:39,290
Excellent. And would you like

1623
01:17:39,314 --> 01:17:41,000
something to start?

1624
01:17:41,792 --> 01:17:42,959
[Grandma] Mmm...

1625
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,209
Well, that pea soup

1626
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:46,209
those fancy ladies
are eating looks good.

1627
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:47,375
I'll have that.

1628
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:49,227
- I'm sorry.
- That soup is reserved

1629
01:17:49,334 --> 01:17:50,957
Strictly for that group

of lady guests only.

1631
01:17:53,334 --> 01:17:54,810
If I may, that
large party suffers

1632
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:57,584
from a severe garlic allergy.

1633
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:00,269
- So, they have requested their
- soup be prepared garlic free.

1634
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,040
It is very bland.

1635
01:18:02,064 --> 01:18:03,751
Practically inedible.

01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,834
[Grandma] I see.

1638
01:18:06,918 --> 01:18:09,876
That sounds disgusting.

1639
01:18:09,959 --> 01:18:11,332
[waiter] May I suggest

1640
01:18:11,356 --> 01:18:12,751
the Cajun spice crab Creole?

1641
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:15,792
It's one of our
signature dishes.

1642
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:23,500
[Grandma] Uh,

1643
01:18:23,584 --> 01:18:26,584
Uh, the... The shrimp
Creole will be fine.

1644
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:28,417
[waiter] You mean
the crab Creole?

1645
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,584
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.

1646
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,125
[waiter] Very good.

[Grandma] Do I know you?

1653
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:13,042
Many years ago, in
a shabby little town.

right here in Alabama.

You wore pigtails.

1656

And you got away from me.

01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,476

Now I've got you!

[cackles]

1812
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:27,542
What?

1813
01:28:27,626 --> 01:28:29,876
I'm done listening
to your trash talk.

1814
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:32,125
What is this?

1815
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:33,751
[grunting]

1816
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,792
[Grandma chuckles]

1817
01:28:36,876 --> 01:28:38,542
You fool.

1818
01:28:38,626 --> 01:28:40,292
Let me out.

1819
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:42,144
- -[all grunting]
- -Let me out!

1820
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:45,417
Let me out! Let me out!

1821

1822
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:50,101
- [both in sing-song]
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1823
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,876
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1824
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:55,083
I will rip out your tongues.

1825
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,584
Stupid mice.

1826
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,476
- [Mary in sing-song]
- The witch in a bottle...

1827

- -[Grand High Witch] Let me out.
- -Witch in a bottle...

1828
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,769
- [Grand High Witch] Let me out
- of this stupid fish bowl.

1829
01:29:02,876 --> 01:29:04,374
Hey, Grandma, this is the key

1830
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:05,918
to that big trunk.

1831
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,040
That's my key.

1832
01:29:07,064 --> 01:29:08,125
That's my key.

1833
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:10,083
That's my key,
you pea-brain brat.

1834
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,102
- -You pea-brain parasites.
- -Come on, guys.

1835
01:29:12,209 --> 01:29:14,250
Nah, nah... [blows raspberry]

1836
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:16,167
Put your tongue
back in your mouth,

1837
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,459
you filthy sewer guttersnipes.

1838
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:24,626
What are you doing?

1839
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:25,976
- What are you doing?
- That is mine.

1840
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,436
- -[Grandma] Ooh!
- -That's mine.

1841
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:30,500
You idiots. You scoundrels.

1842
01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:31,709
That is a lot of bacon.

1843
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,102
- -Lettuce.
- -Dough.

1844
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:35,459
Hey, you're making
me terribly hungry.

1845
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:36,790
No, get your hands off

1846
01:29:36,814 --> 01:29:38,083
of that, that's mine!

1847
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:41,584
Get your filthy paws
off my filthy lucre.

1848
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,790
I'll poke out your beady eyes.

1849
01:29:43,814 --> 01:29:45,959
What are you looking at?

1850
01:29:46,042 --> 01:29:47,250
What's that, Grandma?

1851
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,125
It's a list of names
and addresses

1852
01:29:51,209 --> 01:29:52,375
of every witch in the world.

1853
01:29:52,459 --> 01:29:53,792
Wow!

1854
01:29:53,876 --> 01:29:56,102
- With that list and that money
- and all this potion,

1855
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:57,644
We could turn every witch

1856
01:29:57,668 --> 01:29:59,125
in the world into rats.

1857
01:29:59,209 --> 01:30:00,709
Excellent!

1858
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:02,560
- [Grand High Witch]
- I'll cut off your tails

1859
01:30:02,584 --> 01:30:04,209
With rusty scissors.

1860
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:08,000
I'll clip your ears
with toenail clippers.

1861
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,626
I'll poke out your beady eyes.

1862
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:14,375
I'll get you for this!

1863
01:30:14,459 --> 01:30:16,709
[Grandma] All right,
kiddies, one hop.

1864
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:18,061

[Grand High Witch]

1869
01:30:29,335 --> 01:30:30,709
No, no, no, don't do that.

1870

[voice shaking]

1871
01:30:32,273 --> 01:30:33,751
What are you doing?

1872
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:35,709
Hades.

1873
01:30:35,792 --> 01:30:37,834
Good pussy.

1874
01:30:37,918 --> 01:30:39,186
-You are a good pussy cat.

-You two have fun now.

1878

-Nice kitty.

1879
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,334
Ah, you stupid, mangy
fleabag. Precious.

1880
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:49,792
Put the books back.

1881
01:30:49,876 --> 01:30:53,876
Stay back, you
stupid, precious...

1882
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:55,542
No! Hades.

1883
01:30:55,626 --> 01:31:00,209
Hades, precious,
remember who feeds you.

1884
01:31:00,292 --> 01:31:01,751
No, don't think about food.

1885
01:31:01,834 --> 01:31:03,977

1888

Grandma, you hear that?

1889
01:31:13,834 --> 01:31:15,268
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1890
01:31:15,292 --> 01:31:16,436
-I didn't hear a thing.

1891
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:17,626
-[Mary giggles]

1892
01:31:18,959 --> 01:31:21,709
Oh! Well, thank you kindly.

1893
01:31:21,792 --> 01:31:24,250
And one for you.

1894
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:26,709
[older Hero] The next morning,

1895
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:28,709
we were feeling
joyful and triumphant.

1896
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:31,375
As a matter of fact,
Grandma was so happy,

1897
01:31:31,459 --> 01:31:33,290
she was spreading her joy

1898
01:31:33,314 --> 01:31:35,167
to the entire hotel staff.

1899
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,918
Thank you kindly for everything.

1900
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,667
One for you.

1901
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:41,626
And one for you.

1902
01:31:41,709 --> 01:31:43,125
Thank you, ma'am.

1903
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:48,143
- [older Hero]
- Bruno tried to explain

1904
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:49,417
The situation to his mom.

1905
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,792
Hello, Mother.

1906
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:54,626
I'm now a mouse.

1907
01:31:55,417 --> 01:31:57,125
[shrieks and gasps]

1908
01:31:57,209 --> 01:31:59,018
- -[Mrs. Jenkins] It's a mouse!
- -[older Hero] But it turned out

1909
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:00,582
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins

1910
01:32:00,606 --> 01:32:02,167
weren't really mouse people.

1911
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,083
So, we decided it would be best

1912
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:06,020
if Bruno came to stay with me,

1913
01:32:06,044 --> 01:32:07,918
Grandma, and Daisy.

1914
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:12,667
[all whooping and cheering]

1915
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:26,751
[Bruno] Faster, faster!

1916
01:32:26,834 --> 01:32:28,459
[Mary squealing]

1917
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,042
[laughing]

[all screaming happily]

1919
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:39,000
Here we go!

1920
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,083
[laughing and cheering]

1921
01:32:42,209 --> 01:32:43,459
Whee!

1922
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:44,790
-Cool!

1923
01:32:44,814 --> 01:32:46,083
-Whoo-hoo!

1924
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:48,790
[Mary] How's my hair look?

1925
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:50,292
How's my hair?

1926
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:53,918
[laughs] Whoo-hoo!

1927
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:56,959
Whoo-hoo!

1928
01:32:57,042 --> 01:32:58,685
- -Let's go again, y'all.
- -[Grandma chuckles]

1929
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:00,834
[Bruno] This time
I sit in the front.

1930
01:33:00,918 --> 01:33:03,584
Grandma, I love being a mouse.

1931
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:05,459
Oh, I believe you do.

1932
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:06,902
But you wanna know
something weird?

1933
01:33:06,959 --> 01:33:08,876
I still feel just like a boy.

1934
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,375
[Grandma] But you are, darling.

1935
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:12,209
Life changes all of us.

1936
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:13,334
I mean, look at me.

1937
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:15,000
I'm getting on up in the years,

1938
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,500
but I still feel like a girl.

1939
01:33:17,584 --> 01:33:19,792
And I still feel like a boy.

1940
01:33:19,876 --> 01:33:21,500
See?

1941
01:33:21,584 --> 01:33:22,959
You get it.

1942
01:33:23,042 --> 01:33:25,834
Never give up
what you are inside.

1943
01:33:25,918 --> 01:33:28,416
When I look at you, I don't

1944
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,959
see whiskers and a pink nose.

1945
01:33:31,042 --> 01:33:33,167
I just see your eyes.

1946
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,792
Bright and beautiful.

1947
01:33:38,042 --> 01:33:42,542
Grandma, how long
does a mouse live?

1948
01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:44,624
Oh, an ordinary mouse

1949
01:33:44,648 --> 01:33:46,667
only lives about three years,

1950
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:48,728
but you're no ordinary mouse.

1951
01:33:48,752 --> 01:33:48,810
You're a mouse-person,
and a mouse-person

1952
01:33:48,834 --> 01:33:51,375
will almost certainly live

1953
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,876
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse.

1954
01:33:53,959 --> 01:33:55,542
Maybe even longer.

1955
01:33:55,626 --> 01:33:57,042
That's great news.

1956
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,727
I couldn't stand being

1957
01:33:58,751 --> 01:34:00,375
looked after by anybody else.

1958
01:34:00,459 --> 01:34:01,852
I'll be a very old
mouse and you'll be

1959
01:34:01,876 --> 01:34:03,709
a very old grandmother,

1960
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:06,000
and we'll both die together.

1961
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,209
With a little luck, darling.

1962
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,248
But no one knows how long

1963
01:34:11,272 --> 01:34:13,250
their time is on this earth.

1964
01:34:13,334 --> 01:34:15,792
Only God knows that answer.

1965
01:34:18,626 --> 01:34:22,834
And that is the
natural order of things.

1966
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:24,352
- [older Hero]
- Daisy, Bruno, and I

1967
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,459
Loved living with Grandma.

1968
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:29,584
We were one big, happy family.

[disco music playing]

01:34:50,876 --> 01:34:52,459
[camera shutter clicks]

1971
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:36,518
- [older Hero] Where were we?
- Oh, yeah. That's right.

1972
01:35:36,542 --> 01:35:37,918
So, here we are,

1973
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,626
ready to carry on the fight.

1974
01:35:41,709 --> 01:35:44,334
[all] Carry on the fight!

1975
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:46,394
Over the years, we have turned

1976
01:35:46,418 --> 01:35:46,476
and mouse-afied
every damnable witch

1977
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,584
in these United States.

1978
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:51,417
[kids cheering]

1979
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:54,292
So, we are gathered
here to take our battle

1980
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:56,250
to the entire world.

1981

01:35:58,292 --> 01:35:59,873
-You have your names, correct?

1983
01:35:59,897 --> 01:36:01,500
-[kids] Yes, sir.

1984
01:36:01,584 --> 01:36:02,959
[older Hero] Your addresses?

1985

[kids] Yes, sir.

1986
01:36:04,417 --> 01:36:08,209
And your Number 86
Mouse Maker potion?

1987
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:10,915
[kids] Yes, sir. Number 86

1988
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:13,584
Mouse Maker potion, sir.

1989
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:17,811
Let's get out there
and give those witches

1990
01:36:17,835 --> 01:36:20,417
a taste of their own medicine.

1991
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:28,167
[kids cheering]

1992
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,667
[Grandma laughing]

1993
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:36,042
[sighs]

1994
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:41,584
So, you ready for
this mission, old-timer?

1995
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:45,209
Grandma, I've never
been more ready.
