Yes.

00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:02,687
How did you correct a complete

378
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,647
Well, I didn't correct it.

379
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,107
He couldn't walk.

380
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,609
I convinced him that he could.

381
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,694
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

382
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,738
When you reattach a severed nerve...

383
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,282
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

384
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,366
It's the cells.

385
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,035
The cells are only programmed...

386
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,162
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

387
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,246
Right.

388
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,832
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

389
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,169
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

390

cellular regeneration.

is your treatment?

about healing through belief?

in ways you can't imagine...

424
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:54,924
you reject the possibility.

425
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,510
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

about chakras or energy...

427

you see through me, do you?

It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.
