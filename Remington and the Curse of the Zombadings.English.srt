1
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,458
Homo?

2
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,875
Homo! Homo!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,041
Discipline your child!

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,041
Hi, Fe!

5
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,750
Homo, homo, homo!

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,583
Homo…

7
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,291
Homo…

8
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,750
Child, you may begin your confession.

9
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,666
Shouldn't you be the one confessing?

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,041
What do you mean?

11
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,208
You're a homo.

12
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,041
Homo, homo, homo…

13
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,250
Quiet, don't say that!

14
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,083
Homo, homo, homo…

15
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,208
You're a homo!

16
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,791
Homo, homo, homo…

17
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:21,750
Remington, I told you to stop doing that!

18
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,083
A homo, all right.

19
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,375
Homo, homo, homo!

20
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,416
Homo, homo, homo!

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,083
Yes,

22
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,750
I am gay.

23
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,333
Always have been, always will be.

24
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,375
But you little brat…

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,333
you will turn gay

26
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,416
when you grow up!

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,625
Make way! I said stand aside!

28
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,291
Are you laughing at me?
You want me to arrest you?

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,083
Cordon off the area
for evidence collection.

30
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,333
Another Diana Rose?

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,333
Gay.

32
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:08,125
If you want us to catch the killer,

33
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,708
please cooperate with the investigation.

34
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:16,750
When you find a victim, call the police,
not your neighbors.

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,208
How did she die?

36
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,291
Murder.

37
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,791
Keep the crime scene intact. That's basic!

38
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,625
I've never seen a dead body before.

39
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,833
I've seen a lot.

40
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,916
All kinds. There's homicide,
suicide, parricide, pesticide…

41
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,083
Kidding.

42
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,416
My mom's a cop.

43
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,708
Really?

44
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,708
I know, right?

45
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,833
Cool.

46
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,791
I've seen a lot of corpses, too.

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,125
Victims of lung cancer,
skin cancer, bone cancer…

48
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,291
Social cancer.

49
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,666
Kidding.

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,500
My father's an oncologist.

51
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,500
You're not from around here.

52
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,958
Yes, I am.

53
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,458
By the way, my name is…

54
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,625
Remington!

55
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,916
Jigs!

56
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,916
Remington?

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,708
You're Remington?

58
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,958
Yup. Have you heard of me?

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,458
Hang on.

60
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,458
Miss! Wait up…

61
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,625
You know her?

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,333
She's Montano's daughter.

63
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,416
Montano?

64
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,666
Let's go.

65
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,666
She rode in my taxi the other day.

66
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,958
-What did your mom say?
-About what?

67
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,416
-The murders. Is there a suspect?
-Nope.

68
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,833
Who's the victim?

69
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,083
Janet Jacksonia.

70
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,291
Fuck…

71
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,541
Why? Were you two dating?

72
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,625
No way!

73
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,708
Drinks at Tabel's tonight.

74
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,416
There's also a party at Kevin’s.

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,541
Great!

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,541
Watch the road, you shitheads!

77
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,166
Too bad we missed!

78
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,791
That's her house.

79
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,875
Whose house?

80
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,041
The girl you were talking to a while ago.

81
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,708
Pass it to me.

82
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,458
Shoot!

83
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,875
Dude?

84
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,166
Dude, did you see that?

85
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,916
I did! That was solid.

86
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,416
You okay?

87
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,875
I don't mean the ball.
The thing that was flying…

88
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,250
Drink up.

89
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,958
Is this your birthday blowout?

90
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,541
That's on the 21st.

91
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,791
Cool, your 21st birthday is on the 21st.

92
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,625
That's right.

93
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,208
Hey! Are you drinking or not?

94
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,875
Hey, handsome lads.

95
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:22,958
Present!

96
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,541
Mang Biyo!

97
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,041
Any of you want a job?

98
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,750
We're quite busy.

99
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,458
I'm a few hands short.

100
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,083
The job doesn't require any brains,
which means you're all perfect.

101
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,541
Rearranging furniture
and cleaning the house is all it is.

102
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,416
Have a shot with us, sir.

103
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,125
There's nothing for me
in this nest of lazy drunkards.

104
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,583
Might as well go back to Mrs. Montano's.

105
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,583
Mrs. Montano?

106
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,958
Yes, why?

107
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,625
The one with a teenage daughter?

108
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,666
You mean Hannah.

109
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,750
Hannah…

110
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,916
An only child.
She just got back from Manila.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,625
I'm in. Jigs and I are up for it.

112
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,416
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,625
Okay. Be there at 8:00 a.m.

114
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,166
Easy on the alcohol, don't be late.

115
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,416
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

116
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,833
Second round…

117
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,750
What about the bike?

118
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,000
Do the night shift.

119
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,708
Not enough bikes at night.

120
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,750
I'll be your co-pilot.

121
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,708
Wait for me!

122
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,416
I have to go home!

123
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,375
Be there tomorrow.

124
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,125
Why? Benedict…

125
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,791
My child!

126
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,333
Sir!

127
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,333
Ma'am!

128
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,875
What?

129
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm here.

130
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,833
I know.

131
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,125
Lieutenant Martinez,

132
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,208
you have no witness…

133
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,250
no suspect…

134
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,333
no lead.

135
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,958
Yes, sir.

136
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,208
Wow, wow, wow…

137
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,875
Five salons have closed down.

138
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,916
You can see what that's doing 
to my hair, right?

139
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,125
Besides being kind, our gays…

140
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,166
Where is Councilor Saliendra?

141
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,875
On an emergency family reunion in Davao.

142
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,291
What about Engineer Saludes?

143
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,458
The subscriber cannot be reached, sir.

144
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,875
Please try your call later, sir.

145
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,833
Confirmed. They're all conQUEERmed.

146
00:11:55,666 --> 00:12:00,083
Mayor, it would help a lot
if you approved my budget request.

147
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,500
It's been pending since 1999.

148
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,291
My God, you ask for it like it was candy.

149
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,750
Okay.

150
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
500 pesos! Reload.

151
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,208
Get it from Mutya on your way out.

152
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,083
Georgia, you might be the next victim.

153
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,125
Stupid!

154
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,958
My boss is a cop.

155
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,333
She'll catch that killer.

156
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,375
And he'll rot in jail.

157
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,208
Looking sharp!

158
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,833
Going out on a date?

159
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,583
Introduce me, okay?

160
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,916
-Of course!
-Hey, bro.

161
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
Come in, come in.

162
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,750
Morning.

163
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,041
Hey, guys, Remington’s got a hot date.

164
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,041
Awesome!

165
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:15,916
That's good news.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,083
Gotta run.

167
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,958
Make me proud, son!

168
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,041
He's a good kid.

169
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,375
Yeah, he is.

170
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,291
Hey, this was your idea,
so put in some work.

171
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,750
Just finding my groove.

172
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,291
Are you cold or something?

173
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,541
Careful, please!

174
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,958
Mang Biyo, take a break.

175
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,791
Hannah.

176
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,708
Not bad.

177
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,333
Hannah!

178
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,833
Thank you for the snack. It was delicious.

179
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,333
Did you cook it?

180
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,666
Your mother did.

181
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,375
Why is she always in black?

182
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,625
Is she in mourning? Who died?

183
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,500
My father.

184
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,916
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,333
That's why I came back.

186
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,250
Remember my dad?

187
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,333
The one you called "homo"?

188
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,583
Me? Why would I do that?

189
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,666
Well, it's true anyway.

190
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,750
Give this to Mang Biyo.

191
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,166
Are we okay now?

192
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,833
I can show you around,
so you don't get bored.

193
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,458
You didn't recognize him?

194
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,541
It was dark and his face was covered.

195
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,500
The serial killer!

196
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,041
Have you told your mom?

197
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,500
Come in!

198
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,416
Hurry up.

199
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,375
He had a tattoo on his chest.

200
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,875
A tattoo of what?

201
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,125
Mimi!

202
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,541
What are you doing there?

203
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,750
But this is the last batch, Chief.

204
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,750
Get out, all of you.

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,125
Faster.

206
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,208
Did you tell your dad?

207
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:14,916
Son…

208
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,666
is there something you want to tell me?

209
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,000
-Are you gay?
-Mom!

210
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,291
It's not the serial killer
who attacked you.

211
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,750
How can you be so sure?

212
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,666
So far, all his victims are gay.

213
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,500
Besides, the cuts on your body,
that's not how he operates.

214
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,416
Maybe it was…

215
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,583
Maybe it was…

216
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,333
-a drug addict.
-a drug addict.

217
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,708
Remington…

218
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,916
what do you plan to do after the summer?

219
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,750
After the holidays?

220
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,333
I'll help out at the store.

221
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,375
Is that what you really want?

222
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Don't you want to go back to school?

223
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,708
Your aunt's offer is still good.

224
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,625
Dad doesn't want it.

225
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,208
You're not a boy anymore.

226
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,500
Anyway, Manila's too crowded and polluted.

227
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,708
You want me to get--

228
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,500
Lung cancer. I've heard that one before.

229
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,500
Besides, what good
will it do me going there?

230
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,416
I'm okay with being here.

231
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,000
It's your life.

232
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,083
I'll close up and wait for you here.

233
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,708
Sorry, we're closed.

234
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,250
Just a trim?

235
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,083
Hey, nice ring tone!

236
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,250
Gay identified.

237
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,416
You brought your own hair dryer?
Looks fab.

238
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,208
But I have lots of those here.

239
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,041
Besides, that's for later.

240
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,041
Let's go.

241
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,208
Jigs, do you think we know the killer?

242
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,500
Maybe he's from around here.

243
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,041
Hey, where are we?

244
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,875
What's up?

245
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,375
Something happened to Tonya.

246
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,666
Where's Remington?

247
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,416
He left already.

248
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
He told me to wait.

249
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,583
Where are we?

250
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,708
Who are you?

251
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,291
What do you want?

252
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,333
Hey, you!

253
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,541
I haven't got time for this.

254
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,416
Mang Biyo said you were having your house
decorated for the holiday.

255
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,250
Didn't he tell you?
There's no work here today.

256
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,875
The stores ran out of pink streamers.

257
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,958
Mom said why not do
the entire house in black?

258
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,125
Incredible.

259
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:22,666
Where'd all your stuff go?
You could skate in here.

260
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:35,083
Mom doesn't want to see anything
that reminds her of Dad.

261
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,666
Yet she goes on living here.

262
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,458
She doesn’t want to leave.

263
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,125
That's why I had to come back.

264
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,375
Bad trip. Fucking shit.

265
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,791
What am I supposed to do in this town?

266
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,166
Nothing happens here.

267
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,416
Everything's in slow motion.

268
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,958
And everyone likes to stare.

269
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,500
What’s your plan then?

270
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:10,333
I'll finish my degree.
Then, start a business.

271
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,333
I'll turn the downstairs
into a dorm for students.

272
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,125
No, a billiard hall is better!

273
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,375
A hangout for bums,
no shortage of those here.

274
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,041
Ouch!

275
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,333
Okay, bye.

276
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,583
Hannah, wait.

277
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:30,708
What is it?

278
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,791
I like your makeup!

279
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,875
I mean--

280
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,750
I know.

281
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:42,916
You really think it's okay?

282
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,708
You betcha!

283
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,250
Girl, you look fantabulous!

284
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,791
Remington.

285
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,791
Good morning, ma’am.

286
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,083
Well, same to you.

287
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,125
There's no work here today.

288
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,375
Yes, ma'am…

289
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:23,833
Hannah told me.

290
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,541
I didn't know you were so funny.

291
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,500
Must dash!

292
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,791
I have to mind the store.

293
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:38,375
Popsie might go Rambo, bang-bang. Bang!

294
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,125
I didn't get anything he said,

295
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,750
but I liked the sound of it.

296
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,833
Must dash…

297
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,583
Remington.

298
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,958
Mom's cooking a yummy afternoon snack.

299
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,875
Drop back in for some, okay?

300
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,916
Hey, isn't that Georgia's shirt?

301
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,458
Whoopsie-daisy.

302
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,625
What's wrong with him?

303
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,458
I bet you kept him up late.

304
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,875
Remington, what's the matter with you?

305
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:32,916
Sink.

306
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:35,125
Mirror.

307
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,500
Towel.

308
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,083
Bucket.

309
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:43,750
Toilet.

310
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:52,833
Door-othy!

311
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,750
Serviette.

312
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,375
Farrah Fawcett.

313
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,750
Sink or swim.

314
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,958
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

315
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,083
Bouquet.

316
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,458
John Holmes of Flushing, Queens!

317
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,625
Oh, no!

318
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,416
Fucky, sucky, yucky!

319
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,041
Holiday's almost here.

320
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,666
After the holiday,
another school year starts.

321
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,750
Maybe it's time you let Remington
go to Manila to finish school.

322
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,458
He can stay with his aunt.

323
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,250
I never said he couldn't go.

324
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,125
He's the one who doesn't want to go.

325
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:52,416
He's afraid they'll make him a house boy.

326
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:53,833
And besides,

327
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,625
he doesn't want to get lung cancer.

328
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,791
Where was I?

329
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,666
ConQUEERmed!

330
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,666
To all you gays, homos,
fags, fairies, queers, queens,

331
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,708
and last but not least,

332
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,666
those still in the closet,

333
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,750
go easy on the cruising!

334
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:39,708
It's safer to do it in groups,
like orgies? Just kidding!

335
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:46,583
If you have any information
that could help us catch the killer,

336
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,083
please do not hesitate to call us.

337
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:55,750
You know what,
beauty pageants were made for women.

338
00:28:55,833 --> 00:29:00,625
But they're really
for the pleasure of us, men.

339
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:03,166
You got that right.

340
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,541
Sometimes, though,
they can be quite amusing.

341
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,166
-Who?
-The homos and their pageants.

342
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,625
Why amusing?

343
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,375
The question and answer round!

344
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,166
Like, for example?

345
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,791
I don't remember. But they crack me up.

346
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,333
Because they’re hideous!

347
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,041
Hey you, this conversation
is only for real men.

348
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,208
Remington! How are you?

349
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,666
Have a shot.

350
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,916
Drink up, son!

351
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,875
That’s more like it!

352
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,583
A chip off the old block, right?

353
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:40,166
Son, we're drinking at Berting's tonight.

354
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,708
Join us, okay?

355
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,583
Surely Temple!

356
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,125
What?

357
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,208
Don't be afraid, Isko.

358
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,916
We've kept your identity a secret.

359
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:12,333
What can you tell me about that night?

360
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,125
Tonya and I were supposed to meet
at her salon.

361
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,916
A gray Mitsubishi Lancer sedan.

362
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,416
Remember anything else?

363
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,250
That's it, Ma'am Fe.

364
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,875
The gun that he used, I've seen it before.

365
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:51,875
Where?

366
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:58,166
My classmate Ernesto Manansala
invented it.

367
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,500
Ernesto…

368
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,833
relax.

369
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,750
Do you remember your thesis project?

370
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,333
The thing you invented, it can tell
if a goat is gay and will not mate?

371
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,750
Ernesto…

372
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,791
the gaydar.

373
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:30,166
I lost it.

374
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,208
What does the gaydar do?

375
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,916
It can detect homosexuality in animals.

376
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:49,041
Unfortunately, there was
a fatal accident with the goat I tested.

377
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,000
Once I fix the animal gaydar,

378
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:56,041
it will help improve
the productivity of cattle raisers.

379
00:31:56,583 --> 00:32:03,125
And gay animals will be
put to better use as pets,

380
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,500
or they can work as models
for commercials.

381
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:16,083
Homosexuality exists
in all animal species.

382
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,791
It was by accident
that I discovered the correlation

383
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,500
of the biochemical properties

384
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:27,041
of homosexual animals
to the electron-based discharge of the--

385
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,166
Ernesto.

386
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,791
What happened?

387
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,666
I don't know.

388
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,666
You're nothing but a…

389
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,000
Mimi!

390
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,791
Where is the gaydar?

391
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,375
It was stolen.

392
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,708
Next he takes off his pants.

393
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:52,791
She goes…

394
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,166
But when he removed his briefs,

395
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,625
she says, "What's that, the wick?"

396
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,250
Wick! I thought
you were going to say "dick!"

397
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,958
What's this?

398
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,166
Hey, Suarez,
are you going to perm my hair?

399
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,750
It's so girly.

400
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,958
Gay identified.

401
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,750
Who's gay?

402
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,625
Gay identified.

403
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,375
Berting is a faggot.

404
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,958
You're the killer?

405
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,375
We are.

406
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,125
Remington…

407
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:35,291
your mom will get upset
if she sees your room this messy.

408
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,583
-Son, I have a…
-Dad, I have a…

409
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:54,750
-Go ahead…
-Go ahead…

410
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,583
Don't worry about me.

411
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,416
What's bothering you?

412
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,916
Nothing. Forget about it.

413
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,291
Another Diana Rose.

414
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,916
It's Berting.

415
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:35,458
The tapioca vendor
who just separated from his wife.

416
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,750
This means that…

417
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,041
He's confirmed.

418
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,708
Poor Berting.

419
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:48,250
Just when he was starting
to enjoy his life.

420
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:57,625
Ma'am, I've got the list
of gray Lancer sedan owners.

421
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,500
What are you doing here?

422
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,416
My dad threw me out.

423
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,666
Your mom let me in.

424
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,833
You were already sleeping.

425
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:54,916
Damn you!

426
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,666
You don't want me sleeping here?

427
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,250
It's not that.

428
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,833
You frightened me.

429
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,750
I had a fight with my dad.

430
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,750
Damn it, too much drama!

431
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,083
Jigs…

432
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,416
I also have a problem.

433
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,708
Someone is after me. Like death!

434
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,208
What?

435
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,291
Nothing!

436
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Bro, is there a problem?

437
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,416
That's what I'm trying to say!

438
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:52,291
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

439
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,666
Can I sleep over again tonight?

440
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm still at war with my dad.

441
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,791
Okay if I sleep next to you again?

442
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,000
What do you say, bro?

443
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,250
Wait for me while I go park.

444
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,250
Okay.

445
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,791
-Is Mang Biyo here?
-He's not here yet.

446
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:15,125
Have a bite with us.

447
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,458
Are you sure it's okay?

448
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,125
Food's here, time for a break.

449
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:22,083
Come on, join us.

450
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,250
Hey, Remington!

451
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:27,041
So hot!

452
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,041
I should go.

453
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,958
I have… things to do.

454
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,041
Bye!

455
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,041
Remington!

456
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Remington!

457
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,083
Hannah…

458
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,458
How are you?

459
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:20,458
I missed you.

460
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,541
For real?

461
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,500
-Really, I did.
-Why?

462
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,666
Why?

463
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:32,833
You make me feel so much…

464
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,166
Already?

465
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,333
Tell me where you got the love potion.

466
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,750
Why is Hannah acting so sweet
all of sudden?

467
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,541
You're almost in her pants.

468
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:30,041
My God, Jigs. Show some respect for women!

469
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,333
You really have a problem.

470
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,416
Let's eat, it's on me.

471
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,333
Wait!

472
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,958
Remember when we used to jump over there?

473
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,416
To see who could go higher.

474
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,833
One time, you ran smack into a buffalo.

475
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,750
I had to carry you all the way
to your house.

476
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:55,458
Remember?

477
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,791
We were in grade school.

478
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,000
Why so quiet?

479
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,083
Nothing.

480
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:11,666
I think we were in fifth grade…

481
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:19,958
Where are you going?

482
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,291
I can't stand it anymore.

483
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,083
-The store?
-No, stupid!

484
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,833
Hey, nice bag!

485
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,416
Thanks, I got it cheap.

486
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
It's a winner.

487
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,166
You understand me?

488
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,458
Of course.
Remington, I don't want to die yet.

489
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,708
What's wrong, girl?

490
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:40,083
Look closely.

491
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,833
I'm gay! One look at me and you know.

492
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,666
Remington, they're killing the gays
in this town.

493
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,833
I'm out of here.

494
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,125
-Goodbye, Remington.
-Wait, Georgia!

495
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:56,166
Please stay.

496
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:57,833
What?

497
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,666
I need you.

498
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,125
You do?

499
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,458
You're the only one who understands me.

500
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,166
Really?

501
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,000
I've got a problem.

502
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,958
There's this guy that's been haunting me.

503
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:27,125
He's got a nice body, but no face.

504
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:31,583
First he shaved off
all the hair on my body.

505
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,791
Then he literally
tied my tongue in a knot.

506
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:39,541
And then he did something
to my heart, so now…

507
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:44,125
I'm falling for my best friend!

508
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,791
I don't know what to do next.

509
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,916
You know what?

510
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,458
It'd be a pity if you turned gay.
You're too handsome!

511
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,291
Girl!

512
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,916
The gay community will not approve!

513
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,916
I don't care!

514
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,833
Girl, help me!

515
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,250
I know.

516
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:13,666
What?

517
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,916
-I know!
-What?

518
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,583
Mr. Faith Healer,

519
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,458
tell us what to do.

520
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:31,416
It's not me you want.

521
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,291
I'm just the assistant.

522
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,875
Looking for me?

523
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,416
Hi, love!

524
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,541
Leave us alone for a minute, okay?

525
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,166
I know him!

526
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,333
He put a curse on me
when I was a little boy.

527
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,416
Shush!

528
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,625
You need to find him.

529
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,666
They're the beauty pageant contestants.

530
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,750
Why are they doing the photo shoot here?

531
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,791
The pageant's motif is ancestral homes.

532
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,041
That's why they're here.

533
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:50,833
Such nonsense.

534
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,500
They're all so lovely.

535
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,208
No way. You're lovelier by far.

536
00:46:58,666 --> 00:46:59,500
Really?

537
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,250
Hey, Sandy! Where were you?

538
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,333
Do you play?

539
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:09,041
No.

540
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,833
I think you do.

541
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,333
Look at those fingers, long like candles.

542
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,458
Flatterer.

543
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,875
My dad used to tell me

544
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:23,083
people with fingers like candles
should play the piano.

545
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,000
He said mine looked like they had
candlewax dripped all over them.

546
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,583
Sit.

547
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,708
That's all I know.

548
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:57,666
I knew you could play.

549
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,458
You call that playing?

550
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,583
We used to have a piano.

551
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,291
So you took lessons.

552
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,750
No. I got scared.

553
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,458
When the teacher came,

554
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,541
I ran.

555
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,708
Why did you do that?

556
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:30,916
What for?

557
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:34,791
I was wrong about you.

558
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,791
I thought boys were all the same.

559
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,041
Turns out you're different.

560
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,666
Hannah.

561
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,625
Even the way you talk is different.

562
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:46,083
But most of all you make my mom happy,

563
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:48,166
and that makes me happy.

564
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,708
Hannah, I have to tell you something.

565
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Jigs, eat!

566
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,250
Come, dear, join them.

567
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,041
Take my picture with the contestants.

568
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,625
I think I know what it is.

569
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,708
My answer is yes!

570
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,458
It's not that, it's not that!

571
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,250
It's just that…

572
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,375
I feel different.

573
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,750
I am changing.

574
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:28,958
What?

575
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:34,916
I won't keep it from you any longer.

576
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:37,333
I'm falling for…

577
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,416
Jigs.

578
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,375
Jigs?

579
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,416
Yes!

580
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:54,041
Would you believe me
if I told you I was cursed?

581
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,166
For real?

582
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:01,833
Bring it on!

583
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,833
Good, you're home.

584
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,583
Jigs, can I borrow your bike?

585
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:30,291
Where are you going? I'll take you.

586
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,333
No.

587
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:34,166
I don't want you mixed up in this.

588
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,333
Stop it!

589
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,833
We're friends!

590
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,583
Nothing's gonna change that!

591
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,166
Okay, fine!

592
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,916
You're obviously not drunk.

593
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,666
I lied to you.

594
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,458
About what?

595
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,833
I'm not a virgin.

596
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,458
Hello! I know that.

597
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,583
With gays.

598
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,041
It's not true
that I don't do it with them.

599
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,166
Why didn't you tell me?

600
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,208
I know you.

601
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,250
You'd think I was gross.

602
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,083
Then I find out…

603
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,666
You're also hiding something from me.

604
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,541
What are you talking about?

605
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:41,375
How long have you been in love with me?

606
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,416
Why did you keep it from me?

607
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,958
Did you think I'd be grossed out?

608
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,750
That I'd laugh at you?

609
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,416
Avoid you?

610
00:52:57,916 --> 00:52:59,833
If I was okay doing it with others…

611
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,750
Then why not with you?

612
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,041
-Come here.
-Jigs!

613
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,625
Are you done?

614
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:35,541
Can't do it.

615
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,125
You might go next.

616
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,625
What do you mean?

617
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,083
I mean, die.

618
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:51,375
Who'll die?

619
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:52,375
You!

620
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:53,958
If I ever…

621
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,250
You're the killer?

622
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,125
No!

623
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,833
Janet Jacksonia,

624
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:06,791
Tonya,

625
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:09,708
and even Mang Berting.

626
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,291
You had sex with them?

627
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,375
Yes!

628
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:16,083
Before they were killed.

629
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,916
Sorry, bro!

630
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:25,166
That was close!

631
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:45,791
SAINT ISIDORE THE FARMER

632
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:11,541
Berting was all over him.

633
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,541
Doesn't that thing ever run out of power?

634
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,166
Where's your faggot?

635
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,583
You mean Georgia?

636
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,916
He took off all of a sudden.

637
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,291
You must have warned him.

638
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,916
I made a deal with you, remember?

639
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,625
I'll go along with you
if you leave Georgia alone.

640
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:46,708
But why do this?
Why do you hate gays so much?

641
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,541
Don't you?

642
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,416
Sometimes.

643
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:54,666
When Georgia is being hard-headed.

644
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,375
Gays are insidious.

645
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:06,083
They slowly erode our…

646
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:28,375
…to protect our country…

647
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:34,625
our youth, our future!

648
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:38,750
Where are you off to?

649
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,958
Next town…

650
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,833
-Hannah's.
-Who?

651
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,875
To Hannah's place.

652
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,083
Cool. This one’s a real playboy.

653
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,000
Just like his father.

654
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,541
Where's the booze?

655
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,208
Let's get some.

656
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:56,750
Gay identified.

657
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,666
Gay… Gay…

658
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,166
Gay… Gay…

659
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:08,291
Identity… confused!

660
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,125
Are we looking for a dead person?

661
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,041
BORN 1917, DIED 1986
R.I.P.

662
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,458
It's clean.

663
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,625
Someone's taking good care of it.

664
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:41,375
This is where I saw him! He was crying.

665
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:42,833
Who?

666
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,791
The person who put a curse on him!

667
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,041
Look.

668
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:56,250
Let me.

669
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,833
Excuse us!

670
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,083
Do you know
who visits this grave regularly?

671
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,791
Yes,

672
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,708
the person most beloved
by the deceased, Pops Ricafuerte.

673
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:11,291
Gay?

674
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,000
A really good person.

675
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,333
Do you know where we can find him?

676
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,750
Young people!

677
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:04,625
How can I be of help?

678
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,041
We're here…

679
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:11,833
Do you remember me?

680
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:37,041
I was little then.

681
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,208
Sorry, kid.

682
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,458
I don't know you.

683
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,375
I'm the boy you cursed.

684
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,666
Cursed?

685
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,666
I've never done such a thing!

686
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,041
Think hard.

687
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:58,875
You said I'd turn gay when I grew up.

688
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,541
I said that?

689
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,416
I don't remember that.

690
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,166
You may leave.

691
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:13,458
Hang on.

692
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:15,333
Remington, wait.

693
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:24,250
It’s you! You cursed me!

694
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,208
You're the homo!

695
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:28,541
Homo! Homo! Homo!

696
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,083
Yes! It was I who cursed you.

697
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:33,708
You stupid brat!

698
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:57,750
Tell me how to get rid of the curse.

699
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:58,958
Tell me!

700
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,333
That hurts!

701
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:05,333
Okay, okay!

702
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,041
I don't know.

703
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:14,833
Wait!

704
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:16,708
I don't know how to reverse it,

705
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:19,375
but we can talk to the spirit.

706
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:43,208
Hold hands.

707
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,708
Repeat after me.

708
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:59,208
Mischievous spirit, appear.

709
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:05,583
Mischievous spirit, appear.

710
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,541
Make your presence felt here, now.

711
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:13,750
Make your presence felt here, now.

712
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:17,041
We do not fear you.

713
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:20,708
We do not fear you.

714
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:24,041
Or your unfortunate face.

715
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,375
Or your unfortunate face.

716
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:37,125
Mischievous spirit, appear.

717
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:40,666
Mischievous spirit, appear.

718
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,708
Make your presence felt here, now.

719
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:47,291
Make your presence felt here, now.

720
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,458
We do not fear you.

721
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:53,125
We do not fear you.

722
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:56,875
Or your unfortunate face.

723
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,833
Or your unfortunate face.

724
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,625
Don't let go.

725
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:56,833
You're almost there…
I can smell you already.

726
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:00,541
Do not let go of his hand!

727
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,583
You won't get Remington!

728
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,541
Can we get rid of the curse?

729
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,291
Only if a real man agrees to turn gay.

730
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:12,333
A virgin who hasn't tried gay sex.

731
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,250
I hope you find your replacement.

732
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,833
I hope so, too.

733
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:39,458
We'll come back
if we have any more questions, okay?

734
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,000
Faggots.

735
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:44,666
Uncle Suarez?

736
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,708
I pity your father.

737
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:51,291
-What a waste. A waste!
-The nerve!

738
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:54,083
Who do you think you are?

739
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:56,458
Get off my property!

740
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,375
You're the killer!

741
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,833
Remington, let's go!

742
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,000
Faster!

743
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:21,583
I'm going as fast as I can!

744
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,500
Do you see that?

745
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:30,833
What is it?

746
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:35,916
Up there!

747
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,916
Oh, no!

748
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,208
Remington, calm down!

749
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,416
There's still time!

750
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,750
-There's still time!
-No…

751
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,875
Where's the birthday boy?

752
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,458
I've been texting, but he hasn’t replied.

753
01:06:58,583 --> 01:06:59,875
Where do I put these?

754
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:01,791
Anywhere.

755
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:06,166
Those of you who have fallen
to that wicked gun…

756
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:11,750
wake up, wake up!

757
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:18,041
And let those murderers…

758
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:22,125
meet your sweet revenge.

759
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,916
Son of a bitch!

760
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,625
That hurt!

761
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:03,875
Snap out of it!

762
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,208
We're out of time.

763
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,125
Let's get this straight.

764
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,125
Someone has to switch places
with Remington and turn gay?

765
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
That's right.

766
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:14,375
And that person will start liking boys?

767
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,625
And stop liking girls?

768
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,375
We're forgetting something.

769
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:23,416
My replacement has to be a virgin.

770
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,250
Who among you have
no sexual experience with gays?

771
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,416
Odie and Juno.

772
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,333
Nothing wrong with being gay.

773
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,208
Uncle Elmo sent me to school.

774
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,416
I screwed up, though,
so now he's sending my sister.

775
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:51,958
Good thing he's not here,

776
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,291
it's dangerous.

777
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,875
Yeah, they're all right.

778
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,416
I'm in. I'm okay with it.

779
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You are?

780
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,208
Go through with it, bro.

781
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:07,291
I will still be here for you
when you're gay.

782
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,166
They have a point.

783
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,833
Remington.

784
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,375
Listen to me. You're not gay.

785
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,541
Snap out of it. We can fight this.

786
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:22,291
Thanks, but…

787
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,083
Girl, I'm tired.

788
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,791
None of us wanted this,

789
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,541
but what can we do?

790
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,750
Time to move on, okay?

791
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,791
No.

792
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,708
You don't deserve to be called gay.

793
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:36,791
The gays I know,

794
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:40,458
they know how to put up a fight.

795
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,333
Some of them fight all their lives.

796
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:45,958
But you…

797
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:49,291
You just do what's easy for you.

798
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:53,125
Even if it means giving up
what you love and who you are.

799
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,416
Guys, I'm gay!

800
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,625
I knew it. You weren't drunk that night.

801
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,250
Hannah.

802
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,250
You're right.

803
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,875
I shouldn't turn back on who I really am.

804
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:26,583
Me, too!

805
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:28,208
Time's running out. Let's go!

806
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:33,458
Mimi…

807
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:38,333
You have the list of all the Lancer owners
who work at Ernesto's school.

808
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:39,458
Chief?

809
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:41,416
What?

810
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:46,958
Tonya, Mang Berting and the captain…

811
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,791
Are they in hell?

812
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,750
Are you serious?

813
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:59,791
Yes. I asked for a sign,
a white flower to be exact.

814
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:04,708
But I forgot what the sign
was supposed to mean.

815
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,958
Maybe you should eat the flower
and wait for the answer to come.

816
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:10,625
That's right…

817
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,125
You’re truly brilliant, Chief.

818
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:14,500
That's why I'm the Chief.

819
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,916
Friends, tonight we will find out
who the lucky girl is.

820
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,125
Meanwhile let's wish our judges good luck.

821
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:47,708
They have a tough job ahead.

822
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,375
Do you want to win?

823
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,041
Yes, sir.

824
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,083
What's your cellphone number?

825
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,541
0-9-2-8…

826
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:21,083
We'll find someone.

827
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:26,708
Hey, bro, do you want to turn gay?
For a fee?

828
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,750
What? You want a good beating?

829
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,250
Why don't we put this off
until after the holiday?

830
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:43,375
Bro, what’s that?

831
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,625
Bro, look. She’s crying.

832
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:14,083
Okay, give it a try. Say this.

833
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:16,166
What’s he supposed to say?

834
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:34,208
I run a scholarship fund for girls…

835
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,250
You can take up any course you want to.

836
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:39,250
Okay, sir.

837
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
What do you want to be?

838
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:43,083
An engineer, sir.

839
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:45,166
An engineer? You think you can handle it?

840
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,000
-Are you good at math?
-Yes, sir.

841
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:48,958
-Eight times four?
-Six?

842
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,000
-Correct.
-Thank you, sir.

843
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,791
The makeup is fantastic.

844
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,125
Totally.

845
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:01,708
What a fresh approach.

846
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:03,125
How daring.

847
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,500
Why does your perfume smell like…

848
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:10,916
Shit?

849
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,666
You want to win?

850
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,416
Okay. Go home and take a bath.

851
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,000
He's gay.

852
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,166
What are you waiting for? Use the gun!

853
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,333
It's not working.

854
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:40,708
It's Berting.

855
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:41,625
Berting!

856
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,083
Get down!

857
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,791
What the… Chief?

858
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,125
Let's go! There's too many of them!

859
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,208
Ouch, that hurts!

860
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,500
I said let go!

861
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:49,666
Remington!

862
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,416
-Uncle Suarez…
-Bro, don’t!

863
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:03,583
It’s fake!

864
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:10,500
I swear, my son is not gay!

865
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:12,291
Help me!

866
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:19,041
Help me!

867
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,875
Help me!

868
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:29,791
Hannah!

869
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,500
Someone cursed me when I was young.

870
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,958
That he'd turn gay when he grew up.

871
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,416
It's happening.

872
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,000
I love you…

873
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:09,250
Nonsense!

874
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,333
How I wish it wasn't true…

875
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:17,208
What do we have here?

876
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:21,583
Someone’s turned… No…
Oh, dear, it’s been there all along.

877
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:24,791
You hid it too well and for far too long.

878
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,666
Now look what you’ve done.

879
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,708
Oh, no!

880
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,041
Hey, zombading!

881
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,708
Let's see who's tougher.

882
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:04,916
For my town!

883
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,750
Come back here! Zombading!

884
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:35,708
Hannah…

885
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:40,875
listen.

886
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:43,125
I want you to remember…

887
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,166
I love you so much.

888
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,291
Please don’t forget.

889
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:56,791
Even if I've forgotten.

890
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,333
Remington…

891
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,500
Tell me.

892
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,875
How can we get rid of the curse?

893
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,625
If someone takes my place.

894
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,333
A straight man.

895
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,666
Okay. I'm in.

896
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,958
Really?

897
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,333
What do I do?

898
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,416
You’ll do it?

899
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,000
Dad…

900
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,541
We’re out of time, son.

901
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,708
You'd rather turn gay,

902
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,916
than have a gay son?

903
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,375
Remington.

904
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:39,916
I've had my swing at life.

905
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:42,500
You're life is just starting.

906
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:45,875
I want you to be happy,
and to be who you really are.

907
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,208
Time's running out.

908
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:50,625
But what about you?

909
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:53,000
What’s wrong?

910
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:59,375
Do I stop being a father when I'm gay?

911
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:01,791
What about Mom?

912
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,583
She'll understand.

913
01:22:27,416 --> 01:22:28,625
I…

914
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:32,416
Eduardo Felimon Martinez…

915
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,791
hereby agree to turn gay…

916
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:39,708
and stay gay for the rest of my life.

917
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,583
Remington.

918
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,166
Remington.

919
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,708
Ma'am! Ma’am! A few questions.

920
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:33,625
What can you say
about recent events here in Lucban?

921
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:39,333
You can direct all your questions to her.

922
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:40,416
Chief?

923
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,666
Ma’am…

924
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:52,500
There's talk that what happened here
was just a hoax.

925
01:23:52,583 --> 01:23:54,958
It’s all too… weird.

926
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:57,208
What do you say to that?

927
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:00,333
What I can say…

928
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,708
I've seen a lot of weird things
happen in this town.

929
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:07,375
Things that I never thought possible.

930
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:15,750
Not in my dreams.

931
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:21,333
Not even in my nightmares.

932
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,750
But they happened anyway.

933
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,916
And they are still happening.

934
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,500
How pretentious!

935
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:35,958
Kids,

936
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,625
what do you think of
the famous Lucban noodles?

937
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:39,791
Delicious!

938
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:05,958
So you're all set to go?

939
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,458
Manila's not that far.

940
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:17,125
Right.

941
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,000
What if you were to move back there again?

942
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:22,291
I'm okay with being here.

943
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,708
It hones my patience.

944
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,541
In that case, I'll stay.

945
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:34,791
The high school band teacher said
I could help out with the marching band.

946
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,291
You're frightened, aren't you?

947
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:38,708
A little bit.

948
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:41,916
Don't be. I know you can do it.

949
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,250
Move!

950
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:53,041
Jerk, you're ruining the moment.

951
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,250
Go on, play it.

952
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:01,125
Girls… double time!

953
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:04,791
A big order came in from Germany.

954
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,916
-Come.
-Yes, dear.

955
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:14,375
Here’s my fare.

956
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,458
Mom, look, a homo.

957
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:24,375
She's beautiful!

958
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:13,083
When the world was still brand new…

959
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,708
Okay, okay,
at least before the Spaniards came,

960
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,833
gays were not treated equally.

961
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:25,416
They were given better treatment.

962
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:28,458
They're exceptional beings, after all.

963
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:32,541
Sages. And it is said

964
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:38,666
that they could cross between worlds
both visible and invisible.

965
01:31:41,166 --> 01:31:43,500
They were treated like superstars.

966
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:48,500
Admired, revered, celebrated.

967
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:53,958
As in, "Bro, I hear your son is gay.

968
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:57,541
Congrats! Drinks on you!"

969
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:00,208
Hang on.

970
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:06,875
The words "bakla" or "bro" or "congrats"

971
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,958
didn’t exist then.

972
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:17,708
"Bakla" wasn’t
in our ancestors' vocabulary.

973
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:21,250
That word’s origin is sketchy.

974
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,916
To be "bakla" means to be a coward,

975
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,291
someone who is not man enough.

976
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:31,750
As if straight people don’t get scared.

977
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:36,666
I wonder who demoted the goddesses.

978
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:39,625
The English language is kinder.

979
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:42,291
"Gay" is happy!

980
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:46,833
While here, we reduced the superstars

981
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:50,291
into a synonym for fear.

982
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:55,083
Can you blame them
if they came up with their own vocabulary?

983
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:57,583
For example,

984
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:59,833
they turned the word for fear into…

985
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,750
Fierce.
