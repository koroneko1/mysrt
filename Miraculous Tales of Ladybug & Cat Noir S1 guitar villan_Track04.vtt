&lrm;So, what do you think of my new album?

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.420
&lrm;Can you feel it, Bob? Isn't it killer?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.140
&lrm;Not bad, Jagged, not bad,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.940
&lrm;but if you really want
&lrm;to make something killer,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.540
&lrm;let's talk about this duet with Mr XY.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.340
&lrm;No way, he's not a rocker.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.860
&lrm;He's a baby. I bet he doesn't even shave.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.180
&lrm;This "baby" just pushed you
&lrm;off the No 1 spot.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.220
&lrm;And? Doesn't make him
&lrm;a true musician like me.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.420
&lrm;Penny thinks everything I do is killer.

&lrm;Penny's your agent but I'm your real boss.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
<i>&lrm;Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records</i>
<i>&lrm;cannot afford to be No 2</i>

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.220
&lrm;or rep a No 2 rock star.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.060
&lrm;Get real.
&lrm;You have to modernise your music,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.300
&lrm;change your look, get a new style.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.780
&lrm;You wanna talk real?
&lrm;I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, Bob,

<i>&lrm;not some popstar in diapers.</i>

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.420
<i>&lrm;I'm an artist with real talent.</i>
<i>&lrm;Even my hair's real.</i>

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.420
&lrm;That's what people love about me.
&lrm;Isn't that right, Fang? Yeah.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.180
&lrm;The artwork you did for my album
&lrm;is a waste of my time.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.980
&lrm;Seriously, Bob? What is this trash?
&lrm;It looks like a perfume ad.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.220
&lrm;That's what people want these days.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.580
&lrm;Well I don't.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.540
&lrm;My album covers exude the smell
&lrm;of sweat and leather.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.620
&lrm;If your next album doesn't rank
&lrm;No 1 in the charts,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.580
&lrm;it'll be your last
&lrm;with Bob Roth Records!

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.820
&lrm;I'd rather do nothing
&lrm;than sing a pathetic duet with

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.340
&lrm;a baby-faced nobody.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.260
&lrm;Jagged and I had an idea.
&lrm;Its concept is modern

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.700
&lrm;but it also respects
&lrm;Jagged's own "rugged" style.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.460
&lrm;The girl who made
&lrm;these glasses has real talent.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.780
&lrm;She gets my style.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.420
&lrm;She'll design the cover of my new album.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.740
&lrm;A schoolgirl?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.420
&lrm;See? That's just it.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.140

&lrm;as the target audience.

&lrm;[Marinette] <i>&lrm;Wait,</i>

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.220
&lrm;let me get this straight.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.860
&lrm;You want me to design
&lrm;the album cover for Jagged Stone?

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.340
&lrm;My... all-time favourite singer?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.180
&lrm;That's right, requested
&lrm;by Jagged himself.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.980
&lrm;I brought a few visuals
&lrm;so you can get an idea.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.220
&lrm;This doesn't seem like Jagged,
&lrm;more like a perfume ad.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.460
&lrm;It's the direction
&lrm;of his new image, more modern.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.220
&lrm;Really?

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.780
&lrm;I was thinking more...

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.860
&lrm;Don't think.
&lrm;This is what is selling these days.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.220
&lrm;Sure.

&lrm;[she groans]

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.220
&lrm;Why does Jagged Stone want
&lrm;to change his style?

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.180
&lrm;XY's music is so... cold
&lrm;and lifeless, repetitive, mundane...

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.020
&lrm;The total opposite of Jagged's.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.980
&lrm;And what I've just done is...

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.820
&lrm;so not my style, either.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.980
&lrm;So why're you doing it, then?

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.540
&lrm;That's what I was asked to do.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.020
&lrm;Follow your gut feeling,
&lrm;do something that's really you.

&lrm;"This is what's selling these days".

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.620

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.500
&lrm;You and I like the same kind
&lrm;of music, isn't that awesome?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.540
&lrm;I thought you liked Mr XY.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.780
&lrm;Of course. Don't you?

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.060
&lrm;Not really.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.940
&lrm;Well, neither do I.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.180
&lrm;See? We have the same great taste.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.300
&lrm;A duet with Mr XY
&lrm;will prove that Jagged's still...

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.620
&lrm;[gasping]

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.820
&lrm;From now on,
&lrm;you can call me Guitar Villain.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.060
&lrm;I'll never do a duet with Mr XY.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.900
&lrm;In fact, soon,
&lrm;there won't even be a Mr XY.

&lrm;Soon, there'll be nothing
&lrm;but Guitar Villain fans.

&lrm;The one and only rocker.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.020
&lrm;Such symphony to my ears.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.660
&lrm;It won't be long before

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.780
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir show up
&lrm;to meet their doom.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.460
&lrm;Hurry, Adrien. Get me outta here.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.620
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.620
&lrm;Yeah, Guitar Villain.

&lrm;Hey, Jagged, try and rock my world.

&lrm;The name's Guitar Villain, pussycat.

&lrm;Do see what I see, Tikki?

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.900
&lrm;If you see a dragon, then yes I do.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.460
&lrm;I've gotta transform.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.180
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.460
&lrm;Cat Noir, you OK?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.060
&lrm;Good to see you, milady.

&lrm;[he chuckles]

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.940
&lrm;You're wasting my time.
&lrm;I've got a concert to get to.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.820
&lrm;We've gotta follow him.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.100
&lrm;His power comes from his guitar.
&lrm;We've gotta stop him from playing.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.900
&lrm;I won't let you do this solo.

&lrm;[electronic music]

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.820
&lrm;You're an insult to the music world, XY!

&lrm;He's not here.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.940
&lrm;The concert's not till tonight.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.020
&lrm;I'm just setting up the special effects.

&lrm;On TV. He's at the TV station.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.300
&lrm;[gasping] You again?

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.420
&lrm;To the TV studios, Fang.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.580
&lrm;He'll get there before us!

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.100
&lrm;We'd better make sure
&lrm;he doesn't find XY.

&lrm;Ladybug says we're in danger.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.740
&lrm;Mr XY, we have to leave now.

&lrm;What the heck?

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.860

&lrm;[Alec] Everything will be fine.

&lrm;It's just a precaution.

&lrm;We must get you to safety.

&lrm;YES!

&lrm;[they gasp]

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.980
&lrm;Don't do your victory dance
&lrm;just yet, because one day,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.140
&lrm;I'll play you my favourite music,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.260
&lrm;the anthem of your defeat,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.460
&lrm;[rock music]

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.740
&lrm;Done!

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.660
&lrm;Jagged Stone will love it.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.580
&lrm;I hope so, it's 100% Marinette.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.860
&lrm;It's my... awesome solo!

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.500
&lrm;[Tikki] Rock 'n' Roll!

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.740
&lrm;Yeah, this is it.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.980
&lrm;You did it, girl.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.940
&lrm;I can almost smell
&lrm;the leather and sweat

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.740
&lrm;radiating off of this design.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.940
&lrm;[he sniffs]

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.260
&lrm;You actually are smelling it.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.020
&lrm;I made a scented sticker
&lrm;for your album.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.140
&lrm;I want it. I gotta have it.
&lrm;It's authentic. It's original.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.620
&lrm;It's...so jagged.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.860
&lrm;No, you can't. It's not what...

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.020
&lrm;Fine, then I'm outta here.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.260
&lrm;I'm sure another record company
&lrm;would be perfectly happy

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.860
&lrm;with a No 2 chart-topper.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.900
&lrm;[Bob huffs]

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.460
&lrm;[excited squealing]

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.300
&lrm;I've just designed the cover

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.340
&lrm;for Jagged Stone's new album.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.620
&lrm;I'm so proud of you, Marinette

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.740
<i>&lrm;Jagged Stone's new album</i>
<i>&lrm;hit the charts at No 1,</i>

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.140
<i>&lrm;knocking Mr XY off of his throne.</i>

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.020
<i>&lrm;Welcome back, King of Rock.</i>

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.900
&lrm;Hey, Marinette.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.100
&lrm;I'm a huge fan of Jagged Stone's

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.500
&lrm;and I saw you designed
&lrm;his album cover.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.180
&lrm;I-I did. Crazy, isn't it?

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.420
&lrm;I wanted to ask if...
&lrm;I could get it... autographed?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.220
&lrm;O-OK, sure... I'll ask him.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.500
&lrm;No... actually, I meant you.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.940
&lrm;Me?...Me?

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.940
&lrm;If you wouldn't mind.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.460
&lrm;Awesome! Thanks, Marinette.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.420
&lrm;[growling]

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.260
&lrm;Did I imagine it or did you sign
&lrm;an autograph for Adrien?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.700
&lrm;I can't feel my legs.
&lrm;Hold me up. I'm gonna fall over.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.140
&lrm;Is he still around?

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.460
&lrm;It's OK, he's gone. You can fall over.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.180
&lrm;This is the happiest day of my life.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.340
&lrm;[Marinette] Rock 'n' Roll!
