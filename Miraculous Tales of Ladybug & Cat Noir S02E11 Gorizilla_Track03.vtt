&lrm;I'd like to talk to you about.

&lrm;-Can I have a few minutes?
&lrm;-Yes, of course.

&lrm;This is where I was heading

&lrm;I am, with my bodyguard or Nathalie,

&lrm;But I'm not sure my father
&lrm;would have allowed me to see this movie.

&lrm;Oh, no! Please don't tell me
&lrm;it's a horror movie. I hate horror movies!

&lrm;It's not on the Internet,

&lrm;Wow. I had no idea.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.860
&lrm;It's only being shown once,
&lrm;today, in this theatre.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.380
&lrm;I couldn't talk to my father about it,
&lrm;so I decided to sneak out, unnoticed.

&lrm;I don't think the "unnoticed" bit
&lrm;went too well, actually!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.140
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.540
&lrm;She's alone. If Adrien is Cat Noir,
&lrm;then he'll have to transform to help her.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.540
&lrm;Gorizilla, attack Ladybug!

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.340
&lrm;There's no use. He's too strong!

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.300
&lrm;Cat Noir, where are you?
&lrm;I really need your help, fast!

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.940
&lrm;I'm at Montparnasse Tower!

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.940
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.980
&lrm;A helicopter?
&lrm;It isn't really a good time to play!

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.740
&lrm;Excellent! Now, take Ladybug's Miraculous
&lrm;while we wait for Cat Noir.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.780
&lrm;-I'm so sorry, Ladybug.
&lrm;-Don't worry!

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.900
&lrm;Let me try to manoeuvre this thing!

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.860
&lrm;Get Ladybug back!

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.220
&lrm;Hold on!

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.780
&lrm;Sorry!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.020
&lrm;Let go of Adrien right now!

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.700
&lrm;Jump, Adrien! Quick!

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.780
&lrm;You have to trust me!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.580
&lrm;Always! Yeah!

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.660
&lrm;No!

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.660
&lrm;If you don't transform soon,
&lrm;you'll wind up like a pile of camembert!

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.740
&lrm;I can't, Plagg.
&lrm;Not in the open like this!

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.100
&lrm;I'm sure Ladybug has a plan! I trust her!

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.260
&lrm;Don't be scared, Adrien!
&lrm;I'm going to catch you!

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.220
&lrm;If indeed you are Cat Noir,
&lrm;then transform, son, please!

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.740
&lrm;Come on, son!

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.860
&lrm;Cat noir, help!

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.660
&lrm;Drop Ladybug!

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.420
&lrm;[cheering and applause]

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.060
&lrm;Gorizilla, get them back!
&lrm;And don't mess up this time!

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.900
&lrm;I just knew I could count on you,
&lrm;Mila... Uh! Ladybug!

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.540
&lrm;Adrien! You're safe!

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.420
&lrm;Your earrings are flashing.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.380
&lrm;It won't be long before I transform back!
&lrm;But don't worry.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.580
&lrm;Cat Noir will be here soon
&lrm;to take care of things!

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.540
&lrm;You can leave! I'll keep him at bay!

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.620
&lrm;No. I want you to find
&lrm;a safe place to hide!

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.780
&lrm;Oh! OK!

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.540
&lrm;You shall not pass!

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.900
&lrm;Radiant... Carefree... Dreamy...
&lrm;Adrien, the fragrance!

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.420
&lrm;Now you won't be able to sniff out Adrien,
&lrm;will you? Go ahead, try!

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.780
&lrm;[roars]

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.660
&lrm;I'm coming, Adrien!

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.140
&lrm;I think you lost him!

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.460
&lrm;Looks like it!
&lrm;Any idea where his akuma could be?

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.740
&lrm;You're about to transform back.
&lrm;Leave me here.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.020
&lrm;I'll hide while I wait
&lrm;for Cat Noir to turn up.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.500
&lrm;But what if the supervillain finds you?

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.780
&lrm;He's my bodyguard! He won't hurt me!

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.100
&lrm;Of course! I know how we can trap him!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.980
&lrm;This way, I'll have time
&lrm;to find out where his akuma is!

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.260
&lrm;Meet us at the subway.
&lrm;Adrien agreed to act as a bait,

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.220
&lrm;but we really need you and your cataclysm
&lrm;to make this work. Hurry up!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.020
&lrm;-What if Cat Noir doesn't turn up?
&lrm;-Oh, he will. I trust him.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.700
&lrm;You're right. I'm sure he'll be here.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.820
&lrm;What rabbit are you planning
&lrm;to pull out of your hat now?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.700
&lrm;You can't exactly be Cat Noir
&lrm;and Adrien at the same time!

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.260
&lrm;And what if I can?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.980
&lrm;I need some help!

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.460
&lrm;Adrien!

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.940
&lrm;He's coming.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.980
&lrm;Hurry up, Cat Noir!

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.300
&lrm;[car alarms go off]

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.460
&lrm;Over here!

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.180
&lrm;Why don't you pick on someone
&lrm;your own size?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.500
&lrm;Don't worry, Adrien.
&lrm;I won't let him touch a hair on your head!

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.300
&lrm;Adrien and Cat Noir, side by side?

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.020
&lrm;So I was wrong! Just as well!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.300
&lrm;Gorizilla, grab Cat Noir's Miraculous
&lrm;and be done with him!

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.060
&lrm;Missed me! Missed me again!

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.700
&lrm;That's it, big guy.
&lrm;Come on, just a little more...

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.620
&lrm;There!

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.300
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.540
&lrm;[scream]

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.780
&lrm;This is Cat Noir Express Deliveries.
&lrm;Did you order a giant beast, Milady?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.380
&lrm;I knew I could count on you!

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.140
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;<i>-He's safe!</i>

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.300
&lrm;I'm very sorry,
&lrm;but I'll have to search your pockets!

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.300
&lrm;Here you are!

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.820
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.900
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.340
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.700
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.940
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Pound it!

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.940
&lrm;One of these days, I'll find out
&lrm;who Ladybug and Cat Noir really are!

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.300
&lrm;And when I do,
&lrm;I'll make them pay for eternity!

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.740
&lrm;Adrien, are you OK?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.780
&lrm;He's totally fine! See, if I were you,
&lrm;I wouldn't hang around too long.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.260
&lrm;Unless you don't mind revealing
&lrm;your secret identity to all of us.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.900
&lrm;Bye, Adrien! Bye, Kitty! Bug out!

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.340
&lrm;Gotta scat, too!
&lrm;Thanks for your help, Adrien!

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.460
&lrm;That was awesome! I helped Cat Noir
&lrm;save Paris from that nasty big ape!

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.620
&lrm;I knew I could count on you.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.020
&lrm;I'm sorry I had to ask you
&lrm;to stand in for me earlier.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.540
&lrm;You must think I'm not very brave.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.180
&lrm;You kidding? I got to be
&lrm;in Adrien's shoes for a few minutes!

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.220
&lrm;A dream come true!

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.900
&lrm;I'm really sorry I posted that photo
&lrm;on the Internet. You must be mad at me.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.500
&lrm;-Is that your email?
&lrm;-Yeah.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.180
&lrm;If you can manage to stop running after me
&lrm;screaming, I'm sure we can be friends.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.780
&lrm;I promise, Adrien!

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.220
&lrm;Oh, Tikki! I went to the movies
&lrm;with Adrien! It's best day of my life!

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.380
&lrm;Oh, no! I went to the movies
&lrm;with Adrien in my pyjamas,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.260
&lrm;wearing funny glasses and a towel!

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.260
&lrm;It's the worst day of my life!

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.420
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.700
&lrm;Alya!

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.380
&lrm;<i>OK, Marinette, we all saw your pics</i>
&lrm;<i>online, but we're totally lost!</i>

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.740
&lrm;<i>-We need the scoop!</i>
&lrm;-Right. Not surprised!

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.220
&lrm;I'll just change, then I'll be right over.
&lrm;Wait. Where are you?

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.860
&lrm;At the swimming pool?
&lrm;We're still waiting, girl!

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.420
&lrm;[laughter]

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.020
&lrm;Sit down, Adrien.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.180
&lrm;All you had to do was ask me.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.860
&lrm;I'm sorry, Father. I tried to talk to you,
&lrm;but you were so busy.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.100
&lrm;In fact, I always feel
&lrm;like you don't want to talk at all, so...

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.420
&lrm;You should have trusted me, son.
&lrm;We should be able to trust each other.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.980
&lrm;If you were to begin
&lrm;hiding the truth from me,

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.980
&lrm;then I'd naturally start imagining
&lrm;all kinds of things.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.620
&lrm;Right, Father. Thank you.
