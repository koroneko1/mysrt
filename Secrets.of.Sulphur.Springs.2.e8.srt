1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,078
Harper:
Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,481
Our names aren't
really Harry and Hermione.

3
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:05,815
‐I'm Griffin.
‐Harper.

4
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:06,883
For real?

5
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,418
What if I put the money
into the hotel?

6
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:09,486
50‐50 partner?

7
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:11,254
Harper:
You can rest easy now.
It's over.

8
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:12,622
The Tremonts are back
on the land.

9
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:20,597
You see it, right?

10
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:21,965
Griffin:
It came from the mirror.

11
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:24,501
Harper:
Her spirit's freed,

12
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,969
and there aren't
any more ghosts.

13
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,010
(door slams)

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,547
(whispering):
Sam, your time machine,
it works.

15
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:39,549
nurse: He disappeared
during the middle
of the night.

16
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,851
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

17
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,687
Sam?

18
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,388
"I've gone on a journey
through time.

19
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:48,024
If I'm not back in three weeks,
destroy the radio."

20
00:00:48,024 --> 00:00:49,192
The future.

21
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,627
I missed you
while you were gone.

22
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,195
Like... a lot.

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,931
I missed you too.

24
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:17,487
So, um...

25
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:20,190
Our parents are going all‐out
for this opening tonight.

26
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:23,927
Gift bags.
Theme party.

27
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,328
Heard there's
even a band.

28
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,831
Yeah, should, uh...
Should be fun.

29
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:29,432
Yeah.

30
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,336
I hate this.

31
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,472
We haven't
really hung out
in weeks.

32
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,973
It's not that
I don't want to,
it's just...

33
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,677
Things have just felt
kind of weird.

34
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,380
Maybe they wouldn't be
if we talked about
what happened that night.

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,915
You mean about
how‐‐ how we, uh...

36
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,386
‐you know, how, uh‐‐
‐Just say it.

37
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:50,253
We almost kissed.

38
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:58,294
Unfortunately,
we're all booked.

39
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,963
But if you want to leave
your contact information,

40
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:01,264
I can add you
to the wait‐list.

41
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,934
Great!
Hope to see you soon.

42
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,505
I hear that right?
There's a wait‐list?

43
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,406
Two pages long.

44
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,574
People are lining up
to stay here,

45
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:12,842
and the doors
aren't even open.

46
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:15,211
Guess the price
those contractors charged

47
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,347
‐to finish was worth it.
‐We are about to make

48
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,182
someone on that list
very happy.

49
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,751
Finally found the key
to 205.

50
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,420
Kids are
cleaning it out now.

51
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,589
Uh, but it has that draft.

52
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,025
We still haven't figured out
where that's coming from.

53
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,929
Eh, nothing an...
extra blanket can't fix
in the meantime, right?

54
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,199
Hi, this is Ben Campbell
from The Tremont.

55
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,037
As a matter of fact,
a room just became available.

56
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,377
Did you see this website?
It's about the opening.

57
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,012
Have you looked
at the comments?

58
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,848
"Always wanted to stay
in a haunted hotel."

59
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,583
"I can't wait
to see a ghost tonight."

60
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,852
The ghost left weeks ago.
We saw it happen.

61
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,122
Which means the opening
is probably gonna be
a bust.

62
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,123
Unless...

63
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:03,626
‐Where are you going?
‐To give the people
what they want.

64
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:14,270
(ominous music playing)

65
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,743
All I'm saying is
it's common for people
in stressful situations

66
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,244
to do things
they normally wouldn't.

67
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,512
Having to pretend
to be someone else

68
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,347
definitely qualifies
as stressful.

69
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,618
Daisy did her best,
but wearing your clothes
didn't make her you.

70
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:30,954
‐I mean, I could always tell.
‐Always?

71
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:33,289
‐Except for that one time
in the bunker.
‐Yeah, okay.

72
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,225
But that's only because
I was focused on
switching you back

73
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,626
before people got
too suspicious.

74
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:38,328
Sam knew
something was off
right away.

75
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,496
Would've had
to tell him the truth

76
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,397
if I was stuck
in the past much longer.

77
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,266
We can't risk
messing with time
like that again.

78
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,001
Too many things
could've changed.

79
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,669
And that's not
what we want.

80
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,606
Is it?

81
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,241
To change things?

82
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,411
We should, um...

83
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,347
We should get
these bags finished.

84
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:58,681
Right.

85
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:07,857
(theme music playing)

86
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,649
Mrs. Barker. Hi.

87
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:36,052
Harper...
from the cafe.

88
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:39,189
Is there something
we can help you with?

89
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:45,295
It might be a good idea
to let someone know
you're here.

90
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:46,696
You live at Shady Acres,
right?

91
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,567
Oh, uh, looks like
your ride just pulled up.

92
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,136
Don't do it.

93
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,139
‐Sorry, what?
‐Don't go forward.

94
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,074
It's time
to head back now,
Mrs. Barker.

95
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,647
Don't go forward?

96
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,482
She's just
a confused old woman.

97
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,084
Probably doesn't know
what she's saying.

98
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,753
Uh, what if she was talking
about the future?

99
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:11,988
Like, don't go forward
in time?

100
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,525
‐That would mean...
‐Mrs. Barker knows
about the portal.

101
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:29,539
‐(knock on door)
‐Come in.

102
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,075
‐Hey, Mom.
‐Lunch is almost ready.

103
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,409
Planning on
coming down soon?

104
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:35,912
I'm not really hungry.

105
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,116
Wherever Sam is,
I'm sure he's just fine.

106
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,385
We don't know that.
What if he needs help?

107
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,188
Honey, you have
such a big heart.

108
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:46,589
I know you're worried,

109
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:49,259
but it might be time
to accept Sam isn't
coming back.

110
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,426
He left weeks ago.

111
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:51,928
Three weeks ago.

112
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:53,863
Anything could've happened.

113
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:56,199
Or it's possible
Sam may not want
to be found.

114
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,433
We need to respect that.

115
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,237
I'll see you downstairs.

116
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,414
Don't do this to me, Sam.

117
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:12,615
Please come back.

118
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,761
(water bubbling)

119
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,981
Sure this is gonna
work?

120
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,884
This is my area
of expertise, remember?

121
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,519
Go ahead, try it.

122
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,059
Like I said,
instant ghost.

123
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,529
We've seen
what a real ghost
can do.

124
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,863
It's way creepier.

125
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,931
Patience, people.

126
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm just getting started.

127
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:13,209
Something has been
drawing Mrs. Barker
to the hotel.

128
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:15,345
Now she warns us
about going into the future?

129
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,446
It can't be
a coincidence.

130
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,915
She never
actually said future,
you did.

131
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,149
What else could she have meant?

132
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,117
Any number of things.

133
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,385
For all we know,
Mrs. Barker was talking

134
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,286
to the driver of the van,

135
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,520
telling him
not to go forward.

136
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,055
She grabbed my arm,
Harper.

137
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:27,523
Stared me
right in the eye.

138
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:29,058
‐That warning was for us.
‐Okay.

139
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,294
Um, excuse me.

140
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:32,996
We're looking
for Mrs. Barker's room.

141
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:34,330
Visiting hours are over.

142
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,832
Oh, uh,
we won't stay long.

143
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,400
We just wanted
to bring this by for her.

144
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,802
It's souvenirs
from The Tremont's
grand opening party tonight.

145
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,804
We know how much
Mrs. Barker likes the hotel.

146
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,206
You can leave it
at the front desk.

147
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:44,574
Down the hall
to your right.

148
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,242
Thank you.

149
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,652
Well, that was a bust.

150
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,055
Harper:
Maybe not.

151
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,861
Mrs. Barker?
Remember us?

152
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,363
We saw you
at the Tremont earlier.

153
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,664
You gave us a warning.

154
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,467
What'll happen
if we do go forward?

155
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:13,102
Sounded like
you've seen it.

156
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,573
Griffin,
we need to leave.

157
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,042
Griffin: Mrs. Barker,
if you've been
to the future,

158
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,243
you can tell us,
we'll believe you.

159
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,011
You're not supposed
to be in here.

160
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,080
We were headed
to the desk
and saw Mrs. Barker.

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,982
Just figured
we'd drop this off
with her.

162
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,683
Mrs. Barker needs her rest.

163
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:29,519
I'll show you out.

164
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:40,296
Harry, Hermione,
it was good to see you again.

165
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,966
Savannah?

166
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:49,005
Harper: Mrs. Barker comes
into the cafe all the time.

167
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:50,940
I can't believe
I never recognized her.

168
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,375
Why would you?

169
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,844
I mean, Savannah's
like 70 now.

170
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,979
She's still
the same person, Griffin.

171
00:08:56,979 --> 00:09:00,016
Something should've seemed,
you know, familiar.

172
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,720
Well, Savannah grew up.

173
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,290
She got married,
and she lived this whole life.

174
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,693
I mean, it'd be crazy
if she wasn't any different.

175
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:13,663
I mean, think about
how much our parents changed

176
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:14,664
from when they were kids.

177
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:16,499
That's true.

178
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,102
Hey.

179
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:20,603
What do you think
we'll be like
at their age?

180
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,737
Hmm...

181
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,474
Taller.

182
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,976
‐At least I better be.
‐(laughs)

183
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:31,114
Would we still
recognize each other if
we passed on the street?

184
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,516
Come on.

185
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,084
You know,
you're pretty unforgettable.

186
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,453
Locker ninja.

187
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,527
We have a problem.

188
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,662
Oh, if it's about the napkins,
I've already called‐‐

189
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,264
We have to close
the springs.

190
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,565
I was just down there
and‐‐

191
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:50,900
Knock, knock!

192
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,335
Allison!

193
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,103
Hi, uh,
good to see you again.

194
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,571
Allison is writing an article

195
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,006
for the local paper.

196
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:58,941
I hope you don't mind
the early check‐in.

197
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,310
Just wanted to get
a little preview
of the springs

198
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,445
before it gets too crowded.

199
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,048
Well, we, uh, have
just been so focused
on getting the hotel ready

200
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,318
that our landscaping plan
fell a little behind schedule.

201
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,654
‐Oh.
‐Which is why

202
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,822
we will be having
you back

203
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,690
for a second
complimentary stay

204
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,192
as soon as
the springs are open.

205
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,060
Here, let me grab
that bag for you.

206
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,630
Oh, don't forget
this one.

207
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,366
Just a little something
to help you settle in.

208
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,367
Thank you.

209
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:27,370
Ben: We have
a great room for you.

210
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,806
‐What happened?
‐The springs are a mess.

211
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:33,209
I mean, it smells like
the end of a week‐long
music festival.

212
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:34,443
Of course, they do.

213
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,279
Every new business
has its little hiccups,

214
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,813
especially during
the first week.

215
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,849
Probably won't be
the only thing
to go wrong tonight.

216
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:01,003
It has to be subtle.

217
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:02,672
You're talking
to the king of subtle.

218
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,573
Hey, guys.

219
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,444
The king, huh?
Mmm‐kay.

220
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:11,080
‐Done with 205?
‐Yep. All clean.

221
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,248
Except for the floor.

222
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:14,650
You know, I can't figure out
what this is.

223
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,986
Wouldn't have anything
to do with

224
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,021
whatever's hiding
behind your back, would it?

225
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:23,392
We were making slime
to scare the guests.

226
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,528
You really need to learn
when to stop talking.

227
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:26,862
Ben: We have a lot
riding on tonight.

228
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,464
It needs to go off
without a hitch,

229
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,766
‐which means no‐‐
‐(Allison screams)

230
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:34,403
Pranks.

231
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:37,940
That was set up
way before the slime.

232
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,010
Downstairs. Now!

233
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,961
When I was a little girl,

234
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,531
The Tremont meant summer camp
and brunch on Sundays.

235
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,967
Back then,
I never would've guessed

236
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,370
that one day I would have
my own restaurant here.

237
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,706
Or that my children
would be so deeply connected

238
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,042
to the history of this hotel
and this land.

239
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:17,980
The Tremont now represents
a rebirth for me,

240
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,449
for the next generation
of the Tremont family,

241
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,052
and for our dear friends,
the Campbells, as well.

242
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:24,987
Sarah:
Restoring the hotel

243
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:28,824
started as
my husband's project,
his passion,

244
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:31,927
but soon became
our family's lifeline.

245
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,664
Uh, this process nearly
broke us at times,

246
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:38,000
but, uh, it also built us
back up again.

247
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:41,737
We made so many
special memories here.

248
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:46,275
We hope you will too,
for generations to come.

249
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:52,348
It's our pleasure
to finally say...

250
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,617
all:
Welcome to The Tremont!

251
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:57,053
(all cheering)

252
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,699
(indistinct chatter)

253
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:14,770
(loudly):
Did you hear that strange
scraping noise last night?

254
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,073
It was coming from
across the hall.

255
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:19,275
Room 205, I think.

256
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,143
Strange scraping noise?

257
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,845
(quietly):
That's good. Keep it up.

258
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,582
(loudly): It sounded like
someone or something
was trying to get out.

259
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:28,751
Keep what up?

260
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,653
And why are you shouting?
I'm standing right here.

261
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,956
What part of
"we need to convince people

262
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:36,425
that this place is haunted"
do you not understand?

263
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,294
Dad said no more pranks.

264
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:39,962
Rumors weren't
taken off the table.

265
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:42,898
Is that...

266
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,867
Savannah?

267
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,436
(loudly):
Oh, my gosh!
It is her!

268
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:49,038
‐Look!
‐Over there.

269
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,342
(quietly):
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:54,610
It is her.

271
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:02,385
I take back
everything I said.

272
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,753
That was incredible.

273
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:05,054
How'd you
pull it off?

274
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,223
You'll have to be
more specific.

275
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,691
Savannah walking
through the lobby.

276
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,360
Wyatt:
Had to be a look‐alike.
Or maybe a hologram.

277
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,363
I'm good but not that good.

278
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,933
So you didn't
set anything up?

279
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:20,603
My mom already
grounded me for a week.

280
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,104
Not looking
to do hard time.

281
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,274
It really was a ghost.

282
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,208
Come on.

283
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:34,784
Why would Savannah risk
coming up here?

284
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,019
She wouldn't
unless something happened.

285
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:40,589
Split up.
The sooner we find her,
the better.

286
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,135
(distortion)

287
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,706
Griffin: (in distorted voice)
Help!

288
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,642
Is anyone there?

289
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:01,877
Please, don't leave me!

290
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,951
Savannah's not down here.
Let's check upstairs.

291
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,322
Harper, do you see her?

292
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,925
I saw you...

293
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,093
trapped in a fire.

294
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,500
I'm still not sure
how it actually works.

295
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,435
I mean, maybe the vision
doesn't mean anything.

296
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:27,803
I've been wrong before.

297
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,104
I'm not waiting around
to find out.

298
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,105
There must be a reason

299
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,208
Savannah warned us
not to go into the future.

300
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,442
I'm not asking you
to go with me.

301
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:35,010
Don't you know me
better than that by now?

302
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,911
If you go, I go.

303
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,515
‐Griffin: Savannah!
‐Thank goodness.

304
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,054
Are you crazy?
What are you doing
up here?

305
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,122
Sam went into the future
and hasn't come back yet.

306
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,524
The future?

307
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:49,825
2024.

308
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,061
He left me a note telling me
to destroy the radio

309
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,662
if he wasn't back
in three weeks.

310
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,698
‐That's tonight.
‐What's in 2024?

311
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:58,200
Sam was hoping to find
a cure for his mom.

312
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,636
But if I break the radio,
he won't be able to save her.

313
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:02,738
‐So what do I do?
‐Go home.

314
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,008
‐But Sam‐‐
‐The crystal's cracking,
Savannah.

315
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:08,043
It gets worse each time
we go through.

316
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:10,479
If you don't go home now,
you might not get
another chance.

317
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,781
Harper:
You've already risked
too much.

318
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,318
I just can't believe
I won't see you guys again.

319
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,487
I have a feeling
someday you will.

320
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,725
Here, take this.

321
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:25,194
No one else can know
you're here.

322
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,707
Jess:
Oh, uh, Harper?

323
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,776
This is Allison Carter.

324
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,411
She's doing a story
on the hotel's history,

325
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,879
and she had
some questions for you.

326
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,247
Okay.

327
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,182
Your mother
was just telling me

328
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,618
about the document you found
in the city's archives.

329
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:51,387
I'd love to hear
more about it.

330
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:53,622
‐Would now be an okay time?
‐Of course.

331
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,460
Allison: So, first,
just a little bit about...

332
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,095
Wyatt:
So what would you do

333
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,797
if you came face‐to‐face
with Savannah?

334
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,832
Well, I'd ask her
to dance.

335
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,201
Stay out of sight.
I'll distract them.

336
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:10,039
Hey! So, uh, you guys‐‐
you guys enjoying the party?

337
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:15,144
Whoa! You all right?

338
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:18,781
You may wanna slow down.
It's pretty crowded tonight.

339
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:21,750
No kidding!
Never know who
you'll run into.

340
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,660
Okay, last question.

341
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,229
What does it mean to you,
as a Tremont,

342
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,632
to have this property
back in the family?

343
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,636
In a word...
everything.

344
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,340
All right.
Thank you.

345
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,808
Excuse me.

346
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,509
Uh, hey. Hey.

347
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,279
‐What's going on?
‐Huh? What do you mean?

348
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,480
Well, you look worried.

349
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,650
Wouldn't have anything
to do with Griffin
and that girl, would it?

350
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,054
That is not
a little hiccup.

351
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,368
Where's Griffin?

352
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,769
He's keeping
Topher and the twins busy

353
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:14,737
so I could get down here.

354
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,538
I just saw them.
Griffin wasn't up there.

355
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:17,973
Maybe he's already
in the bunker?

356
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,209
Let's find out.

357
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:35,357
(electricity crackling)

358
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,260
(crystal cracks)

359
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:41,864
Sarah:
Look at all this water!

360
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,465
Where is Zoey
with that key?

361
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:44,733
We need more towels!

362
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,804
‐Here you go.
‐Are those my sheets?

363
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,039
It's all
we could find.

364
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,141
Water just keeps
coming.

365
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,475
A‐‐ A pipe
must've burst.

366
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:55,711
More like
the sewer line. Ugh.

367
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,379
Smells like the springs
up here.

368
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,814
Well, we can't
close the hotel.

369
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,015
That would be
a disaster.

370
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,316
What is this
considered?

371
00:19:02,384 --> 00:19:04,253
Got the key!
Dad's looking
for a wrench

372
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:05,788
to turn off
the water main.

373
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,094
It's like something's...
wedged against the door.

374
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,362
Make room for the muscle.

375
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,200
And change of plans.

376
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,535
‐Did that just...
‐Move!

377
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:22,738
(wood cracking)

378
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,586
(intense music playing)

379
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,109
2024? That's where Sam is.

380
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,278
You think Griffin
went to warn him
about the crystal?

381
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,346
And bring Sam back?

382
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:40,349
They aren't coming back.

383
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,326
Dad! Mom!

384
00:20:51,326 --> 00:20:52,594
Whoa.

385
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:55,097
No! My‐‐ My family
could be in there.

386
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:56,465
Let go!

387
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,801
‐Wyatt! Zoey!
‐It's empty.

388
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,102
Has been for a while.

389
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,540
‐A while?
‐Yeah.

390
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,774
You're sure?

391
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,442
Except room 205.

392
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:10,445
Something evil
took hold up there
and wouldn't leave.

393
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:12,815
It has no choice now.

394
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:19,121
Sam got the crystal
from the springs.

395
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,756
We'll find another one,
and then I can go home.

396
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:21,890
‐Savannah‐‐
‐No!

397
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,493
We have to find a way
to fix this.

398
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:26,695
I can't stay here!

399
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,730
I have a family now.

400
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:30,566
I have a family.

401
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,071
Ben:
Harper?

402
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:38,807
Mr. Campbell.

403
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,010
(door closes)

404
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:45,314
What is this place?

405
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:53,522
(intense music playing)

406
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:59,661
