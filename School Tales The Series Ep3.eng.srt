WHAT CAN YOU EAT TO MAKE YOURSELF BEAUTIFUL?

00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,760
I WANT TO BE LIKE DAO

4
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,840
Dao, I liked all your pictures. I've never missed a single one.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
Me too, Dao. I liked and commented on them too.

6
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,360
-Yeah. -Thank you so much.

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,080
Thank you.

8
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,240
I WANT TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL SKIN

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,040
-How are you, Dao? -I'm good, thanks.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,280
Today, I got a client to give you a modeling gig for designer clothes.

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,280
Look, Dao. Isn't it beautiful?

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm sure you'll like it. It's perfect for you.

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,640
-I like it. -Okay.

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,080
I want you to try this on.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
-Oops. Sorry. -Sorry.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,120
She's so beautiful.

Aim.

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,480
I want to give you this.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
I got it when I did a product review.

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Try it.

24
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey, I saw the powder that Dao reviewed.

25
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,720
-Yeah? -I do want to try it.

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
But with our looks,

27
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,160
how much powder would we need?

28
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,600
How many layers of it would be enough?

29
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,040
Well, look in the mirror.

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,440
Here's a mirror for you to look at yourself in.

31
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
And?

32
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,560
I mean, look at our faces. How can we compete with her?

33
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,520
The powder helps.

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
Who wants to be in my group?

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Oh my gosh. Dao, you want to join my group?

36
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm so glad. Come on.

"Never tell anyone,

49
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,760
no matter how curious about it they are."

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
"Reveal the secret

51
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,400
and

52
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
you will lose everything,

53
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,000
not just your beauty."

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,880
ACCEPT

55
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,400
GET READY!

56
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
What? I'm beautiful now?

57
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm beautiful now.

58
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Wait.

59
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,680
Why do you look prettier all of sudden?

60
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
-Me? -Yes, you, Aim-Orn.

61
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,880
How did you get prettier? Can you please tell me?

62
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
So beautiful.

63
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Can I get a selfie?

64
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
Look at her. So beautiful. So photogenic.

65
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
-Let's get a selfie. -So beautiful.

66
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
She's beautiful.

67
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,440
I have to go.

68
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,360
Sure.

69
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,000
Hello?

70
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,960
Dao, we have a photoshoot scheduled for next week.

71
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll meet you there.

72
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,600
The shoot is at school?

73
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,520
Yes, I got permission from the school director.

74
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
For distinguished alums like me, it's no problem at all.

75
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm kidding.

76
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
I plan to do both your photoshoot

77
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,600
and the PR work that the school director hired me to do.

78
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,240
-I'll do both at once. -I see.

79
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Dao, hold on.

80
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,480
-Yes? -I have a question.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've heard that there's a new student at school.

82
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,640
She's quite pretty, right?

83
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
Her name's Aim-Orn, right?

84
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,200
Listen, I should go now.

85
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,800
I have to go to my class.

86
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,400
NARINKARUNA BUILDING, BENJADARASUKSA SCHOOL

87
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,000
What the hell?

88
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,480
How come she has more followers than me after just one week?

89
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Damn it.

90
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Tell me what you did. I want to be beautiful too.

91
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
I already said that I can't tell you. How many times do I have to say it?

92
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,560
I made a promise to them.

93
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,160
Come on. Please tell me.

94
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,400
You don't understand.

95
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,520
Just thinking about telling you…

96
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,160
Shit, I already feel like…

97
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,440
like some weird shit is going on.

98
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,000
Like what?

99
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,000
Shit.

100
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,080
They know. Shit.

101
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,240
You shouldn't have asked me.

102
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Hey, wait! Don't--

103
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
Hey.

104
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Have you seen Aim-Orn?

105
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,800
Hold on. Let me check.

106
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, her latest photo looks like it was taken in a bathroom here.

107
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,760
Here.

108
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,240
See the mirror? That looks just like a school bathroom.

109
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
So… so you…

110
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,520
you follow Aim-Orn too?

111
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah, of course. Everyone at our school does.

112
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,440
What the hell? She's been so jumpy since she got pretty.

113
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,360
Yeah.

114
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,360
I wouldn't mind being jumpy if it meant I got to be pretty.

115
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
By the way, someone asked Aim-Orn what she did to get so much prettier.

116
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
-Yeah? -Yeah.

117
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,400
Well, what did she do?

118
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
I want to be beautiful too.

119
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,160
I have no clue.

120
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
She wouldn't answer, no matter what.

121
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Could it be a ghost remedy?

122
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,760
Only ghosts can answer that.

123
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,040
-That's crazy. -People don't know their secrets.

124
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,480
You're crazy.

125
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,920
-Hey. -What?

126
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,160
Have you seen Aim-Orn?

127
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,520
Well?

128
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,000
-Didn't you see her leave? -Yeah.

129
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
You're useless.

130
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,680
What?

131
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,840
Dao.

132
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,760
What are you up to?

133
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,400
Nothing, ma'am.

134
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,840
Aim.

135
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,360
Can I talk to you?

136
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
So, you want to sign a contract with an agency, right?

137
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,920
-I can give you some advice. -You can help me, Dao?

138
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Of course.

139
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
What a strange question.

140
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
Thanks.

141
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,920
By the way, can I ask you something?

142
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,240
What did you do to get prettier?

143
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
Well…

144
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,440
I can't tell you. Sorry.

145
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,360
Why not, Aim?

146
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,280
Please tell me. Please?

147
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,640
I had cosmetic surgery.

148
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,640
That's not true.

149
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,800
What sort of surgery

150
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,240
could your face recover from overnight?

151
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,280
Even if that were possible,

152
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,720
you wouldn't be able to afford it.

153
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,640
I really can't tell you.

154
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,920
I made a promise to them.

155
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
It's too risky.

156
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Aim.

157
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,440
We'll keep it between the two of us. I won't tell anyone.

158
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
It's too hard to believe.

159
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
No matter how unbelievable it is, it happened, didn't it?

160
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,360
Look at you.

161
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Aim.

162
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,080
Are you hiding something?

163
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,640
Are you hiding something here?

164
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,440
Dao, there's nothing in here.

165
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,960
Then just tell me the truth.

166
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,800
-Dao, let go. -Why keep secrets?

167
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard a rumor.

168
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
It's a ghost remedy, right?

169
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,960
That's why you can't tell me.

170
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,120
Leave me alone.

171
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,600
You ripped my nail.

172
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,080
Crazy bitch!

173
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,040
How come she's prettier?

174
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,080
Dao.

175
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,960
What are you up to?

176
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,840
Nothing, ma'am.

177
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
No, Dao!

178
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
You can't do that, sweetie.

179
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Here. Press this on your wound.

180
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,320
Ma'am, I'm so sorry that you and Dao will get home late today.

181
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,520
It's all right. These things happen.

182
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Are you coming? The mall is still open. I want to buy more foundation and serum.

183
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,160
Are you coming?

184
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
Wait, Dao!

185
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,880
ROOM FOR RENT. CALL MS. NOK.

186
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
NARINKARUNA BUILDING, BENJADARASUKSA SCHOOL

187
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
Okay.

188
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,280
Smile a little. Right. Great. Very good.

189
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,480
This is the last set.

190
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,080
Three, two… Very nice. Show your teeth a bit when you smile.

191
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,280
All right.

192
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,000
Turn to the other side a bit.

193
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
Great.

194
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Does the school need any more?

195
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,760
Well,

196
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,880
we should have enough pictures. Dao's one of the best in the business.

197
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
They'll want to use all her pictures.

198
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,200
She's done photoshoots since middle school,

199
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
and now she's about to graduate.

200
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
OUTSTANDING STUDENTS, QUALITY CURRICULUM

201
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,120
-Thanks for your time today, Dao. -No problem.

202
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,760
Excuse me.

203
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Would you mind retouching my finger a bit?

204
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,120
You see,

205
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,560
I got bitten by a dog.

206
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,360
You know, something like this

207
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
really shouldn't happen to a professional model.

208
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,040
Come on. I'm just joking.

209
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Of course I can do it for you.

210
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
The look on your face…

211
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
-I'm sorry, sweetie. -It's okay.

212
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Dao's friend is beautiful too.

213
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,600
Now that we're done with Dao's shoot, could you give us a little more time?

214
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,680
I want to create a profile for a girl to submit to the agency.

215
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes, of course.

216
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
But who might that be?

217
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
-Could it be… -Yes.

218
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,920
-Aim. -Aim.

219
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,600
That's good.

220
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
-Smile like you do naturally. -Okay.

221
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
That's good. Just smile. Yes. Very good.

222
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,000
Relax, sweetie.

223
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,680
-Okay. -Aim, I want to make you a star.

224
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
-I'll help you sign a contract. -Okay.

225
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay. Turn to the left a little bit.

226
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes. Good.

227
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,520
Sweetie?

228
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,440
Aim.

229
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640
-This way. -Okay.

230
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,840
Look at the camera.

231
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,400
-Now smile. -Good.

232
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,600
Try a welcoming smile.

233
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
Okay, great.

234
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
You look very cute.

235
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,000
Nice.

236
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,600
Hey, don't you think Aim-Orn looks more beautiful lately?

237
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,240
-Let's watch Aim-Orn's photoshoot. -I'll come with you.

238
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,680
I think Aim-Orn will be a big star. She's just so beautiful.

239
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Yeah, I agree.

240
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,080
Bigger than Dao for sure.

241
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
Dao, what are you doing? Are you going through Aim's things?

242
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,640
Did you find her beauty secret? Let me know when you do.

243
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,760
What?

244
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,960
What do you mean by that?

245
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Hey, you're being too harsh.

246
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,440
Look, I'm just kidding. I heard that everyone says that about you.

247
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,440
You've been weird lately.

248
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,120
Hey, what's going on?

249
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,080
Let's take a look. Let's go.

250
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,520
Let's just go.

251
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,800
You're such a pain.

252
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,240
Wait, sweetie. What do you have in there?

253
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't you see it's dripping everywhere?

254
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,600
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,160
I'd like to rent this room.

256
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,200
Okay.

257
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,800
Hey, guard!

258
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,440
Hurry and get a mop to clean this up! Don't just stand there!

259
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes, ma'am!

260
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,560
Damn.

261
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,680
What the hell? She threw away perfectly good food.

262
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,640
Psycho bitch.

263
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm not feeling well.

264
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm going to sign up with an agency soon.

265
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm so freaking happy.

266
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,840
My dream has almost come true.

267
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,280
How did I get pretty?

268
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,680
Sometimes, I'm not sure…

269
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
if the beauty I got is worth it.

270
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
But I'm getting used to it.

271
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,040
Yeah.

272
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,360
I'll go get something to eat.

273
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
Yeah.

274
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Takeout.

275
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,200
What the hell is up with her?

276
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,120
What's wrong, sweetie?

277
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
Why are you lying here?

278
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
You must be drunk.

279
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,000
Shit!

280
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,280
Come on, open!

281
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,760
PLEASE STOP TRYING. YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW. I'M WARNING YOU.

282
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,600
"Please stop trying."

283
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,560
"You shouldn't know."

284
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,160
"I'm warning you."

285
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,120
PLEASE STOP TRYING. YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW. I'M WARNING YOU.

286
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,840
Dao.

287
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,480
Look at it!

288
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,360
See how badly this bitch insulted me.

289
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,000
Her true personality is freaking nasty,

290
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,920
but she pretends to be shy.

291
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
Why did you write such things to insult Dao?

292
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,360
Isn't it her right to choose whether to tell anyone?

293
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,520
-Dao! -Wait!

294
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,120
Wait. Stop it. Enough.

295
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
Stop it.

296
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,440
-Just let her go. -Enough.

297
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Stop, all of you.

298
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
And the two of you,

299
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,960
come to my office and calm down.

300
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
Let me remind you

301
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,160
that you two are the faces of our school.

302
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,000
Whatever you do,

303
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,560
don't let it ruin our image, all right?

304
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,600
As for you, Aim-Orn,

305
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,800
the alumna who's with the agency

306
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
is coming to sign you up tomorrow.

307
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,960
You should be mindful of your behavior.

308
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,280
It's your dream, isn't it?

309
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,600
Going forward, if there's a problem, just talk about it nicely.

310
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,600
You're classmates.

311
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,520
Figure things out together.

312
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,800
MODEL SCHOOL, OUTSTANDING STUDENTS, QUALITY CURRICULUM

313
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,480
You shouldn't stalk me, Dao.

314
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,160
You're the one who almost ruined everything,

315
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
not me.

316
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,480
Why do you say that?

317
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,400
You're the one who always starts it.

318
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,440
Then just tell me

319
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
what you did to get pretty.

320
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
Why is that so hard?

321
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
I can't do that, Dao.

322
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I already told you that it's a curse.

323
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,480
If I tell you…

324
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,240
I'll lose everything.

325
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
I'd never let that happen.

326
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,520
If you don't tell me…

327
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,280
you'll lose the chance to sign a contract for sure.

328
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,560
Think about it.

329
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,880
If I send this video to the agency,

330
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,160
will they still want to sign a freak like you?

331
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,040
Can you promise me

332
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
that you'll keep everything secret?

333
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,120
So now you can tell me?

334
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,480
What about this stupid curse?

335
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
Is it gone now?

336
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,000
The curse hasn't changed.

337
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,360
I still can't tell you.

338
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,360
But I'll show you

339
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
what I have to become

340
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,360
and how I earn what I have today.

341
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,920
Then you might change your mind.

342
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,120
You underestimate me.

343
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,440
Hurry up!

344
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,800
About the dead cat…

345
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,560
I ate it.

346
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,400
I'll go get something to eat.

347
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
Yeah.

348
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,320
A takeout.

349
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,960
Bye for now.

350
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,240
Well,

351
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,040
if that's a condition of the curse…

352
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,200
I understand

353
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,320
that it might be difficult.

354
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,280
But if you can do it,

355
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
well, so can I.

356
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,480
Well, open it.

357
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,240
Shit!

358
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,160
It freaking stinks.

359
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,320
This rotten odor…

360
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,240
has become a pleasant smell to me.

361
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,160
Really?

362
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,200
It isn't so bad, then.

363
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
In fact,

364
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
it will make my life easier.

365
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,320
Well, go inside.

366
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Get in.

367
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,560
You're actually much worse than I thought.

368
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,160
Where is the secret?

369
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,600
If you don't tell me…

370
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
I'll share this video and show the whole world

371
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
that the state of your room

372
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
and the way you look

373
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
are complete opposites.

374
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,240
It started with me

375
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,840
wanting to be beautiful like you.

376
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Now, every night, I have to eat rotten things,

377
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,640
like what you saw.

378
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,960
I can see that, obviously. It's all over the room.

379
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
Are there other conditions?

380
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes, there are.

381
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,200
You can't tell anyone the secret.

382
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,080
I already know that.

383
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,240
You keep repeating that. It's so annoying.

384
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,000
Keeping it a secret is good, though,

385
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,360
because I don't want anyone to be prettier than me.

386
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,240
There are more conditions, Dao.

387
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,920
They're written on the label of the drink you're looking for.

388
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,760
I messed up.

389
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,200
I drank it without reading the label.

390
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,040
"Penanggalan."

391
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,560
PENANGGALAN

392
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,480
What is it?

393
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,400
Point to it.

394
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Tell me where it is.

395
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,240
Tell me now.

396
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,880
Tell me now!

397
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,600
Where is it?

398
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
Why the hell won't you tell me?

399
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,480
Where is it?

400
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,080
Just point to where it is.

401
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,320
Why the hell won't you tell me? Tell me.

402
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Where is it?

403
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,280
Did you just fall?

404
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,560
Is that what I hear every night?

405
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,480
Do you go crazy every night, you psycho?

406
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,840
Are you really coughing?

407
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,840
I thought you were throwing up to try to lose weight.

408
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,520
There you go again.

409
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,800
Do I just drink it?

410
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,920
You freaky bitch.

411
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,280
Here we go.

412
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,760
To become more beautiful, I'm willing to do anything.

413
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,560
Let's see

414
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,600
how beautiful I'll be.

415
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,280
Let's see

416
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,880
if it works in a heartbeat.

417
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,240
Let me see.

418
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,600
What the fuck are you?

419
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,280
What did you give me to drink?

420
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,080
You drank it, right?

421
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,880
Now I can tell you the secret.

422
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,160
What you just drank…

423
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,280
WHAT IS PENANGGALAN?

424
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,800
…was our saliva.

425
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
KRASUE, A FLESH-EATING SPIRIT

426
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,680
Did you…

427
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,240
did you kill people then eat their raw flesh?

428
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,680
No.

429
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,320
I don't eat it right away.

430
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,280
It has to rot nicely first.

431
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,360
From now on,

432
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,200
your nose will tell you

433
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,080
what you can eat

434
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,880
and what you can't.

435
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,000
Hey, sweetheart.

436
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,360
What are you doing in there so loudly?

437
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,000
Why is it louder than usual in there today?

438
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,360
Sweetie.

439
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,200
I smell a baby.

440
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,520
Sweetie.
