1
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,119
This is me, my name is Sun
and I have a special power.

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,240
I can hear other people's thoughts.

3
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,599
But should it be called special?

4
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,680
Well, if I hear
a lot of other people's thoughts,

5
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,319
I will be stressed
and get headache like…

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,319
my head will explode into pieces.

7
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,760
So I don't want to be close to anyone.

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,040
And that made people around me,
including my fan club,

9
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,640
nickname me…

10
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,799
the Arrogant.

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,000
ONE DAY BEFORE

12
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,400
Hey, come on!

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Or our page’s followers would go down
from 100K to two.

14
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,879
Nah, at least three.

15
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,840
You, me and Keuan.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,840
Sun, get it together, man.

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,560
How many years have we worked on
"Everyday with Sun" page

18
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,759
before we got this far?

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,240
You said you don’t want a full-time job,

20
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,080
don’t want to meet lots of people

21
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,360
because you can hear
other people’s thoughts

22
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,159
so you asked me to create this page

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,319
on YouTube and Facebook.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
Now that you have
lots of fan club followers,

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,439
you're practically running away. Why?

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
I don’t want to hear the voice
of their thoughts,

27
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,800
it causes headache. I don’t like it.

28
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,520
So? You will keep running away?

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,000
You want to be the Arrogant?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,520
You know, your fans
are becoming anti-fans,

31
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,919
the subscriber count
could have been negative by now.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
Can I ask you something,

33
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,360
between subscribers, views and me,

34
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,560
which one is more valuable for you?

35
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,479
Views!

36
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,360
Because it is money,

37
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,680
if there are no views
I will quit and find another job.

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Why are you grumbling about everything?

39
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,199
Now I am here with you
creating content to get views.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,879
You're here, but you're not really here.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,879
I can hear what you think.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,919
I know. You don't want me 
to grumble, right?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,919
Then hear it from my brain instead.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,919
Enough! Stop thinking.
You're giving me a headache!

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,080
Then you better think straight.

46
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Love to listen to this?

47
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,159
So just listen to it,
music or anything you want!

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Will you get in?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go.

50
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,080
Stop, stop, please.

51
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,560
Wow, thank you for stopping the car.

52
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,560
My car broke down.

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,639
Can you give me a ride to the village?

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
This is Sun! That arrogant YouTuber.

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,319
He actually looks cute.
Too bad he is not a nice guy.

56
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,439
Arrogant, so arrogant, still arrogant.

57
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,399
I smile to you this much,
shouldn't you smile back to me?

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,839
And his friend? He seems so bad as well.

59
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,720
Or do you have some gasoline?

60
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,560
Should I have it?

61
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,360
How are they going to get there?

62
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,920
There are many cars around here,
they will find one.

63
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,680
Keuan!

64
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,879
Sun! Pete! How did you get here?

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
We drove.

66
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,279
Brownie.

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
What’s wrong with you?

68
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,959
Ouch! Are you crazy? Get out of the way.

69
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm sorry. Is it firm?

70
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,839
What is firm?

71
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,759
Disgusting!

72
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
Why, what’s the difference
between me and Sun?

73
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,879
Everything. Move!

74
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,959
Sun, my name is Brownie
I am a fan of yours.

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,079
Hello.

76
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,279
Miss you.

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,519
Miss you, too.

78
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,600
Haven’t seen you for so long. How are you?

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,759
It's been so long.

80
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,759
I am good.

81
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,279
Good, good.

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,199
I will take you around.

83
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,680
Why didn’t you tell me you would come?

84
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Hey!

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,519
Tubtab.

86
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,439
How did you get here?

87
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,480
Cracked eggs.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,399
You broke the eggs as soon as you came.

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Did it get all over you?

90
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,399
Take them. Ew!

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,959
Ew! Nasty.

92
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,600
I told you, they would get here.

93
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,959
She is my master degree’s junior.

94
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,839
She is writing a thesis
about community ways

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,680
so she asks me to help with information.

96
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,120
Never knew that she is your FC.

97
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
It’s good to have other people around,

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,959
so he can get used to it.

99
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,959
How about you?
Do you have any content ideas to suggest?

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,399
Like, going to the dam
or walking around the village?

101
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,720
The dam is not a problem,

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,399
what you need to concern is… him.

103
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,279
To make him look more friendly,

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,040
approachable,
not an arrogant YouTuber like this

105
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,800
is a very hard work.

106
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,319
Very hard!

107
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,959
Yes, but I have to do this.

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,959
If I don’t do this,
our page will be closed,

109
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,839
then we gotta separate on our own ways.

110
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
You are really good at threatening.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
Okay, okay.

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I will do anything you want.

113
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,720
Except two things.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,879
Didn’t you just say anything?

115
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,680
Just two things.

116
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,079
Okay. All right.

117
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
First, Keuan!

118
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,759
You have to be MC with me.

119
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,519
Second,

120
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,680
I must not be in a group
of more than five people.

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,759
Deal! Let's do it.

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,759
Keuan, take your friends to grab a bite.

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,759
What’s on the menu, Dad?

124
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,319
Whatever you want.
Just don't grab each other.

125
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,680
Your dad said
"Just don't grab each other."

126
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,759
How did your dad know I want to grab him?

127
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,039
How did your dad know
I want to grab you too?

128
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,080
What! Don’t say that you want to grab me?

129
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,879
Don't tell me you can read my mind.

130
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,919
Nah, I am not like you,

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,559
I can control myself.

132
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,360
Hello, boys.

133
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,639
What are you guys doing here?

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,639
Tubtab!

135
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,559
Have you cleaned yourself up?

136
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,399
Why? If I haven’t,
will three of you help me out? Wow…

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,759
So what are you doing in Bangkok?

138
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,039
I have never seen you come home at all.

139
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,519
I don’t want to,

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,039
I will tell you my job position
over there.

141
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,399
Listen carefully.

142
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,519
My title is the manager of a rising writer

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,279
whose pen name is Sixth Sense Writer.

144
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,879
Her work doesn't
make you see ghost spirits,

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,279
but it makes you, while reading,

146
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,480
enchanted and obsessed.

147
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,559
Are you a manager?

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,320
Me, too.

149
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,639
I am the manager of a famous YouTuber.

150
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,919
-Every video we made was a hit…
-Really?

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,919
Yeah. Hit the floor.

152
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,799
You better not say it.

153
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:04,519
Oh, you heard what I said
with the headphones on?

154
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,519
Everyone said that the MC is so arrogant.

155
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,519
Is it true?

156
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,039
Why, any problem?

157
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
No, nothing.

158
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,600
I just want to share that people like us
need lots of support from our fans.

159
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,360
If you act arrogant like this,

160
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
it is not surprising that
your work would fail.

161
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Whether it's a hit or a miss,

162
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,559
arrogant or friendly,

163
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,799
it’s my business, not yours.

164
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,039
Today, Mae Rawan villagers.

165
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,480
We are going to learn about
brown rice milling, with support

166
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,919
from the EGAT at the Bhumibol Dam.

167
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,000
Sun, go for it.

168
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,639
I know you don’t like
to be bothered while filming,

169
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,879
so I will cheer you up over there.

170
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
Good that you know!

171
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
So please do your thesis over there

172
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
and be out of the way.

173
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,039
Bad mouth.

174
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,600
If you are not Sun’s friend,
you will see me.

175
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,960
Good. I love seeing you.

176
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,480
Funny jokes. Let's start.

177
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
What?

178
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,159
People here are more than
what we agreed.

179
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,799
Just ignore them, okay?

180
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,759
All right?

181
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Sun,

182
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,399
five, four, three, two, action.

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
Hello, now we are here
in Mae Rawan community,

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
one of the communities
around the Bhumibol Dam.

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,879
I've heard that the rice here is superb.

186
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,000
EGAT bought rice from the villagers

187
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,399
to use in the restaurant of Bhumibol Dam

188
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,120
and some are sold to tourists as well.

189
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,519
So, it's a sustainable income
for the community, right?

190
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes, it is.

191
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,960
So, let’s see the demonstration of
how to use rice milling machine.

192
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,480
Let's go see it.

193
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:49,960
Next.

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,799
Excuse me! May my friend try it?

195
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,480
Of course! Come on.

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,120
No. No way.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,720
Do it. Just once. You can do it, dude.

198
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,320
Please give him a hand.

199
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,360
Hey! Sun!

200
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,600
Does he have panic disorder?

201
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,879
Are you all right?

202
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,240
Are you okay?

203
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,519
Do not bother me.

204
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,759
Hey!

205
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm worrying about you
that’s why I’ve asked.

206
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,159
Why would you care?

207
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,559
Are we friends?

208
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,120
Wait!

209
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,840
What?

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,320
Do you have an empty head?

211
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,399
Don't you have any thoughts?

212
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,159
Hey!

213
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,039
What a bad mouth.

214
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,759
That's too harsh, don't you think?

215
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,159
I want to tell you something.

216
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,879
You are such a faker.

217
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,720
You're using these people
to get more views,

218
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,960
acting like you're a laid-back person.
But I know it is hard,

219
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,399
because you are not.

220
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
You don't have the right to judge me?

221
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,320
You don't have the right
to call someone empty-headed, either.

222
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,240
Not someone,

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
just you!

224
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
What are you doing?

225
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,720
Why can't I hear her thoughts?

226
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,279
Teenagers in your village
don't go to sleep?

227
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,120
Doesn't sound like people in my village.

228
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,559
Hey! Can I take your bike?

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
Now?

230
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,840
What kind of mood he is in?

231
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,679
Bro! Do you have a lighter?

232
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,679
Nope.

233
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
You look unfamiliar. Are you local here?

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This area? No.

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Good.

236
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,360
Why?

237
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,679
Let’s go.

238
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,080
Keuan,

239
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:59,360
I have posted a short video that we
filmed on the rice milling demonstration.

240
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,639
Yeah?

241
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,399
How was it? The views spiked up?

242
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
Spiked down!

243
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,359
I think Sun shouldn’t launch a short video

244
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
because there are still
lots of bad comments.

245
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,720
I think you should post something
to make people curious what you are up to.

246
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,559
And the schedule of video release dates.

247
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
You know it all.
Why don’t you make your own channel?

248
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,000
I don’t know it all.

249
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,440
Only because I am Sun’s fan
and follow his page.

250
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,960
You seem to know everything about Sun.

251
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,240
How about your thesis?

252
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,559
I am working on it.

253
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,079
Don’t you need me to review it?

254
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,720
Actually, you should change
your thesis subject

255
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,920
from local wisdom to fan club wisdom.

256
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,119
Pete.

257
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,920
Don't be so harsh!

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,920
Are you in my fan club?

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
How can you know
what I am doing or not doing?

260
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:43,960
So confident!

261
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,759
Anyway, I can be in your fan club
if you want me to.

262
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,599
Jerk!

263
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,920
Sun, are you all right?

264
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
I have something to tell you.

265
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I don’t feel hungry anymore.
I’ll leave.

266
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,759
What is it?

267
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
Well…

268
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,119
At home, we usually put
dried bamboo shoot in Kai Palo,

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,119
make it more delicious.

270
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,119
Hmmm! So delicious.

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,119
This fish is yummy too.

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,440
Easy girl. Or you are going to choke.

273
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,319
Your mother is a really good cook.

274
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,079
Look. Kai Palo with dried bamboo shoot,

275
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
stir-fried mushrooms
with glass noodles in oyster sauce,

276
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,799
and this fried fish is so fresh.

277
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,279
Of course!
Because my house is near the dam.

278
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,000
Where there's water, there's forest.

279
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,400
Where there's forest, there's food.

280
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,000
There's food, we're full.
We're full, we sell the food.

281
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,039
Then we get money to pay for men. Wow.

282
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,680
Well, life is so good.

283
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,799
This is why they say men are life.

284
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,119
Water is life!

285
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,559
Ah, you knew it.

286
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,920
But your life is a novel.

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,599
How's it going? Got the plot yet?

288
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,200
Not yet.

289
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,519
Brownie! Where are you going?

290
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,960
I am finding a place to write my thesis.

291
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
What are you guys doing?

292
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,440
Exercising maybe?

293
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,880
Don’t you see we are eating?

294
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,519
I am getting hungry now.

295
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,759
Honestly, I don’t like her.

296
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,599
Come on!
We might get something new from her.

297
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,839
Ask her to eat with us.

298
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,279
Brownie, let’s eat together.

299
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
Chubby, give me a seat.

300
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,319
Go get the rice.

301
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,119
Who asked you to join? Bored!

302
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,480
Give it to me!

303
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,519
Don’t you follow your favorite one today?

304
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,640
Sun is busy today.

305
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,960
What’s so busy?

306
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,920
What gossip girls.

307
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,799
You see,

308
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,440
I don’t know. They didn’t tell me,

309
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,640
but they acted so strange.

310
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,480
I think it must be a very important topic.

311
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,200
The more important it is,
the more I want to know.

312
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,519
I think you are good at writing
because you are so…

313
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,160
curious about other people's lives.

314
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,160
I will take that as a compliment.

315
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,599
Yes, it is.

316
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,799
But I really want to know
what those three are up to.

317
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,720
Sun, are you sure they are thieves?

318
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,799
I'm sure.

319
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,240
Never, idiot,

320
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,720
wait and see thieves
will rob the whole village tomorrow.

321
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,720
Let’s go.

322
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,759
Hey!

323
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,559
Let’s do it 11 pm tomorrow
everyone should be in bed.

324
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,759
I really heard that.

325
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,640
Wait, bro.

326
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,640
What's happening?

327
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,680
Can you please reveal your face?

328
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,759
Why!

329
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,000
Reveal your face, please!

330
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,799
Sun!

331
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,839
Calm down.

332
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
Hey! Sun!

333
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,920
I know you. You are the net idol.

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,279
And people call you the Arrogant guy!

335
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,039
Now I know not just arrogant

336
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,599
but also bad manners!

337
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,960
Have you unfollowed his page yet?

338
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Sorry.

339
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,640
Don’t worry, friend!

340
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,599
They are tired of working
in hot weather all day long.

341
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,440
It’s okay.

342
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,079
Come on.

343
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,960
Let me give you a hug.

344
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,640
It’s okay, dude, calm down.

345
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,039
What in the world…

346
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,000
It’s all right.

347
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,400
What are those three going to do?

348
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,039
Hmm. Village headman,
I mean Keuan’s father.

349
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,880
Maybe he wants them to check something.

350
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,039
Really?

351
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,480
There is only one thing
coming in my mind now.

352
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,839
Are you in a hurry to hell…

353
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,160
to find cows or buffaloes or what?

354
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,839
Don’t curse at them!

355
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,039
How come! What if something happens here?

356
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,480
Isn’t it frightening?

357
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,279
What’s up?

358
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,200
Do you have number?

359
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,359
Number? I feel numb-er
when I don’t have enough sleep.

360
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Not funny!

361
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,960
Yes, but I won’t give you.

362
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,279
You think you are beautiful
and can be arrogant?

363
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,400
And you have problem with that?

364
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,240
They should have come when I was alone.

365
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,079
Pete.

366
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,240
Where is Sun?

367
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,880
You’re breathing in and out Sun?

368
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,880
What do you like about him?

369
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,240
Don’t you think he is arrogant?

370
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,640
Nope, I like everything he is.

371
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
Why?

372
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,519
Because he is a good man.

373
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,759
How?

374
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,079
He is good in every way.

375
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,079
I am shy now.

376
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,960
How long have you followed him?

377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,839
Well…

378
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
From the beginning.

379
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,160
It’s a very long time.

380
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,319
So, do you have any idea of

381
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,039
how we could get more followers
on the page?

382
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,839
Yeah, I think there's a way.

383
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,359
But I need something in exchange.

384
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,720
What is it?

385
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,319
You need to help me be closer to Sun.

386
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,599
Okay? Otherwise, I won’t help you.

387
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,839
Fine. Deal.

388
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,079
You promise?

389
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,200
Yeah.

390
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,759
-Okay?
-Okay, yeah. Okay.

391
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,920
Good fan club.

392
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,839
Not only his fan club,
later I will become his girlfriend.

393
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, I am going to work now.

394
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,559
Hey!

395
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,079
What?

396
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,359
Why?

397
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,200
How dare you!

398
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,440
There they come to help us…

399
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,119
Fucking slow!

400
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,799
Wait! Stop! Don’t kill them.

401
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,720
I hit the target.

402
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,359
Good job.

403
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,759
They are the ones
I talked about yesterday.

404
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,680
You sure?

405
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Are you going to rob the village?

406
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,359
Yeah, well…

407
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,079
it was just a brief idea,
not a serious one.

408
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,359
It’s wrong even thinking about it.

409
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,920
And you two make loud noise revving up
during the night, right?

410
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,079
I will inform the police.

411
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,039
Please don’t!

412
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,160
We're sorry.

413
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,880
We will not do it anymore.

414
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,680
Please don’t inform the police.

415
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,920
Please!

416
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,119
Where are you going?

417
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Thank you for helping us.

418
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,119
Don’t ride if you’re not good at it.

419
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,519
If you'll complain, then don't help me.

420
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,000
Stand up on your own then.

421
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,519
Are you okay?

422
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,759
I am okay.

423
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,519
Thank you, anyway.

424
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:54,160
Sun!

425
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,920
What happened?

426
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
I fell off the bike.

427
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,880
Really? Or you meant to fall.

428
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,720
Come on, Sun! Let me help.

429
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Everything is okay?

430
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,119
You can go,

431
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,119
I’ll help Anna.

432
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,519
Hey, Sun! Wait for me.

433
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,200
Bye.

434
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,680
Do you like Sun?

435
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,839
No.

436
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,480
That’s good. Let’s go.
I’ll help you. Come!

437
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,920
Interesting.

438
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
I got it.

439
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,559
What’ve you got?

440
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,000
New story plot, isn’t it?

441
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,640
Tell me, tell me now.

442
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,799
Uh! You always think
about new story plots.

443
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,519
How’s it?

444
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,279
I won’t tell you for now.

445
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,480
No! You can't keep it.

446
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,680
Let me know so I can help you to prove

447
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,680
and see whether it’s good or not.

448
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,039
If not, then I won’t let it pass.

449
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,279
Otherwise, you will lose your reputation.

450
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,240
I'll hit your mouth now!

451
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,119
Did you forget already?
I am Anna, your richness bringer.

452
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,559
Exactly, you are.

453
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,880
I have to hit my mouth
because you are my money spinner.

454
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,400
Hey! Did you just give me
a compliment or not?

455
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,079
Yes, it’s a compliment.
Wait. What’s the story about?

456
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,039
I won’t tell you.

457
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,680
Let me see.

458
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,200
I haven't even started.

459
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,279
Tell me some! How does it feel?

460
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,079
Morning, guys.

461
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,880
You two woke up so early.
Why are you coming here?

462
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,480
I am finding the place to write a story.

463
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,359
Where is Sun?

464
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
He is coming here soon!

465
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,759
Why?

466
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,400
Can't we ask about him?

467
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
No, you can't.

468
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,000
You are a dog or what? So fierce!

469
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,480
Where are you guys going to film today?

470
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,640
Can we join you?

471
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,599
No!

472
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,000
-Who…
-Why?

473
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,960
-Who…
-Who?

474
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,079
Who’s asking you?

475
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
Ugh! Very ancient joke.

476
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,200
Ugh, yeah! I have to say it!

477
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,000
Couldn’t think anything at the moment.

478
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,880
Well, Kit, while we are recording,

479
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,759
I will ask you questions
and you can answer truly.

480
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,480
Just answer as what I’ll ask.

481
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,720
Take it easy and no worries.

482
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,119
Not excited at all,

483
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,119
I'm about to pee myself!

484
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,640
Don’t be excited!

485
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,160
You can go to the toilet now, if you want.

486
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,119
We still have time.

487
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,720
Thank you.

488
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,920
All right.

489
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,480
Sun! Set your hair.

490
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,640
Hey!

491
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
Don’t scream.

492
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,839
I am cheering Sun up. Why?

493
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,759
Everyone!

494
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,759
During the record,

495
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,160
please do not make a noise.

496
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,079
Fine.

497
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,720
Listen! Don’t make any noise.

498
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,680
Yeah, I heard. I just acknowledged.

499
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,200
Sun! Take the headphone off

500
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
and zip your pants.

501
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,160
Stop screaming!

502
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,079
Not yet…

503
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,640
No one’s screaming!

504
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,920
He's losing his mind.

505
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,160
Okay, let’s get started! Ready?
Five, four, three, two, action!

506
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,119
Hello! Now we are at the Bhumibol Dam,

507
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
with me Sun, Keuan and our guest

508
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,119
I am Kit.

509
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,359
Kit.

510
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,039
Kit is one of EGAT's staff.

511
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:06,079
Today, he will provide useful knowledge
and present this beautiful place.

512
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,519
Kit,

513
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,119
what do we call where we are standing now?

514
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,720
We are standing on
the crest of the Bhumibol Dam

515
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,640
located in Sam Ngao District, Tak.

516
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,599
Gotta fart to you!

517
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,720
The headspring of our Bhumibol Dam
has is from Chiangmai.

518
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,480
Why you keep looking at me!
See! Wanna fight?

519
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,400
Sure, Wanna fight? Come!

520
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,319
Stop it!

521
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,640
If you wanna argue, just leave here.

522
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,039
Let’s continue.

523
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,359
Come here you two.

524
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Ouch! You're hurting me.

525
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,400
Come here.

526
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
You two, stay here.

527
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,960
So you don’t disturb Sun.

528
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,400
Disturb him?

529
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,920
I didn’t make any noise, nothing at all!

530
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,279
I am so confused.

531
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,519
Because you are a giant!

532
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,119
You disturb Sun’s eyes. Got it?

533
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,119
Are you bullying me?

534
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,759
No, I just stated the truth. Look at you.

535
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,759
Look at yourself!

536
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,960
Thank you for correcting me!
But yeah, you're huge. It’s disturbing.

537
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,039
I am not that big!

538
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,799
Enough! Stop it!

539
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
Your sound will be in.

540
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,279
Shhhhh! Stop! Stop!

541
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,759
She doesn’t stop.

542
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,319
-You started it!
-You started it!

543
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,240
You!

544
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,359
Well,

545
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,480
if you two want to come,
just make yourself useful.

546
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,839
Sure! What can we do?

547
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,200
Chicky, chicky!

548
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,640
Here, I got it! So fresh.

549
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,039
I think it’s enough.
We don’t eat that much.

550
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:50,960
Want some more?

551
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,960
-We call it a surveyor's telescope
-A surveyor's telescope.

552
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,680
It’s used to measure
subsidence level of the dam,

553
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,759
-to ensure its security.
-I see.

554
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,359
What you see over there is a staff gauge.

555
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,279
We used this camera
to read the subsidence scale.

556
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,559
I see.

557
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,519
And do you have to do this
every month or…

558
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,079
Yes, we do it every month.

559
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,199
Ah! Every month.

560
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,480
Yes, we keep the record every month.

561
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,920
If this camera is lost,
will your salary be deducted?

562
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,119
Definitely!

563
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,440
All right. Great.

564
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,360
Okay. Now we're finishing it up.

565
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,360
All right.

566
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,199
So, for today, our trip
at the Bhumibol Dam ends here!

567
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,800
Please follow, give likes,
and share our page.

568
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,760
And we will see you
on the next trip, Everyday with Sun.

569
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,599
Cut! Okay.

570
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,280
Pete, give them some money.

571
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,559
Okay.

572
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,360
No, it’s okay.

573
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,880
-10K!
-It’s okay, really.

574
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,360
-100K then!
-Deal!

575
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,679
I am already okay since 10K.

576
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
Just kidding, I don’t need it.

577
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,800
Thank you very much.

578
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,320
Let’s go.

579
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,559
Hey, Sun!

580
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,519
I think Anna is curious about you.

581
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,159
What is she curious about?

582
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,559
You go and read her thought.
I also want to know.

583
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,639
Don’t you have something in mind?

584
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
I can’t.

585
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,400
Can’t? What do you mean?

586
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,920
I can't hear what she is thinking.

587
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,360
Huh?

588
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,719
Really?

589
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,039
Ouch!

590
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,800
Let’s go! That meddler’s here again.

591
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,360
Hey, wait!

592
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,320
Why are you following me?

593
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,119
I'm not. My house is just this way.

594
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,239
Tell me, what do you want to know?

595
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,639
Can I really ask?

596
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,960
I will try to answer.

597
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,199
All right.

598
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,360
I want to ask
if I can know you more or not.

599
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,280
No.

600
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,320
So mean!

601
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,480
I just want to know
how YouTubers do their work.

602
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,719
If you want to know,
you just search it on Google.

603
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,400
Why do I have to ask Google
when I can ask you? What's the big deal?

604
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,559
Then, can I be your friend?

605
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,280
I don’t want to be your friend.

606
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:53,960
Arrogant!

607
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,719
You know, everyone wants
to know and be close with me.

608
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,920
Do you?

609
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,559
Hey!

610
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
I won’t give up!

611
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,239
Wait for me.

612
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Hey, Sun!

613
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Why couldn’t you hear Anna’s thoughts?

614
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,239
I don’t know, either!
Maybe she doesn’t have a brain.

615
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,000
No way.

616
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,000
Why?

617
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,519
You like her?

618
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,480
-I can help you.
-It’s okay.

619
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,039
That time with Nun was enough.

620
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,719
You helped me to read her mind
but when you were not around,

621
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,039
I just didn't know what was on her mind.

622
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,079
Yes, that’s why.

623
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,599
You need to learn
to love by yourself, dude!

624
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Where are you guys going? Can I come with?

625
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,159
Did you hear something?

626
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,639
I just want to know
how travelling YouTubers work!

627
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,639
Maybe I can try this job.

628
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,199
Why don’t you answer me?

629
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,480
So annoying.

630
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,920
Why so arrogant! What’s up with him?

631
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,599
Hey, Sun!

632
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,960
Where is he going?

633
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,360
Are you okay?

634
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,039
Yes, I am. Just a bit hurt.

635
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,400
I am okay, really.

636
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,639
Let me help you.

637
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,360
Thank you so much. I can go by myself.

638
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,599
I’ll ride you home.

639
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,280
No thanks, it’s okay. Thank you again.

640
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,559
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

641
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,159
This young man is so handsome and kind.

642
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,039
You know sign language?

643
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
No.

644
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,880
If you don’t know,

645
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,480
then how could you know what she said?

646
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,760
Don’t be quiet!

647
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,159
Explain to me now.

648
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,960
You know sign language, don’t you?

649
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,280
Just a little bit.

650
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,760
See! You lied to me.
You've just said you didn't know.

651
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,599
You slipped up, dude.

652
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,840
You've just said you didn’t know.

653
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,519
Well, I know here and there.

654
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,320
What on earth you want from me?

655
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,039
Why did you lie to me then?

656
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,360
Up to you!

657
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
I don’t need to explain it.

658
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,280
If there is nothing behind that,
so just tell me.

659
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,239
He must be hiding something.

660
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,400
Coffee is ready.

661
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,920
Okay.

662
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,440
Here it is.

663
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,920
Specially served.

664
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,480
This is the coffee planted
over all the dams in our country,

665
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,920
and EGAT provided knowledge

666
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,079
and developed this coffee’s recipes.

667
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,639
Wow,

668
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,199
you seem very knowledgeable.

669
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,199
I’ve asked them just now.

670
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,039
-Tastes good?
-It’s great!

671
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,559
It’s great.

672
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,360
Hey, Tubtab.

673
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
I need your help.

674
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,760
About what?

675
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,480
Well…

676
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,800
I want Sun’s information.

677
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,599
I’ve already asked him,
but he didn’t give me any.

678
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,400
Why do you want to know about him?

679
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,920
It’s for my story.

680
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,360
What?

681
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,639
You want to write about him?

682
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,639
Yeah.

683
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I finished writing its summary.

684
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,639
Really? Let me see.

685
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,679
I think this guy has a secret.

686
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
I got to find out.

687
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:41,239
I think we should let Sun
have dinner for now.

688
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,719
Just let him work.

689
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,719
Don’t bother him.

690
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,599
It’s your duty, isn’t it?

691
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,719
I’ve done it all day.

692
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,639
Let me eat for now. Let him do it.

693
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,719
He won’t have time to eat then.

694
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
Let me do it.

695
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:58,920
Eat some!

696
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,159
I'll feed you.

697
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,079
Hey!

698
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,360
Don’t tell me you guys are on a date.

699
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,440
Since you can see us through, Dad,
I guess we should come out then.

700
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,360
No way!

701
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,159
How come?

702
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,480
Stop messing with him.
He would think it’s real.

703
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,880
It’s not like you think, Dad.
Don’t misunderstand.

704
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,840
We’ve been close
since we studied in university

705
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,800
and because Sun didn’t let anyone in.

706
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,599
Do you want some more, dear?

707
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,599
I was so shocked.

708
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,599
So crazy, so cute.

709
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,480
How is it?

710
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,480
Pete!

711
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,000
Have you done it with EP1 video?

712
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,960
Why?

713
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:51,880
You want to see?

714
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,679
I want to see so bad.

715
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,679
Here!

716
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,639
If you want to see it,

717
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,880
come and wash the dishes for me.

718
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,599
So I can finish up the video.

719
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,760
Oh, yeah! You need time to do that.

720
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, right now!

721
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,800
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

722
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,320
Okay, okay.

723
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,920
Pete!

724
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,079
Do you want me to upload the video
and set the timer?

725
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,800
Upload?

726
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,159
You finished it, didn’t you?

727
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,079
Yeah.

728
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,079
You fooled me?

729
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,360
He fooled you.

730
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,119
Yeah, I got fooled to wash these dishes.

731
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,719
My hands got all dirty.

732
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,320
Pete!

733
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,960
Wait and see,
they'll end up being a couple.

734
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,199
Please, God!

735
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,079
Let our first clip be on point!

736
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,440
Give us 100 million, billion views

737
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,440
Ten thousand views are enough.

738
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,079
God blesses me, please.

739
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,000
As long as we’ve done good on content,

740
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:00,760
we don’t need any spiritual help.

741
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,480
We do need help in all way, dude!

742
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,039
It’s a bet. If we don’t get high views,

743
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,800
I will just sell toast
in front of the school then.

744
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,119
Tomorrow,

745
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,719
at 9:09 a.m.,

746
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:22,960
don’t forget to watch

747
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,880
a released video on trip by Sun.

748
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,360
And don’t forget to click like,

749
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,000
share and subscribe, guys.

750
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,239
Here we go.

751
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,079
Hey, Sun!

752
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,400
They're your supporters.

753
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,599
Looking forward to see you, Sun.

754
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:48,880
Arrogant!

755
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,239
Let’s change the MC!

756
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,320
Jerk!

757
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,599
This arrogant guy, nobody want to see him.

758
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:03,000
They are just being mean.

759
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,400
Just don’t care!
They're brave only on social.

760
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,840
We can sue these guys,
and we'd probably get a lot of money,

761
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:13,880
even more than our work income.

762
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:15,719
Meet me! I'll take screenshots.

763
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,559
Let them say what they want.

764
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,159
I don’t care.

765
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,840
The only thing I care is
that you're with me.

766
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,480
Yes, I will marry you.

767
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,679
What’s up with you?

768
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,760
You just impressed me.

769
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,599
Don’t you see? I'm irritated.

770
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,559
Come on.

771
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,760
Feel better now?

772
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,280
It's good to laugh a bit.

773
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,719
Don’t think too much.

774
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,559
I'll go to sleep now.

775
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,079
Tomorrow is another day.

776
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,639
All right,

777
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,960
I won’t think too much.

778
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,880
Excellent, young man.

779
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,840
How about his hearing people's thoughts?

780
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:45,840
Nothing’s changed much.

781
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh! There is one thing.

782
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,239
He couldn’t hear Anna’s thoughts.

783
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,239
What?

784
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:54,079
Really?

785
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,079
-Yeah!
-What?

786
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:58,920
He told me. Seems this is the first time.

787
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,760
Ah, I see!

788
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,320
That’s why Anna can follow him,

789
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,800
without him being upset.

790
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,159
He's not upset?

791
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,719
He gets even angrier.

792
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,760
He tells her to go away all the time.

793
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,320
But Anna doesn’t seem to care.

794
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,840
She still keeps following him.

795
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,239
Perhaps, Anna has fallen for him?

796
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,280
Maybe, if he’s as handsome as me.

797
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,960
What are you watching, girl?

798
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,079
Today is an auspicious day.

799
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:33,000
Sun will release his first video.

800
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:35,480
Don’t bother me, otherwise I'll hit you.

801
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,679
All right. I got you now.

802
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,559
This arrogant Sun…

803
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,400
Why do you really like him?

804
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,719
Top FC like me,

805
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,440
Not only do I like him

806
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:05,199
but I'm crazy about him.

807
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:11,840
Very excellent idea,

808
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,320
give me a hand.

809
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,039
It’s coming soon!

810
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,840
If the views are not high,

811
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,920
I think Sun would feel

812
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,480
sad and stop doing his video.

813
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,000
Let’s cheer him together.

814
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:33,960
Also my duty?

815
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:34,960
Yeah! Let’s help.

816
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,960
Okay, okay.

817
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,880
Give a heart.

818
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,400
Press here, right?

819
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,400
Yup, Dad.

820
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,400
Appreciate you all
for opening this released video.

821
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,519
Everyone, are you ready?

822
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:53,599
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

823
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,440
Dad, you’ve pressed the wrong button.

824
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,960
Here it comes.

825
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:15,880
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Let’s see his video.

826
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,360
He's so handsome.

827
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,199
But there aren’t many viewers.

828
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,639
Hey, look!

829
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,000
There are seven of them.

830
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:29,039
Still not stopping.

831
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,719
Why are the views not climbing?

832
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,440
Calm down.

833
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,679
It’s still early.

834
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,360
Who would wake up this early to watch?

835
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,079
Why don’t we upload in the evening?

836
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:41,960
This is the auspicious time, dude.

837
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,199
Auspicious,

838
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,800
but no one wakes up to watch.

839
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,599
The views get so high now, it’s unstopped.

840
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:04,960
Look!

841
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,360
Thank you, Dad.

842
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,599
ONE DAY WITH SUN

843
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,440
There are so many viewers.

844
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:14,559
I gotta give him a compliment.

845
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,760
Sun, I am Brownie.

846
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,360
Hey! What’s that?

847
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Why do they give such mean comments?

848
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,119
-What happened?
-This!

849
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,920
What did they say?

850
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,119
Such a faker!

851
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,239
Arrogant!

852
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,159
I guess you're afraid to get low views.

853
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,239
So you're acting dramatic.

854
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,440
You never even smiled before.

855
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:37,599
Good acting.

856
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:38,920
Fake.

857
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,760
Calm down!

858
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,719
Don’t be too crazy on this.

859
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,079
Are you stopping me?

860
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,400
No.

861
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,280
I just want to remind you
to know what you're doing.

862
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Fight back. Get even!

863
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,440
Exactly.

864
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,400
Good! Do it!

865
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,159
Do it!

866
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,239
Hey, guys!

867
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,760
Are you sure? Isn’t it too harsh?

868
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,960
You're escalating it.

869
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,199
But…

870
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,320
Will you let them bully Sun like that?

871
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,920
No worry. Leave her.

872
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,360
Her spirit’s already come.

873
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,719
We will get in trouble on it.

874
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,480
Don’t you think that dude
will get caught up in it?

875
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,280
Don’t call him dude.

876
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:29,559
Don’t you think Sun
will get caught up in it?

877
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:30,760
A-ha!

878
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,079
You care about him, don’t you? Right?

879
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:34,679
What?

880
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,360
You're acting that way, girl.

881
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,280
What?

882
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,320
You like him, don’t you?

883
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,639
What? Who likes Sun?

884
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,400
What? Who?

885
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,679
No one!

886
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,360
Hey girls, you are arguing now.

887
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,519
Over there, it’s there.

888
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:50,599
Enough.

889
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:53,159
Sure?

890
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,920
Let me see it.

891
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,440
I DARE YOU TO COME HERE,
FOUL MOUTH.

892
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,280
You really want to do that?

893
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,199
Already done it.

894
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,840
-You can delete it.
-No.

895
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:10,079
I would like to give
big thanks to everyone

896
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,760
for our success on this video clip.

897
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:21,239
Cheers!

898
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,119
Let’s do this. Today is a good day.

899
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:27,840
You got 100K views.

900
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,519
I will play the guitar for you guys.

901
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:32,760
Let’s do it!

902
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,960
Can you also sing?

903
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,199
Not only can I sing a song,

904
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,440
I can cry a song!

905
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,199
Don't you cry, dear.

906
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,840
Cheap little joke,

907
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,679
don’t put it in your story.

908
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:53,760
Sun’s so handsome!

909
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,679
Come on, ready?

910
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,400
Let’s clap your hands.

911
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:36,360
Damn it!

912
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,000
Aww, who’re you talking to?

913
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,159
A guy? Will he come here?

914
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,079
Not like that.

915
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,119
You remember that anti-fan who…

916
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,920
I defied him to come here?

917
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,840
Anti-fan?

918
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,280
He is here.

919
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,199
-Really?
-Yeah.

920
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,760
I already warned you not to do that.
You didn’t listen to me.

921
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,719
What should I do now?

922
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,559
Sun will be angry at me for sure.

923
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,960
If it's gonna be big trouble
then why did you defy him?

924
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,000
Because he attacked my Sun.

925
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,280
I have no choice!

926
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,280
And how? Who is he?

927
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,960
He used to be Sun’s number one fan.

928
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,960
Now that he is an anti-fan,
he is still his number one anti-fan.

929
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,480
I see.

930
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,320
These number one fans

931
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,840
are people who love hard, hate hard.

932
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,239
Exactly.

933
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,039
What should we do now?

934
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,280
Should we tell Sun?

935
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,199
No, we can't!

936
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,320
If we tell him, he will be upset

937
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,519
and it's going to get worse
and all messed up.

938
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,639
Calm down.

939
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:37,599
I think this guy just only bullies
on the comment. That's it.

940
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:38,960
No way!

941
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:40,559
If they confront with each other,

942
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
everything will get crashed down.

943
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,400
OMG!

944
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,639
What should we do?

945
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,840
Hey, Anna! Where are you going? Toilet?

946
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,800
But she grabbed everything with her.

947
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,079
Maybe to work in the toilet.

948
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,159
It’s inspirational in there.

949
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,119
What do you want from me?

950
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:10,599
Nothing.

951
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,679
I have something to tell you.

952
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,159
What?

953
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:20,599
Well…

954
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:21,880
What?

955
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,159
Someone's coming to see you.

956
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,400
Is that it?

957
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,880
Who?

958
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,800
Hello, Sun.

959
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,519
Why are you here?

960
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,360
I am here to keep an eye on you.

961
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,400
Keep an eye on me?

962
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,199
You should go see a psychiatrist.

963
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,119
Hey! That’s rude!

964
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:51,199
Not your business!

965
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:55,079
You'll treat me the way you did
two years ago?

966
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:57,800
Keep it.

967
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,000
I don’t need such a stupid thing.

968
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,159
Isn’t it your favorite?

969
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:06,559
Sun!

970
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:08,519
Let’s make a selfie then.

971
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,880
It's too much! Aren’t you sick of it?

972
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,039
Because I am.

973
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:13,960
Are you stressed out today?

974
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,960
You are not like Sun I know.

975
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,119
I am stressed out with you!

976
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,519
Just get away from me.

977
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:21,840
I don’t wanna see you!

978
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,199
Just go in class.

979
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,079
I will let everyone know
who you really are!

980
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,480
Just do what you want.

981
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,320
I will record you
when you lose your temper

982
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,280
so other people will know
how fake you are.

983
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,920
Get what you want,

984
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,360
and then just leave me alone!

985
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,480
Absolutely!

986
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,599
I won’t touch

987
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,320
such a dirty person like you!

988
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,280
Hey! That’s rude, man!

989
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,400
Hey, wait.

990
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,119
You better not follow him.

991
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:22,679
Who are you?

992
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,960
His fan?

993
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,559
And these are all vegetables…

994
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:31,760
Fake man!

995
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,239
Come on,

996
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,840
don’t make that faked smile.

997
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,480
Everyone knows.

998
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,320
I will let people know.

999
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,599
You'll be out of character one day.

1000
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:45,159
All villagers plant these…

1001
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,119
Drive your fan away.
Like how you did to me.

1002
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,199
Do it. Come on.

1003
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,159
You still have the audacity to come
here after what you've done?

1004
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,079
I didn’t mean to do it.

1005
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,679
I really apologize.

1006
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,159
You know well, he has
a lot of public journalist friends.

1007
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,119
And he also destroys
many superstar’s future via his own page.

1008
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,119
Right?

1009
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,559
You are such a poison fan!

1010
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,679
Uh… I think…

1011
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:43,320
Just ask him to leave here.

1012
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,880
I feel sorry for Sun.

1013
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,800
Okay.

1014
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,199
Sun.

1015
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:03,320
Sun, I am sorry.

1016
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,079
Don’t be sorry,

1017
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,719
just get away from me!

1018
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,239
Sun.

1019
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,199
Stop doing anything for me from now on.

1020
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,519
I don’t want it,

1021
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:24,840
especially from a fan like you.

1022
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,559
Sun.

1023
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:31,400
Sun.

1024
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:34,159
Sun, I am sorry.

1025
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:35,360
Leave me alone!

1026
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,280
Go!

1027
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,960
Calm down, man!

1028
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:40,519
She didn’t mean to do it.

1029
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,000
Sun, I am sorry.

1030
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,320
I didn’t mean to do it.

1031
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,800
I said, go away!

1032
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,880
Sun.

1033
00:59:57,519 --> 00:59:59,119
I am sorry.

1034
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,840
Stop doing that!

1035
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,760
This?

1036
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,159
This is real.

1037
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,079
You just saw it.

1038
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:34,280
That YouTuber just said
he doesn’t need fans.

1039
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,480
It’s enough.

1040
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:36,480
You know nothing, girl!

1041
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,000
You know it very well.

1042
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,239
Your parents want you
to stop following Sun's fan club.

1043
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,719
Because you couldn’t juggle

1044
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,360
between studying and following
someone you're obsessed with.

1045
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,159
Sun used to be nice to you.

1046
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:49,639
Later, he changed,

1047
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:52,519
and he drove you away
to go back to focusing on study.

1048
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:55,039
Do you think it’s a coincidence?

1049
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,360
Ask you parents.
Maybe they have something to do with it.

1050
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,480
How do you know all this?

1051
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:07,639
It’s not important of how I know this.

1052
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:09,800
The thing is you need to realize

1053
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,360
and stop blaming Sun.

1054
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,599
If you want to destroy the person who has
done things for you and your family,

1055
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:27,000
then it’s up to you.

1056
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,920
Hey you!

1057
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,679
Why do you keep following me?

1058
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,360
What…

1059
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,519
you have said to Brownie was too rude.

1060
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,760
You should say sorry to her.

1061
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,960
Why do I have to do so?
Just leave me, that’s all.

1062
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,079
You can be arrogant or a jerk
to anyone,

1063
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,880
but not those who care about you.

1064
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,960
Trouble maker, I'll say.

1065
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,239
Then you are also a trouble maker.

1066
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,360
Don’t come close to me!

1067
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,360
Who wanted to?

1068
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:02,679
So annoying!

1069
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,000
You can feel annoyed,

1070
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,320
but you can't cowardly refuse
what you have

1071
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,039
and take it out on other people.

1072
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,519
What do you mean?

1073
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,239
Your special power

1074
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,199
doesn’t make you afraid
of being with other people.

1075
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,599
But your heart chickens out

1076
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:23,840
and you blame it on the power you have.

1077
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,639
What are you talking about?

1078
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:26,559
How do you know that?

1079
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,280
Pete, you told her?

1080
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,280
No, I did not.

1081
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,920
Let’s speed up!

1082
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:41,320
Hey, you! Come here.

1083
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,480
Nope, you don’t want me
to stay near you, do you?

1084
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,559
Hey!

1085
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:46,199
Move here and talk.

1086
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,159
Go to say sorry to Brownie then!

1087
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:49,360
Stubborn!

1088
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,360
It’s dangerous.

1089
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:55,119
I will. But now you come here first.

1090
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,519
No way! I will just sit here.

1091
01:02:58,159 --> 01:02:59,920
I will sit here. Have a problem?

1092
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,199
I won't let you win today.

1093
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,119
-Come on.
-What?

1094
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:13,719
Hey!

1095
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,320
Why in such a hurry!

1096
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,880
Are you okay?

1097
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:25,679
Your head!

1098
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:42,599
Hey! Sun, are you okay?

1099
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,559
Are you all right?

1100
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,920
You sure you're okay?

1101
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,719
It’s little.

1102
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,400
I mean, your leg or hands might hurt.

1103
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,480
I’ll tell you one thing.

1104
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:13,960
About your special power,

1105
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:16,480
if you know how to deal with it,

1106
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,960
you can help a lot of people.

1107
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,119
Like you helped me just now.

1108
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:23,039
Even if I didn’t help you,

1109
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,920
those riders could have steered away.

1110
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,719
Talking with you
is like talking with a wall.

1111
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,880
Always argue. Never listen.

1112
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,599
Sun!

1113
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:36,400
I’ll help him first.

1114
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,679
Are you comfy?

1115
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,840
Let’s clear things first.

1116
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,199
Come. Let’s sit here.

1117
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,880
So,

1118
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:02,039
do you believe in special powers?

1119
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,480
Isn’t that crazy?

1120
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,480
I read a story about
a lady with a special power.

1121
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,119
She can see other people’s pasts.

1122
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:20,760
Every time she touches someone's hand,

1123
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,199
she can feel their pain.

1124
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:31,800
It makes her get scared of
touching people.

1125
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,760
But this is reality,

1126
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:36,280
not a story.

1127
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,960
I will help you.

1128
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,960
I will help you to deal with it.

1129
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:49,920
With the sound in my head?

1130
01:05:50,599 --> 01:05:51,440
Yeah.

1131
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:58,199
These can help.

1132
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,199
No.

1133
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,880
It’s me who can help you.

1134
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,920
I am different from other people.

1135
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,280
I will try to think positive
and let you hear.

1136
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:42,119
Sun!

1137
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,559
It’s good we have the nurse here,
don’t need to go too far.

1138
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,920
Let me clean your wound.

1139
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,840
Okay.

1140
01:06:58,199 --> 01:06:59,199
Will it hurt?

1141
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,000
It’s a saline solution for cleaning.

1142
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,400
I know all the truth.

1143
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,119
My mom asked you to do this for me.

1144
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,199
Why didn’t you tell me?

1145
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,320
You won’t listen, anyway.

1146
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:14,119
I am so sorry.

1147
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,400
It’s okay.

1148
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:20,280
I was mean to you, too.

1149
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:22,440
I also need to apologize to you.

1150
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:25,199
Why did you change your mind?

1151
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:30,400
Who told you about
what your parents asked me?

1152
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:34,199
Anna.

1153
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,599
It's on me!

1154
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,760
No…

1155
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,519
No denying.

1156
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,719
This is yummy.

1157
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,639
Are you free today?

1158
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,480
Let me think first.

1159
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:04,400
Anything you want?

1160
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,079
Don’t you remember?
You said you’ll help me.

1161
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,279
Why don’t you answer me?

1162
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,760
Well!

1163
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,119
I did.

1164
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:27,000
You should know what I am thinking now.

1165
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,319
You are the only one

1166
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,720
whose thoughts I couldn’t hear.

1167
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,039
Huh?

1168
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,720
Really?

1169
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,039
So…

1170
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,560
I can call you all kinds of names, huh?

1171
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:52,600
Are you giving me a compliment?

1172
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,520
Let me listen to that!

1173
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,000
Am I that sexy when eating ice cream?

1174
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:00,680
My nose

1175
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,560
looks perfect?

1176
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:06,880
Am I that cool?

1177
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,520
Handsome? Smart?

1178
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,039
And you want to look at me closer?

1179
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,119
Hey! Are you crazy?

1180
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,680
Uh, I’m sorry.

1181
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:27,760
It’s okay.

1182
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,199
I can deal with it.

1183
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,439
Anna! Hey!

1184
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,000
Your plot summary got accepted now.

1185
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,199
Congratulations!

1186
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,960
Hold on!

1187
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:48,000
Why do you need to shout? We’re both here.

1188
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,640
I am tired.

1189
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,479
Excited, too.

1190
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,079
I think your plan

1191
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:57,520
of being close with Sun

1192
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,000
is really great.

1193
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:02,680
Now you deserve it, girl!

1194
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,840
Your plot is very good.

1195
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,840
Awesome!

1196
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,439
Actually, I …

1197
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,760
I think…

1198
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,920
Wait!

1199
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:12,600
Don't tell me

1200
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,800
that you secretly fell in love with him.

1201
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,359
No, not that.

1202
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:18,279
Yes or no?

1203
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,960
After work’s done
then we both go our own way.

1204
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:26,319
Yeah, that’s what I wanna tell you.

1205
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:27,319
Aren't you happy?

1206
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,000
Sun.

1207
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:31,840
Sun?

1208
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,760
Oops!

1209
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:47,039
I wish I could read your mind.

1210
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:50,840
Then I could know,

1211
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,680
you are also the same as others.

1212
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,039
TWO DAYS LATER IN KANCHANABURI

1213
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,520
This is what it’s called heartbroken.

1214
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,159
What's heartbroken, man?

1215
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,479
Listen to your brain’s voice,

1216
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,239
then you will know it.

1217
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,880
You finally met the one you can be with.

1218
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,680
Why do you keep saying that?

1219
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,680
Huh? Pete!

1220
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:51,720
Then you ran away from it.

1221
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,560
Why don’t you face it?

1222
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,399
You ran too far!

1223
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,119
It’s good, isn’t it?

1224
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,520
I want to see no one, just stay alone!

1225
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,800
It’s all.

1226
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
You want to be friends only with me?

1227
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,760
Yeah!

1228
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,680
Sun is not in the mood
right now, everyone. So I will

1229
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:19,079
just keep following him this way
and see what he is gonna do.

1230
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,920
Such a nice breeze!

1231
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:25,399
Do you feel better? Say something, man!

1232
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,560
Please just stop, see the view.

1233
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,920
Hey! Don’t say that.

1234
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:34,319
Just stop it!

1235
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:36,000
-Hey!
-Eat!

1236
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:37,720
First word is out.

1237
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,159
I thought he wouldn’t
open his mouth today.

1238
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:47,239
Guys, he is talking to the trees.

1239
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,920
Hey, dude! How’s it?

1240
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,920
Better than talking to people.

1241
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,079
Hey!

1242
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:52,079
Don’t say that.

1243
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,560
How am I gonna use the footage now?

1244
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,359
People might think
you are even more arrogant.

1245
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,920
Here.

1246
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:17,840
Dried banana with solar power.

1247
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,800
You see, how useful solar power can be.

1248
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,479
Your name is Sun,

1249
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,399
have you thought about the good
you could do for others?

1250
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:30,520
I am not a social worker.

1251
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,760
You can be the light for others.

1252
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,880
People still love
and support you, come on!

1253
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,199
I gotta say one thing
since I just realized it.

1254
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:49,479
May I ask you?

1255
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,399
Let’s think about your fan like Brownie.

1256
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,520
Have you ever heard
any bad thoughts from her?

1257
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,359
As a fan of yours,

1258
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,159
she truly loves and cheers you up, man!

1259
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:02,319
Why did you bring this up?

1260
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,760
Because I don’t want you to act this way.

1261
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,000
I am really tired

1262
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,760
of dealing with you, man!

1263
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,199
Try to think of others
so you will have more friends.

1264
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,760
If you are tired,

1265
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,159
then you just leave me.

1266
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,119
I want to do that

1267
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,079
but I just can’t. I am worried about you!

1268
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:38,680
If you really don’t need me, I'll leave.

1269
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,239
I will coordinate with the staff for you.

1270
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,239
Why? Are you from the same sector?

1271
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:54,600
Each sector has
different responsibilities.

1272
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,199
EGAT is responsible
for producing electricity.

1273
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:57,760
If you have problems
with electricity usage,

1274
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,520
you have to contact
Provincial Electricity Authority.

1275
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,079
If you are in the areas like Bangkok,
Pathumthani, or Nonthaburi,

1276
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,720
you may contact
Metropolitan Electricity Authority.

1277
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,319
Dried banana with solar power.

1278
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,640
You see, how useful solar power can be.

1279
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,720
Your name is Sun,

1280
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,039
have you thought about the good
you could do for others?

1281
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:11,960
Oh, I see! I just realize that.

1282
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:13,640
Can you help me to contact them?

1283
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,079
I don’t know how I can contact them.

1284
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:18,239
Sure, I will do that.

1285
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,079
What do you guys argue about?

1286
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:23,960
How ridiculous!

1287
01:15:24,039 --> 01:15:25,479
Just don’t say anything.

1288
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,359
Sun!

1289
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,079
I have told you before.

1290
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,920
Pete really cares about you.

1291
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,079
He would be glad
if he could change the job.

1292
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:37,359
I think he still wants to work with you.

1293
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,680
Pete always cares about friends!

1294
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,279
And he is very worried about you
so he didn’t leave you.

1295
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:45,840
You know?

1296
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,600
I know that.

1297
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,840
Pete!

1298
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,000
I am sorry.

1299
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,920
It’s okay!

1300
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,359
I can never stay mad at you.

1301
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,199
If I were there,

1302
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:11,239
I'd just beat you!

1303
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:13,560
I wanna hug you guys.

1304
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,720
It’s okay.

1305
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,159
Let’s hug. Come on.

1306
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,000
Hug me tight.

1307
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,560
Hey, it’s too tight. I can’t breathe.

1308
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,159
It’s okay now.

1309
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,119
What do you think about me?

1310
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:26,319
I am not angry.

1311
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,239
Too sweet.

1312
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:35,960
Even though the sunlight is gone

1313
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:37,600
but my power is still here.

1314
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,880
Are you serious?

1315
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,359
Let’s make the recording.

1316
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:41,520
I'll grab the camera.

1317
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,680
Go.

1318
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,680
Anna.

1319
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,159
Brownie.

1320
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:07,520
I didn’t really mean it that way.

1321
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:10,119
I heard it from your mouth,

1322
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:12,000
now what excuse do you want to say?

1323
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:14,039
It’s not making an excuse.

1324
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:17,000
You come here for the excuse, don’t you?

1325
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:19,479
It’s really not an excuse!

1326
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,079
I am here

1327
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,760
to apologize you.

1328
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,680
No need to say sorry.

1329
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,800
I don’t need it.

1330
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,319
We are not that close to care about it.

1331
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:34,039
If you don’t care,

1332
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:36,279
why did you react to me so strangely?

1333
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:38,560
I am normally strange.

1334
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,920
I am unusual.

1335
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,760
Why do you have
such a complicated mind, man?

1336
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,039
Then leave me alone.

1337
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:45,000
Are you driving me away?

1338
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:46,079
I did. Go now!

1339
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,119
Why are you still here?

1340
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,039
I don’t want to.

1341
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:53,840
I came a long way to get here.
So, I'll stay here.

1342
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,159
Just go back where you’re from.

1343
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,800
I will stay here! I will sleep here!

1344
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,840
Fine. I will leave.

1345
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,720
Hey! Wait

1346
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,359
Where are you going? I will go with you.

1347
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:05,319
I'll follow you everywhere
till you forgive me.

1348
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:07,760
Argh! What on earth are you?

1349
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,560
I wrote about you,

1350
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,960
I followed you…

1351
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:13,079
because…

1352
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,159
I feel good with you.

1353
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:22,560
You are more special than others.

1354
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:27,199
Have you finished it?

1355
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,880
If yes, then we won’t need
to see each other again.

1356
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:37,479
I wanna make it a happy ending.

1357
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,760
Don’t pretend.

1358
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,680
That doesn’t work.

1359
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,079
Won’t you help me? It really hurts.

1360
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,600
Here it is.

1361
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,640
Do you really want to sleep here?

1362
01:19:21,079 --> 01:19:22,479
Yeah!

1363
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,119
Two ladies here
and it's dark already.

1364
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,840
Where’s Anna?

1365
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,960
Why do you ask me?

1366
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,199
You'll leave her alone in the dark?

1367
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,560
She can come back on her own.

1368
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,359
She just pretends that she hurt her leg.

1369
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:47,000
Hey!

1370
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:50,760
If you don’t really know
how she feels about you,

1371
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:55,880
then you just try
to hear your brain’s voice.

1372
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,439
Here. Take it.

1373
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:16,359
Anna.

1374
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,359
Anna.

1375
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,520
After you're gone, what’s next?

1376
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,520
Anna.

1377
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:27,000
I’ll just let Sun think of

1378
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:28,279
how much he cares about me.

1379
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:30,760
I feel sorry for him, though.

1380
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,159
No need to, girl!

1381
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,399
He deserves it.

1382
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:34,800
One more thing.

1383
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,760
You guys try not to let him
read your minds and thoughts.

1384
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,319
You too, Brownie,

1385
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:40,760
If you are with him,

1386
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,760
just try to hum a tune
or think of something.

1387
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,960
Anna, where are you?

1388
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:49,000
After he cares and worries about me,

1389
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:52,600
then I’ll be open to him.

1390
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:57,600
Anna!

1391
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:02,600
Are you all right?

1392
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,239
Another slip and fall?

1393
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:05,680
Like in the drama,
the actor and the actress

1394
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,079
watch each other closely.

1395
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,640
Are you okay?

1396
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,239
I am fine.

1397
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,520
Come on. Ready, one, two, three.

1398
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,199
It really hurts.

1399
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,439
What?

1400
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,960
My ankle hurts.

1401
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,680
Get up here!

1402
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,520
Come on.

1403
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:01,920
Hold tight.

1404
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:07,039
Thank you.

1405
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:10,399
Don’t forget to add it in your story.

1406
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:11,960
That he gives his lady a piggyback

1407
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:13,359
and walks a mile

1408
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:15,680
even though she is super heavy.

1409
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,840
That’s too much!

1410
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,479
Am I that heavy?

1411
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,199
I'm serious. You are very heavy.

1412
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,800
By the way,

1413
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,760
you really want me to be your lady?

1414
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,199
No answer!

1415
01:22:38,279 --> 01:22:41,239
You're thinking of what
you’ve just said, aren’t you?

1416
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:42,600
Just don’t!

1417
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,920
I am still angry at you
so don’t talk to me.

1418
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,479
Liar!

1419
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,720
Your anger is gone already.

1420
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,239
Who told you?

1421
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:54,840
I can read your mind.

1422
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,640
It’s as planned!

1423
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:14,359
What was the plan?

1424
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,479
The weather is very nice.

1425
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,159
Pete!

1426
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:44,079
Banana pie fresh milk shake

1427
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:45,680
This is recommended.

1428
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,479
This is yummy with the jelly!

1429
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,279
Banana pie.

1430
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,079
If reconciling with Sun is easy as pie,

1431
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:04,479
it would be really nice.

1432
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:08,359
Still trying to link this?

1433
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,560
Where are you going now for the record?

1434
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:14,079
Memory Park.

1435
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,800
Memory of how he is still angry.

1436
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,600
Enough!

1437
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,119
Get a grip, girl.

1438
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,760
Let’s go.

1439
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,760
Go where?

1440
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,239
Go and say sorry to him!

1441
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:36,800
-No.
-Just go.

1442
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,079
-No.
-Why?

1443
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,319
Come on.

1444
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:41,640
This is a good time to do it.

1445
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:42,840
I don’t dare to do it.

1446
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,479
Just go! It’s okay.

1447
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,039
Sun,

1448
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:56,359
are you thirsty? I can buy you some water.

1449
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,239
Sun, I…

1450
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:06,319
Don’t!

1451
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,119
You don’t need to explain anything.

1452
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:17,840
I know

1453
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,479
that you were always good to me,

1454
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,600
saved me from those anti-fans.

1455
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,680
You support me and you don’t even care of
how other people think of me.

1456
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:34,680
Thank you so much.

1457
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,000
I apologize for treating you badly.

1458
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,560
Sun.

1459
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,039
I am so sorry.

1460
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,720
I love you the most, Sun!

1461
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,960
I promise you.

1462
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:03,039
I won’t be anyone's fan except you
for the rest of my life.

1463
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:09,000
Are you jealous?

1464
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,640
Isn' that too much?

1465
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,880
Saying sorry is enough,
but she hugs him so tight.

1466
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,520
Are you that happy?

1467
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,039
He just gave you a hug.

1468
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:22,399
Most ever in the world!

1469
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,000
What?

1470
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,359
Nothing!

1471
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,680
I did what I’ve said now.

1472
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,560
We’re even now.

1473
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,479
We gotta meet each other anyway.

1474
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,039
Meet again?

1475
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:41,479
I’ll always follow Sun anyway.

1476
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,359
Ah!

1477
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:45,920
You mean you wanna meet Sun.

1478
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,439
And…

1479
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:51,039
I also wanna meet you too, brother Pete.

1480
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:55,359
Really?

1481
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:57,399
Absolutely!

1482
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,239
Don’t call me brother,

1483
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:00,159
it seems old.

1484
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:01,640
Well…

1485
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,920
When I like someone, I always say that.

1486
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,239
Sister Brownie.

1487
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,119
Silly!

1488
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,239
Crazy man!

1489
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,880
Since we first met,

1490
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,680
you seemed to be a very nice person.

1491
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,199
But one thing came up was
why you are so mean to others?

1492
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:29,960
Lately, I’ve seen you more,

1493
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:32,640
I wrote the story about your life.

1494
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,319
I’ve gotten to know you more,

1495
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:36,880
we know each other more.

1496
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,319
I feel…

1497
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:44,199
I'm really interested in you.

1498
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,279
You are an author.

1499
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:49,720
You can make words as you want to.

1500
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:55,800
I really wish you could hear
what's in my head right now.

1501
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:02,800
I can hear your heart.

1502
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,159
We're sitting not even that close.

1503
01:28:07,239 --> 01:28:08,600
I still can hear
your heart beating like…

1504
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,840
Lub-dub.

1505
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,279
Too much!

1506
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:22,039
When I am with you,

1507
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:25,000
I feel really good.

1508
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,960
I really want to be your friend.

1509
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:38,520
But I don’t want to be your friend.

1510
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,239
Let’s add the scene where the actor

1511
01:29:03,319 --> 01:29:06,079
kisses his lady in your story.

1512
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:09,800
Silly!

1513
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,520
Great job, dude!

1514
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,880
It’s too early!

1515
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,319
Kiss his lady?

1516
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,239
This is me.

1517
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:17,760
I am Sun.

1518
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,520
I have a special power.

1519
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,760
I can hear people’s thoughts.

1520
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,920
It makes me forget
to listen to my own thoughts

1521
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,159
and so I miss out many things.

1522
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,159
Even though people think I am arrogant,

1523
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,520
it’s okay.

1524
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:33,279
From now on,
I will be with my special power.

1525
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:35,079
And if it could be used to help others,

1526
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:36,960
I will do exactly that.

1527
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,199
One thing that is very strange.

1528
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:43,960
I don’t know why it's only her

1529
01:29:44,039 --> 01:29:47,920
that I couldn't use my special power with.

1530
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,800
The story you have told me

1531
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,319
about the lady
who could read people’s past.

1532
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:54,159
She is not in the story.

1533
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:56,640
It’s you!

1534
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,560
If I can see people’s past
by touching hands,

1535
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,720
then I gotta know about you already.

1536
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,760
No need to figure out from others.

1537
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,640
You may have not seen my past

1538
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,000
like I don’t hear your mind.

1539
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,920
With your work,

1540
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,079
do you need my help
to read people’s thoughts?

1541
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:21,840
So, you won’t need to be nosy.

1542
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,760
Hey!

1543
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,520
You said I am a nosy?

1544
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,279
But… yeah. Deal.

1545
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,159
This is how you read people’s past, right?

1546
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:43,199
What are you talking about?

1547
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,800
So where are you going next?

1548
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,960
I think I will visit Rajjaprabha Dam.

1549
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:55,439
In Thailand, there are many dams where
you can visit and take beautiful photos.

1550
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,239
The villagers are nice,
foods are delicious,

1551
01:30:57,319 --> 01:30:58,439
the local market is also good.

1552
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,640
And the most important thing,

1553
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,960
those places have handsome guys like me!

1554
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:07,720
Everything is good, except the last…

1555
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,800
So, deal!

1556
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,920
Do you wanna hug me?

1557
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,199
And kiss me?

1558
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,800
Dreaming! You are dreaming now.

1559
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,039
Didn’t you say
you couldn’t hear my thoughts?

1560
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,960
You want to be my girlfriend?

1561
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:41,880
No. Who? No way!

1562
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,079
I'm not thinking about that.

1563
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:50,279
THE END

1564
01:31:50,359 --> 01:31:51,840
So what are you thinking?

1565
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,159
Why do I have to tell you?

1566
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:58,680
Thank you everyone for watching
and following our video clips.

1567
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,000
We promise that we will
create good content

1568
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:02,439
to repay all your support.

1569
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,600
That’s so touching, dude.

1570
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,960
For me,

1571
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:10,840
I will promise that…

1572
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,239
I will make myself better.

1573
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,840
I won’t be that arrogant guy
anymore from now on.

1574
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:17,399
Smile!

1575
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,159
See you again, everyone.
