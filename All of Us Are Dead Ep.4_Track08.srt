ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,849
Hello, everyone!

4
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,102
{\an8}I'm Orangibberish, and I always get
to the truth behind the rumors.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,605
Okay, today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombies rumor.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,899
I'm on my way to see
if it's really turned into Zombieland

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,193
like they've been saying online
and on social media.

8
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,611
You know what I'm talking about.

00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,029
FINALLY
HE'S REALLY GOING

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,198
Whoa. It's already pretty crazy.

11
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,283
Look out there.

[Orangibberish] Do you see that?

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,253
It's bumper to bumper
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,629
There are so many cars.

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,756
Hold on.

19
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,966
I'm gonna have to get out
and hike my way in.

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,470
[Orangibberish] I came up the mountain
to avoid the traffic jam.

21
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,096
See that there?

22
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,891
{\an8}That is Hyosan all the way
down there in the distance.

Okay. I'll…

A hockey mask. A pair of knee pads.

28
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,446
Shin guards. Very important.

29
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,782
This is emergency food.

30

First aid kit. And water.

00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,286
And the most important of all, an axe.

32
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,789

slice them up like roast beef.

Maybe they didn't die, then.

They wouldn't have been quiet

how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

Come to think of it, neither did I.

165
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,762
[Cheol-su sighs]

166
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,861
Now, I really wish the school
would burn down.

167
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,823
Till nothing's left.

168
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,825
They'll save us.

169
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,999
They just have to.

170
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,755
[laughing]

171
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,006
[Cheol-su] <i>Otherwise…</i>

172
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,343
I don't know.

173
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,806
I hope there really is a fire…

174
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,727
that kills everyone.

175
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,730
[Eun-ji] Right?

176
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
You want to die too?

177
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,491
[Cheol-su exhales sharply]

178
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
No.

179
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,620
I know you wanna live.

180
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
You wanna live so badly…

181
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,547
that you want to die.

182
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,429
Why are you blaming me for this?
Su-hyeok brought it up.

183
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,639
Pooping's not a crime.

184
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,101
It's not a crime, but…

185
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,395
But what? Don't you need to go?

186
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
Yes, I do.

187
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,359
-Not poop, but, you know…
-What about you?

188
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,364
I don't… Pooping? No.

189
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
Don't you need to go?

190
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
Why are you asking me?

191
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,246
Why are you getting annoyed?

192
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,374
What do you want from us?
We can't go out, anyway.

193
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,336
[breathes deeply]

194
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,838
I have an idea.

195
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,052
[Dae-su] First…

196
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,430
The girls and the guys will take turns.

197
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,848
Where?

198
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
Here.

199
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,269
[Hyo-ryeong] You're crazy.

200
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,854
Stop it, man.

201
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
[Dae-su] Why?

202
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,109
The girls can wait in the other room,
and the guys can just pee out the window.

203
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,320
What about… poop?

204
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,780
Poop. Well…

205
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,950
You can take off your pants
and hang out the window.

206
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,535
Like this.

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,496
Outside.

208
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,540
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

209
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,626
-Like this.
-[Wu-jin] What reaction is he hoping for?

210
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,836
-[Hyo-ryeong] Stop being ridiculous.
-[both sigh]

211
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,422
But someone has to hold you,
so you don't fall.

212
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,049
How are you going to wipe your butt?

213
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,260
-Well, someone else should.
-[Hyo-ryeong] What is he saying?

214
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,220
Idiot.

215
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,472
Let's just hold it.

216
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,266
If the rescuers come--

217
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,143
It'll take a while for them to get here.

218
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,606
It may be the same outside of the school.

219
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,734
[On-jo] I don't know
how long we'll be stuck here,

220
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,277
but my dad always told me

221
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,655
to separate the bathroom
from where you sleep

222
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,198
if you find yourself stranded.

223
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,700
Where will we create a bathroom and how?

224
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,994
Right there.

225
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,709
-Yes, sir.
-[zombies gagging]

226
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,087
-They're sending a chopper.
-[sighs]

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,548
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

228
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,134
What do you mean,
we have to go out to the roof

229
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,678
when it's swarming with the infected?

230
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,430
Also, 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

231
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,599
Why can't you arrange it
for 11:00 p.m. tonight?

232
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,352
Yes, tomorrow. We'll spend the night here.

233
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,982
How can the assemblywoman sleep here?
Radio in again!

234
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,484
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so you're gonna have to create

235
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,777
a temporary bathroom.

236
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,320
-U-sin.
-Yes, sir.

237
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,659
[sighs]

238
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,416
Nam-ra and you guys, try to look
for something to cover the window.

239
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,333
Okay.

240
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,335
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

241
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,089
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

242
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,259
Cheong-san.

243
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,846
And then the rest of you…

244
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
A screen?

245
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,182
-A screen?
-Yes, a screen to block.

246

247
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,778
Come with me. Come on.

-That's the bathroom.

[Dae-su groans]

250
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,630
[Joon-yeong] Put this in here.

251
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,966
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

252
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,384
Oh, okay.

253
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,555
Okay. We're all gonna
use this as a toilet,

254
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,308
so that it will absorb urine and feces
as much as possible.

255
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,562
[Cheong-san] Put this in there too.

256
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,608

What's going on?
Did they make the toilet yet?

263
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,756
What's taking them so long?

264
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,844
[Joon-yeong] That's good.

265
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,222
-This should be good enough.
-[Joon-yeong] Okay.

[grunts]

[Dae-su] How do we poop on this?

268
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,728
Use the cover for poop,
and without for pee.

269
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
Get out.

270
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,772
-Oh.
-Out.

271
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,856
How do we use that?

00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,994
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there, right?

277
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,792
But if you watch the movies,
they can't do anything, either, right?

278
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,337
Yeah, but they always save everyone
in the end.

-[exhales deeply]
-There's nobody there.

There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments out there.

290
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,282
They all ran away or died.

291
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,658
What do you mean by that?

292
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,618
No one's coming here to save us.

293
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

294
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,582
Don't you know my mom?

295
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,586
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

296
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,795
So, what do you wanna do?

297
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm just trying to point out the facts.

298
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,259
We all know that no one's coming.

299
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,304
So I think we should just figure out
what we're gonna do next.

300
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,181
We have to wait to be rescued.

We can't leave somewhere safe
to go somewhere dangerous.

302
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,728
And what if nobody comes?

303
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,689
We haven't been waiting that long yet.

304
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,816
How do you think we have to wait?

305
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,278
-Do you think we should wait until we die?
-No.

306
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm saying let's wait as long as we can.

307
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,824
There's no way we can go out
right now, anyway.

308
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,118
[Su-hyeok] It's probably
because it's nighttime.

00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,579
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning, maybe.

There are a lot of choppers flying around.

You're leaving first
for a personal matter?

How could a firefighter say
something like this during a crisis?

317
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,613
I'll take any punishment
when this is over.

318
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,906
I'll resign if I have to.

Listen.

Do you intend to leave all these people
and go by yourself?
