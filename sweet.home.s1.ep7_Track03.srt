ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,238
Hurry! Get in!

3
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:22,079
Do you have a license?

4
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,206
-I passed the written.
-And the driving test?

5
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,169
Hold on tight.

6
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,114
Ji-su, I'm sorry.

7
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,425
I got you!

8
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:26,203
Mr. Han!

9
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,047
Mr. Han!

10
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:40,509
Shouldn't you go and help?

11
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:41,844
Why don't you go, then?

12
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:43,804
Why aren't you doing as we practiced?

13
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,307
Shut up, you freaking dog!
You're the same as your owner!

14
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,267
Move aside.

15
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,519
You'll get us all killed.

16
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,399
What was all that practice for, then?

17
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,693
Do you really want to live like this?

18
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,206
-Mr. Han…
-Go! I'm fine.

19
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,124
Hurry.

20
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,188
Die, you monster!

21
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,045
One, two…

22
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:18,852
If you were going to lock him up,
why did you save him?

23
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,066
Hyun-su…

24
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,319
Sorry.

25
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:32,407
We made things more difficult for you.

26
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,664
You can choose this time.

27
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:12,573
Thank you.

28
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:13,949
It's nothing.

29
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,996
It's not the time to be treating others.

30
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,708
You seemed to have a hard time breathing.

31
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:26,878
I'm fine.

32
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:55,032
Do you want to die, by any chance?

33
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,953
You might not have any desire to live,

34
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,164
but don't show that to everyone else

35
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,167
struggling to survive.

36
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,793
Why shouldn't I?

37
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,920
That's just manners.

38
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:16,094
Why would you care about manners
in a world like this?

39
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,681
Because we survived

40
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:21,975
in this world.

41
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,979
We should live more decently
as human beings.

42
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:37,157
You have asthma, right?

43
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,661
Are you going to die?

44
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,206
I've never thought of dying.

45
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:46,958
You can treat me.

46
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:51,922
Please.

47
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:45,267
Would you…

48
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,603
like some of mine?

49
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,064
No, it's fine.

50
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,948
These spoons aren't helpful at all.

51
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:02,617
You're right.
It'll be faster to just drink it.

52
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,878
Why do you keep staring at him like that?

53
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,379
I can't help it, you know.

54
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,525
Do you have anywhere else to go?

55
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:43,742
Sit down. You're distracting me.

56
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,084
That was a nice meal.

57
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,299
What's wrong with you two?

58
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,718
Everyone's uncomfortable around you.

59
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,720
Be comfortable alone at least.

60
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:09,643
Don't just sit there frowning
with that scary scarred face.

61
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,853
You're making me lose my appetite.

62
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:15,315
And why do you have
those scars on your arm?

63
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,110
I can't back down from a challenge.

64
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,702
What do you think? Do I scare you?

65
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:35,085
There wasn't a single healthy organ
inside my body.

66
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:38,296
The stupid doctor told me
I couldn't even last six months.

67
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,048
I made him look like a quack

68
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,467
by living until this age.

69
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,013
Should I tell you my secret?

70
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,644
My secret is eating well, you punks.

71
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,856
Just gobble up your food!

72
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,483
We're all struggling
to eat and survive, you know.

73
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:39,733
SECURITY OFFICE

74
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,368
Let me.

75
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:06,361
Come on, let's do it together.

76
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:11,324
Su-yeong, you promised to play with me.

77
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,243
Do you really want a scolding?

78
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:16,121
You're a liar, just like Dad!

79
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:17,622
Go away!

80
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,418
Su-yeong…

81
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:39,019
SKY

82
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,230
Play.

83
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:43,898
It's okay for kids to play.

84
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,777
Give me a gun instead.

85
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,573
Give me something for killing monsters.

86
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:58,246
Later, when you're older.

87
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,998
What if I die before that?

88
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,168
If I die, Yeong-su will die, too.

89
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,089
I'm all he has.

90
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,976
SHOWER ROOM RULES

91
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:29,277
Once every three days?

92
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,281
My skin will get all ruined.

93
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:36,493
What about my dream? It'll be ruined, too.

94
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:39,454
Damn it. Whatever.

95
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:02,769
ELECTRONICS

96
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,314
The water tank's been contaminated.

97
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,069
I thought it'd last 15 days
if we save water.

98
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:17,117
That's a disaster.
Water's most important right now.

99
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,034
You're right.

100
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:24,457
How's your leg?

101
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,875
This?

102
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:29,671
I don't know if it's okay
because I can't feel anything.

103
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,174
It could get infected,
so make sure to get it treated.

104
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:35,718
Okay.

105
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,222
What happened to your glasses?

106
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:41,349
Give it to me. I'll fix it.

107
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:48,398
I like it this way.

108
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,238
But why did you come here?

109
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,782
I think you should come to the basement.

110
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:09,586
Everything fine?

111
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,089
Right, well… What are you doing here?

112
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,305
Be careful.

113
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:23,850
I bet everyone will like this. It's…

114
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:27,604
What's this?

115
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:29,606
You said the basement's safe now.

116
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:33,693
Some people said they were waiting
for their packages, so…

117
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,324
You shouldn't do things alone.

118
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:42,118
Yes, that's why we came together…

119
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,549
HAN DU-SIK

120
00:19:58,509 --> 00:19:59,969
Excuse me…

121
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,446
It'll withstand some weight.

122
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:21,783
If you strengthen the windows
and add weapons,

123
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,284
it could withstand monsters outside.

124
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:25,912
When can you finish it?

125
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,084
So you want it done soon, right?

126
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:32,752
Yes.

127
00:20:32,835 --> 00:20:34,212
We have lots of people and no time.

128
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:37,507
At this rate, all of us will end up
dying in here.

129
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,386
We have to leave
before people start to panic.

130
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:54,732
Kim Ji-eun.

131
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:55,650
-Yes.
-Here.

132
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,029
This one is mine.

133
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,491
And this one is mine, too.

134
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,248
This is mine, too.

135
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:17,547
This is…

136
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:22,176
-mine again.
-How is everything yours?

137
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,594
Let me see.

138
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:25,263
Hey. It's not yours!

139
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,015
It's not yours!

140
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,600
Room 502, Nam Sang-won.

141
00:21:29,684 --> 00:21:31,602
Who's Nam Sang-won?

142
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:35,440
It's Yi-kyung's dead fiancé.

143
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:47,327
YOU ARE INVITED TO OUR WEDDING

144
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,371
Where do you think she went?

145
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:52,415
She'll be okay, right?

146
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,347
Get out.

147
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:27,825
We called them "special infectees."

148
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:29,786
We had several,

149
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,288
but they all became monsters
or lost control and died.

150
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:35,958
The 15th day since the first symptom
was the toughest.

151
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,589
Was there anyone who lived past that?

152
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:44,467
There was one,
but he disappeared without a trace.

153
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:47,970
That boy you mentioned.

154
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:49,722
He better have survived
longer than 15 days.

155
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:28,553
LACK OF WATER AND FOOD

156
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:29,470
SEPARATE FOOD STORAGE

157
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,596
MOVE WITH MINIMUM NUMBER

158
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,165
Stop.

159
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,419
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if you ran away?

160
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:05,840
Give me my share!

161
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,009
Please stop.

162
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:10,428
Fuck! I can't trust anyone anymore!

163
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:12,263
Calm down. Let's talk.

164
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,349
You shit. Don't touch me.

165
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,935
I'm not going to die here like this.

166
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,229
I'm going to leave by myself.

167
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:22,690
You. Give me the car keys.

168
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:27,528
Give me the car keys, you asshole!

169
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:31,157
Give me the keys! You son of--

170
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,084
You…

171
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:48,132
Why don't you go out there then?

172
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:53,679
You don't know how it feels

173
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:56,057
to have your life in someone else's hands!

174
00:24:57,725 --> 00:24:58,726
What are you doing?

175
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,064
Aren't you ashamed to face the kids?

176
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,108
What does age matter right now?

177
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,194
We're all going to die anyway!

178
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,244
No.

179
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:20,540
Not all of us.

180
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:29,423
People like you who act stupid
out of fear are the ones who die first.

181
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,718
Get a grip!

182
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:37,265
Take care of your own life.

183
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:49,819
We need…

184
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:53,573
to venture outside.

185
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,117
We only have five days' worth of food.

186
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:58,869
We'll search
the nearest convenience store first.

187
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,414
Isn't it too dangerous?

188
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,208
We made some preparations.

189
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,378
Mr. An scouted the area.

190
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,760
And Mr. Han is working on the car.

191
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:16,721
Hang on, four-eyes.

192
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:18,431
Who's going, then?

193
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,558
Are we drawing straws?

194
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,729
It's an important mission,

195
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:28,190
so the ones most likely
to succeed will go.

196
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:39,493
-Why me?
-You're in charge of the food.

197
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:42,038
And you're the one most likely to succeed.

198
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,925
Do you know what kind of person I am?

199
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:56,761
I don't care.

200
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:58,846
But…

201
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:00,806
have you ever saved

202
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:04,143
someone's life?

203
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:54,860
I deserved to be punched.

204
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,030
I'm sorry.

205
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:07,707
Me, too.

206
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,003
I'm sorry

207
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:15,047
I punched you.

208
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,143
You have better manners now.

209
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:30,146
Aren't you leaving?

210
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:32,523
I should finish this first.

211
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:36,610
I'm not getting better at drinking.

212
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,532
It's been a long time since I heard music.

213
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:25,159
It was abandoned in a corner somewhere.

214
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:29,914
What song was that?

215
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:34,460
I just improvised.

216
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:35,961
There are only four strings, anyway.

217
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:37,963
The melody was a bit dull, wasn't it?

218
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:40,633
I'd like

219
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:42,718
to hear the whole song.

220
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:44,136
Really?

221
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:50,100
Are you hurt?

222
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,603
It's nothing serious. I'm fine.

223
00:30:17,211 --> 00:30:18,045
What?

224
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:19,880
This song.

225
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:22,341
It makes me feel like I'm home.

226
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:27,680
Thanks.

227
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:30,516
For what?

228
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:33,269
I didn't have

229
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,355
a title for this song.

230
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:40,860
But you just gave it one.

231
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:10,598
GREEN HOME MANSION APARTMENT

232
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:14,143
CHILDREN'S LIBRARY

233
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:49,428
Are you still not done?

234
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:51,430
Nope.

235
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:53,223
I need more time.

236
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:58,312
Hey.

237
00:32:01,482 --> 00:32:03,817
Fuck. It's really urgent!

238
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:06,570
Oh, that's too bad.

239
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:09,073
You should've come yesterday
if it was so urgent.

240
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:11,992
Hey. Do you have a death wish?

241
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:14,578
What? I'm pooping to survive, you know.

242
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:19,583
Hey, Eun-yu.

243
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,544
Hey! Hurry up! Come on.

244
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:50,280
Hey.

245
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:53,617
Hey, what's wrong? Come on. Wake up.

246
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:57,579
Are you turning, too?

247
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:00,249
Because you couldn't poop?

248
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,668
Hey, wake up. Yoon Ji-su.

249
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,425
What's wrong? Wake up!

250
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,593
How long have you been hurting?

251
00:33:11,677 --> 00:33:12,553
I'm fine.

252
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:19,351
Let's see if it hurts
when I remove my hand.

253
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:26,316
I think it's appendicitis.

254
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:27,860
Appendicitis?

255
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:32,072
-Your appendix.
-What do we do?

256
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:33,907
But how do you know?

257
00:33:36,493 --> 00:33:37,536
He should know that much.

258
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:40,622
He got into medical school
when we were so poor.

259
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:47,671
What do we do?

260
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:49,006
She'll be okay.

261
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:52,968
The golden hour…

262
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:59,349
is running out for both sides.

263
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,359
If her appendix ruptures,
it'll become serious.

264
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,612
She could get an infection
in her peritoneum,

265
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:14,073
and bacteria could spread
throughout her entire body.

266
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,576
Then she needs surgery?

267
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:20,287
There's nothing we can do here.

268
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:23,082
I'm not that capable, either.

269
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:29,421
So?

270
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,508
Are you saying you won't do anything?

271
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,721
Just do something!

272
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:42,142
Do whatever you can.
I need to get revenge on her.

273
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,816
So I might die?

274
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,317
Yes.

275
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,780
There's a higher chance
of dying than surviving.

276
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,700
You still want to do it?

277
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:01,578
Yes.

278
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,874
If I don't, there's no chance
of surviving at all.

279
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:20,806
I'll perform the surgery.

280
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,641
I need anesthetics, antibiotics,

281
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:25,144
saline, and surgical instruments.

282
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,103
I'll go.

283
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,606
Are you trying to die?

284
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:37,906
You'll just be a burden in that state.

285
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:42,744
I'll go, too.

286
00:35:44,037 --> 00:35:45,080
No, you will not.

287
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:49,585
There are dozens
of different surgical tools.

288
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,712
Unless you're going to bring
the whole hospital,

289
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:54,339
someone who knows what you need should go.

290
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,312
Help us.

291
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,105
God, she's heavy.

292
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:11,375
If things go south,
just go to the hospital.

293
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,252
Getting food is the subgoal.

294
00:37:14,419 --> 00:37:15,837
Saving Ji-su is the main goal.

295
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,443
When did you start using swords?

296
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:43,782
It's been about 30 years.

297
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,910
I'm serious.

298
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:49,454
I grabbed a knife
at my first birthday ceremony.

299
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,710
You nearly made my appendix burst.

300
00:37:57,671 --> 00:38:00,757
What did you pick at your ceremony?

301
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:03,552
I picked

302
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:09,516
the thread, for a long life.

303
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:12,436
That's nice.

304
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:14,563
The thread…

305
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,917
It's August 25th.

306
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:40,505
I was planning on killing myself today.

307
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,016
You're the new student, right?

308
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,185
Why are you just standing there?

309
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:59,358
I don't know how much more you need,
but take this.

310
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:00,776
No need to pay me back.

311
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:02,986
You're pretty arrogant.

312
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,404
What?

313
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:06,573
What did I do wrong back then?

314
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,743
Watch out!

315
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:14,456
Be careful, guys!

316
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,249
Sorry! Are you okay?

317
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:21,129
Are you okay?

318
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,590
If I hadn't held out my hand,

319
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:28,512
would my life have been
a little bit different?

320
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:32,808
I guess you don't know
why I'm doing this to you.

321
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:37,229
But I have a good reason for this.

322
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,356
You son of a bitch…

323
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,899
You look pretty angry.

324
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:44,820
I guess you weren't beaten enough.

325
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,033
KIM DO-HUN

326
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:50,951
Four-eyes.

327
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:53,870
You.

328
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:56,206
Yes, you.

329
00:39:58,625 --> 00:39:59,835
It's your turn now.

330
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:03,880
But he looks…

331
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:05,549
Why?

332
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,220
Were you close with that jerk?

333
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,893
These guys all used
to be friends with him, too.

334
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,023
Don't do it if you don't want to.

335
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:23,775
I'm not forcing you.

336
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:27,154
By the way,

337
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:31,158
who were your friends again?

338
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:58,518
PARK JU-YEONG

339
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:04,316
I'm sorry…

340
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:12,991
You shit.

341
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:19,164
Oh, gosh. He looks so pitiful.

342
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,918
Why are you doing this to me?

343
00:41:24,503 --> 00:41:26,379
I'll tell you if you jump.

344
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:32,719
From now on, I'll kill anyone
who talks to Cha Hyun-su.

345
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:40,602
Why aren't your parents doing anything
when they know what you're going through?

346
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:43,939
Are they too busy?

347
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,567
Your dad works at my dad's company.

348
00:41:47,651 --> 00:41:48,944
Should I get him fired?

349
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:51,196
I heard that people who get fired

350
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,949
at that age commit suicide a lot.

351
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:55,867
You asshole!

352
00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:59,412
Do whatever you want to me, but
don't touch my dad, you son of a bitch!

353
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:07,003
You really know your place.

354
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:08,713
I'll tell you

355
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,383
why I'm doing this to you.

356
00:42:13,802 --> 00:42:15,262
The day

357
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:18,431
you offered me those dirty coins,

358
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:22,018
the sky was so clear.

359
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:24,854
That's my reason.

360
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:27,440
Because the sky was so clear.

361
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:37,701
You're really something.

362
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,620
So you want to protect your family.

363
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,706
But

364
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,251
would your family do the same for you?

365
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,545
Forgive him.

366
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:50,297
I hated my father for that.

367
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,426
Your father is doing this
to protect our family.

368
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:55,927
You understand, right?

369
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:57,470
And I hated my mother for it, too.

370
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:00,473
Cha Hyun-su is my brother?

371
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,059
What stupid bitch said that?

372
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:04,019
Ji-yeon?

373
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:06,855
That's ridiculous. I don't have a brother!

374
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:09,274
I hated my sister, too.

375
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:13,862
After my father visited my school,

376
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:16,072
the bullying stopped.

377
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:19,743
But…

378
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:23,246
I couldn't live as my old self anymore.

379
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:29,294
That was

380
00:43:30,086 --> 00:43:31,338
what upset me the most.

381
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:33,757
I'll give you money
for your mom's surgery.

382
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,677
Okay? Just run into the road
when a car comes.

383
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:53,109
You go instead.

384
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:01,993
My father was fired the next day.

385
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,293
Hyun-su, your friend's here.

386
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:14,255
It's your fault!

387
00:44:15,006 --> 00:44:18,426
My mom died because of you.

388
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:22,138
I wanted

389
00:44:23,014 --> 00:44:25,225
to become a decent person,

390
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:30,105
but there was nothing I could do…

391
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:34,359
but try to kill myself.

392
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,078
But today,

393
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,333
I'm leaving this place

394
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,710
to survive.
