Your mom's been through it, and...

468
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,886
‐ Um, Victor,

469
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:27,222
uh, my mom's not an addict.

470
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,187
‐ But, but at lunch, you said that‐‐
‐ Yeah, I know what I said.

471
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,733
So when my mom and dad met,

472
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,319
he was this young psych professor.

473
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:45,532
And my mom was this total
free spirit artist.

474
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,534
She was taking one of his classes.

475
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:51,914
And, um, anyway,
they eventually got married,

476
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,124
um, because he wanted to.

477
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:58,921
And then they had a kid,
because he wanted to.

478
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:05,761
And when he became university president,
they moved into this giant house.

479
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:10,349
And then all of a sudden,
she was alone all day.

480
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,018
Trapped in this huge house.

481
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,812
In this life that she never wanted.

482
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,982
Trapped with me.

483
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,154
I think at a certain point, she just...

484
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:29,159
couldn't take it anymore.
So, she left.

485
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,789
No explanation. No goodbye.

486
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,585
‐ So why do you tell people
that she was an addict?

487
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,048
‐ Uh...

488
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,009
...because, um...

489
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:51,431
I don't, I don't want to admit that I...

490
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:56,353
