<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color=#ffff00>"Secrets of Sulphur Springs"...</font>

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:06,859
Remember that jolt I felt
coming out of the hatch?

3
00:00:07,062 --> 00:00:09,023
<i>What if we went through
a portal or something?</i>

4
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:10,454
<i>A portal?</i>

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,041
<i>The hotel
is open for business,</i>

6
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,375
<i>Savannah hasn't gone missing,</i>

7
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:14,421
<i>your dad is our age.</i>

8
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:16,016
Time travel is
the only explanation.

9
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,742
We can see what happened
to Savannah.

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,398
Maybe
even save her.

11
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:20,868
You heard what
Griffin's parents said.

12
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,460
The Tremont
is completely safe.

13
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,179
The Tremont is cursed!

14
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,250
My mom doesn't
want me talking to you.

15
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:27,711
She said
we can't be friends.

16
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,354
<i>'Cause
I live at The Tremont?</i>

17
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:31,330
<i>I'm telling you,
I heard something.</i>

18
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:33,885
- Mom!
- Mom!

19
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,142
We have to get
out of here!

20
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,572
Savannah's upstairs!

21
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:39,003
What if we really did disturb
a spirit or something

22
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,400
when we moved in?

23
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,179
Harper said
Savannah went missing

24
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:45,674
the summer before
the hotel closed.

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,814
You must've been at camp
around the same time.

26
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:49,681
I never met her.

27
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:51,950
You sure about this?
What if your mom finds out?

28
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,158
<i>It'll be worth it
if we can change history.</i>

29
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:55,877
It's Savannah!

30
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:14,861
Oh, my gosh.
Ben, you jerk.

31
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:16,656
I so knew it was you.

32
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:19,023
No one over five still buys
the Moss Man legend.

33
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:21,360
Yeah, then, uh,
why'd you scream?

34
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,994
Whoa. Uh, company.

35
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:28,447
Who are you guys?
I'd know it if you were campers.

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,993
Relax. I saw them yesterday
at the hotel.

37
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:34,158
Yeah, um, we're staying there
with our families.

38
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,369
So do you have any names?

39
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:40,123
Sure. Uh, I'm Harry
and this is...

40
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,085
- Um, Hermione.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,392
They almost took the heat
for my snake prank.

42
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:46,300
Sorry about that.

43
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,502
Nah, it's cool.
Outran 'em, no problem.

44
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,955
So, Savannah,
what's in the backpack?

45
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,635
How do you know
my name?

46
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,775
I, uh, must've heard it
around the hotel.

47
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:00,033
After all,
you're a bit of a legend.

48
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,916
I am?

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,353
It's a two‐month supply
of powdered punch.

50
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:08,228
What? You didn't think I saw
you stealing it out of the kitchen?

51
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:14,142
All cherry red,
blood red.

52
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,408
We dump it in the springs and scare the
pants off of everyone staying in the hotel.

53
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,577
Outstanding.

54
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,119
You guys can help
if you want.

55
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:23,681
Grab a container
and everyone spread out.

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,963
We get caught,
we're dead.

57
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,791
You two can keep
a secret, right?

58
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:31,088
- Actually pretty good at it.
- So far, anyway.

59
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:39,892
Oops, dropped it.

60
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:41,770
- How much do we add?
- All of it.

61
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,369
Done.
Check it out, guys.

62
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,119
Oh‐ho! Gnarly!

63
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,135
No. Epic.

64
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,822
Remember,
you guys agreed.

65
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,767
Never mention this
to anyone.

66
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,103
Especially your parents.

67
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,605
- Got it.
- Not a word!

68
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,330
Uh, we get off here.
Hotel's that way.

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,072
See you tomorrow?

70
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:15,848
- Well... ‐Yeah, sure.
- Uh, we'll stop by.

71
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,100
Awesome.

72
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,766
Epic.

73
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:23,633
I like that.

74
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,473
- See ya.
- Bye.

75
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:26,809
- Bye.
- Later.

76
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,750
My dad said
he didn't know Savannah.

77
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:37,086
He lied to me. To my face.
Why would he do that?

78
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:39,125
Because he had
something to hide?

Look, I get it.

84
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,531
He's your father.
It's hard to even imagine.

85
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:18,251
- He would never do anything...
- But he lied to you, Griffin.

86
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:19,870
Why would he,
unless he had something

87
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,375
to do with
her disappearance?

88
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:25,109
I just can't believe it.
It has to be something else.

89
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,476
Maybe it hurts too much,
the memories,

90
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,539
so doesn't want
to think about it.

91
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:33,218
What?

92
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,719
Just sort of like with my mom
after my dad died.

93
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,674
I was only four
so I don't remember much.

94
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,492
My mom still never
really talks about him.

95
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,055
- It can't be.
- A dance?

96
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,527
The dance.
The camp dance!

97
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,237
That's the night
Savannah went missing.

98
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,656
It was in the newspapers,
everything I read online.

99
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,817
She never made it back to
the bunkhouse. Look at the date.

100
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,789
August 19th.

101
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:03,336
So if we're right, and we're
exactly 30 years in the past,

102
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,719
- Savannah will go missing in...
- In only a few days.

103
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,455
There's not enough time.

104
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,979
There's still a lot
to figure out,

105
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,352
like, how, and when,
and where?

106
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,328
Where?
In the past.

107
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,486
When?
In the next few days.

108
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,047
And...
what was the last part?

109
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:26,680
Um, how?

110
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:28,635
That's the easy bit.

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,085
We change the past,
and Savannah doesn't go missing.

112
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,080
Only if...

113
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,809
Only what?

114
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,914
What if the past doesn't
want to be changed?

115
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,923
I mean, maybe we're
messing with things

116
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:40,993
that shouldn't be
messed with.

117
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:42,656
So you don't want
to save her?

118
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,524
I'm thinking
about my dad.

119
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,773
And if he had
something to do with it.

120
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,766
Which we need
to figure out.

121
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:50,657
What effect
we're having on the past?

122
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,247
What changing
it might do?

123
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,798
We need to be careful.

124
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:56,906
We will be.
Nothing crazy. Nothing rash.

125
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,765
I promise.

126
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:01,156
Tomorrow's Saturday.

127
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,164
I say we go back,
see what we can find out.

128
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:07,024
Even if it's something
we don't want to know.

129
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:10,234
- Okay.
- Okay, fine.

130
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,930
But right now,
I need to get upstairs.

131
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,501
We need to get home before they're
sending out search parties for us.

132
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,422
That you, Griffin?

133
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,913
There you are. What
are you doing down here?

134
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:45,954
Um, I just, uh,
got a little hungry.

135
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,664
- What about you?
- Couldn't sleep.

136
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,727
- Dad's snoring?
- Hmm. Opposite.

137
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:55,586
He found old blueprints of
the hotel and got all excited.

138
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:57,875
Nothing for you
to worry about.

139
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,477
Okay, come on, Mom. You
know he's been acting weird.

140
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,430
Like every time
I mention Savannah

141
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,320
or the time
he went to camp here...

142
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,718
Hey. This is grown‐up stuff.
You be the kid.

143
00:07:08,058 --> 00:07:10,164
And go upstairs
and go to bed.

144
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:11,500
Exactly.

145
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:12,835
- 'Night, Mom.
- 'Night.

146
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,641
Mom's gonna kill you
for being out so late.

147
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,589
Hanging out
at The Tremont again?

148
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,424
Aah!

149
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:00,833
Whoa.

150
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:02,928
What did you do?

151
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:06,430
- Oh. Nothing. It's just punch.
- Punch?

152
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,774
You know, Mom doesn't like you
watching those movies.

153
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,308
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

154
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:12,854
Exactly. Which is why
you're not going to mention

155
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,775
I may or may not have been
at The Tremont tonight.

156
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:16,777
Wait a minute.
That's blackmail.

157
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,672
Yes. That's kind of
exactly what it is.

158
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,820
Oh, Topher, just keep the
screams down. I need my sleep.

159
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:32,484
Aah!

160
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,320
"not in her bunk
the next morning."

161
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,971
"dredging nearby lake."

162
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,744
Salt.
Wards off evil spirits.

163
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,343
That's not someone
at the door.

164
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,041
Ghost,
for real this time.

165
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,715
Dad? What are you doing?

166
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,369
He's gone crazy.

167
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:28,096
Dad, stop! You'll knock
the whole wall down.

168
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,963
Just this one. Stay back.

169
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,580
Seemed like
a perfectly okay wall to me.

170
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:38,025
Found those old blueprints.

171
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,689
The original ones,
I think.

172
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:43,361
There's a room behind this wall.
Probably boarded‐up years ago.

173
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,020
- A secret room?
- With no door.

174
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,134
Did you feel that?

175
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:56,822
- Goosebumps.
- Savannah?

176
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:59,908
Kids, get away from there.
It could be dangerous.

177
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:02,004
So we're taking down
walls now?

178
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,453
Cheaper to do it yourself.

179
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,557
Come on, guys. Why don't
you see the garden I'm planting?

180
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:08,696
- But we wanna see.
- No arguments.

181
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:10,924
Griff, buddy,
hand me that flashlight.

182
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,228
What is this place?

183
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,596
Looks like
some kind of workshop.

184
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:59,395
<i>♪ There's
a place in Louisiana ♪</i>

185
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:04,267
<i>♪ Under sugar maple shade ♪</i>

186
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,916
Dad, you okay?

187
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,315
Dad?

188
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,605
What was that song?

189
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:16,580
Your mom's right.
It's, uh...

190
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:18,635
It's not safe in here.
Come on.

191
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:36,557
He was pretending he wasn't,
but my dad was totally freaked.

192
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,885
It was a song,
maybe from camp.

193
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,668
A girl was singing it.

194
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,254
That's when
he pulled the plug out?

195
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,015
He wanted to stop it.

196
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,188
I'm thinking
more bad memories.

197
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,563
More reason to go back there
and find the truth.

198
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:51,486
Tell me about the cold wind
when he opened the wall.

199
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,971
It was weird.
It was like some kind of ghost.

200
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:57,078
Well, if it was
Savannah's ghost,

201
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:58,621
she may be trying
to reach out to us.

202
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,573
To get us to help her.
To save her.

203
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,283
And maybe if we save
Savannah, we'll save your dad too.

204
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:09,782
We had to close the springs.

205
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,460
I want to know
who's behind this prank.

206
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:15,054
Ben and Savannah.
I pretty much caught 'em red‐handed.

207
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,658
I hope you took
disciplinary action.

208
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,799
Of course. Not that it's
any deterrent to those two.

209
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,640
- They're both trouble.
- Yeah, together.

210
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,341
Oh, goodness.

211
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,271
Maybe we should separate them.

212
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,238
<i>♪ There's a place

213
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:36,713
<i>♪ Under sugar maple shade ♪</i>

214
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:39,654
That's it! That's the
song on the tape.

215
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,924
No Savannah or Ben.

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,494
Let's try the camp.

217
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,439
Looks like fun.

218
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:58,062
Oh, yeah,
a real blast.

219
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,049
Third time this summer
I've painted this bridge.

220
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,166
Where's Ben?

221
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:04,083
Around back, trail‐duty.

222
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,252
Clearing a path or...
supposed to be clearing a path.

223
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,713
Give you a hand?
Um, goes quicker that way.

224
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:12,300
I'll go see
what Ben's up to.

225
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,018
Hey, other way.

226
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,705
Goofy kid.

227
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:21,654
But he's kinda cute.

228
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:26,295
Hey.

229
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,468
Harry. Jeez!

230
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,829
You scared me.

231
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,780
So, I, uh,
heard about the bust.

232
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,085
Ugh. You and the
rest of the world.

233
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:37,920
My dad went back
to the city this morning,

234
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,978
but not before
chewing me out.

235
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,071
Let me ask you something.

236
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,251
Your dad
as big a pain as mine is?

237
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,641
Sometimes.

238
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,440
Only thing that makes
my dad happy is work.

239
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:52,696
Or when I'm in trouble.

240
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:54,666
That makes his day.

241
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,679
Imagine how thrilled he'd be
if I got tossed out of here.

242
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,408
Is-Is that what you want?

243
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,095
You kidding?

244
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,619
I love it here.

245
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:05,127
Savannah and I just have to be
more careful with our pranks.

246
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,142
It seems like you two
really get along.

247
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,509
Savannah? Yeah,
yeah, she's all right.

248
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:14,033
You, uh... You do know
the snake prank was her idea?

249
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,595
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:20,712
You know, don't get me wrong,
I really look forward to camp.

251
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,455
Even if it's a different one
every year.

252
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,849
You know I'm a foster kid,
right?

253
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,048
- Must be kind of tough.
- Only one thing.

254
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:31,314
If Moss Man
were to snatch me,

255
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:33,455
no one would miss me.

256
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:37,846
That was a joke.

257
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,876
Right, a joke.

258
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,869
Look, Savannah, I wasn't
going to say anything, um...

259
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,993
but, me and Harry
aren't really from around here.

260
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,497
We're from...

261
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:55,381
‐We're from the‐‐
‐Detroit?

262
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:57,471
Chicago, Mars?

263
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:58,751
No.

264
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,219
I mean, yes.

265
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:02,142
- Mars?
- Chicago.

266
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:05,626
Oh, that's actually
a pretty normal place.

267
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,166
You had me expecting
some sort of bombshell.

268
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,705
- It's really hot. You want a Popsicle?
- Sure.

269
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,994
- I'll go swipe us a couple.
- Okay.

270
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:21,783
You're wasting your time
on that freaky Savannah.

271
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,017
Total troublemaker.

272
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,400
I really don't know
what Ben sees in her.

273
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,166
You must be new.
I'm Jessica,

274
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:32,572
but everyone
calls me Jess.

275
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,955
My mother.
Right in front of me.

276
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:37,131
I'm shaking her hand.

277
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,150
She knew your father.
She knew Savannah.

278
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:41,486
My whole life, she never
mentioned she went to camp.

279
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,979
And topping it all off,

280
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:44,930
it seemed like she had
a crush on your dad.

281
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,974
- Okay, that's a little gross.
- A little?

282
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:48,467
You're right.

283
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:50,685
This may be more
complicated than I thought.

284
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,316
Changing the past
could be dangerous.

285
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,337
Say we save Savannah,
then what happens?

286
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,860
The springs don't dry up,
the hotel stays open,

287
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,613
my dad never comes back
to fix it up,

288
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:01,911
and you never get obsessed
with the whole thing

289
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,412
because Savannah
never went missing.

290
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:04,903
Which means we never meet,
never go through the hatch.

291
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:08,129
All right, stop!
You're making my head hurt.

292
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:12,512
Harper, I'm thinking...
we can't risk it. Any of it.

293
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,621
And we can't do this
alone anymore.

294
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,855
We have to tell
our parents.

295
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,191
We have to show 'em the tunnel,
the bunker, the hatch.

296
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,777
- But...
- But what?

297
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,356
What if the portal
doesn't work for them

298
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,020
because they can't exist
in two times.

299
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:26,426
Or maybe they'll get in
the way to keep the secret.

300
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,012
We don't have a choice,
Harper!

301
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:29,923
We're just kids.

302
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:33,215
I can't go to my father,
so I'm telling my mother,

303
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:36,057
and you need to tell yours.
It's game over.

304
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:44,863
We've mapped the whole
place. Each floor. See?

305
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:46,516
Guys, three steps
to the right.

306
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,883
It's every place
we felt a cold spot.

307
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,845
Behind the wall, in the
pantry, dining room...

308
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,631
The basement
was the coldest.

309
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,590
- Dad, you felt them, right?
- Felt what?

310
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:00,121
The cold spots. It's
all on the map. See?

311
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:01,756
They're all yours.

312
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:03,050
- Kitchen...
- In the kitchen.

313
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,636
- Dining room...
- In the dining room.

314
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,770
Lobby and porch...

315
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:08,130
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.

316
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,531
I'm still worried
what'll happen.

317
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,441
Anyone ever tell you,
you worry too much?

318
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,111
This place is not haunted.

319
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,157
- How do you know?
- It's a drafty, old hotel.

320
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,743
And all that, what you've
mapped out, can be explained.

321
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,363
- But we felt the cold spot.
- Griff, tell them, please.

322
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:26,907
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

323
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:28,185
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

324
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:29,534
But, Daddy...

325
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,020
You have to believe us.

326
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:46,862
You've got something to say,
or you're just watching?

327
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:49,707
Because if you're just watching,
you better start grabbing some weeds.

328
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,152
Dad's been lying. To me.
To you. To all of us.

329
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,986
That's a pretty big statement.

330
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,147
He knew Savannah.
They were in camp together.

331
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,142
They were friends,
they did stuff.

332
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:04,246
- Pranks and stuff.
- He told you this?

333
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,402
No...
Uh, it's, uh...

334
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:09,449
Someone told you.

335
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,286
Look, it's hard to explain.
But...

336
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,911
You got all this from Harper,
didn't you?

337
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,808
No, no. I... Uh...

338
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:17,214
Made it up,
all by yourself?

339
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,168
Yes. I mean, no.
It...

340
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,795
Look, you just have
to go to the basement.

341
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:22,808
Nobody's allowed
in that basement.

342
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,143
- But it...
- Not anymore.

343
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:25,978
And I do not like
being lied to.

344
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,468
As for Harper, her mother
doesn't even want her here.

345
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:30,401
- Neither does your father.
- Of course, they don't.

346
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,237
Look, this
is real simple, Griffin.

347
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,471
You and Harper
need to take a break.

348
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,250
What's going on?

349
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,768
Go inside and take a shower.
You're filthy.

350
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:40,773
Do some homework, and then
it'll be time for dinner.

351
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,975
With no talk of Savannah.

352
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,103
You were right.

353
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,451
I put my foot down.

354
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,708
How was your day?

355
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:10,656
Or maybe I should ask,
what was your day?

356
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,885
Just goofing around.
Riding my bike.

357
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,008
Mmm.

358
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:19,451
You know, Topher tells me
you got home late last night.

359
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,537
Says you were
out with Griffin.

360
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:24,132
Is that where you were today?
The Tremont?

361
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,139
The woods.
Never The Tremont.

362
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:27,725
Hon, I thought
I made myself clear.

363
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,019
We ran into each other

364
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:30,498
on our bikes.

365
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,383
We rode over to where
the old camp used to be.

366
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:33,893
It's just some
old boards now.

367
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:36,139
And it's still
on The Tremont property.

368
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,186
Mom, did you used
to go to camp there?

369
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,748
Of course not.

370
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,429
Why would you ask me that?

371
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:46,436
I just figured
if Griffin's dad went,

372
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:48,428
and half of the rest
of the town.

373
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,912
Plus you've never really
mentioned it...

374
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:51,342
Because I didn't go!

375
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,062
Look, baby, I'm sorry.

376
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,082
It's just...

377
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,053
You know how I feel
about that place.

378
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,693
There's just...
something about it.

379
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:07,726
And someday
you'll tell me what it is.

380
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:10,732
<i>Hi, Jess.</i>

381
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:14,568
Lois!
How are you?

382
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:16,962
<i>I was actually
gonna give you a call.</i>

383
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,514
Uh, is your sister
still looking for work?

384
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,858
What are you doing here?
How'd you even get in?

385
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:23,733
There's an oak tree
outside the twins' room,

386
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:24,984
and their
window was open.

387
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:26,752
Anyway,
what did your mother say?

388
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,354
You were right.
I tried to tell her,

389
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,164
but she didn't believe
a word of it.

390
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:34,089
- And that's about all I got.
- A word.

391
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,651
My mother flat‐out said
she never went to camp.

392
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,518
She's covering something up.
Just like your dad.

393
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,243
Yeah, I thought
I could turn to my mom,

394
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:45,721
but now she's on the "Stay
away from Harper" train, too.

395
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,143
She says we need
to take a break.

396
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:49,963
Are we going to?

397
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:53,330
How are we gonna
save Savannah if we do?

398
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,885
I'm scared, Griffin.

399
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:57,951
Me too.

400
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:01,924
Do you feel that?

401
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:13,815
She's here.

402
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:28,476
<i>Next time on</i>
Secrets of Sulphur Springs...

403
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:30,187
What are you doing down here?

404
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,629
No one else believes us
about Savannah's ghost.

405
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:34,018
<i>So we're gonna catch her
on camera.</i>

406
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,508
That's what the camera is for?
Your funeral.

407
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,885
We have to go back and find out
exactly what our parents are hiding.

408
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:41,013
Just because you act like
you're in charge, Jess,

409
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:42,813
it doesn't mean
you actually are.

410
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:45,463
<i>Griffin, I think she might've actually
done something to Savannah.</i>

411
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,626
I just think this place
would be a whole lot nicer

412
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,803
if she'd just...
go away.

413
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,624
