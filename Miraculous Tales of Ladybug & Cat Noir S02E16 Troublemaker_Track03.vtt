&lrm;You should take the elevator next time!

&lrm;My deltaplane express delivery
&lrm;wasn't the best idea.

&lrm;For you, Milady!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.140
&lrm;Seriously, Cat Noir?
&lrm;You're about to transform back.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.580
&lrm;So what?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.580
&lrm;Well, if you transform back,
&lrm;then I'll know who you are, and then...

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.300
&lrm;And then we won't have to keep secrets
&lrm;from each other any more.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.700
&lrm;We'll be united, more powerful and free.
&lrm;We'll defeat Hawk Moth,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
&lrm;then we can both run away to an island,
&lrm;far away from everything!

&lrm;We'll live of nothing but fruits!

&lrm;I can't accept this rose from you.

&lrm;I've told you already,
&lrm;I'm in love with someone else.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.700
&lrm;I know, Milady. But if he weren't here,
&lrm;would things be different between us?

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.700
&lrm;Well, you know, I can't even begin
&lrm;to imagine him not being here.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.180
&lrm;I'm sorry, Cat Noir.
&lrm;I really gotta get going.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.940
&lrm;And you'd better do the same.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.260

&lrm;Way too predictable!

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.460
&lrm;What's going on, Adrien?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.980
&lrm;I enjoy defeating you, but it's no fun
&lrm;when you make it that easy.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.380
&lrm;Do you ever get the feeling
&lrm;that you're stuck, Kagami?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.100
&lrm;That, no matter what you do, it's the same
&lrm;old story, over and over again?

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.940
&lrm;That things will never, ever change?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.100
&lrm;Adrien, the biggest mistake a fencer can
&lrm;make isn't choosing the wrong technique,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.460
&lrm;it's choosing the wrong target.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.020
&lrm;Change targets.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.540
&lrm;Well, well, Casanova,
&lrm;you got yourself a new contender?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.060
&lrm;No. No way.
&lrm;Ladybug's the only one I love. But...

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.540
&lrm;Ladybug doesn't love you, so maybe it's
&lrm;about time you changed your tune. Right?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.380
&lrm;Why should it be different with Kagami?
&lrm;I must not have the right technique.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.620
&lrm;I don't know a thing about human girls,
&lrm;but when I meet a beautiful camembert...

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.260
&lrm;I introduce myself. "Hello, camembert.
&lrm;I'm Plagg, so very nice to... eat you!"

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.260
&lrm;Thanks, but I'll get love advice
&lrm;from someone else.

&lrm;Uh...

&lrm;-Huh? You think so?
&lrm;-Actually, what I meant was,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.300
&lrm;I need some advice right now. Can we talk?

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.780
&lrm;Uh... Abosutely.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.220
&lrm;OK, well... I'm sorry,
&lrm;this is a bit awkward for me.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.300
&lrm;-Because it's about a girl.
&lrm;-A... girl?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.020
&lrm;We see each other all the time.
&lrm;We study together.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.100
&lrm;We've just been friends,
&lrm;you know, until recently.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.980
&lrm;-Till... recently?
&lrm;-Now I'm starting to see her differently.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.020
&lrm;-Has the same thing ever happened to you?
&lrm;-Yes. No. Probably. What's she like?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.220
&lrm;She's special. Very Pretty.
&lrm;She's got dark, silky hair.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.540
&lrm;Deep and mysterious eyes.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.940
&lrm;Do... do I know her?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.260
&lrm;Yeah! It's... Kagami!

&lrm;Marinette?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.340
&lrm;-Uh? What?
&lrm;-I was just asking you

&lrm;-what I should do about Kagami.
&lrm;-The Ice Queen?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.980
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-The Ice... rink!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.460
&lrm;That's what I said. No better place
&lrm;to break the ice than the ice rink!

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.980
&lrm;The ice rink? I think I'd be too shy
&lrm;to go there with her by myself.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.300
&lrm;Well, uh, I could come along with you,
&lrm;if you'd like!

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.780
&lrm;You'd do that? That's awesome!

&lrm;to the ice rink together! Thanks!

&lrm;I don't think I want to cancel.

&lrm;-Huh?
&lrm;-Adrien really needs me.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.900
&lrm;And if he wants my advice, then why not?

&lrm;After all, it's not an issue,
&lrm;and I'm definitely not jealous, 'cause--

&lrm;-There's everything between you!

&lrm;Whenever I talk to him as a friend,
&lrm;I hardly stammer at all!

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.820
&lrm;That's a sign right there, right?

&lrm;on your fencing moves?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.900
&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt said he was very
&lrm;disappointed at your last session.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.140
&lrm;Yes, I'm heading out for a one-on-one
&lrm;lesson with my strongest partner, Kagami.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.620
&lrm;Hmm.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.060
&lrm;Could you drive me to the ice rink?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.220
&lrm;I said I was going for a lesson,
&lrm;but I didn't say it was a fencing lesson.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.540
&lrm;I can't believe it, Mr. Mayor!
&lrm;You want to shut my ice rink down?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.940
&lrm;This is not your ice rink, Philippe.
&lrm;It belongs to the Parisians.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.420
&lrm;I'm not closing it down. I'll just be
&lrm;converting it into an indoor gym

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.620
&lrm;for my Chloé... uh, my city.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.980
&lrm;Nobody comes for lessons, anyway!

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.820
&lrm;You haven't had a single student sign-up
&lrm;this year. Just look around you!

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.700
&lrm;Oh!

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.580
&lrm;Huh? Wrong, Mr. Mayor!
&lrm;Some new skaters! I knew it!

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.820
&lrm;OK, OK! If you can get just one single
&lrm;sign-up within ten minutes,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.980
&lrm;I'll put the gym conversion work on hold!

&lrm;Consider it done!

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.900
&lrm;It was really cool of you to bring Luka.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.420
&lrm;Of course. That's what friends are for.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.060
&lrm;I don't know what to do about Kagami.
&lrm;Should I... offer to hold her hand?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.740
&lrm;-You have to let her fall.
&lrm;-Huh?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.540
&lrm;No, what I meant was
&lrm;you&lrm;<i> cannot</i>&lrm; let her fall in any way.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.060
&lrm;I mean, do whatever you can
&lrm;so she doesn't fall!

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.500
&lrm;So, yeah! Grab a hold of her hand
&lrm;and take her onto the ice and then...

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.620
&lrm;Aaah!

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.340
&lrm;Try to be natural. Go with the flow and
&lrm;listen to the rhythm. Just follow my lead.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.220
&lrm;-Don't be scared. I won't tell anyone.
&lrm;-About what?

&lrm;Come on!

&lrm;-You OK?
&lrm;-Uh-huh.

&lrm;Hey, have you ever thought about
&lrm;signing up for ice-skating lessons?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.260
&lrm;The judges couldn't resist
&lrm;that smile of yours!

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.420
&lrm;That's nice of you, but my life
&lrm;is already filled with music.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.020
&lrm;And I might have a brand new song
&lrm;to write, so...

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.060
&lrm;Music's an important part of skating!
&lrm;Think about it!

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.100
&lrm;Did you invite them
&lrm;not to be alone with me?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.540
&lrm;Of course not! It's just that
&lrm;I asked Marinette to help me.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.140
&lrm;-Help you with what?
&lrm;-To perfect my figure-skating skills!

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.060
&lrm;But you don't need her for that.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.860
&lrm;Ah!

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.860
&lrm;You have what it takes to be a champion.
&lrm;The style, the talent...

&lrm;-Let me be your coach!
&lrm;-I only practise noble arts,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.940
&lrm;like archery or fencing.
&lrm;Ice-skating is just for fun.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.100
&lrm;Aaah!

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.980
&lrm;I'll give you a week of lessons for free!
&lrm;Just few hours a day and you'd be a star!

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.140
&lrm;Thanks,
&lrm;but I'm already very busy as it is.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.980
&lrm;Is that Adrien Agreste?

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.100
&lrm;Adrien Agreste, I can see it now!

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.660
&lrm;Grace and style, model
&lrm;and professional ice-skating champion!

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.100
&lrm;If you take lessons with me,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.140
&lrm;I'll have you shining
&lrm;like the candles on a birthday cake!

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.820
&lrm;Um... maybe.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.060
&lrm;He already does fencing with me!

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.300
&lrm;Ugh! Argh!
&lrm;[gasps]

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.780
&lrm;-Are you OK?
&lrm;-Are you OK?

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.660
&lrm;See how lessons could come in handy?

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.500
&lrm;Please, Adrien Agreste,
&lrm;just put your name on this form

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.780
&lrm;and your fans will come running...
&lrm;and my ice rink will be saved!

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.140
&lrm;None of them want to sign up.
&lrm;You can't force them now, can you?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.540
&lrm;You're right.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.100
&lrm;Get up!

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.900
&lrm;The only reason you can't stay
&lrm;on your feet is your hesitation.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.700
&lrm;I never hesitate.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.740
&lrm;Shall we go?

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.140
&lrm;Marinette, are you OK?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.020
&lrm;I think I hurt myself.
&lrm;It's probably best we call it a day.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.620
&lrm;Marinette doesn't look too good.
&lrm;Sorry. I have to go and check on her.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.860
&lrm;I'm sorry, Philippe, but the ice rink
&lrm;will be closed down tonight.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.140
&lrm;Ah! A burning passion
&lrm;that's about to be put on ice.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.900
&lrm;What perfect bait for my akuma.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.340
&lrm;Fly away, my pretty akuma, and evilise
&lrm;this ice-skater's newly frozen heart!

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.540
&lrm;Why are you so sad?

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.220
&lrm;[sighs]
&lrm;I like Luka. He's really nice.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.980
&lrm;But do you think he's just like Adrien?
&lrm;Just a friend?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.500
&lrm;Marinette? Are you OK?

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.460
&lrm;-Yeah, I'm fine.
&lrm;-You're meant to be in love with Ladybug

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.700
&lrm;and you ditch Kagami
&lrm;to go after Marinette?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.260
&lrm;Me? Going after Marinette?

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.380
&lrm;No, she's just a friend.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.300
&lrm;Frozer, I am Hawk Moth.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.620
&lrm;They want to take your rink away from you.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.380
&lrm;So, from now on,
&lrm;all of Paris will be your ice kingdom!

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.260
&lrm;In return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.500
&lrm;Ready to skate, Hawk Moth!

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.900
&lrm;What is that?

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.100
&lrm;Marinette! Hide!

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.300
&lrm;Is that ice? Whoa!
&lrm;Let's try out Master Fu's Magicaroon!

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.500
&lrm;Tikki, power up!

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.580
&lrm;StalacTikki.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.660
&lrm;StalacTikki, spots on!

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.460
&lrm;Ha!

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.260
&lrm;Plagg! Power up!

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.940
&lrm;-PlagGlacier!
&lrm;-PlagGlacier, claws out!

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.140
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.220
&lrm;Your frozen statues will sparkle
&lrm;like trophies above my kingdom of ice!

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.060
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.380
&lrm;Cat Noir, we need to set up a trap

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.900
&lrm;for whoever turned the city
&lrm;into a giant ice rink!

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.300
&lrm;My feline instincts prefer
&lrm;to track and observe before I attack.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.020
&lrm;You go your way, I'll go mine.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.420
&lrm;You're not still mad at me about the rose?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.740
&lrm;There may be
&lrm;a certain chill now between us.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.700
&lrm;I get it. But we should really
&lrm;focus on saving Paris!

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.500
&lrm;We don't always have to do
&lrm;everything together!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.820
&lrm;-It's not like we're a couple!
&lrm;-Cat Noir, don't get all pouty on me!

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.580
&lrm;[groans]

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:53.980
&lrm;This way!

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.460
&lrm;I need to set a trap,
&lrm;but what could I use as bait?

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.980
&lrm;[chuckles]

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.380
&lrm;Thanks, kitty.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.500
&lrm;He's too fast!

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.300
&lrm;I'm positive the akuma is in his skates.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.500
&lrm;My cataclysm could destroy his skates,
&lrm;but he'd have to be up in the air.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.780
&lrm;You were right. We'll have to set a trap.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.060
&lrm;You were right too.
&lrm;We observed and now we know enough!

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.020
&lrm;Seems we're just missing a little push
&lrm;of luck to get the edge on him!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.580
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.220
&lrm;A bag of salt?

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.300
&lrm;Salt makes ice melt!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.660
&lrm;OK, while I keep Frozer busy,
&lrm;you're gonna have to do some melting.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.220
&lrm;Listen!

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.820
&lrm;[groans]

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.780
&lrm;I'm waiting for you, Frozer!
&lrm;Don't get cold feet now!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.900
&lrm;Don't play with fire, Ladybug!

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.740
&lrm;-Let's see if you could do this!
&lrm;-Don't make me laugh!

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.020
&lrm;I'm closing in, Ladybug!

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.500
&lrm;The next one is tricky!

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.700
&lrm;Whoa!

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.580
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.220
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.940
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.300
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.580
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.460
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.780
&lrm;Pound it!

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.020
&lrm;You smashed through my plans
&lrm;like an ice-breaker, Ladybug,

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.220
&lrm;but revenge is a dish best served cold!

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.540
&lrm;This is Philippe at the ice rink,
&lrm;he makes skating so much fun!

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.580
&lrm;Thank you, Adrien!

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.100
&lrm;I hope this helps you
&lrm;get more students to sign up!

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.500
&lrm;You keep doing
&lrm;what other people want you to do.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.580
&lrm;No, I just want him to be happy.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.140
&lrm;And I'm not changing my target,
&lrm;even if it means failing over and over,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.820
&lrm;'cause, one day,
&lrm;I will succeed and hit it.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.940
&lrm;The day you realise you've got
&lrm;the wrong target, I'll be here.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.620
&lrm;[sighs]

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.620
&lrm;Do you want to take the subway together,
&lrm;Marinette?

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.780
&lrm;You should go over and talk to him.
&lrm;Thanks for inviting me out today.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.860
&lrm;Thanks for coming with me, Luka.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.700
&lrm;Adrien!

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.020
&lrm;Adrien!

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.700
&lrm;Marinette? Was there something
&lrm;you wanted to tell me?

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.780
&lrm;I love you, Adrien! Even if you love
&lrm;Kagami. I just had to tell you. There!

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.940
&lrm;Kagami? I don't love her.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.420
&lrm;You're the one I love.
&lrm;How could I have been so blind?

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.980
&lrm;Uh... You love me?

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.060
&lrm;So... We can get married
&lrm;and have a beautiful house

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.460
&lrm;and a dog, a cat or a hamster,
&lrm;and we'll name it--

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.980
&lrm;-Marinette!
&lrm;-Marinette?

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.580
&lrm;You OK, Marinette?

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.460
&lrm;I just wanted to say that...

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.180
&lrm;we should go and skate
&lrm;at the ice rink more often. Yeah!

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.660
&lrm;-You mean... just you and me?
&lrm;-You and me?

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.020
&lrm;Oh, no! Course not!

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.460
&lrm;'Cause we should take the whole gang
&lrm;there. Luka, Kagami, Alya, Nino!

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.020
&lrm;You're right. That would be awesome!
&lrm;I'll try to free up some time.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.980
&lrm;-See you at school.
&lrm;-Bye.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.780
&lrm;Tikki,
&lrm;please don't tell me I did it again!

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.140
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;You'll get there one day, Marinette.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.580
&lrm;One at a time, now!
&lrm;Yes, yes, sign up right here.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.300
&lrm;Learn to skate like Adrien Agreste!
