19

You're so cute.

21

23

that I cheated on you?

It said that I should be careful about love

and that there would be a third wheel.

85

You'll probably be too full before you get to.

170
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:16,218
About the shrimp paste cake incident,

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,845
I have thought about it thoroughly and I believe...

172
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:23,572
all of that could have been avoided.

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is a serious crime, Meka.

174
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:31,000
Had Tim not been rushed to the hospital,
can you imagine what would've happened?

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I sincerely apologize.

176
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,845
I never intended to let it happen that way.

177
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,218
I hope this will be a lesson for you

178
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,000
and remind you to think of the consequences
every time you do something.

179
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,164
And you should apologize directly to Tim.

180
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,000
You're lucky he didn't press charges.

181
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,000
Also, don't forget to thank him.

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,436
Now you two don't have to make BL content anymore because of him.

183
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,647
Huh?

184
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,300
What do you mean by that?

185
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,273
I'm gonna cancel all BL activities

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,873
and also withdraw the suspension for
all Thunderous Sky channel members.

187
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:06,364
Yay!

188
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:17,536
So you no longer want to promote our university?

189
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Oh, no!

190
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:21,782
Have you forgotten...

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,309
that I am a modern chancellor?

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,245
I just have a new project coming up.

193
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:33,136
If you need any help, I'll be happy to assist you.

194
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:36,709
Thank you both for paving the way

195
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,464
and inspiring new ideas for our university.

196
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:42,000
You two have enabled the society to realize
that our university

197
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,436
is inclusive and progressive.

198
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:48,000
After this, you two can move on and do your thing.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,345
Kimhan...

200
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:55,009
I'm looking forward to seeing the student club thrive
just like how you promised me.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
As for you, Meka,

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,791
please concentrate on your thesis
so you can graduate with success.

203
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:05,873
Now...

204
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:09,545
Let me introduce you my vision for the next quarter.

205
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:13,409
I'm going to focus on...

206
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:16,118
Girls' Love content!

207
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,627
Please stay tuned for more details!

208
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:29,799
Allez Cuisine!

209
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,317
Girls' Love!

210
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,127
The chancellor is brilliant,

211
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,608
and also weird.

212
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:41,482
Allez Cuisine!

213
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,327
Now you don't have to worry about getting suspended.

214
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,164
I guess you can go wild now.

215
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:52,043
Wild where?

216
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,727
Thunderous Sky channel is gone.

217
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,809
You guys are still mad at each other?

218
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,764
Someone's looking like a sick puppy here.

219
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,082
Come here.

220
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:06,685
Brighten up.

221
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,827
Quick, quick.

222
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:10,618
You're the best.

223
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:15,164
Since there'll be no more Mek-Kim content,
I hope you don't get too sad.

224
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll come by your place every day.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,264
I'm going to lock my door!

226
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,518
Then, I'm going to climb up to your room.

227
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:24,436
How about that?

228
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:25,846
Come on.

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,191
We only live a few steps apart, remember?

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,045
I gotta go.

231
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,373
See you again in the evening.

232
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,428
See you.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,618
I'm so curious...

234
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,272
about what you did at Mek's resort.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,700
I bet he got a free night promotion

236
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,354
plus the son of the owner!

237
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:07,000
Stop it, you two.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,782
You mean, stop the sweet love between you and him?

239
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:10,828
Come on. Let's go.

240
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,954
We have work to do, don't we?

241
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:14,544
What are you waiting for?

242
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:17,272
Here.

243
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:18,536
Drink this first.

244
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:23,218
It suits your sweet and refreshing life perfectly!

245
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,221
How is it?

246
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,673
Sweeeet, right?

247
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,646
Is it as sweet as Mek?

248
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,910
Let's go now!

249
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,020
We've got work to do.

250
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,292
- Okay, okay.
- Go.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Guys, I have good news.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What good news?

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,509
Gas price is going down?

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,191
No.

255
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,273
The chancellor won't need us to make BL content anymore.

256
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:58,000
She also removed suspension on the Thunderous Sky guys.

257
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,509
- Yes!
- Yes!

258
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:02,782
What are you so happy, Lee?

259
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:03,855
What about you?

260
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,434
Why be so happy?

261
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, because my Bear is not going to get suspended.

262
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,000
And that makes me happy.

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,490
So now you can call him "my Bear"?

264
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,027
Why can't I?

265
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:18,809
Don't you know...

266
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,700
that we're together now?

267
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,499
Since when?

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And why didn't you tell us?

269
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:28,700
I wanted to tell you guys.

270
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,509
I was just...

271
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,973
waiting for the right time.

272
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,291
Then I guess...

273
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:39,082
This is the right time for me to come clean, too.

274
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:41,521
What is it now?

275
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,436
What else do you guys want to tell me?

276
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,182
I am...

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,264
in a relationship with Park.

278
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,000
What? Since when did you have a thing for him?

279
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,673
7 years ago.

280
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:55,155
So you've had a crush on him for 7 years?

281
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,855
7 years that we've been together.

282
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,836
I think I'm gonna pass out.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Why didn't you tell us?

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,218
Well, you guys didn't ask.

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,673
I also have my personal reasons.

286
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,809
So I just date him in private.

287
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,218
You know you can share things with us.

288
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,873
You don't have to keep it to yourself.

289
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,709
When you keep things to yourself,

290
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,545
it can get worse.

291
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,004
So...

292
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:29,000
Any other shocking news you'd like to share?

293
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Just announce it all!

294
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:33,427
I have one.

295
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:35,809
You have one more?

296
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,409
I just want to tell you that...

297
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,654
I still haven't finished The One project.

298
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:43,191
Because I'm working on another project right now.

299
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:44,575
That's okay.

300
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,108
I'll take over.

301
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,427
I'll bring Mek in to help me.

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,373
You heard that, Lee?

303
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:54,218
He said he'll have Mek help him.

304
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:57,164
Loud and clear.

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,164
I guess he got the son of the resort's owner
as free gift for real!

306
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,018
Guys, stop it!

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Let's get back to work!

308
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you know that you're distracting me from work?

309
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,654
You need to get punished for it.

310
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:06,535
Mek, can you open the door for me?

311
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,554
Can you help me edit some videos?

312
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:15,788
Can I come in?

313
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:21,946
Well...

314
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,217
Please let me in.

315
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:28,479
What the heck is this, Mek!?

316
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,292
Is this a bedroom or a garbage pile?

317
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,274
If you're not using these, why don't you keep them away?

318
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,030
You're piling them up for what?

319
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,647
So many pieces of garbage around here!

320
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:40,914
I know.

321
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,329
You're complaining like a mother.

322
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:44,815
Then why don't you keep it clean so no one can complain?

323
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,820
What is this?

324
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,609
A bottle garden I made just for fun.

325
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:50,502
You want one?

326
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:51,628
I'll make one for you.

327
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,706
Well...

328
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,946
Sure, I do...

329
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,590
if you don't mind.

330
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,205
Did you wear this yet?

331
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:12,357
Yeah.

332
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,666
Then why didn't you put it in the basket?

333
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:17,928
The basket is just right there. Only a few steps away.

334
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,442
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

335
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,872
Are you going to do that all night?

336
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,591
What's the work you want me to help edit?

337
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,728
It's my work for the student club.

338
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,208
I want some nice transitions.

339
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,348
That's why I'm asking your for help.

340
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:51,703
But you don't need to make it as fancy as those Thunderous Sky contents.

341
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,095
Actually, I'm not in charge of editing work.

342
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,317
Park takes care of it.

343
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:57,519
And Bear is in charge of filming.

344
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:59,266
I'm the performer.

345
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,628
You miss them, don't you?

346
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:12,545
You miss your friends,
so why don't you apologize to them?

347
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:15,218
Making up with friends isn't that hard.

348
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,946
It's always hard if you're the one to make the first move.

349
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,095
But it's not hard when it comes to pranking Tim, huh?

350
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,628
And you didn't even say sorry.

351
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:27,600
Not again! Not again!

352
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,946
Not again! Not again!

353
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,826
You're complaining so much
you start having wrinkles now.

354
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:34,946
Do you realize that you're distracting me from work here?

355
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:36,042
Now...

356
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:37,852
You must get punished for it.

357
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:42,042
Ouch!

358
00:22:43,077 --> 00:22:45,170
You should get to work!

359
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:47,516
Okay, I will.

360
00:22:47,946 --> 00:22:50,170
But you need to stay here tonight

361
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,946
and oversee me working.

362
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,946
Please. Please.

363
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:56,077
Please. Please.

364
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,423
You must really get the work done, okay?

365
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,292
Kim, you're the best!

366
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,191
Alright.
Work, work, work.

367
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:10,282
Here.

368
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,288
Here?

369
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:12,355
Or here?

370
00:23:12,355 --> 00:23:13,469
Or here?

371
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,741
Can you guys make up already?

372
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,699
This is annoying.

373
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:28,152
I can talk to you.

374
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,703
- But I don't want...
- I am sorry!

375
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,375
It's my fault that I ditched Thunderous Sky

376
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,946
and left you guys behind.

377
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,133
I'm sorry for doing that to you.

378
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:41,078
I'm sorry that I yelled at you

379
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:42,702
and blamed you for being emotional.

380
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,442
I didn't mean that.

381
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:53,842
You know I've been waiting for you to say that for so long!

382
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,834
I miss you so much, Bear!

383
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,546
My life was so dull without your annoying voice.

384
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:04,555
I also miss your fugly face too!

385
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:18,853
I've been thinking.

386
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,919
I don't want to do Thunderous Sky channel anymore.

387
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,946
I think I lost my passion for it.

388
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:26,993
One more thing...

389
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:29,946
I've come to realize that what we did on it...

390
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:32,423
is not really a good thing.

391
00:24:32,946 --> 00:24:34,647
I'd like to try doing something else.

392
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:36,797
Something I've been interested in.

393
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,666
If you've discovered what you like, it's great, Mek.

394
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:42,722
I understand.

395
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,787
No matter what you do, we'll be here to support you.

396
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:49,778
Guys.

397
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:51,853
I freaking love us!

398
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:53,188
Me too.

399
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,610
My feelings are beyond love.

400
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,685
It's about time...

401
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:00,151
that Thunderous Sky has its final episode.

402
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,946
How are you doing with the new channel?

403
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,666
If you need any help, just let us know.

404
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:07,913
It's okay.

405
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,832
I have someone to help.

406
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,218
No worries.

407
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:18,759
Hello, Little Bears out there!

408
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,544
Now, you're watching Bear's Experiment channel!

409
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,946
And you're gonna love me like Rrrr!

410
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:26,226
And the content for today is...

411
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:29,562
My first ever part-time job at Taco Bell!

412
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,442
And Bomb will be mother bear who helps me.

413
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:35,058
Hello.

414
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:38,946
Do you have anything to say before we start, mother bear?

415
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:41,656
Little Bears, please give a lot of support to Bear.

416
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,805
Without further ado, let's get started!

417
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:51,554
Do you think I can make this work?

418
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:53,012
Yes, you can.

419
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:54,946
Because I'm right here with you.

420
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:57,050
So...

421
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:02,066
Can I get some additional moral support?

422
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,024
Okay.

423
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:15,498
Let's start.

424
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:16,881
Let's go!

425
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,706
Here we go!

426
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,516
You can fill your drinks over there.

427
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,282
Bomb, can you help me with this?

428
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:49,946
Hello.

429
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:51,921
- The food will be served shortly.
- Sure.

430
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,946
Next time, you need to add more cheese.

431
00:27:12,376 --> 00:27:13,592
Is this "cheese" enough for you?

432
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:23,894
Bear!

433
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,356
What are you doing?

434
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:26,466
There are lots of people here.

435
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:30,628
I'm tired.

436
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:33,544
And I just need a boost.

437
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,638
Is that enough?

438
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:47,828
Now my energy is through the roof!

439
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,544
That's the end of the first episode of Bear's Experiment.

440
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:57,946
Please stay tuned for my next experiment in the next episode.

441
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,946
For today, Bomb and I have to say goodbye now!

442
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,311
Bye!

443
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:18,500
How are you feeling?

444
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:19,617
You must be tired.

445
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:20,902
Yes, I'm tired.

446
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,108
But...

447
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,255
It was so much fun!

448
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:25,997
See?

449
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:28,506
I told you. You can do it.

450
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,778
I guess this is why people say...

451
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:33,535
"Trust your boyfriend and you'll be doing great!"

452
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:37,695
Ouch!

453
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:44,946
I think he was flirting with you.

454
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:47,021
And if he really was,

455
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:48,946
what are you gonna do about it?

456
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:52,058
Since you found it, why don't you just go ahead and sign up?

457
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:45,472
[Contestant calls for a photography competition]
Why don't you just apply for it?

458
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,424
There's no need to hesitate.

459
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:49,424
I don't intend to apply for it.

460
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:52,544
I just found it by coincidence.

461
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:55,635
But since you found it,

462
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,894
why don't you just go ahead and sign up?

463
00:29:58,478 --> 00:29:59,163
No.

464
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,797
Why bother if I'm not gonna win anyway?

465
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:46,272
Tim.

466
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:47,759
Mai didn't come to class today?

467
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,840
Right.

468
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:51,285
Usually, you two are inseparable.

469
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:54,587
I don't know.

470
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:57,424
He didn't pick up my calls.

471
00:30:57,424 --> 00:30:58,677
Did you two have a fight?

472
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:00,700
What fight?

473
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,521
I was running errands.

474
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:04,148
Don't put us against each other.

475
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:04,928
Hey!

476
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:05,625
I was kidding.

477
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:07,032
I was just worried about you, my friend.

478
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,465
Whenever I saw Tim alone without you,

479
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,187
it feels so strange.

480
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:11,915
Right.

481
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,138
You guys are exaggerating.

482
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,495
He and I are not that inseparable.

483
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:21,023
Don't you need to go to the student club next?

484
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,234
Okay, see you then.

485
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,032
Did he just chase us away?

486
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:28,340
What are you waiting for?

487
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:29,144
Mai...

488
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,503
About the other day...

489
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:34,605
I...

490
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:36,023
You don't need to think too much about it.

491
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:37,870
I understand.

492
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,016
I won't leave you.

493
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,304
No matter what happens,

494
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:44,812
we'll always be friends.

495
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:49,023
That day, I didn't intend to let it happen that way.

496
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,177
I told you I'm okay.

497
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:55,730
There's no need to talk about it.

498
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,373
In fact, you can just forget it.

499
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:02,056
Because I already did.

500
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:07,636
Come on. Let's go.

501
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,517
Did you get all the scripts memorized?

502
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:11,327
Do you want me to repeat it for you?

503
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:18,750
It's okay.

504
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:20,550
I can remember them.

505
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:24,967
Then, let's go.

506
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:41,951
Hi there.

507
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:43,055
Tim.

508
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:44,551
Mai.

509
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:46,854
Hello, Kim.

510
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:49,583
How are you?

511
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:51,443
I should be the one who asks you that.

512
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:55,049
Are you fully recovered?

513
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:56,464
Of course, I am.

514
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,919
Or else I wouldn't be here.

515
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,422
I am truly sorry.

516
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:05,585
I'm not angry with you, Kimhan.

517
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,536
A misunderstanding like this can happen.

518
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:12,234
What kind of cook doesn't check his ingredients?

519
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,763
I am the one to blame indeed.

520
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,845
I am sorry for not being careful enough.

521
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:20,537
How long are you gonna keep saying sorry?

522
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,521
Is it his cue soon?

523
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,106
You can come in and stand by now.

524
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:48,228
You got a new perfume?

525
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:51,466
Mm.

526
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:55,375
Smells good.

527
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:58,269
Tim, please look at the camera this way.

528
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:03,895
5, 4, 3, record.

529
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:06,025
Hello, it's Tim here.

530
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:08,707
Usually, when I have a free time at home

531
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:10,025
I would exercise.

532
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:10,798
And...

533
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,964
It's something I've been doing since I was a kid...

534
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:26,225
I can also give advice on men's styling and grooming.

535
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,116
Yeah.

536
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:32,236
My favorite colors are green and black.

537
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,025
My favorite hobby is exercising.

538
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:37,545
And when it's a rest day,

539
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:39,705
I would...

540
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:41,252
read comic books.

541
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:43,025
Anyway, thank you everyone

542
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,285
for following Absolute Tim channel.

543
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:49,366
I'm so glad that you guys support me and...

544
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:52,659
like the contents I created this much.

545
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,545
We're done. Thank you so much, Tim!

546
00:34:56,357 --> 00:34:57,135
Thank you.

547
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:03,265
I'm done here.

548
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:04,505
Let's go home.

549
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,329
So...

550
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,586
Can I have your LINE ID?

551
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,025
Pete, can you please come over on set?

552
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:11,668
I have to go now.

553
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:19,034
Who's that?

554
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,150
It's Pete.

555
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:23,294
He said he's an Engineering student.

556
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,475
We've just befriended.

557
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:27,469
It's boring waiting

558
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,890
so he looked for someone to talk to, I guess.

559
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,545
I think he was flirting with you.

560
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,781
And if he really was,

561
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,586
what are you gonna do about it?

562
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,571
Tim. Mai.

563
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:47,424
Would you like to join me for lunch?

564
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,586
I have something to talk to you.

565
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,139
We'll have a shoot with you tomorrow at your condo.

566
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,197
Okay, see you tomorrow.

567
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,887
Why didn't I know about this?

568
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:43,133
I thought you said we were going to have lunch.

569
00:36:43,998 --> 00:36:45,417
What are these two doing here?

570
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,057
Be nice.

571
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:52,703
I brought Tim today so you can apologize to him
about that shrimp paste cake incident.

572
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:58,999
I'm sorry for pulling a sick prank on you.

573
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,999
Please forgive me.

574
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,685
Tim was hospitalized because of you.

575
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,817
But you don't seem to have come to your senses.

576
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,082
I had no idea.

577
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:08,276
I never meant to get him hospitalized.

578
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,730
At least you apologized.
And I'm okay with that.

579
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,274
I'm actually more sorry for Kimhan.

580
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:16,583
He baked that cake with heart.

581
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,183
You should have known better than to do that.

582
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:22,691
I'm really sorry, man.

583
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:25,546
If I'd known that you are allergic to the paste,
I wouldn't have put it in the cake.

584
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:27,818
Anyway...

585
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,316
Thanks for sorting this matter out with the chancellor.

586
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:35,500
If it wasn't for you,
my friends and I would've already got suspended.

587
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,435
What did you say to your aunt?

588
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,627
I asked her to halt the BL content thing.

589
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:42,657
And you no longer wanted to do that?

590
00:37:42,744 --> 00:37:43,583
Yes.

591
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,011
I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable.

592
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,720
Well, since we're all here...

593
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,908
I asked you two to come here,

594
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,966
so this meal is on me.

595
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:03,015
Cool.

596
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,881
It's not everyday someone treats me a meal.

597
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:07,563
Any dish you recommend?

598
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,990
Bro!

599
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,838
Huh?

600
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:11,029
Can we please have a menu?

601
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:12,600
Coming up.

602
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:17,010
What did you mean by "bro"?

603
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:19,666
It's "sis" now.

604
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,102
What would you guys like?

605
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,119
There are so many things in here that you don't eat.

606
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,119
Perhaps we should go to another restaurant.

607
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:31,052
I don't think this place is for those with a delicate palate.

608
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:34,737
I can eat these.

609
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:37,235
Feel free to order whatever you want.

610
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:41,356
I can eat everything.

611
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:45,800
Bro.

612
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,459
Mm?

613
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:49,799
I'd like some extremely spicy papaya salad
with salted crab and fermented fish.

614
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,441
Give me 20 chillies.

615
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,782
But make sure you don't put any shrimp paste in it,

616
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:58,217
or someone might end up at hospital again.

617
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:00,934
Sure. 20 chillies!

618
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,523
With no shrimp paste.

619
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:10,619
Here you go.

620
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:11,797
Enjoy.

621
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,536
I think you two already had enough.

622
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,180
I can do another round with a big bowl of spicy soup.

623
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:44,689
I think it's time to go.

624
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:45,694
I agree, Kim.

625
00:39:46,797 --> 00:39:48,040
Go ahead and ask for the bill.

626
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:54,431
Well...

627
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,475
You two, go home safe.

628
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:57,392
You too.

629
00:39:57,608 --> 00:40:01,122
Tomorrow we'll be filming some footages
of your lifestyle at your condo.

630
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,311
Of course.

631
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:04,751
I'll see you tomorrow.

632
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:06,460
Why didn't I know about this?

633
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:08,651
It's a student club's work.

634
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,897
I don't want to bother you.

635
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:11,588
Come on.

636
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:12,587
Let's head home.

637
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,861
You know you can't handle spicy food.

638
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:31,884
Why did you play along with him?

639
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,531
You're being so immature.

640
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,700
If it has any effect on you,
make sure you take care of yourself.

641
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:39,736
I know.

642
00:40:44,614 --> 00:40:45,440
Who's that?

643
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,148
Pete.

644
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:48,580
If he really hits on you,

645
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,929
you need to let me know first.

646
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:51,723
Got it?

647
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,206
Mai.

648
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,771
It's none of your business.

649
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:58,078
I can make decisions for myself.

650
00:40:58,662 --> 00:40:59,724
Got it?

651
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:03,152
Do you need a ride?

652
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,482
No, thanks.

653
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,310
My cab is here.

654
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,096
See ya.

655
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:37,745
Mek, what are you doing?

656
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:39,627
This stuff is expensive.

657
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:40,957
Go back to your seat.

658
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,404
Don't look.

659
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:25,066
Mek!

660
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:26,138
What are you doing?

661
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:27,759
Mek, let go of me!

662
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:29,617
Wait until he puts his shirt on.

663
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:31,490
Stop being naked
so we can start shooting.

664
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:33,807
Let go of me!

665
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:34,920
Not yet.

666
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,096
Why?

667
00:42:36,529 --> 00:42:38,199
Let me go!

668
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:43,291
For starters,

669
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,208
we're going to film you jogging

670
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,404
as part of your morning routine.

671
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:49,308
You can just run and be your natural self.

672
00:42:49,308 --> 00:42:51,676
Mek will follow you with a camera on his hands.

673
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:52,455
Sure thing.

674
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:54,284
I'll make sure you look good.

675
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,736
Shall we get started?

676
00:43:06,082 --> 00:43:06,701
Okay.

677
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:07,818
Come on.

678
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,518
And action!

679
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:16,874
You're doing great, Tim.

680
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,235
Can you keep up, man?

681
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,754
I thought you said you are a runner.

682
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:27,196
Hey!

683
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:29,478
Seriously, is this all you got?

684
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,694
I'm running backwards
but still going faster than you.

685
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:34,139
If you fall,
don't blame it on me then.

686
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:39,370
Seriously?

687
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:46,242
What is going on?

688
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:14,045
What do you think you were doing?

689
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:16,013
None of these footages can be used.

690
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:16,823
Mek...

691
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,931
I'm here to work, not to mess around.

692
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:19,720
Tim...

693
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:21,871
I think we'll probably need a reshoot.

694
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:24,903
But first, let me see if there's anything I can do with these footages.

695
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:26,687
Sure, Kim.

696
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:28,747
Just let me know if you need me.

697
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:30,855
For you, I'm always available.

698
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:33,404
I gotta go now.

699
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,265
Do you need a ride?

700
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,503
Don't, Tim.

701
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,842
I can take care of that.

702
00:44:39,037 --> 00:44:41,578
You should at least catch your breath first
before talking big.

703
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:42,795
What a prick!

704
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:44,449
Don't worry, both of you.

705
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,927
I can get home on my own.

706
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:46,658
What?

707
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,618
Let me give you a ride, Kim.

708
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,619
You two should stay here
and enjoy each other's company.

709
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,215
This is all because of you.

710
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:57,934
You're the reason why he's mad at me.

711
00:44:57,934 --> 00:44:59,447
It's all because you suck at filming.

712
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,806
You screwed up his work.

713
00:45:00,806 --> 00:45:02,124
That's why he got upset

714
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:04,059
and didn't let me give him a ride.

715
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:05,768
Why would you want to do that?

716
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:07,176
Kim is mine.

717
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:08,404
I liked him first.

718
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:09,577
He's already got me.

719
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,620
I don't think you're too dumb to see that.

720
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,018
Are you two in a relationship or what?

721
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:14,007
Not yet.

722
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:15,531
But it's none of your business.

723
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:17,509
You act like you own him.

724
00:45:18,223 --> 00:45:19,935
Maybe don't get too ahead of yourself

725
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,022
if you and him are not official yet.

726
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,742
And why does that concern you?

727
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:25,819
What are you trying to do
by doing all these competitions with me?

728
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,473
Are you really into Kim
or just trying to take him as a win against me?

729
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:33,534
You can't say you're into him, though,

730
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:35,403
or I'll punch you in the face!

731
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:42,509
I'm tired.

732
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:43,648
Excuse me.

733
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:47,962
What's the deal with this guy?

734
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:52,880
Why are you here?

735
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:01,498
Of course I'm here to show you the draft.

736
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:04,900
I filmed for you
and even edited it for you.

737
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,479
The mood in it is so good.

738
00:46:12,582 --> 00:46:15,437
I'm sorry for making you upset today.

739
00:46:15,437 --> 00:46:17,588
I'm not going to act like a child again.

740
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:21,393
But if you ever want me to...

741
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:25,071
I promise I'll be a good boy for you.

742
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,023
You're finally smiling.

743
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:31,734
Well then...

744
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:36,031
What do you say if I take this upstairs
so you can review it there?

745
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:37,620
You're doing this again.

746
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:40,182
Don't give me that look.

747
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:44,748
You, too. You stared so longingly at Tim today, remember?

748
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:51,525
Now, what do you think I should do with this little bad boy?

749
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:55,839
What do you think?

750
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,272
What do you think?

751
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:00,090
What do you think, huh?

752
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,921
Mek!

753
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,813
This bad boy must get a kiss.

754
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:05,625
Mek!

755
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,788
Where are you going?

756
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:07,815
Not yet!

757
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:12,537
Mek!

758
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:13,716
Enough!

759
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:14,539
Mek!

760
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,793
Hey, hey, hey.
Enough!

761
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:21,586
[Pam: Hey, you. I've arrived in Thailand. Wanna meet up?]

762
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:23,294
I love you.

763
00:47:23,294 --> 00:47:24,216
Who did you say that to?

764
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,169
My boyfriend.

765
00:47:25,818 --> 00:47:26,624
Are you free today?

766
00:47:26,624 --> 00:47:28,559
I'd like to ask you to join me.

767
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,302
To do what?

768
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,255
Something that will bring us closer.

769
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:33,524
I don't think you're good at anything besides planting trees.

770
00:47:33,524 --> 00:47:36,297
Speaking of which, it'd be great if I could get a plant to put on my work desk.

771
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:38,167
Just take the bottle garden from my room.

772
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,415
Oh, Kim!

773
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,826
I gotta go.

774
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,003
Why do you always make me worried?

775
00:47:46,003 --> 00:47:48,404
You know, you're so good at playing with my heart.
