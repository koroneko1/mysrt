how am I supposed to know

466
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,055
how to fit in,
or who I'm supposed to fit in with,

467
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,391
when I have no idea who I am?

468
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,811
‐ I get that.

469
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,274
[Mia chuckles softly]

470
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,860
FELIX:
Guys?

471
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,278
Could I get a blanket?

472
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,914
Thank you.

473
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,041
‐ You, you wore yellow.

474
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,546
‐ Yeah. I did.

475
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,220
[stumbles]
[Felix laughing]

476
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,722
‐ Shh! Shh! Shh!

477
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,726
‐ Hey. You're late.
‐ Dad.

478
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,019
‐ You guys been drinking?
FELIX: What?

479
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,773
Drinking? I've never been sober‐er‐er.

480
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:18,815
‐ No, no. Too many "ers."

481
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,817
Go home, have a glass of water,
and sleep it off.

482
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,904
Good night. You come inside,
before your mom hears.

483
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,039
‐ Don't be mad at me. I'm, I'm not drunk,

484
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,001
and I know it's past my curfew,
but the bus took forever, and‐‐

485
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,546
‐ It's okay, Vic.
I know you were being responsible.

486
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,256
[whispers]:
How'd it go with Mia?

487
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:43,632
That girl, Mia. How'd it go?

488
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,759
‐ Good, I think.
‐ All right.

489
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,261
That's great. That's fantastic.

490
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,679
That's great.

491
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,431
‐ Uh, hey, Pap.

492
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,312
How did you know that Mom
was the one for you?

493
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:00,399
‐ Oh. Um...

494
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,651
Well, um...

495
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:06,905
we both had, uh, these after school jobs
at this crappy diner.

496
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,116
Oh, she was a terrible waitress, your mom.

497
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,910
Like, if you'd ask her for a Coke,
she'd bring you an iced tea.

498
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,329
If you asked for an iced tea,
she brought you a hot tea.

499
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,833
But nobody cared, though, you see,
because she was that charming.

500
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,751
She was that beautiful.

501
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,379
So, I asked her out.

502
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,591
I mean, at that point, I was mostly
thinking about how I was gonna,

503
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,176
you know‐‐
‐ Dad, come on.

504
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,553
‐ So, we went out for pizza,

505
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,513
and she started talking about
her grandfather,

506
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,473
and how he had just died a few months ago,

507
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,975
and about how close they were.

508
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,853
And while she's telling me this,
she starts to cry.

509
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:41,315
And the next thing I know,
I start to cry, too.

510
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,569
I mean, here I am,
one minute I'm just trying to hook up,

511
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,614
and the next minute, I'm crying about
some dead old man I never even met.

512
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:53,160
I never felt so connected to anyone.

513
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:54,870
Ever.

514
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,332
And that's when I knew.

515
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,793
Or whatever.
[both chuckle]

516
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,422
‐ Thanks.

517

518
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,348
VICTOR: Hey, Simon.
Thanks for the words of wisdom.

519
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,976
All day, everyone liked me because
they thought I liked Mia.

520
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,562
Here's the twist:

521
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,441
Now that I've spent some time with her,
I do like her.

522
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,701
She's funny, and kind, and she gets me.

523
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,413
Did you ever feel super connected
to a girl and think,

524
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,124
I don't know, maybe this could work?

‐ Look, I know today's barista lesson
didn't go perfectly,

530
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,182
