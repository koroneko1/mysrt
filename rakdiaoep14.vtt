00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Is he my soulmate?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What's up? Hey!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Nothing.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Wait.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I was dreaming about this?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
What's going on with me?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm sorry.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
That's alright.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
How could I dream about him?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's late. Don't you go to bed?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You couldn't sleep because you're thinking of me?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
You're speechless? So you really are.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Nope. What about you? Why didn't you sleep?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I couldn't sleep so I'm looking for someone to put me to sleep.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You want me to play with you and you don't even play back?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
What's on your mind?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Nothing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Or you have a nightmare?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That's alright.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
What's wrong with you? I'm not a cockroach, you don't have to act so disgusted.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I just washed my hair and you touched it. I don't know what you touched before.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I'm off to bed now.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Wait.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Don't you wanna say Goodnight, baby?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I've gote some tea to spill.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Go on.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I don't know where to start.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Just start it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I really don't know how.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Then don't.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Please. Can I just pretend to be shy about it first?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So annoying. What it is?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I mean I've been dreaming about Pom from sales for a few days now.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.000
I had a dream that I kissed him.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I think that I keep dreaming about him because I have a crush on him.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
You sure? I think you keep teasing him so he shows up in your dream.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.000
Nope. I think I've been dreaming about him because I really like him.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.000
If you're so sure about this, then why do you ask us?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I just want to make sure if you ever feel the same.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.000
When you have a crush on someone, do you dream about them?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I do. I had a dream about my boyfriend when I started to flirt with him.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.000
I had a dream that he kissed me.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
What about you? Have you? Got kissed?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Me?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
What did you expect from him? He hasn't had a crush on anyone.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.000
Exactly. Dao tried to set him up on many dates and you didn't even like one of them. You said they didn't like your mom.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Why don't you try to have a crush on someone?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000
I'm sure you're gonna dream about them.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.000
I ask everyone about this type of dream, and they all have the similar experience.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.000
That's right.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Aside from dreaming, do you have any other way to check if I really like someone?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.000
What?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
What're you looking at?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Are you having a crush on someone? Why do you want to know?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
When Dao finds a girl for me, I could use this method to see if I really like them.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It's not that hard. When you're getting close to them. Your heart will beat like this.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.000
This beat means you really like them.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What type of heartbeat in that kind of rhythm?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Let me tell you, when I got cozy with my boyfriend for the first time,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
just a little touch on the hands and my heart was about to leave my chest.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You slut! A man touched you for the first time and your heart beat fast?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Don't you?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.000
I do. I have the same feeling with every man but I've never tried it with Pom.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I think I need to find the way.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.000
Just go to the hospital and have ultrasound to check.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm not pregnant.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Then we need to find ways to get closer to them, so we'd know if our heart beats that way.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Welcome.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Hold on a second.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
How could I get closer to him?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
He's normally sitting there and I'm standing here. It seems too far away.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
What's going on?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
We can stand up and talk. There's no need to act like a boss all the time.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Sure. What's up, pal?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You said you don't want me to act like your boss so I act like your friend.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Or you don't want me to act like your friend?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But you'd rather want me to act like your boyfriend?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Fine. I'm not messing with you.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I know that this pal doesn't like to be messed around at work.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What's up?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
How could I start? Should I pretend to be fainted and have him held me?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
That's crazy. I can't do that or he would know for sure.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Hey, you keep staring at me. You won't say a single word?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Don't tell me that you're talking to a ghost in my room again.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I'm gonna talk to you about 5.5 promotion, are you cool with it?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I think we've done with the promotion for a long time.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I've put this online already. How can I not be okay with this? Right?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Right. I forgot about that. I mean 6.6 promotion.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.000
Did I tell you that I'm gonna do 6.6 promotion?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Or a ghost in my room whispered in your ears again?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Focus. I need to be more subtle or we could see through me.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Your body's temperature is normal. There's no fever.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So what do you want to talk to me about?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Suttirak? Narong wants to see you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Okay.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I'll be right back.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Why did I feel numb when he touched me?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Did my heart beat fast earlier?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I didn't pay attention.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Damn it, I need to find another chance to get closer to him?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
How could I find another way?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Should I trick him to write his wish and hang it by the tree?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So I could touch his hands?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Nope. Too obvious.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Uncle Jod, come take a look at Diao.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
What's going on?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
He has been walking around like this for a while.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Or should I asked him to sit down, then I can sit beside him?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Nope. Too obvious.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Is he on drugs?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Well, he's not you.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.000
What's wrong with me?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Why don't you go ask him about it?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You're worried about him or you just want to know what's going on?

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.000
Well, I'd bad on the latter part, maybe I'm worried about him.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Hurry up / Come on.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Little Diao, is something on your mind? You can ask me about it.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Don't bother the holy spirit. He has a lot on his mind already.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Nothing. There's nothing going on.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Nothing? I saw you mumbling and walking around by yourself.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
If I hadn't known you better, I'd have asked the police to take you.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.000
Well, I'm not on drugs.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You're stressed out from work.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Nope.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.000
You're fighting with Rak?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Nope.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.000
It's not about work, not in a fight with Rak? Or is it about love?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You're speechless like this so you have a fight with your girlfriend?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
You're in a relationship?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Or you're not but you have a crush on someone?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Hey!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.600
Hello.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.000
Hello / Hello.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
You said you have something to say to me. Why did you run off?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
What's going on? We can talk here.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Can I have a cup of Americano and brownie?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Same ? / That's right.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Do you want anything?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I won't order anything.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So I could have some of his brownie and ask him to feed me.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.000
I can see if my heart beats normal.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Nope. I don't want anything .

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Let's have a seat.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
He has someone to talk to. We're useless here. Let's get back to work.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
What do you want to talk to me about?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Let's talk about work at the office.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
You said that you can separate work and personal stuff.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
We're off work now. So we shouldn't talk about work, right?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Sure. Do you want to watch a movie together?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
You don't want to talk about work.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I'm coming.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Americano / Thank you.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And brownie.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Thank you.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
What should I do to make him feed me?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
You keep watching my brownie like this?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Are you pranking me with salt again?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Nope. I was just wondering that

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
you only order brownie when you're here.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
My name means love. If I love something, I'm not gonna change my mind.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Do you want some?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Here. I can feed you.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Would my heart beats fast?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Thank you.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
What're you looking at? Lovers are feeding each other.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
If you want some, why don't you ask Rak to feed you?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
What did he do wrong?

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.000
Why do you make him feed you?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Nothing. I just want him to taste this.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Here.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
So you're a little puppy and you have no hands?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I mean if I had no hands

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
and you fed me like this, I'd love to be a puppy too.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I couldn't do it here if Dao's around.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
You're looking at me like this but you say nothing.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Are you cursing my dad? Don't forget that we have the same dad.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
You're really cursing my dad if you look at me like this.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
This is so good.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Please. Help yourself.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Why do you have to be in the middle of this?

00:23:27.001 --> 00:23:30.000
I almost find out if my heart beats fast for this.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
How could I find another way to get closer to him?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Rak is not here?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
He is. I saw him at Uncle Jod's café.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Where're you going?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.000
I'm worried that I could fail my English test so I'm gonna study at my friend's.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
You're gonna study or play games?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.000
Playing games? You shouldn't ask.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I was just kidding.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.000
I'm gonna study for real. I don't want to fail this test. I don't want to disappoint my brother.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
We can find out if you really study or play games after the test result comes back.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I really am going to study.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.100
But if I took the test and failed,
I finished all of your food.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.000
it would be on the tutor, not me. Okay?

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.000
So you need to buy some more foods. I'm leaving, bye.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Rit!

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Can I use your kitchen?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
He asked to use my kitchen like this? So I have a chance to get closer to him.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.500
Why're you smiling?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Nope. Suit yourself.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
You've been acting strange since you were in the office.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Are you planning another prank on me?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
I should make some jokes to see if he talks back.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Then he'd get closer to me.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
What're you cooking?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I'm cooking bones for you.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I forgot. Dogs can’t have bones or they would get sick.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Well, he's gonna come scratching my chin.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Why didn't he do it?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
What should I do next?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Are you turning on the hood? Do you remember how?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Come on, let me teach you.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
When he pushes the button, I'm gonna say that it is wrong.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Then I'm gonna touch his hand and push it again.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Then I could check if my heart beats fast when our hands touch.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Come here.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
The hood is broken. I couldn't open it.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
So I open your windows instead.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It's broken?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Why now? Why?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Can you help me prepare the food?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Sure thing. What do you want me to cut?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
You're so nice. Are you planning another prank on me?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
You don't like it when I'm nice? You want me to be moody? I can do that.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I like it that you're nice to me.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Can you help me cut this?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
You need to cut like this.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Don't worry.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I'm not gonna let Diao stop dating for sure.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
You're gonna see your grandchildren.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I need to go. I need to talk to your future son-in-law.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.000
Okay.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Are you cooking?

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.000
That's right.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.000
Why don't you tell me?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
It should be a wife's job, not a husband.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Well, my father is here.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
What're you cooking?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Chicken Tom Yum.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I don't know which one is spicier, me or your food?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
You need to try.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
It's hard to tell if you're a human or a spirit.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.000
You don't respond to any of my flirty message.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
What now? You're speechless.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
My heart beats fast because I like him or I'm nervous?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
What's wrong with him?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.000
Ouch / Hey!

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I'm sorry.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Your hand is so red. Let's go to the doctor.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Get the key.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Key? Key?

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.000
Let's go.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I'm so sorry.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
How're you feeling?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
My right hand is hurt but my left hand can still work.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Good. You can use your good hand to hold me.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000
If you're gonna make joke like this, you should apologize to him instead.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Fine.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I'm so sorry.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
That's alright.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I finished your chicken spicy soup already.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
You should have dinner with him.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
So you could heal his hand.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.000
Where're you going?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I'm gonna go see the village office.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
They want me to cater for praying section.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
I'm gonna talk about the foods.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Please take care of my husband.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
If it's not about money, I wouldn't have left you like this.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Get better soon.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
This is the chance to see about the reason of my heart beats.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
You're smiling like this to me again.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.944
What's it? Is it about me?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Are you happy that I'm hurt?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Nope. I'm not that cruel?

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Why don't you wait for me inside? I'm gonna bring food.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.500
Medicine.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
If my heart still beats fast, then I think I have a crush on him.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Why did you arrange the table? Your hand is hurting and you're gonna drop something.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
My right hand is hurt by my left hand can still work.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
If you want to take care of me, why don't you hurt my other hand?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
So you could have an excuse to take care of me.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Who wants to take care of you?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I'm doing all of this for Dao.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Don't you feel bad for me?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
You should eat something so you won't talk.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Why did I say that to him? In case he makes fun of me or scratches my chin,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I'd know if my heart beats fast.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
I should find an excuse to have him scratched my chin.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Can you pick up a spoon? Or do you want me to feed you?

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Can you feed me?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Your left hand is working, you should do it by yourself.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I saw you smiled since the hospital.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Dao's cooking is less spicy than yours.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
You still remember my food?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Who wouldn't? You were so mad at my for throwing away your soup.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It's hard to forget.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Let me do it.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
I'm gonna have meat and you can have bones.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I'm not you. I don't like to eat bones.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
He's not gonna scratch my chin. Fine, I'll pretend to be annoying.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Why did you eat like this?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I'm sorry. Ouch!

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.500
Ouch!

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I'm sorry, I don't mean to. I was just gonna pretend to walk away.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Look at my thumb.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I'm sorry.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Do you mean to hurt me so you could take care of me?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Are you crazy? I'm not.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Here.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I was feeding you already. Why do you still want me to take off your clothes?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
You hurt my hand.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I hurt your left hand's thumb.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Dao hurt the right one.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
That's right. But if my thumb hadn't hurt, I would have been able to unbutton my shirt.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Now it can't be working properly, how could I unbutton my shirt.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
You want me to do this?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
It's like crab, searching for something to eat.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
You need to help me unbutton my shirt. I need to take a shower.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
This is the chance to see about the reason of my heart beats.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Fine.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
I think I really like him.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
You should take a shower now.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Thank you.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Not a problem. Call if you need anything.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Do I really like him?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
This is obvious.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.000
What obvious?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I met Pom at Move On and I got closer to his chest.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.000
My heart beats so fast. I think I like him. I like him.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
You came here just to tell him this?

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.000
That's right. I'm gonna have a boyfriend and my friends need to know.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
I'm gonna have a boyfriend.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
I know that you like Pom

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.000
but does Pom like you back?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
He may think of you as a friend.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
That's true. I should go back to Move On

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.000
and see if Pom likes me too. Let's go.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Wait. If you're here just to say this, why didn't you call Diao?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
It wasted my call fee.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.000
Well, this wasted my gas fee.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Your gas, not mine. Let's go.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
You evil.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
You came here just to make my house dirtier.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Wait / What?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Did you take a good care of Rak?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:43.600
I did.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Mom called earlier.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
She told me to let her know when you're free.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Pang, mom's friend's daughter, will visit Bangkok.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.000
She wanted Pang to visit when you're free.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
She wanted you to meet her to see if you two could get along.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.600
Okay?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
What does he feel about me?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Why would I want to know about this? Mom wouldn't allow.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It can't be possible.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Rak.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Toon.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.000
I haven't seen you for ages. Can I have a hug?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Who's this bitch?

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.000
Toon is Rak's ex.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:54.000
His ex is here. Do you think they want to repeat the history?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Get out.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I'm sorry to wake you up.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I'm not asleep.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.000
What're you doing?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
We're about to do it but someone made a noise.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
You shouldn't say that in front of him.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:13.000
It seems like you care about him a lot. Do you like him?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
If Toon asks me to go back to her, what would you say?
