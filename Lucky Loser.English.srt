1
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,916
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,416
WHO DREAM TO PLAY IN THE WORLD CUP.

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,583
THIS FILM IS FICTIONAL

4
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,541
AND NOT BASED
ON ANY EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS,

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,583
INDIVIDUALS, AGENCIES, OR REAL EVENTS.

6
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,625
This is the moment Thai soccer fans
have been waiting for.

7
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,166
Thailand's first World Cup.

8
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,666
The players are making their way
onto the pitch.

9
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,250
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,000
this is the man responsible
for the reason why we are all here today.

11
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,041
Pongnarin Ulice,

12
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,125
the greatest coach in Thai history.

13
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:33,958
What are you doing?

14
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,166
PONGNARIN TO TAKE THAILAND
TO THE WORLD CUP

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,416
My nephew is coming.

16
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,416
This time,

17
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,333
Thailand is going to make it
to the World Cup.

18
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,625
-What should I bet on this time?
-You can't go any further.

19
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,208
-Checkmate!
-Black tea, please.

20
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,416
-Great.
-I only have Nescafe.

21
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,000
-Did you lose again?
-No.

22
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,916
-Good.
-Last night, I won big.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good.

24
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,166
I'll win big on tonight's match for sure.

25
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,416
You're going to be rich, right?

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,250
Then pay your gambling debts.

27
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,250
Yeah, I haven't forgotten.

28
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,416
Right.

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,333
If Chelsea win on Saturday,
you can have it all.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,875
Not again.

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,541
You can't keep doing that.

32
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,791
Have I ever stiffed you?

33
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,416
Saturday, I'll pay up.

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,416
You can't. Not this time.

35
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,583
Or...

36
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,541
Is our football whiz stone broke?

37
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,833
You shit!

38
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,750
Don't look down on me.

39
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,250
I have a lot of money in the bank.

40
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,166
Money in the bank, are you sure?

41
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,416
Mui.

42
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,541
I'll buy the whole lot of lottery tickets.

43
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,458
All of it?

44
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,458
That will be 27,300 baht.

45
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,916
I'll give you
the extra 25,000 baht next time.

46
00:02:58,833 --> 00:02:59,708
-Ming!
-Ming.

47
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,958
-What about your gambling debt?
-Dad.

48
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,958
-She gave me--
-And you haven't paid for your coffee.

49
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:08,958
The officials will select
the winning two-digit lottery prize.

50
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,791
We are going to announce
the winning number.

51
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,708
The winning last two-digit prize 

52
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,333
is...

53
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,791
two

54
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,000
and seven.

55
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,791
-I repeat.
-Christ!

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,416
Two and seven.

57
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,958
Now, Mr. Jira,

58
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,000
-Chatuchak District Attorney...
-Hello?

59
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,666
...will draw the number for us.

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,458
The winning lottery prize...

61
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,541
-Tonight? Fine.
-...from Government Lottery Office

62
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,208
is ready to be announced.

63
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,666
-I want Real Madrid and odds on Juventus
-The winning

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,875
-and Liverpool.
-number

65
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,625
-is...
-Lottery?

66
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,583
-I bought some but lost on all of it.
-five, eight,

67
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,916
-seven, zero,
-What a crap.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,625
two and eight.

69
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,666
I repeat.

70
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,041
The winning number

71
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,250
is...

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,958
the sixth set.

73
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,916
Number five,

74
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,833
eight, seven,

75
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,166
zero, two and eight.

76
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,708
-Wait.
-The Government Lottery Office...

77
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:06,666
I won.

78
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,916
...would like congratulate

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
-the winners.
-I... I won!

80
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,291
-Please appropriately buy the lottery...
-Hey!

81
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,750
-for you own happiness.
-Anyone's here? Hey! I won.

82
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,291
I won the lottery.

83
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,625
I won the lottery!

84
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,250
PAPAYA SALAD VENDOR

184 MILLION LUCKY LADY LOTTERY WINNER

86
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,208
LOTTERY WINNER: PONGNARIN'S AUNT

87
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,333
What are you going to do with the money?

88
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,708
I'm going to donate it
to the Thai national football squad.

89
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,500
The Thai national football squad.

90
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,000
DONATES 184 MILLION TO THAI'S WC BID

91
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,625
But...

92
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,916
Coach Pongnarin,

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,291
my nephew,

94
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,791
must be the team's coach.

95
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,166
PONGNARIN

96
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,583

PONGNARIN WANTS TO COACH THAI TEAM

99
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,250
LET'S VOTE
DO YOU WANT PONGNARIN TO COACH OR NOT?

100
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,708
OF COURSE, DON'T BOTHER,
STAY IN ENGLAND

101
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:26,333
How likely is it that Pongnarin will take
the reins of the national squad?

102
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,041
From our initial discussions,

103
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,000
Mr. Pongnarin has proposed
an appealing strategy.

104
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,708
But I have to admit
that the budget is quite enormous.

105

READY TO TAKE THAI TEAM
TO THE WORLD CUP QUALIFYING ROUND

115
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,666
Hey, Teep.

116
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,125
What is all this?

117
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,166
Don't you know?

118
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,333
You're our national hope.

119
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,625
PONGNARIN IS HERE

120
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,083
READY TO TAKE THAILAND TO THE WORLD CUP

121
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,791
Beckham, steal the ball,
and win five baht.

122
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,833
You're on.

123
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,583
Quit playing around.

124
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,625
We'll be in trouble if we're late.

125
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,333
Tuk, how many fish do you need today?

126
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,083
They're good for some larb.

127
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,541
Sanglek has a way with kids.

128
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,541
With skills like that,

129
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,291
I would want him to be the father
of my child.

130
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,583
How many fish would you like?

131
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,833
Sorry.

132
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,208
I forgot that we're going to be
vegetarians tonight.

00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,833
Pong.

138
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,458
Hey, stop reminiscing over there.

139
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,625
Pong.

140
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,041
Please sign your autograph.

141
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,041
Come here.

142
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,208
That's too many. My hand will cramp.

143
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,250
Please.

144
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
I need them for my customers.

145
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,083
Please help me make a living, okay?

146
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,500
Sure.

147
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,833
Sign right here.

148
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,833
Right.

149
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,666
Here's your coffee, coach.

150
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,750
-Let me see.
-Thank you.

151
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,166
You're welcome.

152
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,958
Is that your new cook?

153
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,958
That's Ting from Arvee.

154
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,500
Sanglek's mother.

155
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,916
He plays in the Thai League.

156
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,833
I told you about him.

157
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,583
But now he's made
the Arvee national squad.

158
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,416
Madam Ming!

159
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
Big news!

160
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,416
Arvee entered the qualifying round.

161
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,458
-Hello, coach.
-Hi.

162
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
You're up early today, Pong.

163
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,583
How did that happen?

164
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
Weren't they eliminated already?

165
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,625
This is how it went.

166
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,416
One of the teams withdrew,

167
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,125
which opened a qualifying spot,

168
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,666
and Arvee was chosen as the replacement.

169
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,125
How come? Let me see.

170
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,041
-Where? I can't see your breaking news.
-Right here.

171
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,208
"Lucky losers, Arvee,

172
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,458
enter the qualifying round
for the first time in history."

173
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,791
I see.

174
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,833
What does "lucky loser" mean?

175
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,750
How about that?

176
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,125
Are we ready to win?

177
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,000
Which team are we going to play?

178
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,083
For our group, we have India,

179
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,750
Uzbekistan,

180
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,500
and North Korea.

181
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:02,916
That's why...

182
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,500
we have to be prepared!

183
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,000
I've proposed to take
the whole team to Thailand

184
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,833
to have training in Pattaya.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,708
Pattaya!

186
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,291
What about Pongnarin?

187
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,333
I'm not so sure.

188
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,666
Sir.

189
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,875
There isn't anyone more qualified
than Coach Pong.

190
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,083
Also, the fans want him to be the coach.

191
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,750
That was proven in every poll that we did.

192
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,083
I don't care about the polls.

193
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,083
My main concern is getting Thailand
into the World Cup.

194
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,791
Then...

195
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,875
What about the 184-million baht offer?

196
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,583
-What offer?
-Wait.

197
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,208
Sir.

198
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,083
Haven't you been watching the news?

199
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,625
Above all...

200
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,208
I must thank everyone,

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,750
all Thai football fans,

202
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,541
who have supported me all along.

203
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,583
That's not good.

204
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,416
I should be more concise.

205
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,416
What?

206
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,375
Hi, coach.

207
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,041
My name is Jo.

208
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,750
I'm a regular customer here.

209
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,875
Can I get your autograph?

210
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,916
PONGNARIN ULICE:
FROM FOOTBALL ACE TO DIAMOND COACH

211
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,125
Smile, coach.

212
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,750
One, two, three.

213
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,250
Hey, Jo.

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,791
My body is all sore.

215
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,125
Come here and give me a back rub.

216
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,958
Give me a back rub. Come on.

217
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,291
Madam Ming.

218
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,875
I'm a trainer, not a masseur.

219
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,500
Here's my album.

220
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,375
AEROBIC DANCE

221
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,208
Something to thrill you.

222
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,041
Thank you.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,041
I'm so thrilled to meet you.

224
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't worry.

225
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,916
He's from the same town as us.

226
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,000
Hey.

227
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,583
What time are you leaving for Pattaya?

228
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,083
Early afternoon.

229
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,166
We should get there by evening.

230
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,583
Why?

231
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,125
Nothing.

232
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,208
Madam Ming wants to know.

233
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,041
Do you have a cold?

234
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,083
Have you taken any medicine?

235
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,875
It's okay. You don't have to worry.

236
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,208
Give me an onion.

237
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,916
Hurry up!

238
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,208
Idiot.

239
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:33,833
Wash up, too.

240
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,583
Sanglek, when you're done peeling onions,
bring me the garlic.

241
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,583
Yes, Mom.

242
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,583
Breaking news of the hour.

243
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,166
A passenger bus veered off the road
into a ditch

244
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,750
on Udon Thani Highway.

245
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,041
Twenty passengers were seriously injured.

246
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,958
Sixteen suffered minor injuries.

247
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,458
But there was no loss of life.

248
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,500
The bus was carrying
the Arvee football team

249
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,666
who is on its way
to have a training in Thailand.

250
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,791
Including the players,

251
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,208
staff, and coaches,

252
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,958
there were 35 people on the bus in total.

253
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,916
Arvee became the lucky loser team

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,916
to enter the qualifying round
of the World Cup

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,041
after Nepal and Philippines withdrew
from the competition.

256
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,458
But they may be forced to withdraw
after this accident.

257
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,666
Hurry up, Pong, or we'll be late.

258
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,250
LUCKY LOSER, ARVEE ENTERS
THE QUALIFYING ROUND: MAKES HISTORY

259
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,125
I'd like to go to Udon

260
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,958
to check on my friends.

261
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,708
If they're fine, I'll be back right away.

262
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,375
Go ahead.

263
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:20,958
Don't worry.

264
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,666
But how are you going to get there?

265
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,541
I'll go to the corner
and grab a taxi to the bus station.

266
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,708
Don't be silly. Come with us.

267
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,625
I'll drop you at the bus station.
It's on my way.

268
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,666
I'll take you there. Come on.

269
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,375
Hurry, or I'll be late.

270
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,291
Pong, hurry up. We're late!

271
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,958
The National Federation is determined

272
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,833
to push Thailand

273
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,875
into the final round of the World Cup.

274
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,875
Hurry up. We're late.

275
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:10,041
The directors have
unanimously decided to appoint...

276
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,083
I knew it. It's Coach Pong.

277
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,500
One hundred million, right?

278
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,708
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,291
That's not right.

280
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,291
The person who is going to be
Thailand's national coach

281
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,458
-is Mr. Jose Luis Cardinho.
-Hi.

282
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,708
-What? Cardinho?
-Hello, everyone.

283
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,708
And the federation would like to thank

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,416
Ms. Mingkwan Ulice

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,875
for donating 184 million baht

286
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,708
to support
the Thai national football squad.

287
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,958
The federation guarantees

288
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,041
that the donation
will be spent efficiently.

289
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,375
Why are you still here?

290
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,333
Right, I forgot about you.

291
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,416
I'm so sorry I completely forgot.

292
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,833
What happened?

293
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,791
The coach left.

294
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,541
The press conference is over.

295
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,166
Pong isn't going to be the coach.

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,416
They chose a foreigner instead.

297
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,958
I'm really mad.

298
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,916
We've been betrayed.

299
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,833
I'm not giving them my money anymore.

300
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,166
I'd much rather give the money
to the Arvee team.

301
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,500
Why are you not donating the money
to Thai team?

302
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,916
Why is that?

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,333
What are you going to do with it?

304
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,458
Are you really going to donate the money
to the Arvee team?

305
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,625
What about Thai team?

306
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,041
MING ABOUT FACE
DONATES 184 MILLION TO ARVEE

307
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,166
MING GOING MAD PUSHES PONG TO COACH ARVEE

308
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,041
ARVEE GOT LUCKY BOTH MONEY AND COACH

309
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,833
MR. BUNTERNG
ARVEE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION CHAIRMAN

310
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,958
I'd prefer Pongnarin as a coach.

311
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,708
He has a world-class experience.

312
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,625
But if the Brazilian coach can take us
to the World Cup, then that's great.

313
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,333
Pongnarin is great.

314
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,958
I guess Pongnarin
will have to prove himself more.

315
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,708
The Brazilian is okay.

316
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,625
I don't see why he's going to coach
the Arvee team.

317
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,583
Is he that confident with his skills?

318
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,708
We've heard some opinions

319
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,083
from Thai football fans.

320
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:42,250
Mr. Buranath, can you give us your opinion

321
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,875
on the current turmoil
in the Thai Football Federation?

322
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,333
Personally, I was surprised as well.

323
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:54,291
I'm an avid fan of Coach Pongnarin's.

324
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,750
But that aside,

325
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,541
I respect the federation's decision.

326
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm sure Coach Pong would concede
that Cardinho is an exceptional coach.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,750
Therefore, I think saying
he'd be better off coaching Arvee

328
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,333
is overstepping his boundaries,

329
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,958
even though he has every right.

330
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,958
If he wants to snub the federation
or the nation,

331
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
I think it's highly inappropriate.

332
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,708
See, look at all the trouble
you've caused.

333
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,791
Hey.

334
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,750
I spoke in anger.

335
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,291
But I can't take it back now.

336
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,333
I'm really sorry, Madam Ming.

337
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,833
And to you too, Pong.

338
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm the secretary
and I couldn't even do anything.

339
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,583
See how happy the Arvee people are.

340
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,583
PONGNARIN CHOOSES ARVEE

341
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,916
Perhaps we should really do this.

342
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,416
Is that a good idea?

343
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,458
It's an excellent idea.

344
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,916
On behalf of
the Arvee Football Association,

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,083
I'd like to thank Ms. Mingkwan
and Coach Pongnarin

346
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,208
for volunteering to help our team.

347
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,708
I've prepared a welcome party
in Arvee City for you.

348
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,541
If there isn't any problem,

349
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,458
I can call the federation
and let them know we can still compete.

350
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,666
Wait.

351
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,250
I haven't made any decision yet.

352
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,208
Really?

353
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
I had a feeling

354
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,958
a topflight coach

355
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,250
like Pongnarin

356
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:29,666
wouldn't want to coach
an underdog like Arvee.

357
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,166
It's okay.

358
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,833
I'll make the phone call and...

359
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,625
withdraw the team from the competition.

360
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,208
I'm going to call now.

361
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,583
I'm about to call them now.

362
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,916
Come on, Sanglek, let's head back.

363
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,958
Wait.

364
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,791
Hello, dear Arvee Sport Radio listeners.

365
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,500
Today, Coach Pongnarin,

366
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,583
a top-class Thai coach
has arrived in Arvee City.

367
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,416
Please welcome him
to Principality of Arvee,

368
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,333
our country by the South China Sea

369
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,458
with major exportation

370
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,416
and with non-aligned policy.

371
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,375
This is our squad.

372
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,833
Pisay is the captain and defender.

373
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,166
Kraisorn is assistant coach.

374
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,083
Lumnow and Bundee are midfielders.

375
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,000
And that's Tong Daeng.

376
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,750
Srimaen is the former goalie coach,

377
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,291
now he's a goalie.

378
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:54,166
Including Sanglek, that's makes six.

379
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,666
Now, you've got to fill
the rest of the roster.

380
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,083
Yeah, I like that one.

381
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,541
That number two, he plays fullback.

382
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,583
It's really fun.

383
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,541
It's fun to watch him attack.

384
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,666
Really great!

385
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,666
Right now,

386
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,750
we don't have any strikers.

387
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,750
We need to find at least three or four.

388
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,083
But from what I've seen
from the taped matches,

389
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,208
we need to work on defense
and quick counterattacks.

390
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,833
Right. Here.

391
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,875
That is Tom, son of a vendor.

392
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,500
He's hardworking and skilled.

393
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,166
He's been on television too.

394
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,166
Tom!

395
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,583
What are you doing?

396
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,125
Everything is wrecked.

397
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,833
They are for sale!

398
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,791
Coach.

399
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,500
I have two friends
I used to play football with.

400
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,958
I'd like you to give them a tryout.

401
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,958
How are you, Dueng?

402
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,416
This is Kamdueng.

403
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,875
He likes to say a smart striker
uses his head, not his foot.

404
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,958
I've stopped playing football.

405
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,500
Hurry up, man.

406
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,750
Try coming to the practice.

407
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,166
If it doesn't work, you can quit.

408
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,750
You'll also get a per diem.

409
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,708
Yes. Hey!

410
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,708
You lost. Pay up, man.

411
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,208
Pay up.

412
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,041
Pay up now.

413
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,833
Come on, pay up.

414
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,333
Hey.

415
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,666
Can I include the old debts as well?

416
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,791
No.

417
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,125
If you don't pay,

418
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,750
I'm going to chop off your legs.

419
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,416
How much does he owe you?

420
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,541
I'll settle his debts.

421
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,125
But you have to join the training session.

422
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,791
Do you have enough cash?

423
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,708
He owes us a lot.

424
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,000
How much?

425
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,666
Five million.

426
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,083
Phusamhing is good at almost every sport.

427
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,541
He played football in junior high.

428
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,416
But he stopped playing in high school.

429
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,500
He said it's not cool.
Girls don't like it.

430
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,958
Girls, where are you going?
You look so beautiful.

431
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,833
Hey, Sang.

432
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,541
Long time no see. What's up?

433
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,166
-Hey, Mhing.
-What?

434
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,083
I want you to play for the national team.

435
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,166
Interested?

436
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,708
No one is into Arvee football.

437
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,041
Hey, it's not like before.

438
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,583
We've made it
to the qualifying round this year.

439
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,666
-Take a photo with me.
-Hey, girl.

440
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,041
-Is he that famous?
-Totally.

441
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,291
Sanglek is a national football player.
He's really famous.

442
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:58,875
I've got to get his autograph.

443
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,208
Yo, when does the practice start?

444
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,083
PHUSAMHING

445
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,541
KAMDEUNG

446
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm whacked.

447
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,416
Fifty laps.

448
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,791
Who can run that far?

449
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,500
Coach said, in England,
you have to run even farther.

450
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,166
Take a two-minute break,

451
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,375
then run 20 more laps.

452
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,958
Sticky rice, too.

453
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,541
Who cooked the food?

454
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,541
I did. You can't eat it?

455
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,416
It's edible.

456
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,958
But it's not good for the players.

457
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,125
It has too much fat and high cholesterol.

458
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,708
It's low in protein.

459
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,166
It's doesn't conform
to dietary standards, Aunt.

460
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,750
Athletes need to eat food
that is rich in protein,

461
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,375
which would provide them a lot of energy,

462
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,583
such as pasta.

463
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:36,958
I see.

464
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,208
I didn't know.

465
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,833
Let's do this, then.

466
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,291
I'll bring Tuk to help me out
with the cooking.

467
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,458
-She's studying at culinary school.
-Okay.

468
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,541
Hey.

469
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,833
Let's celebrate this tiring day, man.

470
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:07,375
Players of the Arvee team must refrain
from drinking alcohol.

471
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,916
We've got a match coming up.
Keep the discipline.

472
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,166
Good evening, dear viewers.

473
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,708
Let's welcome the Arvee football team.

474
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,791
This is the first qualifying match
for Zone Asia Group A.

475
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,791
Today, our Arvee team
is hosting North Korea.

476
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,208
Now, Arvee has the opening kickoff.

477
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:30,000
Today, the Arvee side
is dressed in red uniform,

478
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,250
-while North Korea is in white.
-We've got a fighting chance.

479
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,000
They're just trying us out.

480
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,916
Park Sung Young
passes the ball to number ten.

481
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,208
Heads it for a goal.

482
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,041
-I knew it.
-Arvee gives up their first goal

483
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,041
to a header by Ahn Moo-hoon.

484
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,083
North Korea's long ball
into Arvee territory.

485
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,333
Srimaen, our skilled goalie, catches it.

486
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,416
Arvee goes on the offensive.

487
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,875
But Pisay's pass is intercepted
by number eight.

488
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,958
He shot past Phusamhing
and simply into the goal.

489
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,916
North Korea leads Arvee

490
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,541
by two to zero.

491
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,458
Sanglek has the ball.

492
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:07,041
He dribbles past two defenders.

493
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,125
Can he make it?

494
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,583
He is stopped by the third.

495
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,208
North Korea has the ball

496
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,875
and passes it back up.

497
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,875
Number eight, Ryu Hong Sun gets through.

498
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,750
Rounds off Srimaen

499
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,291
and sends the ball into the net.

500
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,958
Arvee gives up its third goal
at the end of the first half.

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,333
What was that disaster?

502
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,208
Our game plan is to counterattack.

503
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,666
If you just play as you like,

504
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,500
how are we going to beat them?

505
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,125
Focus. Focus.

506
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,791
Playing football requires finesse
and precision.

507
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,208
You can't rely on raw instinct.

508
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,000
If you don't want to lose,

509
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,541
you better go out and get some goals.

510
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,916
Go, Arvee!

511
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

512
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,416
Hey!

513
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,708
Now, listen up team!

514
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,083
Anyone who gets a goal,

515
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm going to pay ten million each!

516
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,250
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

517
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,416
North Korea scores again.

518
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,083
Another goal sinks Arvee,
five goals to none.

519
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,541
I think Coach Pong

520
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,833
will need more time to adjust
and improve the Arvee side.

521
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,958
We've made it
to the qualifying round anyway.

522
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,958
Right? Let's go, dear.

523
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,625
THAI BEATS JORDAN 2-0

524
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:13,208
ARVEE DEFEATED BY NORTH KOREA

525
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,375
THAI BEATS JORDAN 2-0
WON THREE POINTS

526
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,958
ARVEE LOSES

527
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:28,166
THAI BEATS JORDAN 2-0
ARVEE LOSES 0-5

528
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,083
Kids.

529
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,791
What are you doing?

530
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,791
We're marking the wall with the ball.

531
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,666
I see that.

532
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,166
Why are you doing it?

533
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,250
I don't know. Grandpa told us to.

534
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,416
He said in the past, whenever Arvee lost,

535
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,583
he would get drunk to drown his sorrow.

536
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,958
One day, while he was drunk,
he kicked the ball against the wall,

537
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,458
and it made a mark.

538
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:53,208
On the wall, he would write the score,
and to which team Arvee lost.

539
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,208
Hey, there's more over there.

540
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,583
You better start thinking of what
you're going to mark when Arvee wins.

541
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,291
Kids.

542
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:30,833
Help me out.

543
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,541
I'm lost.

544
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,916
What's her name?

545
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,583
Tukta.

546
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,208
She flew here just to cook for us?

547
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,791
She's studying culinary,
so we asked her to help.

548
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,291
Is she your girl?

549
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,083
What? No.

550
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,750
Your mouth says one thing,
but you're blushing.

551
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,166
She really isn't.

552
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,708
Look at this.

553
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,291
It's all Western food.

554
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,791
How can we eat this?

555
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,083
Isn't this a bit drastic?

556
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,916
They're Arvee people, you know?

557
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,916
If they don't eat fermented fish,

558
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,166
where will they find the strength
to play ball?

559
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,166
Aunt.

560
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,208
But those local foods
don't have any dietary value for athletes.

561
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,333
Right. I'm going to see Bunterng.

562
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:49,833
I want a physical trainer for the team.

563
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,291
Not sure if we can find one.

564
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,708
Why do you want one?

565
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:56,541
To keep everyone fit and train the team.

566
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,791
Just one more move.

567
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,291
Why do we have to dance like this?

568
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,541
It's called "body combat."

569
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,083
It improves your agility.

570
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,666
-Good!
-Hey, man.

571
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,833
-Do you think he's a fairy?
-Good!

572
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,000
I think not.

573
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,750
I'm not sure if he's gay or not.

574
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:53,125
Right, I think we play
too much zone defense.

575
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,250
It's like we're inviting them to attack.

576
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,666
-We should chase down the ball.
-Right.

577
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,916
Since we can't keep possession,

578
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,500
we have to press the opponent
to diminish their control.

579
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,958
-Hey!
-What happened?

580
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,291
Excuse me.

581
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:57,791
What's your name?

582
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,500
Sompon.

583
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,458
Do you know how to play football?

584
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,458
SOMPON

585
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:28,791
Hot coffee, please.

586
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:38,750
That's Wernsawan.

587
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,625
Excuse me?

588
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,500
Wernsawan.

589
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:48,041
The best football player
Arvee has ever seen.

590
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:51,708
If he is still playing,
maybe we could do better.

591
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,666
Was he injured?

592
00:38:58,833 --> 00:38:59,708
No.

593
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,583
He's facing a lifetime ban from football.

594
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,541
He has a short temper

595
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,208
and can't control himself.

596
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,666
He gets into fights with his opponents.

597
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,500
In his last match,
he kicked the referee and broke his ribs.

598
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,375
It was a huge scandal.

599
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,791
This is Ngid.

600
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,250
Ngid is a local hunter-gatherer
from the Karenni tribe.

601
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,208
He knows Wernsawan well.

602
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:06,083
Can't you find
a less temperamental player?

603
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:10,458
Ngid, slow down.

604
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,458
-I'm here.
-Hey!

605
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,916
Hurry up. It's getting late.

606
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,166
Wernsawan is dangerous.

607
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,416
From what I've seen from the tapes,

608
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,500
his opponents provoked him.

609
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,958
It's been over ten years.

610
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,916
He should be much calmer.

611
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,166
Hey!

612
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:56,750
You want a fight?

613
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,291
Hi, Wern.

614
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,125
It's like I told you.

615
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,875
What do you say?

616
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,916
Would you like to play football again?

617
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,500
I stopped playing a long time ago.

618
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,625
Football disrupts my mind.

619
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,666
Why don't you try it out?

620
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,083
I'd better not.

621
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,208
When I play, I lose self-control.

622
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:34,333
I don't want to hurt anyone again.

623
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,166
Why don't you give it a shot?

624
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,041
-I don't want to play.
-Just a shot.

625
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,666
-No.
-It will be fun.

626
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,250
No!

627
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,708
No, I'm too old.

628
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,916
Ngid, pass me the ball.

629
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,791
WERNSAWAN

630
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,541
NGID

631
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:13,916
I spent millions so you'd be comfortable.
Train your hearts out, team.

632
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,416
-I want a room with air conditioner, then.
-Sure, you can. Come on.

633
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,833
Come with me.

634
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,166
From what you've seen,

635
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,458
India isn't that strong as a team.

636
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,083
Just trust in me

637
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,416
as much as I trust in you.

638
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:11,333
This next match is the real deal.

639
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,333
Starting tomorrow,
we're going to train really hard.

640
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:20,166
We'll use a 4-5-1 formation
with four defenders.

641
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,708
Natee as a left-back.

642
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:22,916
Two center backs.

643
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:24,416
Phusamhing as a stopper.

644
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,375
Pisay as a sweeper.

645
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,416
Tong Daeng as a right-back.

646
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,583
Both full-backs must press in
on the opponent.

647
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,791
If the ball gets to the two center backs,

648
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,166
I want you to clear the ball first.

649
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,541
The five midfielders will cover the zone.

650
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,041
Lumnow and Sompon, chase down the ball,

651
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:41,541
-and disrupt the opponent's game.
-Ouch!

652
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,083
Why did you kick me?

653
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,208
Sorry, I forgot.

654
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,750
Wern is going to be midfield general.

655
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,666
If there's an opening,
pass the ball for Kamdueng to setup.

656
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,458
Sanglek, once you get the ball,

657
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:56,750
I want you to try to draw a foul.

658
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:59,291
Don't forget that everyone must help
chase down the ball in defense.

659
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,250
Get it?

660
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,625
Let's practice shooting.

661
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,083
Pass the ball to Kamdueng.

662
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:06,041
He'll head it back for you
to shoot the goal.

663
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,333
Next.

664
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,000
Wait!

665
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,666
Kick the ball softly
to that tall guy's head,

666
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,333
and when it bounces back,

667
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,916
slowly run in to kick the ball
into the goal, okay?

668
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:32,541
But kick it
with only half of your strength,

669
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,625
or else it will enter the stratosphere.

670
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,166
Broken arm?

671
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,250
Yes.

672
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:04,958
Broken in two halves.

673
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:08,708
It will take three months
before he can play again.

674
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:19,458
Do we have enough time
to find a new goalie?

675
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,000
That won't be necessary.

676
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,458
I have someone in mind.

677
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,250
Help me carry it.

678
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,958
Put it over there.

679
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:47,333
Cramps!

680
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,708
-Easy.
-Be gentle.

681
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,250
-Let me see.
-I'll do it.

682
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,291
Please be gentle.

683
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,416
It doesn't hurt there.

684
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,291
You're fine. It's only a cramp.

685
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,458
Gently.

686
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,708
Is anyone else hurt?

687
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,291
-No. Everyone is healthy.
-No one.

688
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:27,708
You might be wondering why I'm having you
practice so many penalty shots.

689
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,291
Players like Zico,

690
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,666
Baggio, Henri, or Beckham,

691
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,750
have all missed
important penalty shots before.

692
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,041
Anything can happen in a football match.

693
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,208
-Wern.
-Hey!

694
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:04,916
Be careful.

695
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:29,083
USA is out.

696
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:30,291
Guys.

697
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,291
Watch and see. Arvee will win the crown.

698
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,583
Just wait, guys.

699
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,916
I doubt it. Venezuela is much prettier.

700
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,208
She can win.

701
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,416
-How can you say that, Jo?
-Right.

702
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,875
How can you say that?

703
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,958
-Miss Arvee is much prettier.
-Venezuela's prettier.

704
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:44,041
-Arvee!
-Venezuela!

705
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,250
You want to bet on it?

706
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,083
Are you sure?

707
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,416
Your luck hasn't been so good lately.

708
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,208
Let's make it 500.

709
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:55,208
-Arvee!
-Arvee!

710
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:59,375
-Arvee!
-Arvee!

711
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:02,875
-Arvee!
-Arvee!

712
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,291
What's the racket all about?

713
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,666
It's not cold in India
at this time of the year.

714
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,791
Are you still sick?

715
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,583
No.

716
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,875
It's just allergies.

717
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,416
Here.

718
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,458
Team.

719
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:07,791
Give me your attention.

720
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:09,833
Look who's here!

721
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,166
It so happens,

722
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,375
Petchdawan just arrived.

723
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:26,458
So I asked her to wish us all good luck.

724
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:28,916
Try your best to win.

725
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,875
Don't lose face to Petchdawan.

726
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,083
Let me take a photo with her.

727
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,625
-Me first!
-Me too!

728
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,875
Aren't you going to ask for her autograph?

729
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,791
I'm not that crazy about celebrities.

730
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,541
Don't be shy.

731
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,416
You're just as famous as she is.

732
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:51,791
Right.

733
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,208
She's a beauty queen
and I'm just a lousy football player.

734
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:05,333
Thanks. I have a pen.

735
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:08,583
No. I want to get your autograph.

736
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,083
Here's my autograph.

737
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:28,583
See you later.

738
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,500
Breaking news!

739
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,666
Big news!

740
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,500
Arvee has won!

741
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,166
Arvee?

742
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,291
-Arvee really won!
-Can you keep that for me? I'll be back.

743
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,041
What's the rush?

744
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,791
I'm going home to mark the wall
with the ball.

745
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,208
We won. Why do you have to mark the wall?

746
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:15,916
Yes! Nine! I won.

747
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:41,958
Wait.

748
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:16,416
Hey.

749
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:20,541
Just in time.

750
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:21,583
What's this?

751
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:26,750
Rub it on your chest, back, and neck,

752
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:29,250
so you can breathe better.

753
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:31,666
Thank you.

754
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,625
-Rub it every time you play or practice.
-Okay.

755
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,291
Tukta, dear.

756
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,333
My heart is sore.

757
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:48,250
-What should I rub on it?
-Right.

758
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,708
-You're crazy!
-Ouch.

759
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,791
I may be crazy,

760
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,208
but is love a crime?

761
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,916
Sang, you're just on time.

762
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:06,875
Wait.

763
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,333
What are you guys doing?

764
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,500
Check this out.

765
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:15,500
We have to go international.

766
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,750
Everyone has bleached his hair.
You're the last one.

767
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,625
For team unity, man.

768
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,416
I had someone to buy bleach from Thailand.

769
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,958
You think it's a good idea?

770
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,708
-How come you didn't bleach your hair?
-Who says I didn't?

771
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:28,791
I did.

772
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,250
I was the first one.

773
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,958
The Uzbeks use a 4-3-3 formation
for a full-on attack.

774
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,250
The most dangerous player
is their center midfielder.

775
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:45,333
Do anything you can to stop him.

776
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,208
Damn it!

777
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,541
I can't stand this.

778
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,541
Whose idea was this?

779
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,208
Why didn't you bleach yours?

780
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,083
There wasn't enough bleaching product.

781
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,291
Sanglek, wait.

782
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,916
Did you rub this on?

783
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:09,125
No, I forgot.

784
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,875
There isn't enough time.
I'll rub it after the first half.

785
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,458
Pull up your shirt.

786
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,541
Hurry up.

787
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,000
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

788
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:24,750
All finished. You can go.

789
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,458
Welcome Arvee football fans.

790
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:32,041
Today, the Arvee team
is sporting a new bleached blond look.

791
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:33,958
I don't know what they were thinking.

792
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,416
How can this build up their team unity?

793
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,666
Game starts. Uzbekistan kicks off.

794
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,291
Chase the ball!

795
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:47,750
Arvee concede a foul early in the game.

796
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,875
The Uzbeks have possession

797
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,875
and pile up pressure for 11 Arvee players
to retreat into their own half.

798
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:21,791
Arvee are still packing a tight defense.

799
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,666
Pongnarin's tactic today
is to shield the Uzbeks' attack.

800
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:55,875
Chase the ball!

801
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,416
Wernsawan, Arvee's commander,
has the ball.

802
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:09,708
Wernsawan to Sanglek on the left.

803
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,875
Sanglek bursts forward.

804
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,541
A tackle! He's fouled!

805
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:19,333
Arvee gets a free kick on the left flank.

806
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,791
-Now.
-Left.

807
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,666
Sanglek.

808
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,916
Sanglek curves a long ball into the box.

809
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,125
It's in! It's a goal for Arvee!

810
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,458
Wernsawan scores for Arvee!

811
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,041
Arvee leads Uzbekistan 1-0.

812
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:50,375
Arvee just scored their first goal.

813
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,041
What are you doing?

814
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,333
Our next match will be in North Korea.

815
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:41,083
They say that the weather there
is freezing cold.

816
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,083
I need to get used to it.

817
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,500
It's freezing in there.

818
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:06,041
What's the point of all this?
Isn't it a bit sadistic?

819
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:09,750
It's a lot colder in North Korea.

820
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,791
We have to prepare ourselves.

821
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,375
There's no need to go this far.

822
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:23,166
We have to trust the coach.

823
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,791
Focus, Sang.

824
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
Focus.

825
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:37,083
Ngid, pass me the ball.

826
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:42,000
No, don't kick it.

827
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,041
Billboards smash to pieces

828
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,833
with the monster kick from Ngid,
the number 12.

829
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:51,041
We're down to the final minutes.

830
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,958
The game between Arvee and North Korea

831
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:54,541
remains tied at zero.

832
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,125
If no one scores,

833
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:59,125
North Korea will go through
to the quarterfinals.

834
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,958
Arvee has only seven points.

835
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,041
While North Korean has nine points.

836
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:05,791
Arvee needs nothing less than a win
to go through.

837
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,583
Ngid blasts another monster kick.

838
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:13,791
It throws the North Korean goalkeeper
to the ground!

839
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,708
This is him, Ngid, "The Clearance,"
sent in to clear the ball.

840
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,375
A draw is enough for Arvee.

841
01:02:22,916 --> 01:02:25,916
It looks like Kim Eun-ji,
the goalkeeper, can get back on his feet.

842
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,916
The match is deep into injury time.

843
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,625
At this point, we must say that Arvee
has done all that needs to be done.

844
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:35,500
Ngid has the ball, blasts it away,
and runs back into position.

845
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,541
The ball flies over the keeper
and into the net.

846
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,916
In the net?

847
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,166
What? The ball is in!

848
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:46,041
How come? Arvee snatches
a last-gasp victory!

849
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:49,500
Unbelievable! Arvee leads 1-0!

850
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,625
Arvee are going through the quarterfinal!

851
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,583
ARVEE 1-0: STEAL DRAMATIC VICTORY
TO ENTER QUARTERFINALS

852
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,291
ARVEE WON

853
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:00,458
PONGNARING BOASTS:
ARVEE READY FOR THE WORLD CUP

854
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,083
THAILAND WINS GROUP B
AFTER BEATING JORDAN 3-0

855
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:12,250
You lose because you never try

856
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,125
It's a shame

857
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,208
It's a shame

858
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,541
Don't hide it

859
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,541
If it's for someone you care

860
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,416
Give it your best

861
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,166
In love, there's nothing fair

862
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,083
-Happy, huh?
-If you hide it

863
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,875
You've exerted great effort
preparing this.

864
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:39,291
They won't know about it

865
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:49,125
Wow, we will play
with Iran, Japan, and Qatar.

866
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,125
Do we even have a chance to win?

867
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:54,541
Everything is possible in a football game.

868
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,416
GOAL: TO THE WORLD CUP

869
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,333
Captain.

870
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,083
We'll be playing the heavyweights.

871
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,666
Do you think we have any chance?

872
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:06,791
Hey.

873
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,791
We have a great coach.

874
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:11,333
At least, if we finish third in the group,

875
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,916
we'll earn a quota to be in a playoff.

876
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,208
If we won,

877
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:18,833
we'll play with the winner
from Central America.

878
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:22,000
And with another win,
we'll proceed to the World Cup.

879
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:24,000
I don’t get it.

880
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,000
It's too complicated.

881
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,625
Who are we going to compete first?

882
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,291
Iran.

883
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,708
Looks like a long queue.

884
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:21,666
Shouldn't we take a shower together,
so we won't have to wait?

885
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,166
-No.
-No.

886
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,166
I can wait. No rush.

887
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,916
We can wait, right?

888
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,333
I've got cramps. Help!

889
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:20,750
It's all right! I'm fine!

890
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,250
Help! I'm okay now!

891
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,541
I'm fine!

892
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,791
Help!

893
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:38,583
THAI STRIKER DEFECTS TO ARVEE

894
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:47,083
Do you know the Thai player
who's going to play with us?

895
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,458
Yes, but we never talked.

896
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,041
We played for different clubs.

897
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,041
He was Thai League's top scorer.

898
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:59,375
Why do you want to play for Arvee?

899
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:02,208
I want to make my father's dream
come true.

900
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,208
On his deathbed,

901
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,750
he told me...

902
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:11,833
"You must join the national squad

903
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:15,291
and play in the World Cup."

904
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,375
And I trust you.

905
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,333
I have faith in you.

906
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:23,041
I believe that you can make our dream
come true.

907
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,416
I'm asking you seriously.

908
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,666
Give me a chance, coach.

909
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,666
We suffered the same tragedy.

910
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,916
We were rejected by our own people.

911
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:35,333
Do it as a favor for me, coach.

912
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,833
Go! Run!

913
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,208
How are you doing, Sanglek?

914
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,916
Remember me?

915
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:47,833
I'm Saman.

916
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:51,166
Thai League's top scorer
who beat you by a couple of goals.

917
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:52,333
Don't worry.

918
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,458
Now we're in the same squad.

919
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,500
You pass, I score. I pass, you score.

920
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:04,291
Having us on the same team
is like two tigers unleashed.

921
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:09,458
I'm Saman, man.

922
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:26,708
Hey, stay focused!

923
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:52,166
What devil has got into you?

924
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:56,541
You think you're on top of the world?

925
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,791
You boys think you're celebrities?

926
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,791
Where's your focus and discipline?

927
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:08,625
You think you'll die and go to heaven now
that we're in the last eight?

928
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,083
Whose phone is it?

929
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,000
Must be Miss Universe calling.

930
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,083
From now on,

931
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,416
switch off all communication devices
during practice.

932
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:47,083
Tell everyone not to call you
during the training session.

933
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,208
I don't care if it's your parents,

934
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,333
your family,

935
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,250
or girlfriends.

936
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,541
Where are you? Yes, I'll call you back.

937
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,166
I'll bet on Liverpool.

938
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,875
Hey, Sang.

939
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,416
Set me up for a goal
when you spot a chance okay?

940
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,541
I'll rip their defense apart

941
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:58,500
with my incredible speed.

942
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,583
But the coach told us to play defense.

943
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,500
Come on.

944
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:05,583
To play great football...

945
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:08,041
is to attack.

946
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:12,166
I'm too good to play defensive tactics.

947
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:21,208
Saman's dribble is blocked again.

948
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,416
-Damn it. What's he doing?
-Arvee's new striker

949
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,125
has recently rescinded
his Thai nationality.

950
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:27,916
He earned his cleats
as Thai League's top scorer.

951
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,208
Skilled he is.

952
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:32,000
But he's not a team player.

953
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,208
Iran's counterattack.

954
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:35,833
The ball is in the box.
Number eight charges. It's a goal! 

955
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,333
Iran is up 1-0.

956
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,416
Saman!

957
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,208
Why don't you stick to the game plan?

958
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:50,333
We have to attack when we have a chance.

959
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,333
That's exactly the reason why they scored.

960
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,541
Cut it out!

961
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,166
Let's play. We still have time.

962
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,250
Iran doubled their lead.
Again, from number eight.

963
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:03,291
A clear header from Kahlil Karimi
since he's left unmarked.

964
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,625
Iran are up 2-0.

965
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:07,833
What are you doing?

966
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:09,708
Run!

967
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:12,208
Chase the ball!

968
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,666
Karimi has the ball again.

969
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,500
He's storming forward.

970
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,625
Phusamhing tackles.

971
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,916
This is dangerous for Arvee.

972
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,083
What did the referee say?

973
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:28,791
Phusamhing is shown the red card!

974
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,916
It's a professional foul.

975
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,500
Penalty for Iran.

976
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,458
It's a goal!

977
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,125
Hamid Daiei sends
the ball past the keeper.

978
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,833
Iran are up 3-0.

979
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,583
Arvee decides to take Saman off.

980
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:54,916
Number 11, Bundee, is coming on.

981
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,458
There's a fight.
Wernsawan is cooking trouble

982
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:12,375
with Kahlil Karimi from Iran.

983
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,083
What? Has he gotten hit?

984
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,708
Karimi is down.

985
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,833
The Japanese referee rushes over.

986
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,250
This foul play is unprofessional.

987
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,166
And it's another red card!
Can you believe it?

988
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,250
What will they do next?
Oh, Wernsawan is charging at the referee.

989
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,041
Wernsawan lost his temper now.

990
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,958
His teammates now

991
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:32,541
-try to hold him back.
-Stop it, boys. Stop it!

992
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,791
Boys, don't fight!

993
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:35,541
Stop it! Don't fight!

994
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:53,583
I don't know where to begin.

995
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,166
I could lecture you until tomorrow.

996
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:08,041
I'm not saying that if you'd stuck
to the tactic, we would've won.

997
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,375
But at least if you'd listened to me,

998
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:13,208
it wouldn't have been this humiliating.

999
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:19,833
Where is Wern?

1000
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:33,208
It's your fault, Saman.

1001
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:36,083
You spoiled our game plan.

1002
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,041
I did my best.

1003
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,916
You guys don't know
how to play decent football.

1004
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,625
You're only good at committing fouls.

1005
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,541
Shut up, Thai boy!

1006
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:48,125
You have no heart to fight for Arvee.

1007
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,208
You're playing for your own glory.

1008
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:52,833
What about your coach?

1009
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,416
Isn't he also a Thai?

1010
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,583
What about the woman who feeds your team?

1011
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,208
Even the chef?

1012
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,791
-They're all Thai, aren't they?
-I never asked for your charity.

1013
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:02,958
Don't think that your money can buy us.

1014
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,250
Madam.

1015
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,291
I'm sorry.

1016
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,666
I didn't mean it.

1017
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:04,666
Forget it.

1018
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:07,125
It's all right, Pisay.

1019
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:08,875
Let it rest.

1020
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:12,750
Arvee and Thailand are like siblings.

1021
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:15,458
When we fight, it's like a sibling fight.

1022
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:22,666
From now on, we're one and the same,
be it Thai or Arvee.

1023
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:27,208
Saman's mother came from Arvee.

1024
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,000
And me, I'm 100 percent Northeastern Thai.

1025
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,875
Right?

1026
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:38,916
We speak the same language anyway,
don't we?

1027
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,708
ARVEE TO THE WORLD CUP?

1028
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:53,791
PONGNARIN'S HEADACHE
AS IN-FIGHTING BREAKS OUT

1029
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:01,958
I'm sorry, Aunt.

1030
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,583
Sorry for what?

1031
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,666
We haven't been eliminated.

1032
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,000
It was just one defeat,

1033
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:15,541
and you're acting like
it's the end of the world.

1034
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:20,000
Our World Cup dream
is going to end in this round.

1035
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,666
Who cares?

1036
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,458
I still have a big stash of cash left.

1037
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:27,916
If we're knocked out,
I'll fly everyone to go see the World Cup.

1038
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:43,458
Coach.

1039
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:53,916
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

1040
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:03,333
Why aren't you changed yet?

1041
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:06,250
I thought you had kicked me out.

1042
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,791
If you don't get changed in three minutes,

1043
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,208
you're out.

1044
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,541
Are you not feeling well?

1045
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:43,458
No, I'm fine.

1046
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,500
-Can we get your autograph?
-Can we get your autograph?

1047
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,583
You're so cute.

1048
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:51,750
What's your name?

1049
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,000
It's Pim.

1050
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:56,333
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

1051
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:30,583
Sanglek, you have a missed call.

1052
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,333
TUKTA

1053
01:20:44,708 --> 01:20:45,791
You have a cold?

1054
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,625
No.

1055
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:51,833
Just allergies.

1056
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,458
With some balm. I'll be fine.

1057
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,083
She's gone back to Bangkok?

1058
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,791
When did she leave?

1059
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:05,458
This morning.

1060
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,958
She said she'd drop by her house
in Udon Thani first.

1061
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:14,458
I didn't want to keep her here
since school has started.

1062
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:17,666
We've got help.
You boys won't starve without her.

1063
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,583
Good evening, dear viewers.

1064
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:49,583
Welcome to the live broadcast of
the World Cup Zone Asia qualifying match.

1065
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,958
This is the first leg
of a crucial play-off

1066
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:53,458
between Thailand and Arvee.

1067
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:56,833
Played at the National Stadium
in Arvee City.

1068
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:00,708
Let's take a look
at both team's qualifying campaigns.

1069
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,125
Arvee began the quarter finals
with a humiliating defeat

1070
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,666
after being thrashed 0-7 by Iran.

1071
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,916
They visited Japan
and suffered a 1-0 loss.

1072
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,166
They drew Qatar 1-1 at home,
but lost 0-1 in the away game.

1073
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:18,708
Then came the surprise from Arvee,
1-0 home victory over Japan.

1074
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:22,208
Before holding Iran to a goalless draw.

1075
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,916
This vital match has kicked off.

1076
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,166
Arvee, wearing blue, kick off the match.
While Thailand is in all-red outfit.

1077
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,750
Let's see what Arvee will play
against Thai.

1078
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:37,791
Vitoon intercepts the ball and passes,

1079
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:40,041
but it's offside!

1080
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,041
ARVEE - THAI

1081
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,500
Anurak passes a long ball,
but it's offside again.

1082
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,833
Thailand open aggressively,
but get caught by the offside trap.

1083
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:47,583
Could that be Pongnarin's tactic?

1084
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,833
Setting the offside trap against Thai.

1085
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:56,083
Now, Wernsawan passes
to Sanglek who turns around and charges.

1086
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:58,500
He's loose!
It's one on one with the goalie!

1087
01:22:58,583 --> 01:23:01,041
Slides and knocks the ball in!

1088
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,958
Arvee goes ahead
at the end of the first half!

1089
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:03,958
Unbelievable.

1090
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:06,041
As expected, this Arvee team

1091
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:10,083
can play fast counterattack
and it's all Thai's fault.

1092
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,958
Let's continue our live broadcast.

1093
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:16,083
The second half is about to start.

1094
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:19,500
Five minutes to go,
and Arvee is still leading with 1-0.

1095
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,458
Thailand presses nonstop,

1096
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,083
but Arvee's defense is a tough one.

1097
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,291
Thai want at least one goal to level.

1098
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,291
If they have an away goal,
next match in Thailand,

1099
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,375
they'll have an advantage.

1100
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:30,958
Now! They level!

1101
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:33,625
It's a goal. Vitoon levels for Thailand!

1102
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,208
The game is tied 1-1!

1103
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,791
That's the final whistle.

1104
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,416
It's a 1-1 draw between Arvee and Thailand

1105
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,750
in Arvee City.

1106
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:43,000
The second leg in Bangkok

1107
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:45,875
will decide the World Cup destiny
of both nations.

1108
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:47,000
ARVEE 1-1 THAI

1109
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:49,416
They are tied. It's unbelievable.

1110
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,041
Pongnarin shakes hands
with Thai and Arvee players.

1111
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,791
But he seems disappointed with the result.

1112
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:56,333
His team almost won.

1113
01:23:56,416 --> 01:24:01,416
And now he faces a do-or-die match
in his home country.

1114
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,625
He certainly looks stressed out.

1115
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:08,541
No one could feel more pressure
than he does right now.

1116
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:12,958
THAI FANS SIGH IN RELIEF FROM NEAR LOSS
NEXT MATCH IS MAKE-OR-BREAK

1117
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:15,416
VITOON LEVEL 1-1
CARDINHO ADMITS, ARVEE IS TOUGH

1118
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,708
PONGNARIN AT THE CROSSROADS:

1119
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:20,750
THE TIE ADD MORE PRESSURE ON PONGNARIN

1120
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,958
PONGNARIN WILL TAKE ARVEE TO THE WORLD CUP

1121
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,291
DUTY OR HEART

1122
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,750
WHAT WOULD HE CHOOSE?

1123
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,458
Such a shame.

1124
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,416
We almost did it.

1125
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,416
Should we appoint Adisorn as a coach?

1126
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,208
But we must believe in Pongnarin.

1127
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,041
He has brought us this far.

1128
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,833
GOAL: TO THE WORLD CUP

1129
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:17,666
ARVEE 1-1 THAI

1130
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:48,000
People may be wondering

1131
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:51,166
about how I'll maintain my position

1132
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,958
at situations like this.

1133
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:56,208
I'm Thai.

1134
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,458
And like all Thais.

1135
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:04,958
I've always dreamed of seeing Thailand
in the World Cup.

1136
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,166
My aunt,

1137
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,041
Mingkwan Ulice,

1138
01:27:11,208 --> 01:27:12,708
is also a supporter of the Thai team.

1139
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:16,750
All her life, she's dreamed
of seeing Thailand in the World Cup.

1140
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,666
But now,

1141
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,333
Mingkwan

1142
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:24,750
has a responsibility
as an Arvee team manager.

1143
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:26,916
And myself,

1144
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:29,458
as their coach,

1145
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:32,541
my priority as a coach...

1146
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:36,416
is to make this team win.

1147
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,333
Emerge victory.

1148
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,500
There's no question about it.

1149
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:43,708
Tomorrow,

1150
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:45,958
Arvee will fight

1151
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,791
with heart

1152
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:50,708
and dignity.

1153
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:53,708
I hope that...

1154
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:58,625
both Arvee and Thai football fans

1155
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,208
will enjoy tomorrow's game.

1156
01:28:03,166 --> 01:28:04,166
Thank you very much.

1157
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,958
MISS UNIVERSE VISITS FOSTER HOME

1158
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,458
Hey.

1159
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:40,625
I couldn't reach you on the phone.

1160
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:43,416
I've been studying.

1161
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:45,583
I've been studying hard lately.

1162
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,166
I got a lot of work too.

1163
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:51,541
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1164
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:56,541
I'm just a Missed Call, not Miss Universe.

1165
01:28:57,875 --> 01:28:59,291
What are you doing here?

1166
01:29:00,833 --> 01:29:02,333
Running away from training?

1167
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:09,833
Here.

1168
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:11,375
Come to the match.

1169
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:15,083
You're still a member of the staff.

1170
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:18,791
I'm not sure.

1171
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:22,083
Let me see if I'm free.

1172
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,291
Allergies still acting up?

1173
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,333
Smell something?

1174
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:33,750
Shoot!

1175
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:35,833
Damn.

1176
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,500
SHE'S NOT THAT PRETTY

1177
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,291
BEAUTY QUEEN MAKE ME PUKE

1178
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:02,958
You'll need this.

1179
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:14,916
COME BACK AND RUB THE BALM FOR ME

1180
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:18,208
Look at those two lovebirds.

1181
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:19,166
Yeah.

1182
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,875
And she said they're just friends.

1183
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:25,791
We're closing.

1184
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:29,125
Good evening.

1185
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:31,458
Welcome to the live broadcast

1186
01:30:31,541 --> 01:30:34,625
of the second leg
of the Zone Asia Qualifying match.

1187
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:36,708
This game is of paramount importance
for both teams.

1188
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:40,791
Thailand are hosting Arvee  in Bangkok.

1189
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:44,291
The winner of this second leg

1190
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:48,833
will play against the winner
from Zone Concacef.

1191
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:51,958
And the winner of that playoff
will earn a berth in the World Cup.

1192
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,083
The most interesting match-up.

1193
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,958
But looking at the statistics,

1194
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:05,625
Thailand is in a different league
from Arvee.

1195
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,708
Especially in a crucial game like this,
I'm confident that Thailand

1196
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:11,166
won't shoot itself in the foot.

1197
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:21,166
Arvee's trump card is Pongnarin,
who's already made history as a coach.

1198
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:24,166
How do you anticipate his tactic today?

1199
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:27,291
Remember that...

1200
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,666
at this point,

1201
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,833
our chance is as good as the Thais'.

1202
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:36,083
This is the game of our life.

1203
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:39,166
Stay focused.

1204
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,208
And fight with all you've got.

1205
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,166
What if we give it all and still lose?

1206
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,583
We're not going to lose.

1207
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,083
We've lost enough.

1208
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:55,583
Go out there and believe that we will win.

1209
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:58,041
Believe in one thing. Victory.

1210
01:31:58,541 --> 01:32:00,041
We're going to the World Cup.

1211
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:02,041
Don't you want to go to the World Cup?

1212
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,583
What for?

1213
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,666
Because I want to!

1214
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:16,708
-Yes!
-Yes!

1215
01:32:16,791 --> 01:32:19,875
-World Cup!
-World Cup!

1216
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:21,541
Arvee, please get ready for the game.

1217
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,416
What did you say?

1218
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,041
Brothers from Arvee,
please get ready for the game.

1219
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:50,666
Here.

1220
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:11,916
You're asking for too much.

1221
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,375
Hurry up.

1222
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,208
Hey, man, hurry up.

1223
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:32,458
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1224
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:35,916
Mhing! Wait up!

1225
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,666
Sang!

1226
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,791
THAILAND

1227
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:36,708
-Thailand!
-Thailand!

1228
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,416
-Thailand!
-Thailand!

1229
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,166
-Thailand!
-Thailand!

1230
01:36:51,416 --> 01:36:53,833
Grilled squid!

1231
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,333
Grilled squid, anyone?

1232
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:58,375
A historic game is about to begin.

1233
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:00,458
Today's referee is Michael Shao
from Singapore,

1234
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:02,416
and also the assistant referee
from the same country.

1235
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:05,291
Thailand kick off the match.

1236
01:37:06,041 --> 01:37:08,833
-Arvee in red uniform with white socks.
-Chase the ball!

1237
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,625
It's getting hairy early in the match.

1238
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:15,000
Thailand's Torpong tackled hard
by Sompon from Arvee.

1239
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:16,708
He is down.

1240
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,958
Thailand has a free kick.

1241
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,541
Sukmak-anan has the ball
and shakes off an Arvee player!

1242
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:23,416
Passes to Vitoon.

1243
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,083
Vitoon fires!

1244
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:29,791
Toward the goal but well-caught
by Tom, Arvee's goalkeeper.

1245
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:33,541
Thailand started off very well,
but still tied 0-0.

1246
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:36,916
Ball is with Vitoon.

1247
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,041
Vitoon's left foot shot
is way off the mark!

1248
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:43,291
Thailand is more aggressive in the attack,
but Arvee defense is very good.

1249
01:37:43,375 --> 01:37:46,833
We can't underestimate them.
Beware of their counterattack.

1250
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,291
We learned a lesson from the first leg.

1251
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:49,750
Sukmak-anan fires a shot!

1252
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:52,416
Tom palms it out of the way.

1253
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:54,666
Thailand's got a corner kick.

1254
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:57,208
Pongsak sends the ball,

1255
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:58,791
flying into the box.

1256
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:00,666
Tom catches the ball,

1257
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:04,125
and quickly throws it to Sanglek.

1258
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:05,333
Sanglek.

1259
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:07,541
Showing off now.

1260
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:08,875
-Sending the ball...
-Hands off me!

1261
01:38:08,958 --> 01:38:11,708
Thailand's Namchoke fouls Wernsawan.

1262
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:14,166
That was harsh.

1263
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:17,166
Wernsawan is down.
The yellow card is shown.

1264
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,416
-Shame.
-Asshole!

1265
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,833
Namchoke receives the first yellow card
of the game.

1266
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:22,958
I called you an asshole!

1267
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:24,541
Hey. Calm down, mates.

1268
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,458
No, don't.

1269
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:37,208
Arvee got a free kick outside the box.

1270
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:39,916
Sanglek will take the free kick.

1271
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,625
Let's see if he's going to shoot
or open it.

1272
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,291
Sanglek kick with his left foot.

1273
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:44,291
The ball is headed away.

1274
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:46,041
Thailand clear the ball from their goal.

1275
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:48,375
Now, it's time
for Thailand's counterattack.

1276
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:50,541
Anurak takes the ball to the right flank.

1277
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:51,875
Nicely shifts the ball pass Arvee.

1278
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:53,166
Anurak to Sukmak-anan.

1279
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,666
Now to Vitoon.

1280
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:55,666
Vitoon.

1281
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:57,708
Vitoon to Anurak.

1282
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:00,791
Anurak passes the ball into the box
and charges!

1283
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:03,125
It's in. That was beautiful!

1284
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:05,833
They set it up beautifully.
Thailand leads 1-0 against Arvee.

1285
01:39:05,916 --> 01:39:08,416
This is classic football.
Thailand is up 1-0 against Arvee.

1286
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,625
Wonderful play with a sublime one-two pass

1287
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:12,916
and with a magnificent finish.

1288
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,958
This is what I call real football!

1289
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:38,000
Thailand has the momentum
and presses an all-out attack.

1290
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,000
Wernsawan returns the favor.

1291
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,083
Namchoke is down on the pitch.

1292
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:45,708
Micheal Shao, the referee
shows the yellow card to Wernsawan.

1293
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,333
Thailand will get a free kick.

1294
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:49,083
What a good spot to take.

1295
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:51,250
Let's see if they can make it 2-0.

1296
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:54,041
Goal! Thailand doubles the lead.

1297
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:56,416
It's now 2-0!
Thailand is up 2-0 against Arvee.

1298
01:40:10,125 --> 01:40:12,666
That's the end of the first half.
Thailand is leading 2-0 against Arvee.

1299
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,208
Wern.

1300
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,833
Watch out for number five.

1301
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,875
He's trying to get you red-carded.

1302
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:37,291
Don't let him provoke you.

1303
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:55,041
I'm sorry.

1304
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:03,125
So far, you guys have played well.

1305
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:08,458
I've taught you how to not concede goals.

1306
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:12,708
But today,

1307
01:41:16,125 --> 01:41:17,666
I want you to score goals.

1308
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:24,833
Attack!

1309
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:27,500
Don't hold back.

1310
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:28,583
Boys.

1311
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:31,375
Just march forward and fire at them.

1312
01:41:31,916 --> 01:41:32,875
You too, goalie.

1313
01:41:33,291 --> 01:41:35,333
Don't worry about catching the ball.

1314
01:41:35,416 --> 01:41:37,083
Forget stupid tactics.

1315
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,875
We have 45 minutes left.

1316
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:43,333
Give it all you've got.

1317
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,041
In four years, you'll be singing lullabies
to your kids at home.

1318
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,916
Give it your best shot today!

1319
01:41:50,166 --> 01:41:51,458
Win or lose,

1320
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,666
do it with dignity.

1321
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:55,041
Understood?

1322
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:12,541
The worst thing...

1323
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:16,291
for a coach

1324
01:42:17,708 --> 01:42:19,250
is to ignore the tactics.

1325
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,458
So, this is our tactic.

1326
01:42:26,791 --> 01:42:29,958
Forget all the training that we did.

1327
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:33,458
And play it the way you like to play!

1328
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,708
You mean, make a mess out of it?

1329
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:38,416
Yes!

1330
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:40,208
Make a bloody mess out of it!

1331
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:41,250
Get it?

1332
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:43,083
-Yes!
-Yes!

1333
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:53,041
A change of form for Arvee
in the second half.

1334
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:56,333
Storming forward and firing away
like there's no tomorrow.

1335
01:42:56,416 --> 01:42:59,750
Thailand must stay composed
since we have two goals in the bag.

1336
01:42:59,833 --> 01:43:03,666
We enjoy a better chance of going through.

1337
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:06,375
To put a nail in the coffin,

1338
01:43:06,458 --> 01:43:08,916
we must score a third goal quickly.

1339
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:11,166
Nice and easy.

1340
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:20,666
Now, Saman Komsantier is coming on.

1341
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:25,875
The Thai fans in the stadium
are booing him.

1342
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:30,875
Bringing a striker on
means Arvee are going for broke.

1343
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:37,583
His one-man-show...

1344
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:38,500
What the hell?

1345
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:41,916
...and his unnecessary diving

1346
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,916
often costs his team dearly.

1347
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:49,833
Saman bursts forward
for a one-two touch to Sanglek.

1348
01:43:55,833 --> 01:43:57,666
Wow! It's a goal!

1349
01:43:57,750 --> 01:44:00,916
Thailand finally gives up a goal
to a wonderful strike.

1350
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,666
-Arvee are back in the game at 1-2.
-Damn it!

1351
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,666
Fifteen minutes to go,

1352
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:08,541
and Thailand have to pack
a strong defense.

1353
01:44:17,791 --> 01:44:20,250
He's provoking the fans.

1354
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,666
It's a foul taking off his shirt.

1355
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:24,791
Saman is shown a yellow card
for taking off his shirt.

1356
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:31,041
We must stay focused
and not lose our nerve.

1357
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:33,291
It's crucial to keep this scoreline.

1358
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:43,916
GO, THAILAND

1359
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:45,416
Thailand on the attack.

1360
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,666
Vitoon dribbles inside and blasts a shot.

1361
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:17,041
-Ouch!
-A clash!

1362
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:18,583
They are at it again.

1363
01:45:18,666 --> 01:45:20,791
A clash occurs
between Wernsawan and Namchoke.

1364
01:45:23,708 --> 01:45:24,958
What is going on?

1365
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:26,958
Is Wernsawan confused?

1366
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:29,041
-Wernsawen is hitting himself!
-What do you want from me?

1367
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:31,208
-What do you want?
-The referee is dumbstruck by his action.

1368
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:33,541
-How should he judge this?
-Tell me!

1369
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:34,541
What?

1370
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:47,833
Now there's substitution.

1371
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:51,791
Arvee is bringing in number 12,
Ngid, "The Clearance".

1372
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:53,500
Thailand has to be careful.

1373
01:45:53,583 --> 01:45:56,375
His "clearance shot"
once made the Koreans weep.

1374
01:45:56,458 --> 01:45:59,250
Taking Arvee through.

1375
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:04,750
Namchoke is tackled hard by Ngid!

1376
01:46:04,833 --> 01:46:07,583
That was harsh.
Might need to be substituted.

1377
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:09,541
Five minutes to go in regular time.

1378
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:14,958
Thailand has got another free kick
in scoring range!

1379
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:16,916
This is scoring range.

1380
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,125
-Need to take this one carefully.
-Interpreter.

1381
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:21,583
-What is the coach shouting?
-What?

1382
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:23,833
What is the coach shouting?

1383
01:46:30,041 --> 01:46:31,166
Charge the ball.

1384
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,708
He said to keep the ball in possession.

1385
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:35,875
Otherwise...

1386
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:37,708
Otherwise, they'll attack our counter.

1387
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:38,791
What?

1388
01:46:55,625 --> 01:46:57,166
Just look at me.

1389
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:00,041
Take a good look at me.

1390
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:03,458
It's an advantage ball for Arvee.

1391
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:05,500
The referee waves the play to continue.

1392
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:24,333
Saman is brought down in the penalty box!

1393
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:26,750
He might have taken a dive.

1394
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,458
But the referee said it was the penalty!

1395
01:47:29,833 --> 01:47:32,291
Thailand concede a penalty
in the last minutes of the match!

1396
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:36,916
No doubt this is our own fault.

1397
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It was really a foul.

1398
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:43,208
That's right. If Arvee level at 2-2,

1399
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:45,833
they will go through
due to the away-goal rule.

1400
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:50,291
This is because Thailand could score
only one goal in Arvee's home.

1401
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:53,708
The goddess of luck
is sitting on Arvee's side.

1402
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:01,208
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

1403
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:03,833
Sanglek.

1404
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:05,666
You take it.

1405
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,041
I'm scared.

1406
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:09,750
But I'm hurt.

1407
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:13,916
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

1408
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:39,958
Good afternoon, brothers and sisters
of Arvee.

1409
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:44,291
Our Arvee boys fought bravely
in the World Cup.

1410
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,125
First match.

1411
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:49,250
Defeated by France, 8-0.

1412
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,416
Second match.

1413
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:55,041
Defeated by Mexico, 5-0.

1414
01:49:55,916 --> 01:49:57,333
And in the last match,

1415
01:49:57,416 --> 01:50:01,000
beaten by Cameroon, 4-0.

1416
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:03,166
Altogether,

1417
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,583
we conceded 17 goals

1418
01:50:06,125 --> 01:50:08,125
and scored none.

1419
01:57:34,208 --> 01:57:36,208
