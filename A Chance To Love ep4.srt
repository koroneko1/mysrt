1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,680
Ae.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,560
What did you tell us what friends are for?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:04,780
Huh?

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,000
You like to help other people, right?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,420
Then why don’t you care about us?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,060
We are very worried about you.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,480
Where's the guy named Ae?

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,000
You're his friend?

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:20,840
No.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:23,620
Hey!

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,660
Are you here to mess with my friend?

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,200
If you’re here to mess with him, I’ll punch you in the face first.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,280
You’re all pathetic.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,460
Why?

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,040
Do you think someone like me doesn't have a girlfriend?

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,720
You should go back where you came from.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,260
Can!

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,480
Where were you? I called you but you didn’t pick up the phone.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,060
Hello.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,880
You are Can's friend?

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,360
I’m Lay.

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,920
I am Can’s sister.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,400
Sister?

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,080
Not girlfriend?

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,880
No!

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,480
Of course not!

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,980
Just sister.

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,180
A guy like him cannot find any girlfriend.

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,140
Give me that.

Lay.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,180
Let's go back home.

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,840
Just sit still.

53
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,680
Lay!

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,300
Be quiet!

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,960
Thank you for inviting us to lunch.

56
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,660
It's okay.

57
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,100
I've got time today.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,960
But you said you've got some errands to run.

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,960
There's still so much time left.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,600
Your name is Lay, right?

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,280
You can order anything you like.

62
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,060
Are you treating us?

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,360
Yes, feel free to order.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,240
Are you deceiving my little sister?

65
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,220
I will start to order then.

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,180
Sure.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,480
Excuse me.

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,820
Thank you.

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,700
Lay.

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,420
Why do you call Can...

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,720
Cantaloupe?

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,860
Well.

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,580
Can comes from...

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Ouch!

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Let's just ignore him.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,840
He's always acting crazy.

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,280
His name, Can, comes from Cantaloupe.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,500
And my name Lay, comes from Lemon.

79
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,440
Because when our mom was pregnant, she wanted to eat it.

80
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,620
That's nice.

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
How is that nice?

82
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,340
The name is too cute.

83
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,180
Not all mothers care enough to think of their children's names.

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,400
I want to go home now.

85
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,240
Lay won't stop talking about me.

86
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,920
This dude too.

87
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,800
Speak of the devil.

88
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,100
Why are you following me around?

89
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,900
I didn't follow you.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,620
I just want to go to the toilet.

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,900
Just go. It's over there.

92
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,420
Go!

93
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,540
There's big question mark on your face.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,520
Am I that obvious?

95
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,760
I just want to ask you a few questions.

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,160
Ask then.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,500
Well...

98
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,420
About what you said...

99
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,000
Not all mothers care enough to think of their children's names.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,180
What do you mean?

101
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,080
My name is Tin.

102
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,140
I know that.

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,060
Tin and your surname is something with Nan.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
But...

105
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,980
I just want to know why you said that.

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
My brother's name is Tul.

107
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,900
Tin and Tul.

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,900
Both of your names are much cooler than ours.

109
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,840
The reason that my mom gave me that name

110
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,020
is because she wanted it to match with my brother's.

111
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,380
She wants me to be good

112
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,320
and smart

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,620
like my brother.

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,820
I'm the son that she doesn't want.

115
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm just Tin

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,960
who will always live in my brother's shadow.

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,440
Tin...

118
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,700
I didn't know what you've been through.

120
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm curious because I saw you're making weird face.

121
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,140
You believe me?

122
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,360
What do you mean?

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,620
Just a little bit of acting, and you already fall for that?

124
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,500
You're stupid.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,940
You asshole!

126
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,360
I was worried about you. You're an asshole.

127
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,540
Thank you.

128
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,580
For what?

129
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
For worrying.

130
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,520
Who's worried?

131
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,360
That person must be crazy.

132
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,640
What if I tell you the truth.

133
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,380
Will you believe me?

134
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,960
I have to pee. I'll be right back.

135
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,000
Tin.

136
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,020
You're his good friend, right?

137
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes.

138
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,000
Can you look after him for me?

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,960
He is a little bit foolish and naive.

140
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,300
People often trick him.

141
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,820
Is it that often?

142
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,060
Very often.

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
When he was young,

144
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,400
he was fooled into believing that he would get an extra point

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,940
if he could open a girl's skirt.

146
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,360
Can believed that!

147
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,860
He opened my skirt.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,740
I was crying so hard back then.

149
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,580
That's not it.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,980
He was tricked to get rid of ant's nest.

151
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,460
He also went into a house because someone told him that the dog was abused.

152
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,300
He almost died.

153
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,420
Imagine a Thai Bangkaew dog attacking a ten-year-old kid.

154
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
I don't want to think about it anymore.

155
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,400
What did Can do then?

156
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,620
What can he do?

157
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,400
It doesn't matter how many times he got hurt.

158
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,540
He's always optimistic.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,060
He never gets angry at anyone.

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,280
He truly believes in his friends.

161
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,260
Why are you telling me all this?

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,580
Because you're smart.

163
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,820
I want you to teach him.

164
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
Thank you for telling me this.

165
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
Can I trust you?

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,480
Type, are you there already?

167
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,800
Wait for me. I'm coming.

168
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,180
Come on. Wait for me.

169
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,540
Alright.

170
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,320
What are you doing here?

171
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,340
Keng has been waiting for you for two hours already.

172
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,360
Techno.

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,260
Can I talk to you about...

174
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,000
that night?

175
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,300
Shut up! Technic is still here!

176
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Come on.

177
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,060
Brother.

178
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,220
Actually,

179
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,680
I know everything.

180
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,480
Huh?

181
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,140
I'm not joking.

182
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
But I don't want to interfere with this matter.

183
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,840
You two should talk.

184
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,120
Techno.

185
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,480
What can I do

186
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
for you to forgive me?

187
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,300
No...

188
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm not mad at you.

189
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
Then why are you avoiding me?

190
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm not avoiding you.

191
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,880
Techno.

192
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,320
I will do everything for you to forgive me.

193
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,700
I really like you.

194
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,080
Let's talk about that later.

195
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,920
Type is waiting for me.

196
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,840
I have to go now.

197
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,020
Techno!

198
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,440
My brother...

199
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
He's so good at running away.

200
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,520
He's avoiding you again.

201
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,640
I did wrong this time.

202
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
It's everyone's fault.

203
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,480
I sold my brother for free gifts.

204
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,020
Shit!

205
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,880
Why is he so handsome?

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,160
My damn heart, calm down. I will have a heart attack.

207
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,560
Give me more time, Kla.

208
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,940
I never thought of having a boyfriend before.

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,900
Shorty, wake up!

210
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,400
What the hell?

211
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,840
It's not time for sleeping.

212
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,980
It's so late already.

213
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,660
Usually, you wake up at 5 a.m.

214
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,060
Get up!

215
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,440
Shit!

216
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,880
I don't know anything.

217
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,780
I didn't see anything.

218
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,460
My two best friends are getting together?

219
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
Shorty.

220
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,920
Are you going crazy?

221
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,940
I understand if you want to have a boyfriend.

222
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,900
But I cannot accept the fact that...

223
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,720
Mai is your wife.

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,080
Pond!

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,860
What?

226
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,660
Are you crazy?

227
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,840
That's right.

228
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,140
I get it.

229
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,360
You have a new buddy now.

230
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,640
You already forget about your old friend.

231
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,500
Damn you.

232
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,340
Where are you taking me?

233
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,320
Just come.

234
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,960
I take you here to do something that is suitable for you.

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,160
Stop making a pit bull face.

236
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,840
Here it is.

237
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,700
You should join this.

238
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,380
What is it?

239
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,180
A volunteer camp?

240
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,340
That's right.

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,020
Instead of feeling sad.

242
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,140
You should do something more useful.

243
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,360
You should use your time thinking about your boyfriend

244
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
to do something that you're good at.

245
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,500
Register this.

246
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,640
It's better than overthinking.

247
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,060
Mai is amazing.

248
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,940
He doesn't study here,

249
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,860
but he knows about this camp.

250
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,360
It seems like you'll enjoy it though.

251
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,640
You told me that you want to go if you have a chance.

252
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,760
Ae.

253
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,400
Ae!

254
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,020
Are you listening?

255
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,540
Can you take a picture for me?

256
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,240
Huh?

257
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Since when do you like to take pictures?

258
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,140
Just take it.

259
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,020
Fine.

260
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,580
One. Two...

261
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,680
You're not going to smile or pose anything?

262
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
This is good enough.

263
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,960
Can you tell me what's going on?

264
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,540
You said I don't like to update about my life.

265
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,480
I want to try to do it.

266
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,100
It's better than doing nothing.

267
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,760
Ae.

268
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,080
I'm okay. Thanks.

269
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,140
Are you sure?

270
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,240
He doesn't look okay to me.

271
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,040
Thank you for dropping us off.

272
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,320
Lucky us that we don't have to carry heavy stuff back home.

273
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,540
It's me who carry everything. You didn't help me at all.

274
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,100
Lay, I'm your brother!

275
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,580
What are you laughing at?

276
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,940
I have to thank you anyway.

277
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,660
What about you?

278
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
What?

279
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,680
Did you forget something?

280
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,260
Forget what?

281
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,720
I came out of the house with just a phone and a wallet.

282
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,140
It's probably Lay who forgets it.

283
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,860
He asks you, did you forget to say thank you?

284
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,820
I will tell mom if you still behave like this.

285
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,940
Lay.

286
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,460
I'm your big brother.

287
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,400
What are you laughing at?

288
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,880
For you.

289
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,440
Thank you.

290
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,060
Lay.

291
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,000
We cannot accept things from strangers.

292
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,680
Mom also taught us that we can't be bought with money.

293
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,540
Who is the stranger?

294
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,300
He's your friend.

295
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,880
Your friend gives me this so I can accept it.

296
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,460
I will go inside first.

297
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:35,860
Okay.

298
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,620
What else do you want?

299
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,980
Did you forget something?

300
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,080
Do you want me to say it that much?

301
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:50,940
Okay.

302
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,500
Thank you so much.

303
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,820
Are you satisfied now?

304
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,380
I want it...

305
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,000
this way.

306
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,280
You're so much cuter than those girls.

307
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,920
He kissed me again!

308
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,260
Why...

309
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,180
Why do I feel this way?

310
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,180
It feels like

311
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,500
dragonflies in stomach.

312
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,980
I get it now.

313
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,300
This is how you solve it.

314
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,880
What's wrong with you?

315
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,120
He's stressed.

316
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,680
Then you should eat this. It will help to relieve stress.

317
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,100
Stop playing around.

318
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,880
You're not helping me to do the work at all.

319
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,560
Give it to me.

320
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,680
I'll eat it for you.

321
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,580
Come on, dude.

322
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,160
It's mine.

323
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,180
Seeing you enjoy eating can help me to relieve stress.

324
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,260
What makes you stressed?

325
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
About Ae.

326
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Just give him more time.

327
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,280
It seems like he doesn't have anyone beside him.

328
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,660
You should stop feeling sorry for him.

329
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,340
Why?

330
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,380
Because he still has us by his side.

331
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,860
Let's continue with our work.

332
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,040
We have to finish Ae's part too.

333
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,460
After we finish, we can go and look after him.

334
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,320
That's right.

335
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,680
What do we have to do again?

336
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,100
Pick it up.

337
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,820
Pick it.

338
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,120
Let's get it.

339
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,020
What?

340
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,920
Cheers!

341
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,060
Cheers!

342
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,520
Fight for Ae!

343
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,260
Fight for Ae.

344
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,180
Start working now.

345
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,360
Keen.

346
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,580
Hello.

347
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,380
What are you doing here?

348
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm here for a while already.

349
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
What's wrong?

350
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,240
Nothing.

351
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,740
It should be me who ask that.

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,500
It's like there's something going on in your mind.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,300
Is it about Tar?

354
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,660
No.

355
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Tar is doing fine.

356
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,300
He called me yesterday about his friends and study.

357
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,860
There's nothing to worry about.

358
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,900
I just feel like...

359
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,060
I don't have any inspiration these days.

360
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,880
Inspiration to write songs?

361
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,100
That's right.

362
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
I want to write a love song.

363
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
But...

364
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,480
I have no idea.

365
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,860
I don't know how to write a song but I have an idea.

366
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,760
Someone told me that

367
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,000
if you want to write a love song,

368
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,980
you must learn how to love first.

369
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,500
Who will love someone like me?

370
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,640
How can you know if you haven't looked around?

371
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,680
What do you mean?

372
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,940
Just forget about it.

373
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,740
Let's practice.

374
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,680
Okay.

375
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,560
Did you figure out how to play yet?

376
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,800
I did.

377
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,880
I added solo part into this.

378
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
You finally come back.

379
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,220
It's late already.

380
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,000
You should come back earlier.

381
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,940
You will make our parents worry.

382
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,420
You're just a student.

383
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,220
Are you done?

384
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,100
Why are you so against me?

385
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,540
I cannot say anything to you at all?

386
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,360
I don't need to listen to you.

387
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,380
You were always calling for me before.

388
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,920
I told you.

389
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,260
Stop pretending.

390
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,860
You can be a good son,

391
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,620
a perfect husband,

392
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,060
or a caring father.

393
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,180
But don't pretend that you're my brother.

394
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,500
He's long gone.

395
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,700
I'm sitting right here.

396
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,860
He's dead!

397
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,260
He's dead a long time ago, along with my stupidity.

398
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,340
I'm smarter now.

399
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,540
When will you take off your mask?

400
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,980
You can't do it, right?

401
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,460
Because if you do and people know the real you,

402
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,100
no one can stand you.

403
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,240
I'm off.

404
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,540
My little brother is too straightforward.

405
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,520
You can't stand to be with me either, right?

406
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,860
Gonhin.

407
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
Hin, where's Tul?

408
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,800
He goes to talk with the teacher.

409
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,060
I will wait for him here then. I want to see his face first.

410
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,560
He makes my day brighter with his handsome face.

411
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,240
Have you heard that Tul already has a girlfriend?

412
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,180
Is she the one that waited for him that day?

413
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,740
She is so pretty, but I hope they're not together. What a waste.

414
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,920
Hin, Tul already has a girlfriend?

415
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Well...

416
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,240
I...

417
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,480
Hi, girls.

418
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,420
What are you guys doing here?

419
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,620
We're here to chill in this room.

420
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,900
I thought you guys come to see me.

421
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,500
Well yes.

422
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
You probably know already that we're waiting here to see you.

423
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,500
I won't know that if you guys don't tell me.

424
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,260
You guys almost made me cry.

425
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,920
Hin, are you free?

426
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,640
I want to discuss with you about what the teacher just told me.

427
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,060
Will you excuse me? You guys can stay here.

428
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,940
I'll be right back.

429
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,480
Come.

430
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,780
Hin.

431
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,740
Look up and look into my eyes.

432
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,020
Look up!

433
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,320
Who made you cry?

434
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,780
No one.

435
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,440
You know that I hate it, right?

436
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,060
I hate it when someone makes you cry.

437
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,660
You can only cry because of me.

438
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,360
Do you understand?

439
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,560
Yes.

440
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,200
I belong to you.

441
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,460
That's right.

442
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,860
Remember that.

443
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,300
You belong to me.

444
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,860
You wouldn't get it when I give it to you.

445
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,620
Now you're dragging me all the way here to buy it.

446
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,980
It's you who drank all of mine.

447
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,120
Coming with me to buy it is the right thing to do.

448
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,940
It's you who drank all of them.

449
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,140
What are you talking about?

450
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,480
What did you do that makes you so hungry?

451
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,460
Well...

452
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,620
My heart was beating too fast because of Tin.

453
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,940
Huh? What did you say?

454
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Oh!

455
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,040
I was going to say that

456
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,280
you eat too much,

457
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,420
but you also talk a lot.

458
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,080
That's why you never get fat.

459
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,280
Of course not. It's because I stop eating junk food.

460
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,720
You should drink Jele. It's the best.

461
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,420
Easy to drink and it won't make you fat.

462
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,260
This one.

463
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,700
It helps you to grow.

464
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,700
You should drink a lot of this.

465
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,540
So you will be more mature.

466
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
It's yummy.

467
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,040
Lay!

468
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,380
Where are you?

469
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Lay!

470
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,320
Go home!

471
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,940
That's right. I have to hurry.

472
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,700
I'm late again!

473
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,160
Why didn't you wake me up?

474
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,020
Where's the motorcycle?

475
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,480
How come you're here?

476
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,040
When will you stop greeting me with that sentence?

477
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,180
Thank you for dropping me off.

478
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,280
You can leave now.

479
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,800
Why are you still here?

480
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,460
I told you.

481
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,460
I don't want just a simple 'thank you.'

482
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,860
I know what you're going to do.

483
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,040
This time, I won't let you kiss me.

484
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
You're teasing me.

485
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm not.

486
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,580
You are.

487
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
You kiss me because you want to make me lose my mind.

488
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,860
I won't let you do it for a second time.

489
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,900
I'm not teasing you.

490
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,680
Well...

491
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
What do you want?

492
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,800
Hit on you.

493
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,200
I never hit on anyone like you.

494
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,140
I don't know how.

495
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,240
But I will hit on you.

496
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,460
You

497
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,860
hit on

498
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,100
me...

499
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,940
You're hitting on me.

500
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,640
Hit on me...

501
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,760
If I tell you something,

502
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,620
will you believe me?

503
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,460
