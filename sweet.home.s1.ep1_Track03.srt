SEPTEMBER 2020

2
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:43,689
To your places.

3
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:45,900
Prepare to shoot.

4
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:48,235
Units in position.

5
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,570
Report, please.

6
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:55,409
Unidentified creature reported.
Stay on high alert.

7
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,312
-It's out, sir!
-Is it human?

8
00:01:23,395 --> 00:01:24,772
I can't tell, sir.

9
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,690
I can't see clearly because of the snow.

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,891
Moving in for closer visual.

11
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:08,941
It looks human!

12
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:15,698
Visibility is compromised.

13
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:17,575
Remain on standby
until visual is confirmed.

14
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:24,999
It keeps approaching, sir!
What should we do?

15
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:26,417
Units on standby at the bridge.

16
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:28,794
Standby to shoot.

17
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,672
Do not approach.

18
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,591
If you don't stop, we will shoot.

19
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:34,884
Alpha Team is ready, over.

20
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,469
Snipers in position.

21
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:39,847
Visual confirmed.

22
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,764
Ready to fire.

23
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:43,350
Fire!

24
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:21,639
Someone once said

25
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,683
that even the thickest darkness

26
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,311
disappears with the faintest light.

27
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,283
This is a story about us,

28
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,077
the ones trying to find

29
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,828
a reason to live

30
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:48,540
in a world where this is even harder

31
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,251
than merely surviving.

32
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,567
ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

33
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,686
AUGUST 2020

34
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,812
CANCEL THE REDEVELOPMENT

35
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:55,607
INELIGIBLE UNION MEMBERS HAVE NO SAY
IN GREEN HOME REDEVELOPMENT

36
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,236
PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO LIVE
GREEN HOME RESIDENTS

37
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,405
Oh, my goodness. That was close.

38
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,868
I don't know how that flew
all the way over there.

39
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:50,537
I'm sorry. This isn't my job,

40
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:52,623
but they said nobody else
could work on the weekend.

41
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:55,793
People here think security guards
are slaves or something…

42
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,004
Well, anyway…

43
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,047
Excuse me.

44
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,716
I haven't seen you before.

45
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,717
What brings you here?

46
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:06,637
I moved…

47
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,181
What? I can't hear you.
Can you speak louder?

48
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,350
I moved here.

49
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:12,893
Moved?

50
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:17,272
I heard somebody was moving
into Room 1410. I guess that's you.

51
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:18,232
Are you living alone?

52
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,651
Yes.

53
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:23,529
What? I can't hear you.

54
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:26,281
I'm living alone.

55
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:27,783
Right.

56
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,619
BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN
GREEN HOME MANAGEMENT OFFICE

57
00:06:58,313 --> 00:06:59,606
Should I just die?

58
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:31,138
Mister!

59
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,057
Oh, right.

60
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:36,185
You're always sleeping.

61
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:39,229
-Do you ever work?
-I'm sorry.

62
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:41,023
Take the bed out.

63
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,192
Pardon?

64
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:46,111
Someone made a complaint about the bed.

65
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,946
That bed is why you're not focused on work

66
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,032
and dozing off all day.

67
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:52,409
Well, but then how would I get any rest?

68
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,204
I'm telling you not to rest.

69
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,497
Got that?

70
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:59,166
Why can't he understand anything?

71
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:05,506
He's so loud and uncultured.

72
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,798
Oh, hello.

73
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:10,636
Don't mind him.
He just never learned any manners.

74
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:14,431
But you know, I used to live in Gangnam.

75
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,268
None of the security guards there
had beds in their offices.

76
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:19,895
Pardon?

77
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm just saying.

78
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:24,274
But what brings you here?

79
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:27,528
Oh, this. Someone sent me some fish.

80
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:29,780
But you know, I only eat yellow corvinas.

81
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:32,950
You can have these.

82
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:35,869
You really didn't have to.
Thank you so much.

83
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:38,789
You know the term
"noblesse oblige," right?

84
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,627
-Have a nice day.
-Right. Thank you, ma'am.

85
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,754
I'll enjoy these. Thank you!

86
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:44,790
Fucking hell.

87
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,168
Damn it.

88
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:56,718
Hey!

89
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:01,056
Was this you?

90
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,059
No.

91
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,730
Maybe it was the gangster guy.

92
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,899
Did you see who did it?

93
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:16,488
No.

94
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,330
Do you want one?

95
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,708
No.

96
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:32,629
Are you a loner?

97
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,223
I thought handsome guys
couldn't be loners.

98
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,935
Maybe you're just an asshole.

99
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:52,691
Don't die here.

100
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:59,156
You'll just cause trouble
for a lot of people here.

101
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,158
Find somewhere else to die.

102
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:19,426
What are you doing?

103
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:26,266
I asked you to come by the office,
but I guess you forgot.

104
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:28,393
You need to fill out
a registration document.

105
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:33,315
I'll go later.

106
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:48,705
I'm sorry about earlier.

107
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:50,916
Here.

108
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,045
All right.

109
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:17,484
Yes, Mom.

110
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,569
I'll go back if I fail this audition.

111
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,739
How many times do I have to tell you?
This is the last one.

112
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,991
Don't take back your word.

113
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,701
I'll get accepted for sure this time.

114
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:27,786
A sponsorship?

115
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:30,288
I'm not going to be a prostitute. Okay?

116
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:31,957
-Hello.
-Right.

117
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,209
I'm so hungry.

118
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,045
I'm doing all this to earn a living,
but I might starve to death.

119
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:42,634
What? Why am I suddenly
getting a nosebleed?

120
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:13,081
-What do you think?
-It sucks.

121
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:15,834
Are you really going to perform there?
Don't you have any pride?

122
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,544
Hey, my pride's not making me any money.

123
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,714
And they're paying me a lot.

124
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,009
I could sell my soul
for that kind of money.

125
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,220
Hey, I have to go to work. Bye.

126
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,337
I guess you just moved here.

127
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,340
Yes, I came just a week ago.

128
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:06,259
Sorry I didn't introduce
myself earlier. I'm in Room 1510.

129
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:07,719
It's nice to meet you.

130
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,764
Oh, dear! It's okay, Da-eun.

131
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,349
She's just a neighbor.

132
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:14,392
Sorry.

133
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,686
I guess I was a little loud.

134
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,775
I might have a lot to be sorry about
in the future, though.

135
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,444
It's all right.

136
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:27,656
How old is your baby?

137
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:32,035
My little princess is just one year old.

138
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,414
Hello!

139
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:40,835
Isn't she pretty?

140
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,634
Yes, she is.

141
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,398
Aren't you getting in?

142
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,274
Oh, I…

143
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,902
forgot my wallet at home.

144
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,952
I'll wait for you.

145
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:15,662
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

146
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:31,344
What's wrong with her?

147
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,472
It's all right. She's a kind person.

148
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,897
She lost her baby last year.

149
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:44,774
They say her stroller

150
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:47,110
rolled into the street
when she wasn't looking.

151
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,865
That's so sad.

152
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:00,665
God sometimes gives us hardships
that are hard to overcome.

153
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,460
But failing to overcome them

154
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:05,003
doesn't mean you should be criticized

155
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:08,173
or feared by others for it.

156
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,467
Yes. You're right.

157
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,593
Everything is God's will.

158
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:15,972
It's nice to meet you.

159
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,224
I'm Jung Jae-heon. I live in Room 1506.

160
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,107
Am I being overly friendly?

161
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,234
No, it's just that

162
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,237
my hand reeks of cigarettes.

163
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,239
Oh, all right.

164
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:34,699
I'm Yoon Ji-su.

165
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,290
I guess you play the guitar.

166
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:43,583
I play the bass.

167
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,126
Oh, right.

168
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:49,172
What do you do, then?

169
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:51,883
I'm a Korean language teacher.

170
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:58,556
I have a Bible because I'm going
to church today. Since it's Sunday.

171
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,184
-That's nice.
-Right.

172
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:03,686
THE HOLY BIBLE

173
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,024
I'm not a missionary or anything.

174
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,276
Right. I get it.

175
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,075
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

176
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:48,523
Don't come in.

177
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:54,988
-Your lesson fees.
-I already paid for them.

178
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,325
-Where did you get the money?
-I met a rich guy.

179
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:02,662
Tell me the truth.

180
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,749
If I tell you

181
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,126
would anything change?

182
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,171
Why are you so damn nosy?

183
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,302
I just yanked out the whiskers!

184
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:20,597
And then I skinned it with my knife.

185
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,891
Look. This is it.

186
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,226
You see this?

187
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,271
Did you catch this snake, too?

188
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,106
What are you talking about?
Oh, what's that?

189
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:32,275
It's a snake!

190
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,861
What are you doing?

191
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:38,114
-Hey!
-What? Is that a snake?

192
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:39,282
-What?
-Sir…

193
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:41,367
Oh, my gosh!

194
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:59,552
Hey! Get ready!

195
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,687
Why are you doing this to me?

196
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,233
I didn't do anything!

197
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,153
-Hey, this is dangerous.
-I don't know what it is,

198
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:18,988
but I'm sorry.

199
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:22,033
I won't report this.

200
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:25,870
I won't tell anyone about this.

201
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:38,007
Are you really going to leave?

202
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,552
Don't you remember?

203
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,638
When you were a fourth grader…

204
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:46,766
What? What is that?

205
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,826
Please don't kill me.

206
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:10,290
I'm trying.

207
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:52,665
CONGRATULATIONS!

208
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:55,376
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE A TESTER
FOR THE REMAKE OF LAST WORLD

209
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:00,214
COME TO THE FAN FESTIVAL
AT G-TOWER ON AUGUST 25TH

210
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,511
AUGUST

211
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:11,142
NAME OF EVENT

212
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:23,488
AUGUST 25TH, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

213
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:25,740
DO NOT ENTER

214
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:28,785
What is this?

215
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:04,779
Is he unemployed?

216
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:09,242
He does look like a gangster, though.

217
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:13,871
Do you even pay rent?

218
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:16,874
Go and ask questions at school.

219
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,424
I got kicked out

220
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,552
for setting the school on fire.

221
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:51,909
It's been a week since I moved here.

222
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,079
I've only eaten ramyeon,
so I don't feel well.

223
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,457
But that doesn't matter.

224
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,375
I'm going to kill myself anyway.

225
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,712
OPEN

226
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:07,091
This is so hard. I didn't lose any weight.

227
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,051
This is so irritating.

228
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,970
Hey, Kitty.

229
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:14,348
I'm starving, but you're eating
as much as you want.

230
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:18,895
Hello? Oh, hi!

231
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,608
Oh, it's all right. Maybe next time…

232
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,067
Drinks?

233
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:26,319
Yes, I enjoy drinking.

234
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,905
All right, call me anytime.

235
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:30,656
I KEEP HEARING THINGS
AND GETTING NOSEBLEEDS

236
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,367
Damn it. What do I do?

237
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:35,119
SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR?
IT'S REALLY SERIOUS.

238
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:38,789
Damn it…

239
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:49,467
WHAT THE HELL, WHO SAID TO LEAVE?

240
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,426
THAT PRICK EVEN MOVED

241
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,095
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS DIED

242
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:54,430
REST IN PEACE

243
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,766
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO SURVIVED

244
00:24:56,849 --> 00:24:58,100
FIGURES

245
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:02,438
DON'T DIE UNTIL WE ALLOW YOU TO

246
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:06,150
YOU PRICK

247
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:25,002
THE SECURITY GUARD WASN'T IN
SO I LEFT YOUR PACKAGE AT THE DOOR

248
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,463
RAMYEON

249
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,351
What the hell?

250
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,928
Hungry…

251
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:41,871
Excuse me.

252
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:43,080
Are you in?

253
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:45,499
Please help me.

254
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,960
I'm so scared. Please help me.

255
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:50,421
Is there nobody home?

256
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:55,051
Please. Help me.

257
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:57,678
Please.

258
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,556
Hello?

259
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,808
Please help me.

260
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:09,815
I'm scared.

261
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:21,035
Hello?

262
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:23,871
Are you okay?

263
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:28,000
You're home.

264
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:29,585
Did something happen?

265
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:32,672
I just came home,

266
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:34,590
and the door was open,

267
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:36,592
and it was a mess inside.

268
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,594
And my cat is gone.

269
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:41,222
The floor…

270
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,100
It was covered in blood.

271
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,646
Please, help me.

272
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,273
Okay, calm down.

273
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,527
I'll call the police.

274
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,952
Can't you stay with me?

275
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:11,293
What's going on?

276
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,797
Please…

277
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:19,510
Hang on.

278
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:21,887
Please, can you open the door?

279
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,348
I'm so scared.

280
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,059
Please, can you stay with me? Please?

281
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,061
Please.

282
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,647
Please open the door.

283
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,900
Open the door. Please.

284
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:38,195
Please open the door.

285
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,655
Well…

286
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:43,117
Can you show me your arms?

287
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,704
What?

288
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:48,664
Your arms.

289
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,459
Show me your arms.

290
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,419
What did you say?

291
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:55,588
Your arms.

292
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,716
Show me your arms.

293
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,678
I told you to open the door! Open it!

294
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:07,475
Open the door!

295
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:10,019
You asshole!

296
00:30:08,327 --> 00:30:09,453
It's blood.

297
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:13,040
There's a lot of blood.

298
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:17,545
Did you

299
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:19,964
see a weird woman just now?

300
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,727
Jeez.

301
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:37,147
I shouldn't have played so much.

302
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,441
Coming.

303
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,445
You must be pretty angry.

304
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:47,992
I'm sorry. I sometimes get
really inspired at night, so…

305
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:51,287
-I'm hungry.
-What?

306
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:55,207
Open the door!

307
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,626
Your face…

308
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,086
Did you hurt yourself?

309
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,631
I'll be quiet!

310
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:05,301
I told you I'm sorry.
You're being a bit harsh!

311
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:09,388
Open the door!

312
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:14,059
I'm hungry!

313
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:21,567
Damn it…

314
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:53,390
SPORTS MEDICINE
MATH

315
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:00,606
I'm going to work now.

316
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,983
Don't just eat ramyeon, okay?

317
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,360
BASTARD

318
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,903
Eat a proper meal, all right?

319
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,530
And if you're not home later,
I'm reporting you missing.

320
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:13,410
Just report me as dead.

321
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:14,912
You're smothering me as it is.

322
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:22,044
LEE EUN-HYEOK
KEEP OUT

323
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:29,051
UNDER MAINTENANCE

324
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:34,807
UNDER MAINTENANCE

325
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:51,240
Some woman was banging on the door,

326
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,075
and she had blood all over her face.

327
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,160
She seemed hurt, but she was so angry

328
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:56,996
and she was banging
on the door really hard…

329
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:05,462
You don't think she jumped, do you?

330
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:15,222
She wasn't just banging.

331
00:33:16,265 --> 00:33:17,599
She was ramming into the door.

332
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:35,576
Damn it. I'm late.

333
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:40,706
What's going on?

334
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,667
Where's the security guard?

335
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,044
My daughter hasn't come home yet.

336
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:47,337
Who lowered the shutters?

337
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,091
Excuse me.

338
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,719
Does your cell have service?

339
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,561
I guess not.

340
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:06,690
What's going on here?

341
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,944
-Did you just come down?
-Yes.

342
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:13,572
Didn't you see anything strange
on the way?

343
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,076
-Like what?
-Never mind.

344
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,535
I asked what's going on.

345
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:24,374
We're trying to find out.

346
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,878
The back doors and the parking lot doors
are locked as well.

347
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:35,219
Are you saying we're locked in?

348
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:38,972
Someone may have locked us in.

349
00:34:41,308 --> 00:34:42,267
Hey!

350
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,019
Hey!

351
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:48,232
-Hey!
-Honey, just wait.

352
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:50,359
-Isn't anyone inside?
-Honey…

353
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,319
Ma'am, we can't just sit around

354
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:54,446
and wait forever. This is so annoying.

355
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,366
These jerks are going to ruin
our business. Damn it.

356
00:34:57,449 --> 00:34:58,742
Honey…

357
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:00,786
I took photos

358
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:01,703
as evidence.

359
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,539
Is it still not open yet?

360
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:05,249
What…

361
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,751
Wait!

362
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:09,419
What are you doing?

363
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:11,213
Move if you're not going to help.

364
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:13,632
We'll have to pay to get the door fixed!

365
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:16,426
-Are you going to pay for it all?
-Excuse me.

366
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,720
Who's that? Hey! What the heck?

367
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:21,056
Oh, watch out!

368
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:25,769
Are you okay, sir?

369
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,771
Your hair.

370
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:33,986
That little jerk.

371
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,822
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

372
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,786
So they went home? I can't believe them…

373
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,289
Hello, this is Firefighter Seo Yi-kyung…

374
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:48,208
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

375
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,960
Please wait a moment.

376
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:54,715
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

377
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:56,925
-Please wait a moment.
-Landline phones must be working.

378
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:01,763
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

379
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:02,973
Please…

380
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,189
Did you just touch something?

381
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:13,108
Hey, you little…

382
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:14,610
I'm trying to open the doors!

383
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:17,029
-Put it back to how it was.
-Fine!

384
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:23,827
Maybe it wasn't that.

385
00:36:58,278 --> 00:36:59,947
Oh, whatever.

386
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,200
The employees will fix the phone tomorrow.

387
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,285
That's not the point
when we're locked in here.

388
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,913
Is that it?

389
00:37:14,002 --> 00:37:15,879
I found the switches!

390
00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:24,554
All right, now we're ready.

391
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:26,723
The shutters will go up now.
We found the switch.

392
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:27,724
-Come on.
-Let's go.

393
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:29,559
-Let's open it.
-Why were they down?

394
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:31,853
I don't know. But all we had to do
was press a button.

395
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:33,355
I guess we can go out now.

396
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:34,606
What's that?

397
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,735
Okay, raise the main door switch…

398
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:41,154
And press this.

399
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:51,623
What's wrong with that guy?

400
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:57,546
It's open, right?

401
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,756
You're all getting out thanks to me.

402
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,010
Is that blood on his mouth?

403
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:24,031
Put it back down.

404
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:31,330
Oh my god.

405
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:33,373
Lower the shutters!

406
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,081
Help…

407
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,219
Mister!

408
00:39:30,347 --> 00:39:31,681
Mister!

409
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:35,644
When I signal you, lower the shutters!

410
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:41,400
Okay!

411
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,820
Honey!

412
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:57,290
Mister!

413
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,919
Lower it!

414
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:03,380
MAIN DOORS

415
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:05,674
Now!

416
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,387
Hurry!

417
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:51,761
Hurry! Come on!

418
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,316
Thank you.

419
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:53,823
What was that?

420
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,202
It wasn't human.

421
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:43,707
Is it gone?

422
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,083
-I don't know.
-I guess it's gone.

423
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,251
Go slowly.

424
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,561
Hey.

425
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:05,770
I heard you're a firefighter.

426
00:43:05,854 --> 00:43:07,439
What's the government doing?

427
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:10,817
I'm sure they'll take care of things.

428
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,527
We're paying so much tax.

429
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:14,195
They can't even take care of one monster?

430
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:15,822
No.

431
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:18,992
It's not just one.

432
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,374
Protein!

433
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,262
What's going on?

434
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:24,057
I don't know.

435
00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:26,184
Maybe the world

436
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:29,312
is finally coming to an end.
