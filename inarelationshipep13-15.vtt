00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.960
Are you awake, sleepy head?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.160
I miss you already.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.280
Where are you?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.120
Didn't you promise not to go anywhere?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.080
Where have you been? Why didn't you text me?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.280
Sorry.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
I'm not feeling well today, so I didn't text you.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.600
Don't be sad.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.720
I'm sorry

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.120
It's okay.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.400
Just knowing that you're okay is enough.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
How are you feeling.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.400
I'm having headache and a little fever. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.560
I should get better after some sleep.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.560
Have some rest then. Get well soon.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.800
Boss..

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.200
You're sending this many stuffs?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.760
I'm worry about you so I sent you a lot of things.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.040
What is this?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.920
Mackeral chilli paste.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.480
My favourite.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.920
What is this clip?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.400
Play it. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.880
Can we stop being friend?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.880
I want to use the word love with you.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.640
Can you and I change to lover?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.560
Having meal at Siam Square One.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.040
Say good bye to the word friend and start loving each other.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.040
I'm very worry about you. Get well soon, so we can go eat together. 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.800
Boss...

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.840
You don't have to do this much.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.200
They say...

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.680
having good support will help recovering your mind and body.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.080
Get well soon.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.400
Okay.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.000
I want to say sorry again for disappearing like that.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.720
That's fine.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.040
I'll always wait for you.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.080
Such a dramatic person.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.760
I'll get some sleep now.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.560
Tono, just a second.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.600
I want to get a reward...

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.680
I carefully took of all fish bones for you.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.480
What reward?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.760
Close your eyes first.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.400
Hey, why are you teasing me like this?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.880
Who said that I will kiss you?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.520
Good bye.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.680
Let's unbox this package to see...

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.360
what has Tono sent me.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.240
Oh, it's a t-shirt.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.200
The meaning is so good.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.040
what i have with you,I don't want with anyone else.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.560
Do you know that no one ever drew me a picture before? 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.320
Here it is. I did it for you, is it beautiful?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.400
Yes, but the mouth looked like I was punced.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.680
Calm down, it still need a bit of blending.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320
I forgot.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.080
I need to add a double chin.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.640
There is a double chin at the space under my chin, but the space beside me...

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.760
is still empty.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.640
So I'm being with you every day, doesn't count, right?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.080
Hey, it's not like that.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920
I'm here with you.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.960
Thank you for the drawing.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.360
It's okay.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.640
I do it because I'm free.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.280
You drew me so pretty,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.840
If I'm not all the same as what seen in the photo,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.040
will you still like me?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.280
Why did you ask that?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.960
Just asking.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.480
If you want to know the answer,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.880
come to meet me quickly then.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.520
I have something for you,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.520
to thank you for the drawing.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.840
Wait a minute.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.040
So excited.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.240
Don't tease me.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.240
Plesse don't mock me if it doesn't sound good.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.080
Can you please stay with me for a long long time.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.600
I can't help but saying that I love you.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.880
Will you keep the love that I've given you?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.200
I only want to only be with you tonight.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.680
Wow, that's so good.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.440
Good but it will be better if you don't sing.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.440
Boss,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.680
when can we talk without the filter?

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.120
Oh, you noticed me? I see you were playing game.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.640
Um, I finished.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.880
Boss, seriously...

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.800
I feel that we barely know each other.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.360
Shall we get to know more about each other?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.000
Sure.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.720
Where should we start?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.000
I don't know.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:36.640
So, do you have picture when you were a kid or in school?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.360
Hm. I'll sent it to you.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.360
you went to this school?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.640
Yep.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.920
But it's not important, I was just a kid.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.840
What did you like to do when you were a kid?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.360
Just normal things like other kids.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.280
That's not fun at all.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.440
Here, look at my picture.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.120
Such a nerd.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.360
I may look like a nerd but I'm very into anime.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.560
Baki. Momotaro. Naruto. One piece.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.760
At night before bed, I liked to fight.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.440
I'd jump up and down alone so loudly that my dad yelled at me.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.400
That's so cute.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.440
That might be the last memory I have of my dad.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.920
My parents got divorce not so long after that.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.160
Until these days,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.200
I still never contacted him.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.320
That's okay.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.640
You have me right now.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.000
I'll be everything for you.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.160
I can be your dad too.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.440
Your dad, my ass.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.760
So, I told you about myself,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.640
do you have anything to tell me?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.840
Me?

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.440
Nattanon Ratri. That's a cool name.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.400
Why were you named Boss?

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.960
I used to be a fat boy who liked to give others order.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.040
So, I was named Boss.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.680
But I have sexy shape now, do you want to see?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.000
Pull it down.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.080
Or I'm hanging up.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.720
I was joking.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.240
We can get to know more, when we really meet.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.840
Do not rush.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.320
Hm, okay.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.400
I'll take a shower now. I'm feeling so sticky.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.200
Okay.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.520
What's up? How's your love life with your lover? How is it?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.000
What lover? There's nothing between me and him.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.400
I'm just joking, don't be so upset.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.600
Jade, I want to ask you something. It's so strange.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.440
I've known him for a long time but I barely know anything about him.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.840
So I'm not sure, if this relationship will work.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.760
Are you happy when you're with him?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.920
If you can fully be yourself, you can smile and laugh,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.360
isn't that enough?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
Yeah, I'm very happy.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.880
I am more happy everyday with him.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.080
That's why I want to know more about him.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.920
I feel like he is hiding something.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.760
There's something he doesn't want to tell me.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.000
Calm down. Don't overthink.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.000
Do you know his first name and last name?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.440
You should search that on Google?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.680
Hm, will it work?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.480
You've got nothing to lose.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.640
Okay, I'll try it.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.160
Who is he ?!?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.800
Jade, I need your help.
