1
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,291
I still remember

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,625
the first time
I had to be far away from home.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,416
It was a Sunday afternoon.

4
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,291
It felt both hectic and lonely.

5
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,041
It was the last day

6
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,958
of school break for the seventh graders,

7
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,958
like me and my friends.

8
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,458
It was like the last day of being free.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:12,250
The freedom that we enjoyed
during our vacation.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,083
Stop crying!

11
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,041
You didn't get any work done
during your vacation.

12
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,500
The one thing

13
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,375
we could never come to terms with

14
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,500
is...

15
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,458
How do you want it cut?

16
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,541
Crew cut.

17
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,458
The last day of school break.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,750
However,

19
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,291
some of us can't wait to go to school.

20
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,708
Because it means
being reunited with our friends.

21
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,958
Except for me.

22
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,041
Hey! Stop pressing the buttons!

23
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,958
KITROONGRUANG

24
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,291
Jaew, Pen, take good care of the house.

25
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,250
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,041
We could have let Ton

27
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,958
finish seventh grade
before transferring him to another school.

28
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,250
Moving suddenly

29
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,041
is a shock for me as well.

30
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,125
Can you stop talking about this subject?

31
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,666
Dad, is Ton's new school
in another province?

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,166
Yes, it's in Chonburi.

33
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,708
Where will he stay after school?

34
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,333
In the school dormitory.

35
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,125
They have everything there.

36
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,333
Remember, son,
a man must be able to live anywhere.

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,500
Are we almost there?

38
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,125
No, we have to cross
the Bangpakong River first.

39
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's make a wish, Tor.

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,875
If you hold your breath
as we cross the bridge,

41
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,000
whatever you wish for will come true.

42
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,083
Really?

43
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,000
But don't cheat. Hold your breath
until we have passed the bridge.

44
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,625
Ton, hold your breath too.

45
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,375
What did you wish for?

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,833
For Dad to send me
to boarding school with Ton.

47
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,916
What about you, Ton?

48
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:19,500
SAICHON WITTAYA SCHOOL

49
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,916
Tor, don't go too far.

50
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,958
STUDENT DORMITORY

51
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,750
Hello, ma'am.

52
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,041
My name is Pranee.

53
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,666
I'm the dorm supervisor
for junior high boys.

54
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,333
This must be Chatree.

55
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,958
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,208
Parents, please wait here.

57
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,333
Chatree, follow me.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,166
Don't dawdle.

59
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,125
Hey, it's a new kid.

60
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,208
Where's he from?

61
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,666
He seems like a troublemaker.

62
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,916
This is your bed.

63
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,083
Go and get your blanket.

64
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,083
Make sure

65
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,416
to make your bed every morning.

66
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,333
Every boy must take care of himself here.

67
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,291
No one will serve you or pamper you
like when you were at home.

68
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,666
Dad has written your name on everything.

69
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,208
CHATREE

70
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,041
Study hard and don't get into trouble.

71
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,750
Please keep an eye on him.

72
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:55,958
I will.

73
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't be so noisy!

74
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,416
Chatree, follow me.

75
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,000
Dinner is served at 6 p.m.

76
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,541
Everyone must eat on time.

77
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,666
This is your seat.

78
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,000
Sit down.

79
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm sending Ton
to a boarding school next semester.

80
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,541
Why is it so sudden?

81
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
Darling,

82
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,000
this new school has high standards
and a good reputation

83
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,916
unlike his current school.
The kids don't study hard enough.

84
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,333
Playing around and watching TV are
all they do before having exams.

85
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,166
But they still get good grades.

86
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,083
That means the school has low standards.

87
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,541
This is Chatree.

88
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,083
Your new classmate.

89
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,125
Chatree will board here and study with you

90
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,916
starting from this term.

91
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,500
Go take your seat.

92
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,833
CHATREE

93
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,166
Chatree, Master Peng is calling you.

94
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,750
My name's Peng.

95
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,291
That's Dr. Nui.

96
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,375
This idiot is Sarote.

97
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,166
That ass is Pok.

98
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,333
I'm Toei.

99
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,833
What's your name?

100
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,458
His name is Chatree.

101
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,208
Okay, Chatree.

102
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,208
Are you scared of ghosts?

103
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,250
Of course, why wouldn't he be?

104
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,625
I'm not asking you, idiot.

105
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,541
Are you scared of ghosts?

106
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,375
Good. As we've been here longer

107
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,583
we're going to tell you
the history of our school.

108
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,666
I just found out about this story.

109
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,958
I'm sure you guys haven't heard it.

110
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,041
A senior told me that

111
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,125
one of the cooks had a beautiful daughter.

112
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,250
She was the crush of every boy in school.

113
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,500
But one day,

114
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,833
she hung herself

115
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,833
from a Bodhi tree.

116
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:37,083
No one knew
why she suddenly killed herself.

117
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,875
When the police conducted an autopsy,

118
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,416
they discovered that she was

119
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,791
four months pregnant.

120
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,250
A pregnant ghost
is the nastiest kind around.

121
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,916
A group of senior boys

122
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,750
wanted to find out the truth.

123
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,541
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

124
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,125
What did they see?

125
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,500
No need to go to the Bodhi tree.

126
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,666
There are ghosts in the dorm.

127
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,625
Someone once saw an old man
walking around the dorms at night.

128
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,416
At first, no one knew who he was.

129
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,291
But when they looked into old yearbooks,

130
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,916
they found out that

131
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,166
he used to be the dorm supervisor.

132
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
You've got goosebumps, Master Peng.

133
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,708
Hey, bugger off.

134
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,166
Have you ever experienced

135
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,250
feeling like you're not alone

136
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,291
when you go to the toilet
in our dorm at night?

137
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,583
Keep this in mind.

138
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,125
Any night the dogs howl in unison,

139
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,916
you better stay away from the toilet.

140
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,458
Do you guys know

141
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,041
why our school had to build
a new swimming pool?

142
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,750
SCHOOL POOL RULES

143
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,625
Because a student drowned himself

144
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,125
in the old pool behind the school.

145
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,041
More importantly,

146
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,791
he was in seventh grade just like us.

147
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
Most importantly,

148
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,125
he used to board in this dorm.

149
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,875
They shut down the pool years ago.

150
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,958
A senior told me that

151
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,416
Ms. Pranee almost lost her mind.

152
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,666
Yes, that's when she became weird.

153
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,000
And she still hasn't recovered.

154
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,708
Do you know how weird she is?

155
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,791
Have you seen
the old record player in her office?

156
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,833
She likes to listen to
this creepy love song.

157
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,625
It gives me the creeps.

158
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,083
One day,

159
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,625
someone saw her

160
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,916
staring and crying at an open drawer.

161
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,375
To this day nobody knows

162
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,625
what the hell is in that drawer.

163
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,750
Maybe Doraemon's there.

164
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,791
Doraemon, my ass.

165
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,416
After a while,

166
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,083
you'll see for yourself, Chatree.

167
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,500
Maybe

168
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,375
Ms. Pranee had something to do with
the boy's death.

169
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,708
And that boy's ghost is a vicious one.

170
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
Anyone who slept in his bed

171
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,291
was kicked out of it every night.

172
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,416
Finally, they had to put
the bed in storage.

173
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,916
But...

174
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,916
I saw the janitor bring his bed out

175
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,583
from the storage room today.

176
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,333
Boys!

177
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,916
Bedtime is for sleeping.

178
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,750
Anyone who can't wake up tomorrow

179
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,708
will get whacked.

180
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,750
Hey, the new kid wet his bed!

181
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,416
The new kid wet his bed!

182
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
-Gosh.
-He wet his bed.

183
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,250
Look at him.

184
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,541
-The new kid wet his bed!
-Will it be washed?

185
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,375
If you hang it that way
it'll just fall to the ground.

186
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,625
The clothesline is a battle zone.

187
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,625
If you're going to make space
you have to be tricky.

188
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,916
And you only need one pair of
bathing shorts.

189
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,833
Or else every pair will get moldy.

190
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,500
VICHIEN CHAMCHONG

191
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,333
Do you guys smell something?

192
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,250
Not this.

193
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Not this, too.

194
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,666
I know. It reeks of his piss.

195
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,500
All the ghost stories
made you wet your pants.

196
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,166
Make fun of the new boy, everyone.

197
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,458
Pok, why are you laughing?
Your mouth stinks pretty bad as well.

198
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,625
Is it broken?

199
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,583
I don't know. Maybe I can fix it.

200
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,166
You know how to fix it?

201
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,125
I'm not sure, but I'll try.

202
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,041
Can I play with it

203
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,500
after you fix it?

204
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,125
Sure.

205
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,833
Chatree, you have a phone call.

206
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,541
It's your dad.

207
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,708
Chatree Ananpitisook,

208
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,041
your father is on the dormitory phone.

209
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,833
Chatree Ananpitisook,

210
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,666
your father is on the dormitory phone.

211
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,208
I bought some snacks for you.

212
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,166
Don't you dare do this again.

213
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,291
If you get bad grades this semester,
I'll really punish you.

214
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,208
Chatree isn't here right now.

215
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,083
Would you like to leave a message?

216
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:44,083
No, that's okay.
I'll call back another day.

217
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,833
Thank you.

218
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,083
Hey, who's there?

219
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,708
Open the door!

220
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,833
Asshole, just wait until I get out!

221
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,333
Open the door!

222
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,458
That was awesome.

223
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,750
Just a few ghost tales,
and he peed his pants.

224
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,583
What a sucker!

225
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,250
Open the door!

226
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,791
Hey!

227
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,916
You woke up late?

228
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,250
Yes.

229
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,375
You're really curious about
Ms. Pranee, aren't you?

230
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,208
You better watch out.

231
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,916
I know.

232
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,208
Do you know why Ms. Pranee is so weird?

233
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,125
There are lots of theories.

234
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,291
Worst of all are the ghost stories.

235
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:38,041
They're not true.

236
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,958
You've been here for a long time?

237
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,833
Why did you ask?

238
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,375
It's just that

239
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,083
you seem to know everything.

240
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,208
Of course, I do!

241
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:54,333
Don't you know I'm Vichien
"Know-it-all" Chamchong?

242
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,541
Take a bath quickly.

243
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,958
Ms. Pranee is coming down.

244
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,208
Before we go down for breakfast,

245
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,583
I have something to say.

246
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,041
This is a school, not a graveyard.

247
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,125
I want you to stop telling ghost stories
to scare each other.

248
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:27,166
If I catch anyone
engaging in such nonsense,

249
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,541
that person will be punished.

250
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,833
Hey, Chatree!

251
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,166
Wait up!

252
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,541
What are you daydreaming about?

253
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,083
Have you ever snuck out of school?

254
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,791
Where to?

255
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,458
Home.

256
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,583
Why would I do that?
School is more fun than at home.

257
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,875
No parents to tell you what to do.

258
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:04,958
Like hell, it is!

259
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,708
It's hard at first,
but you'll get used to it.

260
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,875
No, I won't.

261
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:19,791
Do you see what I see?

262
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,041
Geese?

263
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,833
Look again.

264
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,791
Those are goose eggs!

265
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,375
Hold it.

266
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,750
Geese are really protective of their eggs.

267
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,666
There's only one way

268
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,958
to get their eggs.

269
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,041
Hurry up, man.

270
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,000
Hurry up!

271
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:01,750
Hurry up!

272
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Hurry up!

273
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:16,666
I got them!

274
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,666
Chatree.

275
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,083
Your father's on the phone.

276
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,458
Hold on, please.

277
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,500
Okay.

278
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,583
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

279
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:23,125
Chatree, grab a seat for us
in the courtyard after dinner.

280
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,458
There's an outdoor cinema tonight.

281
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,333
Have you watched Hungry Ghost 1, 2, and 3?

282
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,041
-I have.
-Me, too.

283
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,125
I've watched them all.
Part two is the best.

284
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,833
HUNGRY GHOST 4

285
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:39,708
Part one had the female ghost.
Part two had the child ghost, right?

286
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,708
You've got it wrong.

287
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,125
Part three had the female ghost.
Part one had the child ghost.

288
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,125
No, part two was the girl,
and part three was the kid.

289
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,041
-Wrong.
-I told you part three was the girl.

290
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,208
Part one had the female ghost.
Part two had the child ghost.

291
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,458
Part three had the female ghost.
Part one had the child ghost.

292
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,291
Baby, you're so beautiful today.

293
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,625
-Hey!
-Yes, sir?

294
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,958
Where have you been?

295
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,541
Here, swallow this pubic hair.

296
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,833
What?

297
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:15,208
And chant the eight points of this prayer
to exact revenge on your enemy.

298
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,083
It's so frizzy.

299
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,791
-Can I eat your two buns?
-What?

300
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,750
May the force be with me.

301
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,625
It might work.

302
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,083
Go insane.

303
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,125
Go insane.

304
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,291
-Wait.
-You...

305
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,458
Why did I slap my face?

306
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:40,875
What? Here comes
the important part, master.

307
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,208
-Sir...
-My hands...

308
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,500
They're moving on their own.

309
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,041
Baby!

310
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,208
-That's right.
-Hey, hold it!

311
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,166
-I didn't mean to--
-You pervert!

312
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,500
Hey, let's go sit
with Tay and his friends.

313
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:09,916
How did I get here?

314
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,416
The mantra has been loose.
The ghost is free!

315
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,291
He's following me.

316
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,583
Help me.

317
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,333
Help me!

318
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,208
Hey! He's grabbing my leg!

319
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,041
Don't trust me, you idiot!

320
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,583
I'm coming for you.

321
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,916
I'm leaving now.

322
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,708
How about this?

323
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:48,291
Open the freaking door!

324
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,125
He's still here.

325
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
-Let's move.
-He's coming.

326
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,125
-Stop.
-It's his treasure.

327
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,458
I only have one!

328
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,458
No, don't bite it!

329
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,458
Stop! Help me!

330
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,333
-Help me!
-I'll help you.

331
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,250
Don't pass out. How can you do this?

332
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,958
You can't do this to me.

333
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:19,958
Master.

334
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,500
-Master, wake up.
-He's coming.

335
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,541
-Don't!
-We're not going to make it.

336
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,375
Everyone, hold your breath.

337
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,708
Hey.

338
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,541
Where have you been?

339
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,416
Are you also scared of me?

340
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,750
Like I told you,

341
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,458
I saw a ghost.

342
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,416
I swear.

343
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,583
It looked...

344
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,083
He looked like us.

345
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,041
Sure.

346
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,125
Now you have ghost stories to share.

347
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,750
Don't forget Ms. Pranee's warning

348
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,750
that telling ghost stories
will get you punished.

349
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,541
Do you want to be punished?

350
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:58,416
Can you still see the ghost right now?

351
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,083
I haven't seen him

352
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,458
since I moved to a different seat.

353
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,583
Do you guys think

354
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,166
it's the kid who drowned in the pool?

355
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,291
Maybe

356
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,541
he's looking for a friend.

357
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,833
Dr. Nui, how can you believe him?

358
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,416
Are you delirious?

359
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,625
You should get some rest
until your fever subsides.

360
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,500
I bet he will wet his bed again tonight.

361
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:13,208
Chatree.

362
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,708
Daydreaming again?

363
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,208
Have you finished your homework?

364
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:20,541
Yes, sir.

365
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,166
Then study your textbook.

366
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes, sir.

367
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,208
Chatree Ananpitisook,

368
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,250
your father is on the phone.

369
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:54,625
Chatree.

370
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:03,708
Your father called to say that
he can't pick you up this weekend.

371
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,875
-Shoot!
-Yes!

372
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,750
Watch out!

373
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:27,250
It has been fixed. Do you want it?

374
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:43,458
You know, we have something in common.

375
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,083
We are invisible to others.

376
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,416
Go ahead.

377
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,500
I don't know how to play.

378
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:11,666
You don't know how to play?

379
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,083
I'll show you how.

380
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,875
You need to avoid this guy.

381
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,916
Turn right. Go down.

382
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:19,916
Turn left.

383
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,791
Master Peng.

384
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,125
What?

385
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:31,500
What's up?

386
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,625
Who is Chatree talking to?

387
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,750
Here, you need to avoid these guys.

388
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,375
Understood?

389
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,375
Shit! He has lost his mind.

390
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,875
What's strange about that?
I talk to myself all the time.

391
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,000
Isn't your dad picking you up?

392
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,041
No, I'm not going home this weekend.

393
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,375
When will your dad come to pick you up?

394
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,791
He stopped to make a delivery first.

395
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,625
He is on his way.

396
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,958
Well...

397
00:50:15,708 --> 00:50:19,708
Can you still see the ghost?

398
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,041
Why did you ask?

399
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,541
I want to see it too.

400
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,750
Let me know if you see it again.

401
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,541
I like this stuff.

402
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,458
My dad's here.

403
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:56,833
UTAIN COFFIN

404
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:57,875
See you later.

405
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,166
Hey, what's this button for?

406
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,375
-This one.
-What a noob.

407
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,291
I'll show you how it's done.

408
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:15,500
Walk. Jump.

409
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,708
Jump.

410
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,000
You lost.

411
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,250
Remember the night you wet your bed?

412
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,416
Are you making fun of me?

413
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,125
No. I have something to confess.

414
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,625
Are you ready?

415
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,625
You were the one who spooked me, Vichien!

416
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,166
What the heck?

417
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,416
I didn't mean to.
You went to the toilet by yourself.

418
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,041
May I have more dessert, please?

419
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,458
May I have more dessert, please?

420
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,666
May I have more dessert, please?

421
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,208
Is something wrong with the food?

422
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,958
-May I have more dessert, please?
-May I have more dessert, please?

423
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:18,833
May I have more dessert, please?

424
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,916
-No, it's good.
-I have finished my dessert.

425
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,000
Pretty lady,
may I have more dessert, please?

426
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:29,166
Eat more, so you can grow up fast.

427
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,250
All gone.

428
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:40,958
Are you tired?

429
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,708
Mom, I have to go
and rehearse for Sports Day at school.

430
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:44,750
All right.

431
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:46,416
-I'm off then.
-Okay.

432
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:47,875
Hey.

433
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,208
She's mine, okay?

434
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:00,958
Why did you bring me here?

435
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:04,125
You said you wanted
to grow up quickly, right?

436
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,791
This is my treasure trove.

437
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:32,500
The illustrated guide
to becoming a manly man.

438
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,875
Why was he called in?

439
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,791
PLAYBOY FOR STUDENTS 2

440
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,916
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

441
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,041
I bet she's going to lash him
black and blue.

442
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,875
I think a stickler like Ms. Pranee

443
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,500
put him on her blacklist
and called his parents.

444
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,333
This happens every year.

445
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:27,083
Don't do this again, understood?

446
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:29,791
You can leave now.

447
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,708
Guys, he's out.

448
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,041
-Hey, what happened?
-Are you all right?

449
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,958
She didn't punish me or anything.

450
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,166
-What?
-What?

451
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:43,333
How come?

452
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,541
How long has Ms. Pranee
been teaching here?

453
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,333
A long time.

454
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,333
Even before I attended this school.

455
00:55:53,916 --> 00:55:55,041
Why did you ask?

456
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:56,500
Nothing.

457
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,875
Wait.

458
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,833
Are you sure there's a way out
around here?

459
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,250
Just follow me, all right?

460
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,208
Hey, are you sure about this?

461
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:02,833
Hey.

462
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:04,416
How did you get here?

463
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:08,333
-Namtarn, can I take a picture with you?
-Sure.

464
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,500
One, two, three.

465
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:15,208
Thank you.

466
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,500
Do you want to take a picture?

467
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,500
Can you hold my baton?

468
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:59,291
Okay, I'm ready.

469
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,250
Big smile, okay?

470
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,500
Your cheeks look like
they're going to burst.

471
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:09,083
Okay, one, two, three.

472
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:26,291
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

473
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,541
How did you die?

474
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,833
I died of old age.

475
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,416
I'm serious, you idiot.

476
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,833
Wait a minute. I have to pee.

477
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:00,666
Do you want to know

478
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:03,416
why I have been sent here
during the second semester?

479
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:08,458
Shit. It's already 6 p.m.

480
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,208
Let's hurry back.

481
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,291
Vichien, wait up!

482
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,208
Chatree Ananpitisook,

483
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,708
your father's waiting at the dormitory.

484
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,208
Pen, follow me downstairs.

485
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,500
Don't worry. Everyone's asleep

486
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,625
Where have you been?

487
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,125
What have you been up to?

488
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,208
Why did you do this?

489
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,250
Why didn't you tell me anything.
Don't do this again.

490
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:38,000
Did you hear me? Don't do this ever again!
Be a good boy.

491
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,875
Chatree,
Ms. Pranee asked me to bring this to you!

492
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,958
Here, your father left this for you.

493
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,041
Where did you go? Your dad was here.

494
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,375
What about you?
Where the heck have you been?

495
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,708
You said you're invisible to other people.

496
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,541
What about you?

497
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,250
Do you care about
anyone else but yourself?

498
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:31,958
Hey.

499
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,375
If you've got something good,
you should share it with us.

500
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,458
Why would I do that?

501
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:40,375
Come on.

502
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:42,500
We're friends.

503
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:45,750
Friends always
share things with friends, right?

504
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,541
Let's make up, all right?

505
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:05,458
MEN'S DESIRE

506
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:07,166
VICHAI

507
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:09,916
I bet the new boy's a faggot.

508
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:11,708
What?

509
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,791
I don't know. He seems like a fairy.

510
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:19,125
Maybe

511
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,916
that porn magazine
has many naked men photos.

512
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,708
That's why he won't share it with us.

513
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,166
No wonder

514
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:27,208
Ms. Pranee let him off so easily.

515
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,291
And kept the magazine for herself.

516
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,583
Pok, lend me your sima lotion.

517
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,375
I'm getting a rash again.

518
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:38,916
Here.

519
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,166
Damn! Do you have big balls
like a dinosaur?

520
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,958
How come it's all gone?

521
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,875
Nui, do you have any?

522
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,916
No, but I have formalin. Do you want some?

523
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:54,541
Save it for your dad!

524
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:01,875
Do you want it?

525
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:06,833
Yes, thanks.

526
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,541
Hold on.

527
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,708
Do you have any sima lotion?

528
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,416
POL. CAPT. VICHAI CHAMCHONG
SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR CORRUPTION

529
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,916
FAMILY PLEADS FOR MERCY FROM THE JUDGE

530
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:47,458
POL. CAPT. VICHAI CHAMCHONG SHOCKED
KNOWING HE'S GOING TO JAIL FOR 25 YEARS

531
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:49,166
RESULTING TO BAD HEALTH

532
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,291
Chatree, your mom's on the phone.

533
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,250
Mom?

534
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,416
Ton, it's me, Dad.

535
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,583
Ton.

536
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:12,375
Pen no longer stays at our house.

537
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:20,375
Why didn't you pick up the phone
when I called?

538
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,750
If you think that I sent you away
because of Pen

539
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,875
then you misunderstood.

540
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:43,958
Well...

541
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,000
Do you like your new school?

542
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:31,333
STUDENT DORMITORY

543
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:18,625
VICHIEN

544
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,791
You have to stay here every night

545
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:01,791
because I'm sleeping in your bed, right?

546
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:22,583
Hurry up, but don't take a picture.

547
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,958
-Hurry up.
-That's enough.

548
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:26,416
-What's wrong with him?
-Did he faint?

549
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,083
No, I think he sniffed the ether
used to knock out the rabbits.

550
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,041
-Hey.
-What should we do?

551
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,458
-He is unconscious.
-What's happening?

552
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:34,291
Don't crowd him. Back off, boys.

553
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:39,541
Chalermphol, how many times
have I told you not to sniff ether?

554
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,333
-He's regaining consciousness.
-He's still alive.

555
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:44,708
-He woke up.
-He's still alive.

556
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:47,500
It's like I died and came back to life.

557
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,583
Don't exaggerate.
You were only out for a few seconds.

558
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:53,791
But I really felt like I died.

559
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,500
And I had trouble breathing.

560
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,458
And everything was dark.

561
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,916
And I saw...

562
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,416
That's so insane.

563
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,000
If anyone wants to know

564
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:11,583
what lies beyond death,

565
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:13,625
feel free to consult me.

566
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:16,916
Stop it, you fatty.
I don't give any shit about your stuff.

567
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,500
Gosh, I'm starving now.

568
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:21,666
Let's go. I'm starving.

569
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:13,708
Shit!

570
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,791
Vichien, Don't jump!

571
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,666
Now you know

572
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,375
how I died.

573
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,458
Why did you drown yourself?

574
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:56,666
Who said I drowned myself?

575
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:01,083
It's stupider than that.

576
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:05,916
That day,

577
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,041
we didn't want to stop swimming.

578
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:11,958
It was getting dark.

579
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:18,958
Help...

580
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,125
Help me!

581
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,625
Guys, Jira is drowning.

582
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:38,666
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

583
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,041
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

584
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:44,083
-Idiots! I fooled you!
-Where is he?

585
01:19:44,166 --> 01:19:45,291
You were faking it?

586
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,291
Gosh!

587
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:04,791
Have you done your homework already?

588
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,583
I forgot. It's due first period too.

589
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:12,666
-Help me.
-Which subject?

590
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,625
Get up.

591
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,666
-Vichien is drowning.
-Help me!

592
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:17,375
Help me!

593
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:21,416
Hey.

594
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,041
-Go ahead and save him.
-Help me!

595
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,750
But he could be faking it.

596
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:29,250
Help me!

597
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,208
Help me!

598
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,541
We all know the trick.
No one is going to believe you.

599
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,000
Hey, it's 6 p.m.
Let's go back to our dorm.

600
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,375
-Let's go.
-All right.

601
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,291
I'm leaving now.

602
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:33,125
How come

603
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,041
they say that

604
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,916
Ms. Pranee was related to your death?

605
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:44,708
You read that newspaper, right?

606
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:52,958
POL. CAPT. VICHAI CHAMCHONG
SENTENCED TO PRISON

607
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,500
It's about my father.

608
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,958
Ms. Pranee didn't want me to find out.

609
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:04,125
Vichien!

610
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:06,458
What are you doing?

611
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,166
Who gave you permission to enter here?

612
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:13,750
Come here. Why did you do this?

613
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:16,166
I'll hit you until I break my hand.

614
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,208
You can't do this!

615
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:26,916
I just wanted to read the news
about my father.

616
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,416
Unfortunately,

617
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:35,166
Ms. Pranee caught me.

618
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,958
Ms. Pranee,
Vichien hasn't returned to the dorm yet.

619
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,916
Before my accident,

620
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:20,833
I managed to sneak back in
to steal the newspaper.

621
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,833
What?

622
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,791
Ever since then,

623
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,500
Ms. Pranee has thought that

624
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,083
my death

625
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:38,166
was her fault.

626
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:56,416
Why do you have to drown yourself

627
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,708
over and over again like this?

628
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:02,125
I don't know.

629
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,583
How much longer

630
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,250
will you be stuck like this?

631
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,083
I don't know that either.

632
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:12,875
But it's really cold

633
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,458
at the bottom of the pool.

634
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,375
See? I told you.

635
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:53,541
It must be the boy
who drowned in the pool.

636
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:59,416
I've seen ghosts like this before.

637
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,083
At my old house...

638
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,000
UTAIN COFFIN

639
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:07,375
a motorcycle crashed
rounding the corner one night.

640
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:17,375
The driver died instantly.

641
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:20,583
After that,

642
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,958
I would hear the same motorbike

643
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,041
skid around the corner almost every night.

644
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:04,708
As if

645
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:07,583
the spirit hadn't been reborn yet,

646
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,416
so it had to re-enact its death

647
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:13,625
over and over.

648
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,416
What then?

649
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,000
We moved the heck out of there.

650
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:40,791
No. How do we help the spirits get reborn

651
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:42,375
so they stop re-enacting their own deaths?

652
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,375
Ghosts and humans

653
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,916
live in separate worlds.

654
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:51,500
To help a ghost, you must be a ghost.

655
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,458
To be a ghost, you have to die first.

656
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,208
Unless you can split your spirit
from your body.

657
01:26:58,208 --> 01:26:59,291
Do you want to try?

658
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:08,833
Are you crazy?

659
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:11,208
Why would you want to die?

660
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,041
Ton,

661
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,666
promise me that you won't do it.

662
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,291
Can you promise me that?

663
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,333
Dr. Nui, what the hell are you looking at?

664
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:37,166
Something's wrong with Chatree.

665
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,958
He seems strange.

666
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:41,958
What the heck?
The other day, you said he wasn't strange.

667
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:43,750
I know.

668
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,291
But today, he seems strange.

669
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:52,208
Maybe he's going to jump off the building.

670
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:56,166
How the hell
can he jump through the grille?

671
01:29:05,333 --> 01:29:06,875
Can you see that water tank?

672
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:11,041
I had climbed to the top before.

673
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:13,583
The view is even better from up there.

674
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:18,750
I'll take you there someday.

675
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,083
Chatree

676
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:48,500
has disappeared.

677
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:02,666
Playing during dinner again?

678
01:30:03,166 --> 01:30:05,583
I'll teach you a lesson with this stick.

679
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:44,791
-Chatree.
-Chatree.

680
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,208
Chatree, what's wrong?

681
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:50,750
-Chatree.
-What's wrong with him?

682
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,666
-Chatree.
-Are you okay?

683
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,375
TOO MUCH INHALATION IS DANGEROUS

684
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,833
He killed himself, right?

685
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:01,833
-No.
-Don't die, Chatree.

686
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,958
I think he split his spirit from his body.

687
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,416
What are you talking about?
Splitting spirits from what?

688
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:08,666
He told me

689
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:12,041
he wanted to help his friend
that drowned in the pool.

690
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:15,750
I cluelessly suggested he could do that
if he splits his spirit from his body.

691
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:31,458
Trust me.
We have to take him to the old pool.

692
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,916
Ms. Pranee, Chatree killed himself.

693
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,833
What?

694
01:32:11,416 --> 01:32:13,208
-Vichien is drowning.
-Help me!

695
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,166
Help me.

696
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:58,250
Here.

697
01:32:58,875 --> 01:32:59,833
What's that for?

698
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,041
Why are you so stupid?

699
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,708
What do we do now?

700
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:39,000
You said you're invisible to other people.

701
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:40,750
What about you?

702
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:42,750
Do you care about
anyone else but yourself?

703
01:33:52,666 --> 01:33:54,791
Hey, let me out!

704
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,958
Are you still mad at your friends
for not saving you from drowning?

705
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:44,958
No, I'm not mad anymore.

706
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:48,625
What about you?

707
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,833
Do you still want to run away from school?

708
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,083
No, not anymore.

709
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:56,583
If I did,
I would run straight to Namtarn's embrace.

710
01:34:57,791 --> 01:35:00,291
I know what you're thinking.

711
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,583
Don't get me started!
I saw the way you looked at her, too.

712
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:04,625
I've had my heart set on her for years.

713
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,583
When will we visit her again?

714
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:18,041
Ton.

715
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:26,666
I've got to leave now.

716
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:31,583
Hey, Chatree woke up!

717
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,083
Chatree woke up!

718
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:36,125
-Chatree.
-How are you, Chatree?

719
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,875
-How are you, Chatree?
-Are you okay?

720
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,791
Are you okay?

721
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:44,875
-You're fine now.
-Hey.

722
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:45,833
He woke up.

723
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:50,166
Ms. Pranee, Chatree is fine now.

724
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:33,291
CHATREE

725
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:43,583
I never knew our school was this big.

726
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:47,708
Why are you so amazed
by the size of our school?

727
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:52,708
I know from experience. Ms. Pranee
made me run around the school before.

728
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:54,750
That's awesome.
I'm even having goosebumps!

729
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:57,125
Do you want to fall down there?

730
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:59,541
Take it easy.

731
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:01,166
I won't tease you again.

732
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,458
Ton.

733
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:09,291
Why didn't you tell Ms. Pranee
the truth about Vichien?

734
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,041
Right. You made us all get punished.

735
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,166
I don't think she would believe me.

736
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,041
But

737
01:38:22,333 --> 01:38:24,333
we all really believe you.

738
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:27,958
If you happen to see another ghost,

739
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,666
feel free to consult me, okay?

740
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,333
But don't consult me, okay?

741
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:37,083
Let me be the first one
to consult you then, Dr, Nui.

742
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:40,083
Why the heck do you speak with a lisp?

743
01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:51,750
Chatree Ananpitisook,

744
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,291
please meet your parents in the dorm.

745
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:57,166
Chatree Ananpitisook,

746
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,916
please meet your parents in the dorm.

747
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:02,625
I'm leaving now!

748
01:39:05,291 --> 01:39:06,791
See you guys next year.

749
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:09,125
-Damn.
-Damn.

750
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,458
Good luck, man.

751
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:12,791
-See you.
-Good luck.

752
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,875
Ton, I want to see the swimming pool.

753
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:32,875
Be patient, Tor.
Let him pack his things first.

754
01:39:32,958 --> 01:39:35,208
-Okay, but then can we see it?
-Yes.

755
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:42,333
Have you been eating enough food?

756
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:45,791
You've gotten darker.

757
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:47,333
You lost weight as well.

758
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,500
You've been playing outside
too much, haven't you?

759
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:54,750
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

760
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,125
Why?

761
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:00,333
When you're older,
I won't get to hug you anymore.

762
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,833
Tor, stay around here.

763
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,166
Let's get your bags, dear.

764
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:33,166
Dad.

765
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:37,666
I like this school.

766
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:12,625
Ms. Pranee.

767
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:22,083
Vichien didn't kill himself.

768
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,541
His drowning

769
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:30,208
was really an accident.

770
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:40,708
Vichien asked me to apologize

771
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:44,333
for breaking your record player that day.

772
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,500
He knows that

773
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,708
you were concerned about him.

774
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,208
Thank you, Ms. Pranee,

775
01:42:08,666 --> 01:42:10,208
for always taking care of us.

776
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:13,791
Goodbye.

777
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:01,875
I still remember the first day
my father took me home.

778
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:09,166
It was a Friday afternoon,
and everything seemed normal.

779
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:13,500
But one thing that had changed was me.

780
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:18,625
I was two centimeters taller.

781
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,750
It will take a while
before I become a teenager.

782
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,208
Being friends with Vichien

783
01:43:26,541 --> 01:43:28,625
has taught me many things.

784
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,208
I couldn't tell

785
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,750
if there would be other fun things
happening in the next semester or not.

786
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:55,958
But I could tell that
I wanted to see my friends again

787
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,500
because I learned that

788
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:01,125
if we have one good friend
who sticks by our side,

789
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:04,208
the hard times in our lives

790
01:44:04,916 --> 01:44:07,666
would get better

791
01:44:08,958 --> 01:44:10,708
and that takes only some breath.

792
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:38,833
FOR MY BELOVED FRIENDS AND TEACHERS
FROM ASSUMPTION COLLEGE SRIRACHA
