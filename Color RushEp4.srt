00:00:01,273 --> 00:00:02,304
(Yoo Jun)

2
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:04,543
(Hur Hyun Jun)

3
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:14,953
(Color Rush, Episode 4)

4
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,184
Why am I putting on my jacket?

5
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,133
Why are you here?

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,764
Because I missed you.

7
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,203
I can't believe he's here.

8
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:33,163
I shouldn't see him today.

9
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:36,504
So why am I already wearing my jacket?

10
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,074
Get home safely.

11
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:40,944
Wait, don't hang up.

12
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:43,243
I failed to show you a rainbow the other day,

13
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:45,743
so I thought I'd show you something else.

14
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,114
Which is what?

15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,324
The night view.

16
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:12,643
This will be it.

17
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:16,274
After seeing the night view, I'll say I've had enough.

18
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,783
That I don't want to be with my probe.

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,283
Yeon Woo, this will be your last preview.

20
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,593
I see.

21
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,723
Last night, I looked at it with sunglasses on.

22
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,093
- Sunglasses? - I got to realize...

23
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:39,703
that maybe you'd be better off not seeing its colors.

24
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:50,843
You might collapse due to the color rush again.

25
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:56,583
Still, you should get at least one chance to see this view.

26
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:00,224
To know that having colors isn't always beautiful.

27
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:14,363
What's the name of this color?

28
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:16,594
Lemon.

29
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:20,833
Yeon Woo,

30
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,703
lookout in front of you.

31
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:29,243
This is what a night view looks like.

32
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,953
The night view here...

33
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:38,523
is one that felt the loneliest to me.

34
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,264
You're right.

35
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,903
It does feel lonely.

36
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,944
Why on earth did you show me this though?

37
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,014
Because you're adamant...

38
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,513
against learning about colors.

39
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,123
When did I ever say that?

40
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,763
You show the colors to me...

41
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:22,763
and I help you to identify faces. Right?

42
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:26,104
- That's right. - Tell me what I need to do.

43
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,173
Just look at me when I tell you to.

44
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,513
Like this?

45
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,493
So what now?

46
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:52,964
Do you want to learn the colors?

47
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,334
Yes.

48
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:11,344
No. No way.

49
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,553
No way. Not a chance.

50
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:19,323
I must've been out of my mind to have said that.

51
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,423
Like this?

52
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:29,394
I blame it on Yoo Han's eyes that went from a shade of gray...

53
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:31,534
to a mesmerizing shade of caramel brown.

54
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:36,404
That's the reason for saying what I didn't mean.

55
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:38,673
So what now?

56
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:41,243
Do you want to learn the colors?

57
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:43,544
Yes.

58
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,644
I'm doomed.

59
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,084
How am I supposed to go to school now?

60
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:24,823
- Boo! - What on earth?

61
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,323
Are you all right?

62
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,164
Not even my mom has ever hit me,

63
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,063
but Yeon Woo did.

64
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:39,063
Hold on. Let me see.

65
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,104
I'm fine.

66
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:44,544
Let's go see the school nurse.

67
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,214
I see she's not here.

68
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,484
Have a seat.

69
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:16,933
Here's a mirror, so apply the ointment.

70
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,803
I thought you'd do it for me.

71
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,613
Fainting from a color rush will only cause more nuisance.

72
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,544
No, that will hardly be the case.

73
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:31,683
Then, let me help.

74
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:06,253
So this much of a color rush doesn't have me fainting.

75
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,394
I can take it off if you want me to.

76
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,063
This might hurt.

77
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,664
Does it hurt a lot?

78
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,164
Soothe it for me.

79
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,174
Are you all right?

80
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,913
Yes.

81
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:44,054
Yellow.

82
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,424
(Missing Person)

83
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,863
(Yoo Yi Ri, mono)

84
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,934
Yeon Woo?

85
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:56,734
(Nurse's Office)

86
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,773
Are you all right?

87
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,194
Wait.

88
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,694
What happened to me?

89
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,493
You cried your eyes out.

90
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,434
Pain suddenly swept over you...

91
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:27,204
and you started crying.

92
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:30,873
You didn't seem to be conscious though.

93
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,503
What exactly did I do?

94
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,013
I can't remember.

95
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,013
The colors...

96
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,054
I can't see them.

97
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:48,523
Decoloring happened. Don't you remember?

98
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,763
You needed to see the color of the headband.

99
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,293
You didn't want the image to fade away.

100
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,204
I already...

101
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,474
experienced it?

102
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,844
It's one of the phases mono experiences...

103
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,184
while adjusting to one's probe.

104
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,413
The color rush gets extended,

105
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:19,084
you forget what happened, you pass out a while later,

106
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,054
and your subconscious can surface.

107
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,824
The fact that he's adjusting to the color rushes...

108
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,694
is a good sign, right?

109
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,834
Don't do it at school for the time being.

110
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:35,373
We don't want him to wither away even more.

111
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:36,873
Got it.

112
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,714
I'm glad that you're getting used to it.

113
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,424
You scared me a little back there.

114
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:54,023
I'm getting used to it? As in what way?

115
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,324
Me getting used to my probe?

116
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:58,993
To Go Yoo Han?

117
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,863
Yeon Woo...

118
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:04,334
And what comes after that?

119
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:08,074
Obsession, kidnapping,

120
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:09,804
and murder.

121
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:11,844
Look at me.

122
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,564
You should wash your face.

123
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,334
You're still just as pretty with puffy eyes,

124
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,204
but it seems too obvious that you cried.

125
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,153
I'm the mono here.

126
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,613
So why are you trying to keep me next to you?

127
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:00,584
Go Yoo Han.

128
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,623
Why are you crying when I'm the one who blacked out?

129
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,293
I thought something bad had happened to you earlier...

130
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,574
and got scared.

131
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,133
I get it, so let go of me.

132
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,944
No. Since it's raining...

133
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:23,344
Just for a little while.

134
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,783
What does the rain have to do with anything?

135
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:30,613
I'm fully aware of it now.

136
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,283
The difference between what my brain logically wants...

137
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,393
and what my heart desires.

138
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,464
I like being with my probe.

139
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,234
I want to see the colors.

140
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:44,064
Do you wish to see the colors that I see?

141
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:46,204
Yes.

142
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:48,604
What?

143
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:53,003
Can he even tell what I'm thinking now?

144
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,773
Yeon Woo, look ahead.

145
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,783
Being your probe...

146
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:06,854
means that the colors I know will become the colors you know.

147
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:11,023
We'll be seeing the same colors.

148
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:12,893
What on earth?

149
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:16,033
Then how you describe the sea...

150
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,793
will be the color I'll learn.

151
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:21,474
Yes, that's exactly how it'll be.

152
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,133
That's absurd.

153
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,844
But when I felt a moment of happiness,

154
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,513
I saw the happiness draining out from my view.

155
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:38,554
Loss.

156
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,054
Only having moments of happiness...

157
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:44,324
that leaves me all alone in a land of gray...

158
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:46,324
terrifies me.

159
00:13:46,763 --> 00:13:49,964
Could there be a way to never let this go?

160
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,834
If only I could...

161
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,734
Choi Yeon Woo!

162
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:57,503
Let go of me!

163
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:02,413
What's your problem?

164
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,814
It just crossed my mind...

165
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,883
that I want to keep you forever.

166
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:29,373
(Color Rush)
