00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,660
Great. It says:
"Welcome to Hell".

3
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,330
WELCOME 6-CLASS (IN HELL)

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,500
This year is gonna suck.

5
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,120
How do you know that?

6
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,790
Oops. That Happens

7
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,200
I just know it.

8
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,700
Last year we were the kings.

9
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,250
Fifth graders. We rulled
that school.

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,660
This year, nobody likes us

11
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,950
That's true.

12
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,250
Speak for yourself. I'll
be fine I got a mustache comming in.

13
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,830
I wanna see it.

14
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,870
No

15
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,830
Noone's
got it worst than me.

16
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,080
Do you see that girl over there?

17
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,410
She is
gonna torture me every chance she gets

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,330
Wait a second, is
n't that your sister?

19
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,410
Yeah.

20
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,290
At least you guys have your own rooms.
My grandfather stole mine.

21
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,580
Wait, Your grandfather moved in with
you guys? When did that happen?

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,910
Ever since he robbed  the grocery store

23
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,080
Can I help you sir

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,620
You can help me find Maria.

25
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,950
Oh, Maria is gone.
We are completely self checkout now.

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,660
Much faster, much more efficient.
I think you will like it.

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,410
So the price is gonna be lower
because I'm doing all the work now?

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,250

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,620

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,870

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,580
Come on, sir.

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,950
Go ! I'm a senior citizen.
Get out of here.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,370
-I know judo!
-Go!

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,660
Leave the poor man alone!

47
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,620
Your shop stinks.

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Are you insane? Stop!

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,540
Oh, I see you all wanna
play it out.

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,910
That's all you've got
? That hurt.

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,120
Hey, there's my girl. You didn't have to come all this way
I told you I was fine

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,500
What happened to the mailbox?

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,250
Oh that, some idiot took him out.

54
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,370
Oh crap.

55
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,410
Dad, you are driving again, aren't you?
You lost license remember?

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,080
No, I didn't loose it,
I forgot to renew it.

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,000
So now I have to retake the test all over again,
which is idiotic

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,160
because I've been driving for over 50 years.
I mean what am I supposed to do, starve to dead?

59
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,790
I'm coming in.

60
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,330
This can't keep happening.

61
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,830
Don't worry I'm never going back
to that damn store again

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,500
No, I mean the part about you
I had to leave the dealership earlier

63
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,540
Drive two hours each way
just to check on you

64
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,450
I didn't ask you to come!

65
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
No, you didn't, the police did.
Dad I wanna come, I want to be there for you.

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,370
But maybe this is now is the time
we have to consider...

67
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,580
No, I am not moving!
I built this house, I'm gonna die in this housre

68
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,660
And that's it.
and you are not putting me in a home!

69
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,160
What if it were our home?

70
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,500
What are you talking about? fish and relatives
stink after three days. that's a horrible idea

71
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,660
We'll kill each other.
It ain't working no, sorry.

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,700
Dad!

73
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,580
I miss her too.

74
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,870
And
That's no gonna changes

75
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,450
why moving me out of my house
and sticking me in yours.

76
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,750
Oh God.

77
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,080
Maybe we could
miss her together.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Yeah, maybe. But you don't have
the room in your house anyway. Where would even you put me

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,370
The attic? No way!

80
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,870
Come on buddy, don't make it harder
than it already is. It's the only choice

81
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,080
Dad! If it's the only choice,
then it's not a choice at all.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,410
'Cause a "Choice" means
you get to pick

83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,660
Between at least two things.
And this is one thing.

84
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,580
Unless the other is
sleep in the yard

85
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,330
And get eaten
by a bear.

86
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,080
Don't be so dramatic, Peter

87
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,410
Besides, your
sisters is already sharing room.

88
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,540
Yeah, well Sarah told you said that.

89
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,660
No, I know, I know she exaggerates
but may... you sta...

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,120
Hold on. Shh!

91
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
Schhh!

92
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Schhh...

93
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,580
-Hey What's up.
- Shh!

94
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,500
Plus the attic doesn't have bathroom
And your Grandpa can't do all the stairs.

95
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,750
And the basement ... is the basement.

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,450
-Ha!
-What?

97
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,290
My Jordans! I just put them first laces.

98
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,910
Hey Peter, do you need
help moving upstairs?

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Get out! It's still my room.

100
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,620
Not for long.

101
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,700
Go away! go go go!

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,370
Peter, I know
it's not ideal, but we are

103
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,830
a family and we make
sacrifices for each other.

104
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,910
Sometimes very big sacrifices.

105
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,250
Look sweetheart
the attic is bigger than this room

106
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,450
Once you move in
then that will be your room.

107
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,700
No, it won't. It will be the attic
where you put stuff and forget it

108
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,330
just like our old TV or
the exercise bike that Dad used once.

109
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
True

110
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,450
What? I excercise, what the...
look think about it is a fresh new start, alright?

111
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,700
We'll dust everything up
put new paint up everywhere.

112
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,910
Get a chance to clean up
your turtle tank.

113
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,620
They like it that.
get some privacy.

114
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,830
Does it still fit you, sweetie?

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Yes

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,580
Grandpa!

117
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,080
Grandpa is here, Grandpa is here,
Grandpa all the way.

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh what fun it is to have a Grandpa
come and stay, hey

119
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,660
Hey, now remember: we
don't wanna overwhelm Grandpa, Ok

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,660
So let's let him settle down.

121
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,370
There will be plenty of time
to talk to him during dinner ok.

122
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,370
-Oh, I'm not gonna be here.
-What?

123
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,910
What? I'm studying with Russel.

124
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,200
"Studying" still means studying, right?
It's not slang for something else?

125
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,540
No dad. "Studying" still means studying
And I already cleared it with mom.

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,500
Grandpa!

127
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Jenny!

128
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,080
Don't body Slam.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Oh, oh, oh, shit.

130
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,080
-Hi, Grandpa.
-Hello sweetheart.

131
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,750
Ed.

132
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,830
Artie.

133
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,790
Where is your brother

134
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,750
<i>Peter?</i>

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
<i>Peter?</i>

136
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,290
Peter!

137
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,410
Kids, let's help Grandpa
with his bags.

138
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
-Okay, I've got this.
I've got it.

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,540
OK. Then I'll take the suitcase.

140
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,620
He called me "Artie" again.

141
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,870
Please Arthur,
this isn't easy for him.

142
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,790
Hey, Grandpa.

143
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,040
Hey there he is, Look at you.

144
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,250
Look at you.
look you are sprouting up like a gloom

145
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,750
Oh, nice sneakers.

146
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,370
Thanks. How do you like your room?

147
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,580
It looks nice.
ah, because it's nice.

148
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,290
Easily
the nicest room in the house.

149
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh I know kid Look,
I didn't wanna to be this way either.

150
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,540
Sometimes you have to make
sacrifices in a family.

151
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,540
That's true, You're right.

152
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,450
Sometimes you don't even get to vote

153
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,250
That makes two of us.

154
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,580
Be careful with the floorboards
They're no fairly up.

155
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,620
I'll remember that, thanks kiddo

156
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,330
I'll talk to you later, Grandpa.

157
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,080
You can visit me in the attic anytime.

158
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,500
It's a creepy place
full with spiders and mice.

159
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,750
- <i>Peter!
</i>-I wasn't!

160
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,160
Here we are.

161
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,080
You've been robbed, bro.

162
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,660
No, I was invaded.

163
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,450
The worst part is
I'm not even allowed to complain about it.

164
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,580
Seems like you've been complaining
enough lot, pete.

165
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,200
I mean at home because he is old
and we all love him and stuff.

166
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,620
Dude come on
get another enemy to invade your base.

167
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,580
You gotta to fight back and
stick up to your rights.

168
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,330
I don't have rights.

169
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,500
Everyone has rights. They are in,
uh ...uh, aliens something

170
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,620
They are allowed to pursuit happiness
It is in the constitution.

171
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, well all that would be great if I lived
in North America.

172
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,500
But it turns out that 153
Burlington Avenue is actually in North Korea.

173
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,580
Woah, Did your parents
know that when they bought the house?

174
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
What?

175
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,950
I wouldn't put up with this Pete.

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,580
I'll get my room back
or else it's war.

177
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,330
What do you mean "Or else it's war"?

178
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,700
You want him to attack his grandfather?

179
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,700
Sneak attack, Emma.

180
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,120
See, He cannot fight him the normal way
because his grandfather has strenght, size

181
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,500
And experience, while Peter is
weak, small and dumb.

182
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,040
You're a bad friend.

183
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,200
Hi, Steven...uhm

184
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,000
Mom says don't forget to wear
your sandals when you shower in Gym Class

185
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,870
Not cool, Lisa.

186
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,870
My brother has that toe fungus thing
Totally gross and contagious.

187
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,910
Contagious?

188
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Gross.

189
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,080
It's only on six of my toes

190
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,200
That's a lot of toes, bro.

191
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,580
Hi grandpa.

192
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,950
Hi sweetheart.

193
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,250
Do you wanna play a game?
I have "reindeer run"

194
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,540
I have "Santa's World",
I have "1-2-3 Christmas tree".

195
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,830
Maybe, but not right now, okay?

196
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,200
Wanna watch a movie?
I have "Frosty the Snowman".

197
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,750
I don't think so. Okay,
sweetheart? Maybe tomorrow?

198
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Okay.

199
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,000
What's wrong with Grandpa?

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Why? What happened?

201
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,370
He doesn't wanna do anything.

202
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,700
He's just staring out the window
but there's nothing there except for that tree

203
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,620
That daddy says hes gonna cut down, but you
won't let him to use the chainsaw.

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,120
Daddy can
use the chainsaw anytime he wants honey, OK?

205
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,950
He just chooses to wait
until Mommy says it's okay.

206
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,660
Grandpa will be alright.
He's just tired and

207
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,250
Thinking a lot about Grandma
. He'll be okay

208
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,330
Okay.

209
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,450
Get away from me!

210
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,330
I hate my life.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,660
Oh come on!

212
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,910
Ouch.

213
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,120

It's not bad, it's just you know
it's an adjustment, so yeah

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,330
Who are you talking to?

No, I would love to,
I would love to but I can't

223
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,200
I'm so stuck here. Yeah.

224
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,040
Hi Jerry, It's Sally.

225
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Hey!

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,080
-He's not stuck.
-What are you doing?

227
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,950
Yeah bring him over
Im on my way to work

228
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,910
See you soon, bye Jerry.

229
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,790
So, now you are setting me up on play dates?

230
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,330
Coud I pack your lunch
maybe put a note in it?

231
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,910
You want a note? Might
not like what it says.

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,040
I'll see him some other
time, don't feel like it now.

233
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,080
You haven't seen Jerry in ages.

234
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,200
Now you live
close. It will be nice.

235
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,450
I can't and I don't want to. I
I've got stuff to do. I have to take care of

236
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,830
The light switch in my room now
'Cause Artie put it in backwards

237
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,290
You did!

238
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,910
Eat up. We're going in 15 minutes.

239
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,200
Yes, Mom.

240
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,830
How is it going
grandpa did you sleep ok?

241
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,540
Like a log Pete. Thanks.
don't you guys have a newspaper around here?

242
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,250
Yeah, we do.

243
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Here it is.

244
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,500
Ahh, I can't read this.

245
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,370
Just make it bigger. See.

246
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Oh, yes.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Jenn...

248
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,120
How does she
survive ? She doesn't eat anything.

249
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,250
I don't know. don't be late, Peter.

250
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,540
OK. so? No nightmares?

251
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Me? No.

252
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,750
Insomnia?

253
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,410
Now it's like eight
words in the whole screen.

254
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,040
You don't want to talk about anything?

255
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,080
I just make the whole thing disappear!
I don't know what i did just now? what the...

256
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,250
<i>Peter, let's go!</i>

257
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,040
Ok well, if you
want to talk about something later on , we can do that.

258
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,830
Ok have a good day.

259
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,870
He didn't react at all?

260
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,910
Not a word. what's his game.

261
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,250
What's yours Pete,
I mean, come on

262
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,000
You don't start a war
with a note

263
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,910
Maybe he didn't
actually read it

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He read it
It was on his desk unfolded.

265
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,540
Maybe he forgot he read
old people do that

266
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,290
You do that, Steve.

267
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,330
Oops. that happens...

268
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,660
What the point is, you've already blown
the element of surprise.

269
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,250
You've got to attack immediately.

270
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,000
-A mess chilli in your backpack?
- He knows.

271
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Yeah.

272
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,950
Hi, Steven.

273
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,500
Oh god no

274
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,040
You left your retainer
in the back seat of mom's car.

275
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,790
I think there's snicker
trapped in it

276
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,910
At least I hope that's a snickers.

277
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,040
See you at dinner.

278
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Oh god it's a snickers

279
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,080
Comming along, Arthur?

280
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,000
Not bad if you feel like big boxes.

281
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,950
Big boxes built this company.

282
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,250
Yes. Yes, they did.

283
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,620
Are you sure that's
the Walmart food print?

284
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,200
Walmart? I thought this was for Kmart.

285
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,370
It's Walmart.

286
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,370
Oh man. I'm sorry.
I've got a lot on my mind these days.

287
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,950
My father-in-law just moved
in with us, so ...

288
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,290
I don't know. I feel like
he judges me

289
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,830
He thinks I work for some
soul sucking corporate firm

290
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,370
That has no interest or care
or worries of it's ...

291
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,250
...it's employees.

292
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,040
Have a good time.

293
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,250
From, I'm just gonna walk home?

294
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,080
Well, you can if you want.
Or you can use this.

295
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,080
I already have a phone.

296
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,580
That's not a phone. I don't
know what that is. Just take it.

297
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,160
Okay, this is a car service
called "Lyft".

298
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,160
If you wanna go home,
you just swipe that, somebody comes to get you.

299
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,080
You don't need cash,
you don't have to talk to anybody.

300
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,750
Swipe. Swipe it.

301
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,910
Bye, Dad.

302
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Oh! okay.

303
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,830
-Say hi to Jerry for me.
-I will.

304
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,750
Holly cow, this is all yours?
This is like a college kid dream room.

305
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,660
Are you kidding?
No college kid can afford this.

306
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,950
The pool table alone
is six grand.

307
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,620
And you use all these stuffs?

308
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,370
Of course I do.

309
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,950
What do you wanna do first?
Play pool ? Pump some eye like a man?

310
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,950
And what the heck is that?

311
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,410
That is a onewheel.
and they are fun.

312
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
And you actually ride that thing?

313
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Hell yes

314
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,790
Epic!

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,660
You should see me.

316
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,410
Wow!

317
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,830
Yo, Jerry! Oh! sorry I didn't know
you were ocupado

318
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,660
This is my old friend Ed.

319
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,410
Ed, hi, Danny.

320
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,950
Glad to meet you.
So are we walking?

321
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah.

322
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,250
Oh good. 'Cause my Masseuse
told me if i get 10 thousands steps this week

323
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,410

She will meet me for coffee.

324
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,410
By "coffee" I mean, you know

325
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Coffee?

326
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,830
Yeah, coffee.

327
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,830
Good morning ladies.

328
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,290
Really, dude?

329
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,910
These jogger pants are gonna be the death to me.

330
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,200
Why do you do that?

331
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,830
What? They think I'm cute.

332
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,870
Yeah, "Cute like, an old guy.
is cute when they still think they have a chance."

333
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,660
Hey I'm a catch.

334
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,160
They know I have a full pension.
Two more years and I can ski free as a senior.

335
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,370
Do you ski?

336
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,580
No, I do not. Good morning.
Beautiful morning.

337
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,500
How are you? Lovely.

338
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,620
Nice, Nice
next time bring up the pension.

339
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,450
And the free ski if you'll ever do.

340
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,080
How is  your daughter Place, Ed?

341
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,870
It's okay, I guess
She gave me my grandson's room, He is not too happy about it

342
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,250
He sent me this last night.

343
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,700
<i>"... my bedroom, ... no choice, ...face the consequences".</i>

344
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,080
Wow! How did you respond?

345
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,450
I didn't.

346
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,500
-You just gonna roll all on this?
-You've gotta respond., come on

347
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,540
This kind of aggression show must stand
<i>Semper fi</i> .

348
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,200
I know you were a marine?

349
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,330
And why not. Just saying ...

350
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,160
Ah He's a kid. He getting used
to it just as I am

351
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,450
I'm his grandfather, so
he is not gonna do anything.

352
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,200
What are you talking about? You have to do something ...

353
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,040
<i>"People who steal other people's room
should not sleep well."</i>

354
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,040
Peter? Oh, Peter!

355
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,580
Grandpa. Is that you?

356
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,950
Yes, it's me you know it's me.
Do you know what time it is?

357
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,750
Night time?

358
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,950
It's the middle of the night. Come on,
It's not funny. I don't like people

359
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
playing tricks on me,
specially my own grandson.

360
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,540
It's not a trick. It's war.

361
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,870
You don't go to war
against your family

362
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,000
You have to have an enemy.
to go to war and I'm not your enemy

363
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,910
You've got my declaration.
Why didn't you say anything?

364
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,700
Because I was kind of hoping it was a joke.

365
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,870
It's not a joke. You took something
of mine and I want it back.

366
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,750
OK. Go back to sleep, you made your point.

367
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,700
But this is over now.

368
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,660
Will see you in the morning,
which is almost here

369
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,620
Grandpa? I love you.

370
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,040
I love you too, kiddo

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,540
But the war is still on.

372
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,290
Hi grandpa.

373
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,620
-Hey, Jenny.
-Can I come in?

374
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,040
Sure, why not.

375
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,950
'Cause when Peter lived here

376
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,540
I was snuck in
accessing in

377
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,000
Come on, come on

378
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,540
So what can I do for you?

379
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,790
Nothing. I just like to look at other people's stuff

380
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,790
Do you know my birthday is comming up?

381
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,910
I do.

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,250
OK. Just making sure.

383
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,410
What's this?

384
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,410
Those are marbles.

385
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,290
Can i have one

386
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,500
Sure, if you promise to take care of
it. They are special.

387
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,250
They are not magic.

388
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,660
People always say that things are magic
and they never are.

389
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,200
No, I didn't say
that they were magic

390
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,750
but they are special. Come here.

391
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,120
You know that grandma
used to build houses?

392
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,870
Yeah, but I wasn't born

393
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,410
That's true, you weren't born
But

394
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,950
When you build a house, you
always start by doing some digging.

395
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,160
And for some reason
you almost always find marbles

396
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,080
I guess because they roll around
and get lost easily.

397
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,040
But pretty much every foundation
I ever dug, I always

398
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,660
found a marble or two.
So guess what I did with them.

399
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,750
What?

400
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,000
I kept them
so if you count all those marbles

401
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,200
You will know how many
houses i built.

402
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,290
That's a lot of houses.

403
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,250
I worked a long time.

404
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,120
How can't you work right now?

405
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,330
Because I'm much so called retired.

406
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,830
What is retired?

407
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,410
It's when you stop working
so you can do other things.

408
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,080
Like your grandmother and
I had big plans

409
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,200
but, sometimes
things just don't work out

410
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,750
Can I have a marble now?

411
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,830
Sure.

412
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,910
Careful, sweetheart, careful, careful.

413
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,330
Are you okay, Grandpa?

414
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah / yeah, I Just get a rest down here
for a while

415
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,660
Can I still have a marble?

416
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,160
Take whatever you want

417
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh no no no no

418
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,830
What's it rocking upstairs?

419
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,950
Grandpa lost his marbles.

420
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,080
<i>"Come to my room. Now."</i>

421
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,200
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah. Come on in. Shut the door.

422
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,370
Have a sit.

423
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,290
So,
you know that big jar of marbles I have?

424
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,250
No. How would I know
about the things you have

425
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,200
in your room...? That used to be mine.

426
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,040
That's good. That's funny.
that's real funny.

427
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,620
Everybody likes a funny kid. I thought
we were done with this.

428
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,040
All you have to do is tell mom and dad
that you will switch room with me

429
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,200
And then.
It will be done.

430
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,870
You really want war?
Because you know I've been in one.

431
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,790
It's not like video games.

432
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,540
Even if you win,
everybody gets hurt.

433
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,080
I only want what's mine

434
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,540
You're playing hard, ah?

435
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,950
I'm not playing.

436
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,660
Fair enough. So what are the
rules of engagement?

437
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,370
What?

438
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,000
Rules of engagement
what's allowed and not allowed.

439
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,410
- You don't have rules in war.
-Oh yes, you do.

440
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,660
<i>"Rule number one:

442
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,750
That means it can't affect
your parents or your sisters.

443
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,950
Agreed.

444
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,580
<i>"Rule number two: no telling."</i>

446
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,290
This is man to man. Just between me and you.
No ratting the other guy out.

447
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,750
Agreed.

448
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,870
OK. Sign!

449
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,410
Okay, you got your wish,
"Secret Warrior".

450
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Okay. "Senior Soldier".

457
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,370

don't mess with me, you little ...

461
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,410
Do you think you're cute?

462
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,870
Then you did the math without
the landlord, my friend.

463
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,580
<i>You will be sorry for that,
I promise you.</i>

464
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,620
Do you think you're cute? You are not cute!

465
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,250
This one never been spoken of!

466
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,540
I have no idea what you are talking about.

467
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,160
You're doing very well, Grandpa.

468
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,580
Thank you, sweetheart. You are
a very good teacher.

469
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,950
Why is your face so red

470
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,580
I dont know.

471
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,540
I may be
allergic to something in this house.

472
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,120
Well, I'll be in the shaving cream.

473
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,580
I mean ... school.

474
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,000
Uh, Peter! is that your binder?

475
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
Yeah, thanks.

476
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,950
Have a good day at school,
kiddo, love you.

477
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,410
Hey Pete How's your
super unnecessary war going ?

478
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,410
Not good. I was up all
night. couldn't sleep at all.

479
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Diarrhea?

480
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,700
What? No! My grandpa.

481
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,410
Your grandpa has diarrhea?

482
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,450
No! there is no diarrhea
, in the story.

483
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,200
I did what you said yesterday
and I hit him good multiple times.

484
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,910
I even put hot sauce in his coffee
this morning.

485
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,370
So far nothing.

486
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,790
Dude, your grandfather is using psy-ops.

487
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,790
Psychological warfare.

488
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,370
Or, maybe he's just been an adult.

489
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,040
Peter? Have you
done talking? , Maybe you'd like

490
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
To read us your report
on what you did over your summer vacation?

491
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Yeah, sure.

492
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,660
<i>"My Summer Vacation" by Peter Decker.</i>

493
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,580
This summer was one the
best summer break I've ever had.

494
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,830
I rode my bike a lot
and stop showering

495
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,370
until I smell like a monkey's butt.

496
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,870
Keep reading Peter, go on.

497
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
I don't want to. This isn't my ...

498
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,790
Read!

499
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,290
During my vacation
I figure out how to freeze my own farts in a baggy.

500
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,330
I didn't write this.

501
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,790
Have a sit.
and see me after class.

502
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,950
Psy-Ops.

503
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
Amateur.

504
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,000
What's going on here?

505
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,000
The... nothing, nothing! We were just hm...

506
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,790
I
was just dropping up some vocabulary drills.

507
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,870
Really?

508
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,950
Vocabulary.

509
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,580
Russell, go! Mia, stay.

510
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,660
Do you ignore that the policy
doesn't allow

511
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,830
Boys in this house
when noone is here?

512
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,910
Oh, my god, mom, don't
blow a gas. 'Cause we weren't doing anything.

513
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,910
Don't you think I was your age once.

514
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,870
The... No,
I don't

515
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,950
really ...
yeah

516
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,410
'Cause you are...What ...

517
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
You are literally...Say it.

518
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,700
Those vocabulary drills
are paing off, sweetie.

519
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,830
What the heck...!

520
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,660
Don't start nothing won't be nothing.

521
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,790
He got me.

522
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,830
I got him good.
Tape on the door way,

523
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,330
Like I woudn't see that
from miles away.

524
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,080
-Rookie!
-Tape on the door way.

525
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,120
Tape on the door way.

526
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,660
Step back boys, I'll tee off.

527
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,200
Yeah. I'm steeping back.

528
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,080
We should skip this hole.

529
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,450
-Yeah, Good idea.
-Yeah.

530
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,790
I wonder how
my grandpa's golf game is doing.

531
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,700
My Jordans!

532
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,040
Dude, I think your
grandpa might be a ninja.

533
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,790
My Jordans.

534
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,910
First time?

535
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,700
Unfortunately, no.

536
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,700
What are you, a spy or something?

537
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,410
No. I'm just trying to
spy my grandson.

538
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,540
We are in the middle of
a tough battle over a bedroom.

539
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,790
I just moved in to my
daughter's house so ...

540
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,160
No, no no don't say anything else.
so nobody can make me testify.

541
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,040
I won't.

542
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,750
You need a hand.

543
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,660
No, let me give it one more shot.

544
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,080
Oh, come on, yeah...
and what am I doing wrong now?

545
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,080
Oh no no I'm...I'm not gonna help you now
that way you'll never learn

546
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,910
Make you tough on me?

547
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,080
ah, you're on your way.

548
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,450
<i>Bam! Cars like this
1974 Volkswagen bug used to...</i>

549
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,910
We had one of those remember.

550
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,410
We changed the
clutch on it.

551
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,370
Yeah, how could I forget,
you dropped the flywheel on my toe.

552
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,540
Well that was your fault.
for mistaking me for your son.

553
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,000
Anybody wanna watch anything else maybe? Like ah...

554
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,330
Netflix?

555
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,000
The weather channel?

556
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,790
Sea spam?

557
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,040
"The Grinch" stole Christmas

558
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Hey yeah!

559
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Hey, going to Skyler's house

560
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,910
What? Now?

561
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,040
Yes, I'm studying.

562
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:18,450
Do you want me to get into
a good college or not?

563
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,580
Okay, bye.

564
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,750
She's going to see Russell, I know it.

565
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,370
-What?
-none of my business.

566
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,950
No come on, your are gonna say it anyway.

567
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Okay.

568
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,080
My advice about fighting
her about a boyfriend is done.

569
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,290
It cost me two years with you.

570
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah. When you started dating
Artie here.

571
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
That's not true, I don't remember that.

572
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,370
well I do. It was terrible

573
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,330
I was over the house
all the time

574
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,200
Yes, you were over the house
talking to your mother. You barely talked to me at all.

575
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,580
-Really?
-Yeah.

576
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,250
-Sorry dad.
-No, don't be, it was my fault.

577
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,120
I thought he wasn't good enough
for you til I realized

578
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,750
That wasn't the point. The point
was you thought he was good enough for you.

579
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,700
But, you and Artie get on
great now.

580
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,540
Because I stopped being an idiot.

581
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,120
But,
I'll never get those two years back.

582
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,950
Wow! ah, I appreciate that, Ed.

583
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,620
You're welcome Artie, I mean.
I meant that sincerely.

584
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,040
But your career is not so much...

585
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,500
What? Dad!

586
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,450
Nothing against Artie, It's just that I think
that people who side their dreams

587
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,160
Who settle for less
, are never very happy, that's all.

588
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,000
Really? Well, I find  that those
same people tend to have secure incomes.

589
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,370
Which then allow them to, I dont know
take an aging senior perhaps.

590
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:45,660
And the name is "Arthur". Come on, honey
let's go, It's bed time. Here we go

591
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,040
Night, sweetie.

592
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,950
-Night.
-Good night.

593
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,160
I thought you stopped being an idiot.

594
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Sorry.

595
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,040
I can't put anything back together
. He took all of the screws

596
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,950
Now
I'm sleeping on the floor.

597
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,620
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

598
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,790
Yeah. Ha-Ha.

599
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,620
<i>Dude, you may have to face
the fact that</i>

600
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,370
<i>yourf grandfather
is just smarter than you...hey</i>

601
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,700
<i>Billy, male snake.</i>

602
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,870
<i>Thanks.</i>

603
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,080
<i>Steven, I found the dog
chewing  your suckables again.</i>

604
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,410
<i>Those aren't mine.</i>

605
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,290
<i>Really?
It says "Captain Steve" on the waistband.</i>

606
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,040
<i>Get out of my room!</i>

607
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,620
<i>"Captain Steve".</i>

608
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,540
See, it's not that hard.

609
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,450
Yeah thanks kiddo

610
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay off you go.
A lot of thanks.

611
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,580
Yeah, Now we're talkind?

612
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,830
- <i>I know something you could do, Peter.
</i>-what?

613
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>You could use some of the mental
energy spending</i>

614
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,870
<i>On picking up stupid tricks to
play on your grandfather to not get a C in math.</i>

615
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,160
Who cares about math?
This is real life.

616
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:15,250
<i>... says the guy building
a fake castle in a video game.</i>

617
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,830
Petersburg isn't a castle,
it's a palace.

618
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,250
And after three years in the making,
it's almost finished.

619
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,330
Too easy.

620
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,620
Ah no. Oh!

621
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,580
And then see
if the light is on.

622
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,450
No no no!

623
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,910
Every beginner knows that.

624
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
What the...?

625
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,410
Grandpa's cookies

626
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,540
Did you bring it?

627
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,080
You have the cash

628
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,120
Dude it's all there.

629
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,660
I'm sure is, Pete. I'm sure is.

630
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,160
Not funny, Peter!

631
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,500
Nice snake, nice, nice snake! nice snake

632
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,910
You can take all you want,
whatever you want!

633
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,790
I'm just, I just can go, go over here.

634
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,500
Don't mind if I do, Eddie.

635
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,750
You stay there. You stay there. You stay there!

636
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,830
What's that?

637
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,370
It's a Baylor necklace.

638
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,040
A what? Like those TV commercials?

639
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,660
You expect me to wear that?
Absolutely not. Absolutely not, no way

640
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:27,580
You know you use
or wear under your shirt and nobody could even see it.

641
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
You can't see that.

642
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,620
If you don't
wanna wear it for you , wear it for me.

643
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
-But I don't need this.
-Really?

644
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't need this

645
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
Because Arthur says that you've been acting

646
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,080
Odly.

647
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
He has?

648
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,330
For the record:
I didn't say "odly".

649
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,750
I said "confused".

650
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
"Confused".

651
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,120
Look, look dad, is it so hard to believe
that we care about you.?

652
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,660
Probably you
wouldn't even use it.

653
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,620
You got that right, 'cause I'm
not wearing it.

654
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,000
Look, it gives me peace of mind
to know that with just one push of a button

655
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,660
You can get help
if you need it.

656
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Please.

657
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:10,950
Please.

658
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,750
Sweet necklace, Grandpa.

659
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Great reaction, my friend.

660
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,750
And this is  how you found him?

661
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,660
Yeah. When I couldn't
reach him online I got worried.

662
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,250
My life's work, ruined.

663
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,370
Oh I see it's a pile of rubble.

664
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,620
He destroyed Petersburg.

665
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,830
I've been building it for more than a third of
my life.

666
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,450
Actually,
three twelfths are exactly 25 percent,

667
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,910
Which is less than a
third of your life.

668
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,540
Well it is.

669
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,870
It's okay buddy.

670
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,540
Ah, you see dear.

671
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,950
I was right the boy is comming around.

672
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,040
Do you both promise to
use your words?

673
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,450
I promise.

674
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,620
Why are we doing it this way?

675
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,200
Because when you have peace talks, you need
someone neutral to mediate

676
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,580
otherwise you just break down into yelling

677
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,700
This is dumb!

678
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,950
Well we are doing it
besides it took me five minutes

679
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,250
To get on this chair,
I'm not getting out.

680
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,540
Grandpa promised.
you have to promise.

681
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,620
Okay fine. I promise.

682
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,500
Good. Now,I will admit the hostilities
may have escalated more

683
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,250
Than neither of us
anticipated

684
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,750
You don't touch another man's
computer.

685
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:07,040
That's not cool!

686
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,790
That's what war is all about, kiddo

687
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,450
War! I just want my
room back!

688
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,660
No yelling!

689
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm not yelling, he is yelling.

690
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,580
Say you are sorry to Grandpa.

691
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,910
No, It's ok sweetheart.

692
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,830
-I love you, Grandpa.
-I love you too.

693
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,660
-Stop that!
-stop what?

694
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,500
-What's going on here?
-Nothing's going on here.

695
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,040
You're supposed to be neutral!

696
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,660
I don't even know what that means.

697
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,910
Means you shouldn't act like you
like him better than me.

698
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,200
I do like him better than you.
He gave me a cookie.

699
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,250
Okay, that sounds worse than it is.
It is true a cookie was given

700
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,620
But it was way before this
negotiation was even scheduled.

701
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,410
Chocolate chips. My favorite.

702
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,500
Mine too.

703
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,660
That's it I'm done.
peace is canceled.

704
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,540
No yelling!

705
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,660
Shut up!

706
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,000
"Shut up" it's a bad word!

707
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Peter.

708
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,370
Can I get my second cookie now?

709
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,080
Peter, peter, peter, hold up please come on
youre right a cookie may have been involved

710
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,250
Which may have been an attempt to influence the mediator,
which in retrospect may have been inappropiate

711
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,370
"may have been"

712
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,540
Okay to be thin with the negotiation
with a bit  of an attitude yourself

713
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,950
You didnt even give
peace a chance, either

714
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,290
Why should I?
You demolished Petersburg.

715
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,870
But that's what I've been trying
to tell you when this all started.

716
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,540
War is not game, Peter.

717
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,500
Only kids, and fools and generals
think that. War hurts.

718
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,290
War ruins, and kills and causes
misery. We gotta end it somehow.

719
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,370
How?

720
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,660
What if we have one final competition
the winner takes it all?

721
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,910
What kind of competition?

722
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,290
I don't know, you pick.

723
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,410
Whatever you wanna do
this all thing will be over.

724
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,910
-Whatever I want?
-Whatever you want.

725
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:49,410
Okay.

726
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,410
It's not a date.
It's just that we need a fourth in the team,

727
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,160
it needs to be a woman and
I don't know anyone else.

728
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,330
So Let me get this straight
you want me to help you

729
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,540
And your buddies
to beat up your grandson and his buddies

730
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:06,950
Because the two of you can't
figure out some way to live in the same house?

731
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,330
Well, when you put it like that...

732
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:13,870
I'm in.
my granddaughter can be a pain in the butt sometimes.

733
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,160
Holly Mary we're dead

734
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,700
Ah that's just an Intimidation tactic
Danny.

735
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,540
Don't let them see your fear
They feed of that.

736
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,160
They are like baby velociraptors.

737
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,370
Yeah, yeah, velociraptors.

738
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,040
Do you guys even remember
how to play dodgeball?

739
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,500
Did they even have dodgeball in the 1,800's?

740
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,870
They're wise ass kids, I know that.

741
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,750
Just remember not headses.

742
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,410
And no nutses.
No aiming for the junk.

743
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,580
Yeah what he said.

744
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,000
Hope you brought your Poligrip, old man?
'Cause those false teeth are comming out.

745
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,790
Big words for a little baby. Sure you don't need
your diaper changed?

746
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,660
Sure you don't?

747
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,040
-Men!
-tell me about it.

748
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,370
You're gonna love the attic, Grandpa.

749
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:09,410
You're gonna see about that
Pete boy.

750
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,790
-Let's get it on!
-Let's get it on!

751
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,660
Yeah!

752
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,200
Hi!

753
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,870
Run for your lives!

754
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,660
Fire!

755
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,330
Why did I agree to do this?

756
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,700
Man down.

757
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,410
Hey, we said, no headses!

758
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,200
Oops. It slipped.

759
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,790
Next game! A O P P Team: One.

760
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,620
A R P T team: none.

761
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,830
My ears are ringing. This is barbaric.

762
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:58,330
Man up, Danny, get in the game.

763
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,410
Who is this again?

764
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,250
Bring it in guys, bring it in

765
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,370
Obviously they are way
too fast for us.

766
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,250
We are gonna have to play our own way
if we wanna win this thing?

767
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,080
-Am I right
-yeah, yeah, yeah

768
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,120
Okay I have an idea...

769
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,870
Game two! position people!

770
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,950
Grab them!

771
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,450
Fire!

772
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,250
Yeah. Now you are in trouble.

773
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Boom!

774
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,000
Out! Out! Out! two catches
in a hit. You three.

775
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,910
Come on, you old cute, give me your best shot!

776
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,700
Well, if it is Mr. Headses!

777
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,250
Nutses.

778
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,250
Oops. Slipped.

779
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:05,830
That's game two. We're Tie. One on each.
Final match, the winner takes it all

780
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,910
You okay? Okay.

781
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,040
Positions people!

782
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,250
What's he doing?

783
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,540
Danny!

784
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,950
You are an animal!

785
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,750
Hell yeah, Whose house is this?

786
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,830
-Our house!
-Our house!

787
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,910
Yeah!

788
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Let's do this!

789
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,370
Jerry! What happened?

790
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:49,160
I broke something.

791
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,660
I definitely heard a pop.

792
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,950
Dude! I mean
old dude are you okay

793
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,120
Of course he is okay, dummy.

794
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,410
1,2,3,4.

795
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
You! get out!

796
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,580
chiss!

797
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,750
Hey, you can't get me, I'm on fire!

798
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,620
Sorry, Danny!

799
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,410
Oh, what's up son.

800
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,120
You two, out!

801
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,620
What?

802
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,700
That's not fair.

803
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,620
Yeah right, that doesn't count. He was already out
and he throws like a girl.

804
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,450
Diane, that was a friendly fire.
Are you playing for wrong agent now?

805
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,950
You three, out!

806
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,830
Sorry, Peter's grandpa,
but I'm gonna end you!

807
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,910
Hey, what happened to the sisterhood?

808
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,120
Sorry, Kid.

809
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,790
You will not a die in vain.

810
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,290
This is so dumb.

811
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah You're out now, off you go!

812
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,450
-Go ahead!
-Yeah.

813
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,080
- Come on, Peter! you've got this
-End him!

814
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,200
-Get your room back.
-Come on!

815
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,870
-Let's go!
-Finish him, Ed! yeah go Ed.

816
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:22,500
What are you waiting for? end it.
I've got an eight years old birthday party up next

817
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,120
It's a tie!

818
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,790
-No way!
-what!

819
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,000
What? No way! I totally
caught his ball before he caught mine.

820
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,290
No, I caught the ball first.

821
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,160
- Seriously, he caught it before him.
-He bubble his.

822
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:53,040
I didn't buble anything

823
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,250
He is got butter fingers.
See butter.

824
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,330
He is old, his fingers don't work.
I've got one finger that works

825
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:03,250
Okay, that's enough. Game over.
Go home. All of you, seriously.

826
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,660
I won this...yeah sure... I won

827
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,450
Are you kidding?...You lost I'm sorry, you know that...
What are you talking about, I obviously cought it before you

828
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,450
This place has a bar?

829
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,040
What's this?

830
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,080
I'm just drawing.

831
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:26,370
It doesn't look like one of your usual
what you call them "boxes".

832
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,500
Yeah.

833
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,500
No, don't get me wrong, I mean, It's interesting really
I like it. Is this for work?

834
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,000
No, the city is taking bid for
addition to the library so...

835
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,330
I thought
I'd submit a design.

836
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,580
But you know how it is. I'm sure They'll just pick one
of the big firms.

837
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:47,450
Well, you miss100 percent of the shots
if you don't take.

838
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,870
You know who said that?

839
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,620
Uh, no.

840
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:57,040
Wayne Gretzky.
Best hockey player of all time.

841
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,080
I was gonna...i was gonna say that.

842
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,410
The great one?

843
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,250
The greatest.

844
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,700
Still not a sports guy?

845
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,790
No.

846
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:05,870
Okay, good.

847
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,540
-Found him!
-Ready to sedate!

848
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,160
Just lie down, sir.

849
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,250
-What is this?
-Hold him!

850
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,450
We're trying to save
your life, sir. get that thing away from me!

851
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,200
Sir, you are not helping!...I just bought this you idiot

852
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,620
Don't worry, sir,
you are in good hands!

853
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,500
Get rid of that thing or you're dead!

854
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,580
Patient defends himself.
We may need restraints.

855
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,290
restraints.
I don't need restraints!

856
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:13,290
You know, I hate that test.

857
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,910
I think I did pretty good.

858
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,410
Get in the car.

859
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:27,330
Uh, thanks, but I think
I Just I'm gonna take the bus home with my friends.

860
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,080
Come on, get in the car.

861
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,580
Bye.

862
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,040
Friend of yours?

863
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,580
That's Chuck. You don't need
to know about Chuck.

864
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,500
Um ...

865
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,790
Where are we going?

866
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,500
Clear Lake. Nice place, you'll like it.

867
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,700
You know I'm only 12, right?

868
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,410
There's a lot of life still to live.

869
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,790
I can be president some day.

870
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,790
Or be the first person in a mission to Mars.

871
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,330
Holy heck!

872
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,370
Get out!

873
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,500
You know mom is expecting us for dinner.

874
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,290
Maybe I should call her,
let her know where we are.

875
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,000
No problem, we'll bringing dinner
home tonight

876
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,540
I rented for a couple of hours
. I thought, me and you

877
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,450
could do
a little fishing.  Together

878
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,950
How does that sound?

879
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,040
Great.

880
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,620
I mean I'm not gonna have fun.

881
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,290
You'll have fun.

882
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,330
I think I caught one.

883
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:23,160
What a wave, eh!
Gotta be a big one.

884
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,250
It's huge!
nice going

885
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,790
That's not a fish
that's a whale.

886
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,500
He really fought too.

887
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,450
We're gonna have some good eating tonight.

888
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,660
I'll give you some bait again.

889
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,750
Okay.

890
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,250
OK. cast away!

891
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,700
Nice cast.

892
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,250
Thanks. This is kind of fun.

893
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:54,160
Yeah it is. That's what happens when
we put our differences aside, see?

894
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,330
Are they biting?

895
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,700
Pretty good. Caught a couple of nice ones.

896
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,950
Oh good for you.
That's probably because

897
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,620
Not too many people fish here.
It's been ilegal.

898
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,080
-What?
-What?

899
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,160
You could ask the ranger.
Here he comes now

900
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,540
-Throw the fish out!
Those are our fish?

901
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,620
Throw the fish!

902
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,580
-Why?
-Make it up!

903
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,700
The cooller!

904
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,200
Forget the cooller.

905
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:30,080
You're breaking the law!

906
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,660
He's gaining on us.

907
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,700
He is gaining on us.

908
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,950
What are you doing?

909
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,500
I gotta call Chuck to pick us up.

910
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,200
He left us?
What kind of friend is that?

911
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,450
Friend? He is my Lyft driver.
I don't know the guy.

912
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,080
Pull over or
face the consequences!

913
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,790
Hold on, the landing will be tough.

914
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,790
Grandpa come on!

915
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,750
Hey, why didn't you tell us
there was no fishing?

916
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,660
You wouldn't rented the boat!

917
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,830
Stop, stop! hold it!

918
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,660
-That was so cool.
-Yes, it was.

919
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:35,540
But breaking the law
is wrong, you know that, right.

920
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,870
Yeah. I know.

921
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:48,080
Pull over here, Chuck.
I wanna show you something, Pete.

922
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,370
So this house
this house facade, I built it.

923
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,450
They changed the color,
I don't like that. What do you think?

924
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,750
I like it.

925
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,450
Maybe It's not so bad.

926
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,870
You know, over the years,
when I wasn't feeling so good

927
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,870
I came by and take a look.

928
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,370
I've seen people
living in a thing I built raising families

929
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,450
Making lives and...
I felt better.

930
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,000
Do you feel better now?

931
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,250
Yeah, I do.
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

932
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,410
-Yeah.
-come on.

933
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,000
People who build houses
usually sign their work,

934
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,500
Like an artists sign their paintings.

935
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,620
Really?

936
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,370
Yes, but It's always hidden.

937
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:42,410
Some guys sign their names on a rafter,
others put something under the floorboards

938
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:47,040
Like a newspaper with the date the
house was finished.

939
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,250
One guy used to write
poem at the bottom of a toilet

940
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,950
before
he installed it.

941
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,620
What did you do?
oh me, well

942
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,790
I always had one of my guys take
a picture of me and your grandmother.

943
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:03,000
And then I would sealed the picture inside the wall
next to the fireplace.

944
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,660
So there are photos of me and your grandmother

945
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,080
Inside the walls
all over this partner city.

946
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,950
Nobody knows but you

947
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,290
And now you do.

948
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,830
That's cool.

949
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,950
<i>We'll make an angler out of you yet, kid.</i>

950
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,080
<i>Maybe next
time we will find a lake with a lot of fish...</i>

951
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,540
<i>Oh yes there are plenty of lakes

01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,540

965
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,870
Did you put the words in that one?

966
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,450
I'm doing that right now.

967
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,160
<i>"Come celebrate Jennifer's super fun
Christmas theme birthday party"</i>

968
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,330
Great job.

969
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,500
Do you like it?

970
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
Love it.

971
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,540
Is this empty?

972
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,580
Thanks Ed. for coming.
You never like to go alone on such occasions.

973
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,700
Carl was one of my long time
adventures buddies.

974
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,250
He'll be missing, the old warrior.

975
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,700
How is he...? You already know...

976
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:25,660
Fell asleep. When skydiving.

977
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,910
Looking good bro.

978
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,870
So did you come here alone?

979
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,660
That's my husband.

980
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,120
I could drive you home.

981
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,200
What the...

982
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,790
Sorry.

983
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,250
Crap.

984
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,000
What? Damn it!

985
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,830
Sorry about this, Carl.

986
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,580
I don't know this guy.

987
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,620
So, grandpa.
How was the funeral yesterday?

988
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,750
Really nice. Thanks for asking.

989
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:53,790
How about you?
anything exciting happen at school .

990
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,160
No. Unless you call getting punched in the face

991
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,870
By a a giant eight grader exciting

992
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:59,950
Really?

993
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,120
Yeap.

994
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,410
What happened?

995
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,620
He got a full load of orange juice
as soon as he opened up my backpack.

996
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,870
It's so weird right?

997
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,700
Hello boys.

998
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:11,870
Hey, Dad.

999
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,870
Hey, I'll set this stuff down
and I'll help you

1000
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,700
to put the lights on the roof, Ed.

1001
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:20,450
Thanks Arthur. I said "Arthur".

1002
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,290
Don't you two make a nice team.

1003
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,790
Jenny's birthday is going to be so exciting.

1004
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
All that's left to do is
find Santha Claus

1005
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,250
In early september
and I'll be done.

1006
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:34,410
Don't you worry yourself. I know
Santa personally. Consider it done.

1007
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,120
Thanks dad. That's so sweet.

1008
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,370
That's the least I can do for Jenny.

1009
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:45,040
Mom, before you say "no", hear me out.

1010
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,000
Can Russell
come to Jennifer's birthday party?

1011
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,370
-No.
-What?

1012
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,700
Why? Peter's friends got to go.

1013
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,580
That reminds me
I invited Jerry and the crew if that's okay.

1014
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,910
Yeah, that's great.

1015
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,330
And you don't see how unfair this is?

1016
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,910
I hate you!

1017
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,750
I don't wanna hear it.

1018
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Hey, Peter?

1019
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:09,370
Yeah?

1020
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:17,200
Listen ...you know In World War I, the
Germans and the British put down their weapons on Christmas Eve

1021
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:21,330
In favor of celebrating rather than
fighting during the holiday

1022
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,750
Your sister's birthday is a
special occasion, it should be celebrated.

1023
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,290
I guess you are right

1024
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:31,450
Ok, then let's agree on a
temporary truce for Jenny.

1025
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,290
Deal?

1026
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,160
Deal.

1027
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,450
No!

1028
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,500
Oh, stop it! You are hurting me Au.

1029
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,120
That looks like fun.

1030
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,120
Yeah, lots of fun.

1031
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,080
We like fun too.

1032
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,120
I forgot, I got detention today.

1033
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,410
Looks like you are on your own.

1034
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,950
I have a question, Do you know my grandson, Peter Decker?

1035
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,830
Thought so.

1036
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:20,250
-Dumpster.
-What?

1037
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:22,830
Don't make it harder
than it has to be, kid.

1038
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,200
Come on, fat man.

1039
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,370
-Who are you guys?
-Come on!

1040
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,120
Disciplinary Board.

1041
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,290
Leave Peter alone, understood?

1042
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:37,830
Phew, overripe. Not your lucky day,
tough guy. Get him in there

1043
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,450
No! No! Not! No!

1044
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:42,750
Nasty!

1045
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,660
Get me out of here! Hello?

1046
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,540
Wow!

1047
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,700
Merry birthday, sweetheart.

1048
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:00,500
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JENNIFER!

1049
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,500
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

1050
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,500
It is quiet. Too quiet.

1051
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,790
Billy, they agreed.
His grandpa is not gonna do anything.

1052
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,660
If my grandpa makes a move I'll be ready
See that Santa's chair?

1053
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,330
SANTA'S WORKSHOP

1054
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,000
A booby trap it.

1055
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,250
Did somebody say booby?

1056
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,040
Go away, Steve.

1057
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,370
The egg nog taste funny.

1058
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,120
Let me fix it for you.

1059
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:03,830
Hey everybody! Guess Who's Here!

1060
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:07,700
Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas,
Here comes Santa!

1061
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,540
-Yes, Santa Claus!
-Juchhu!

1062
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,200
You better watch out,
You better not pout.

1063
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,370
Toys and goodies.
I've got everything.

1064
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,040
Wait a second. That's not my grandpa.

1065
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:19,830
Ed?

1066
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:23,450
No thanks. I've gotta stay alert.
Just in case.

1067
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,620
Kid wouldn't have the cojones to do anything.
You shook on it.

1068
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,000
You never know
you can't trust these kids.

1069
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,120
Hey, Grandpa.

1070
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,500
Hey Nice party, ah pal?

1071
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:36,370
Sure is, buddy but I...
I thought you were playing Santa Claus?

1072
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,910
Me? Oh no,
I'll leave that to the professionists.

1073
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,330
Jerry've been more Santa ever since he retired.
Have a problem, Pete?

1074
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:44,700
Why would that be a problem?

1075
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:49,660
Just asking. Hey, you wanna hand me
one of those soda over there?

1076
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,450
Thanks, kiddo.

1077
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,330
The kid is up to something, I can feel it.

1078
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,660
That is just a coincidence.

1079
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,870
Ho Ho Ho. And what's your name?

1080
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:14,750
Let me guess. It wasn't a name 20 years ago
Am I right?

1081
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,580
-Peter?
-Dad, what's up?

1082
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:19,500
Do you know where Mia is?
She's supposed to help me with the hot dogs.

1083
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,160
-Nope.
-Okay, come on I can use your help.

1084
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:35,200
Hey grandpa. What happened to you?
You're all wet.

1085
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,120
Some questions don't have answers, Pete.

1086
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,660
Hey, Cooky?

1087
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,700
-No, It's okay.
-Oh, They're delicious.

1088
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,250
-No, it is really fine.
-Especially this one.

1089
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,870
-I'm good.
-You sure?

1090
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,160
I'm sure.

1091
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,290
Wanna help me get some mustard and ketchup
on this bad boys

1092
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,450
And get them out to the kids
before they get cold?

1093
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:56,660
Sounds good, dad. I'll be the front row
you'll be the back?

1094
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,080
You are the boss.

1095
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:04,330
I'm so sorry
That just slipped.

1096
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:07,500
I swear I didn't mean to do that.

1097
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,540
What you gotta do?

1098
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,120
Oh darn. Bottles
must be overly full.

1099
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,790
Hey dad? The Christmas lights are on the fritz again
could you check on them?

1100
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:20,910
I'm on it.

1101
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,080
Yeah, and Peter, check on the air pump
for the bouncy house?

1102
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,790
It could be a little bit...bouncier.

1103
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,660
What the heck is he up to now?

1104
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,200
Grandpa!

1105
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,700
Dad!

1106
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:06,950
Dad!

1107
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,870
Dad are you alright?

1108
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,660
I'm Okay.
Found a quarter in it.

1109
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:20,870
Peter, we said no pranks.

1110
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,330
We shook hands on a man to man
it. What happened?

1111
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,790
What are you talking about?

1112
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,000
Grandpa, I swear
I didn't do that!

1113
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,950
Santa is dead.

1114
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,620
Okay, I might have do that.

1115
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,120
That is not good.

1116
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,540
Danny, Ed, ...

1117
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,540
Did you see that? Epic.

1118
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:53,080
Here comes Santa. Ho Ho Ho!

1119
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,250
Oh...My fakes!

1120
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,790
Jerry! You alright?

1121
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:59,830
What happened?

1122
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,620
Fire!

1123
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,080
Everybody get back! I've got this.

1124
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,700
Dad, I'll get the hose.

1125
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,790
Okay. Pull the grip, got it ...

1126
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:16,580
<i>"Put away from face ..."
</i> I am blind, I am blind!

1127
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,200
I've got it!

1128
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,910
Grandpa, get out of the way!

1129
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,790
My Christmas tree!

1130
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,200
My Christmas birthday cake!

1131
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,410
Oh, what have we done?

1132
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
No no!

1133
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,540
Peter!

1134
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:19,870
Hi, Mom.

1135
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,040
Mia? Russell?

1136
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,500
Don't you run away, Russell!

1137
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,120
Nothing happened.

1138
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,750
Okay, this in not my fault.

1139
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:37,830
Hey help, anybody?

1140
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,080
That's a pretty good
scratch there, Mr. Marino.

1141
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,410
Yeah?, you should see the tree.

1142
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,160
Thank you.

1143
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,950
What? What? It's nothing.
I'll be alright.

1144
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,830
Sure you'll be alright.
Dad's always alright.

1145
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:02,580
Doesn't need anyone's help
or love

1146
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,330
Oh Sally, please come on.

1147
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,830
You could have been killed! dad

1148
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:09,000
Come on, you're over dramatizing.
It was an accident, that's all.

1149
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,620
-An accident?
-Yeah.

1150
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,410
well, do you think I dont know
about the "war"?

1151
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,750
Dad ... or should I say "senior soldier"?

1152
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:17,830
Oh, oh that.

1153
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,200
What were you two thinking?

1154
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:21,450
Don't blame the kid, sally
Please, it's all on me

1155
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:24,000
I'm the grown up here,
I should've known better.

1156
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,040
Yeah you should have.

1157
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,450
I'm so sorry.
I just got out of hand.

1158
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,500
I have the money to pay for everything.

1159
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,660
I'll take my crew
and we'll fix everything the way it was.

1160
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,830
It's not about the house
or the money, Dad.

1161
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,410
If you hated living with us so much,
you just should have said it.

1162
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,540
I never said I hated
living with you.

1163
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,040
Exactly, I just said you never said.

1164
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,950
Well I'm saying, I never said that.
We cleared that up, hopefully?

1165
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,450
No! Forget about what you never said

1166
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,910
The, the point is I just stop..., when you come home with us,
you realized that we loved you

1167
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,620
And you changed your mind
about living alone.

1168
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,620
Of course that didn't happen.

1169
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,950
You were so hell bend on ...

1170
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:06,120
...Comming it up.

1171
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,290
-Are you okay, Grandpa?
-Yeah, grandpa is fine.

1172
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,000
Listen sweetheart Im really sorry about
what happen in birthday party.

1173
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,950
It's okay. I brought you something
to make you feel better.

1174
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,790
That's very nice. But I gave
that to you, remember?

1175
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,160
Don't you want it?

1176
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:25,330
I think you need that more
You can call it loan.

1177
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,660
That's very adult of you
sweetheart.

1178
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,000
You'll be able to take him home soon.

1179
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,160
The doctor just need to review
the x-rays.

1180
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,000
We'll be in the waiting room.

1181
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,620
Can I go see him now?

1182
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,750
No, no. It will be a long time before
we leave the two of you

1183
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,500
alone together again
...ever.

1184
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,620
Is he gonna be okay?

1185
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,870
He'll be fine. You and Mia, On the other hand,
that's a different story.

1186
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:05,790
You are both cho-grounded
for the next six months.

1187
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,700
Cho-grounded? What does that even mean?

1188
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:09,540
Chores plus grounded.

1189
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:10,870
Time six months.

1190
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,290
-What?
-Yeah, yeah

1191
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:14,450
So, that's a whole out of both isn't it?

1192
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,700
But I didn't even do half of the stuff that peter did.
That is so not fair.

1193
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,700
Can I be cho-grounded too?

1194
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,160
No, sweety, you don't have to be cho-grounded.

1195
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:27,950
Russell!

1196
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,870
Don't you move a muscle!

1197
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:34,370
What? Wait. Mom! come on

1198
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,450
Russell?!

1199
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,450
Dad, can you think rational...

1200
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,540
Russell!

1201
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:40,790
But she said not to move.

1202
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,540
Get away from me!

1203
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,870
Get back in, coward!

1204
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Come!

1205
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,160
Okay, that's it. Mom is certifiedly
insane. I'm going out there.

1206
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:01,410
Wo, wo, wo. Hold on, hold on, I know your mother
She's can handle this.

1207
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,540
You won't slam me, right Mrs. Decker?

1208
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:15,790
No.

1209
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,000
What's happening right now?

1210
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,580
What's happening right now is
I'm not gonna lose two years of my daughter, Russell.

1211
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:32,120
Come on take it
before I change my mind.

1212
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,410
Come by the house tomorrow.

1213
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Really?

1214
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:40,500
Yeah. And bring some work clothes.

1215
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:45,580
I have this giant hole on the second floor.
Needs fixing.

1216
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,250
Okay.

1217
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,450
How that go?

1218
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,410
Thanks a lot mom.

1219
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,000
I didn't hurt him.

1220
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,000
Everything is gonna be alright.

1221
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,750
Let's go get Grandpa and go home.

1222
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,870
Excuse me, could you check on Mr. Marino,
see if he is ready to go?

1223
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:13,000
Oh, he left already.
I thought you all left.

1224
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,950
He said his brother was picking him up.

1225
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,040
Brothers?

1226
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,450
Yeah. Chuck ...?

1227
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,910
Chuck.

1228
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,370
Who is chuck

1229
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:29,040
Dad?

1230
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:30,370
Ed?

1231
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,330
Grandpa! Grandpa!

1232
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:36,370
Grandpa!

1233
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:45,790
Mom!

1234
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,500
I just called the phone of Jerry, He haven't seen him.

1235
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,450
I shouldn't have
pushed him so hard.

1236
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,660
It's Peter's fault.
He needed grandpa to go away.

1237
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:10,410
Yeah peter But at least you
got your room back, happy now?

1238
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,330
Peter? You still with us.

1239
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,370
I think I know where Grandpa went.

1240
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:27,290
I like the fireplace a lot.
They don't make it like this anymore.

1241
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:32,040
Thanks.
You know there are secrets inside these walls .

1242
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,450
Wait!

1243
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:46,290
I started this,
I'd like to be the one to end this.

1244
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:52,450
Hi, Chuck.

1245
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,790
-Grandpa!
-Peter.

1246
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,830
hm, what's going on? You moved
out of your room

1247
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:13,080
It's your room, kiddo.
It always was.

1248
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,660
I've decided
I want you to have it.

1249
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:19,160
I don't want you to leave, Grandpa.

1250
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:22,120
Peter, I think we both know that
the room will always be between us.

1251
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,790
No it won't.
besides I love the attic.

1252
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:28,580
I don't know why I got mad about the old,
smelly room in the first place.

1253
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,290
Honest. See, you've gotta
come back.

1254
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,620
It's not that easy, kiddo.

1255
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:41,500
I'll do anything. I'll get back every marble
for you, I swear.

1256
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,580
Oh, Pete.

1257
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:47,250
Grandpa, please. I feel so ashamed
of how I acted

1258
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:50,330
I just wanna crawl up
ball and die.

1259
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,540
It's all my fault.

1260
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,080
No, don't you believe that for one second.
We both have fault.

1261
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,790
You were just defending what was yours.

1262
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:04,450
Maybe this is how  a war gets started
and just goes on and on.

1263
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:10,290
Your enemy does something bad to you,
so you do something worse back to him.

1264
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:12,750
And he gets you back, and you get him back.

1265
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,250
And the whole thing just gets
worse and worse.

1266
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:19,580
And then at the end
somebody just drops a bomb.

1267
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,160
Isn't it how it happens?

1268
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,750
That's how it happens.

1269
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,580
I never want to go to war.

1270
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,200
I'm very glad to hear you say that.

1271
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,580
And I hope to God
you'll never have to.

1272
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,330
Can I tell you something more?

1273
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:39,620
I kind of enjoyed messing
with the fellow crazy man.

1274
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:40,910
Really?

1275
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,500
Yeah. It helped me get off
of my sad grief of your grandmother.

1276
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:48,910
plus ... you got me pretty good
a couple of times .

1277
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,660
Not as good as you got me.

1278
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:53,290
Yeah.

1279
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:56,410
Please come home, Grandpa.

1280
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,660
Come here.

1281
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,000
3 MONTHS LATER

1282
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,580
<i>Well, Mr. Decker,
your sign it right there.</i>

1283
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,830
You know
I was gonna cut this tree down by myself.

1284
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,000
But my wife has that whole
chainsaw thing.

1285
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,790
You know I can use the chainsaw
any time I want.

1286
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:33,330
Yeah, I believe that man,
if you need anything else

1287
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,870
Just give a call
at the office, alright?

1288
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,250
I mean, I can use it
anytime I want .

1289
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,750
A little more dignity, please.

1290
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:42,290
It's just a chainsaw.

1291
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,610

1292
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:20,000
Hey grandpa. I'm ready to
go fishing.

1293
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:23,790
Oh, Petey,I guess I forgot to tell you.
I can't take you fishing today.

1294
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:26,910
Why? It's saturday
