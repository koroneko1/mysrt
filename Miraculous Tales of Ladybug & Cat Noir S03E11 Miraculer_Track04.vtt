00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.260

‎-Today's the day!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.100
‎How embarrassing! Without me,
‎they look ridiculous, utterly ridiculous!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.100
‎Come on, Ladybug, you need help!
‎Come and fetch Chloé!

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.300
‎Oh, yeah, sorry!
‎Come and fetch Queen Bee!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.660
‎Mayura, Ladybug and Cat Noir
‎are in trouble!

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.700
‎Chloé is already waiting for her,
‎like she always does.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.500
‎Perfect. Be ready in case Ladybug
‎goes and hands her the Bee Miraculous.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.940
<i>‎But Ladybug calls her lucky charm</i>
<i>‎and gets... a rubber duck?</i>

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.260
<i>‎What'll she do with that,</i>
<i>‎while Cat Noir, Rena Rouge and... ?</i>

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.860
‎Come on!
‎What are you waiting for? You need me!

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.820
<i>‎OK! Of course! That's brilliant!</i>
<i>‎And Ladybug pulls it off yet again!</i>

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.940
<i>‎She's defeated Destroyer,</i>
<i>‎with the help of all her friends.</i>

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.220
‎All? All? What about Queen Bee?

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.700
‎-That's really not cool.
‎-Oh, you so don't get it!

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.780
‎Ladybug only calls on me when she has
‎serious villains to contend with!

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.060
‎Uh, yeah, of course!

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
‎Wayzz, shell off!!

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.060
‎Trixx, let's rest!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.900
‎And don't forget, nobody
‎can ever know our secret identities.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.340
‎-Except us, of course.
‎-Thank you! See you again next time!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
‎-Still haven't spoken to her, huh?
‎-It's dangerous to use Chloé!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.580
‎Everybody knows that she was Queen Bee!
‎Everyone including Hawk Moth!

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.620
‎He could use it to trap us! That's why
‎our identities must remain a secret.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.820
‎And the best-kept secrets are the ones
‎you don't share. Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.940
‎I don't think Chloé knows
‎her time as Queen Bee is over.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.060
‎I know. I just haven't had time to tell
‎her! And... and I won't today either!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.900
‎-I'm about to transform back!
‎-Milady, promise me you'll talk to her.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.540
‎It's the right thing to do.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.220
‎Yeah, sure!

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.540
‎Chloé Bourgeois
‎must become Queen Bee again!

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.900
‎Are you still considering
‎making her an ally?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.060
‎Ladybug has grown reluctant
‎to give Chloé the Miraculous.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.500
‎-She's being very careful.
‎-Then I'll get Chloé to force to Ladybug

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.420
‎to give it to her. All I need
‎is for her to lose all hope in Ladybug

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.180
‎to become angry enough
‎so I can akumatize her.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.220
‎Maybe it's time we bring Lila Rossi's
‎psychological talents into the plan.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.700
‎Excellent idea, Nathalie.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.900
‎I want to thank you for trusting me,
‎Mr Agreste.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.340
‎I'm very honoured
‎to be able to protect Adrien.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.740
‎But I'm saddened
‎by all the people around him.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.660
‎Your son deserves better
‎than that friend of his, Nino.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.220
‎Not to mention all the girls
‎clamouring to catch his eye,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300
‎especially Marinette
‎and that stuck-up Chloé!

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.260
‎Chloé! Pff! She won't stop bragging
‎about being Queen Bee!

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.220
‎But Adrien couldn't care less
‎about these girls. He's just so perfect!

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.140
‎I don't think Adrien's
‎completely indifferent to Chloé!

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.660
‎They've had a strong friendship since
‎they were young that no one can ruin.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.500
‎-Thank you, Lila. I'll see you tomorrow.
‎-Yes. See you tomorrow.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.460
‎I'm sure that this young lady
‎will help us implement our grand plan.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.540
‎Rena Rouge and Carapace are so tacky!

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.540
‎I just don't understand why Ladybug
‎keeps calling them in when I, Queen Bee...

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.580
‎-Good morning, everyone!
‎-Hey, Lila!

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.660
‎Yeah. Let's go study for that test.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.140
‎-What test?
‎-The Science test this afternoon.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.100
‎-Argh!
‎-Come on, I'll get you up to speed!

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.620
‎-Were you talking about Ladybug?
‎-Uh... Who are you, again?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.380
‎-That's Lila. She's in our class.
‎-Really?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.260
‎Well, she clearly didn't make
‎a big impression on me.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.500
‎Ha, ha, ha!
‎Oh, I love your sense of humour!

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.780
‎I remember now
‎that Ladybug's mentioned it a few times.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.260
‎-You talk to Ladybug?
‎-Course!

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.620
‎She and I are very close friends. A bit
‎like you used to be, back in the day.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.300
‎Whenever I feel like seeing her,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.980
‎I've a magic command
‎that calls her to me right away!

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.940
‎-Magic?
‎-Yeah.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.060
‎Just like your signal to summon her,
‎except mine works every time!

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.940
‎Well, to each her own.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.100
‎Don't you want to know what it is?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.620
‎If you insist.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.780
‎If Ladybug
‎doesn't come to you with that,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.140
‎then you'll know she's not a true friend!

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.020
‎Go ahead! I'll meet you!

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.580
‎Uh...

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
‎-Chloé?
‎-What do you want, Dupain-Cheng?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.460
‎I don't know what Lila just told you,
‎but you should watch out for her.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.420
‎Besides, I'm sure Ladybug will come and
‎see you anyway, with or without magic.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.900
‎-Are you making fun of me?
‎-No! No, I'm not!

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.740
‎I can see Ladybug
‎whenever I feel like it, OK?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.980
‎So mind your own business, Dupain-Cheng!

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.980
‎-You really ought to talk to Chloé!
‎-But I just did!

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.620
‎-It's pointless, obviously!
‎-No! Marinette talked to Chloé.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.180
‎The only person
‎Chloé listens to is Ladybug.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.380
‎ You're right.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.580
‎Our ally is living up to our expectations.
‎I can already feel Chloé's anger rising.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.100
‎-Get ready, Mayura.
‎-Yes, Hawk Moth.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.060
‎It's time.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.220
‎Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.500
‎Lollipop! Lollipop!

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.660
‎No, Auguste! I've told you already.
‎You're too little to have lollipops!

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.900
‎Fly away, beautiful amok.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.740
‎Enhance and hone that frustration.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.300
‎Lollipop!

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.740
‎Oh!

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.780
‎A sentimonster! Sorry, Chloé,
‎you're ‎gonna‎ have to wait a bit longer!

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.380
‎Today's the day!

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.620
‎-Welcome back... !
‎-Move, Jean-Gaspard!

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.900
‎Thank you. I'll be safe now.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.900
‎You're right. It's nice and safe in here.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.500
‎How about we just hang and wait
‎for a camembert monster instead?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.980
‎If we run into one,
‎I'll save you a big chunk!

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.220
‎Come on. Plagg, claws out!

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.860
‎Look out, Milady!
‎Lollipops are bad for your teeth!

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.940
‎I don't see an akumati‎s‎ed person anywhere!

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.460
‎Seems like this sentimonster
‎is all on its own!

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.740
‎-Come on, hurry!
<i>‎-Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.740
<i>‎The battle between Ladybug</i>
<i>‎and the monster has begun!</i>

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.620
‎If Ladybug doesn't show up,
‎I could go fetch our costumes

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.060
‎-and we could play dress-up.
‎-That's right, go fetch the costumes.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.580
‎Come on!

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.900
<i>‎I've got a magic command</i>
<i>‎that calls her to me right away!</i>

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.020
<i>‎Don't you want to know what it is?</i>

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.700
‎No, that would be ridiculous,
‎utterly ‎ri‎...

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.180
‎Ladybug, Ladybug, Ladybug!

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.620
‎Mademoiselle seemed
‎a little upset earlier.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.780
‎Get lost, Jean-Pascal!

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.940
‎Mademoiselle
‎needs a few minutes to herself.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.460
‎Gotcha! Bye-bye, little feather.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.660
<i>‎Miraculous Ladybug!</i>

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.340
‎But I did the magic dance! Ladybug
‎wouldn't have forgotten all about me!

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.940
‎That smart-‎alec‎ idiot at school
‎took me for a ride!

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.860
‎Yes, I feel the anger rising.
‎My plan is rolling out beautifully!

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.820
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise her!

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.820
‎That's OK.
‎We can still play Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.780
‎Play? With you? Who are you anyway?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.220
‎You don't have any powers.
‎You're a nobody!

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.940
‎I'm a superheroine, OK? I am Queen Bee!
‎You and I have nothing in common! Go away!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.020
‎My dear Chloé Bourgeois,
‎this is Hawk Moth.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.900
‎Ladybug wants to strip you
‎of your superpowers?

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.620
‎Well, I can empower you.
‎Come with me,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.220
‎and we will recover
‎the Bee Miraculous together.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.220
‎We will be a team,
‎and your powers will know no limits!

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.820
‎No, Hawk Moth!
‎I'm a superheroine! I am Queen Bee!

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.980
‎Ladybug will come and get me when
‎she needs me. I will never join you!

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.140
‎Chloé Bourgeois really is quite... unique.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.620
‎But I can feel a negative emotion
‎not far from her. A friend

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.460
‎who could help us achieve our goal.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.580
‎Follow it, my evil akuma.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.260
‎<i>‎ Stop tickling me!</i>

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.580
‎Miraculer!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.020
‎Your friend has rejected you because she's
‎only interested in other people's powers.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.140
‎Well, I'm giving you the power
‎to steal those powers from them

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.140
‎and win back your friendship.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.540
‎And, in return, you will bring me
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.260
‎Thank you, Hawk Moth.
‎Chloé and I will be a real team, at last!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.140
‎Pound it!

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.740
‎Hey, you're on the late side.
‎The fight was five minutes ago!

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.500
‎"The fight was five minutes ago."
‎Actually, it's right now!

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.540
‎You've neglected Chloé
‎one time too many, Ladybug!

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.780
‎I guess you didn't
‎work things out with her.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.460
‎-I was about to, but...
‎-"I was about to, but..."

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.100
‎Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.660
‎Cat Noir, I'm ‎gonna‎ transform back
‎at any second!

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.980
‎-"Ooh! Help me, Cat Noir!"
‎-I don't even talk like that!

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.460
‎Stop mimicking me!

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.820
‎Lucky charm!

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.580
‎-What have you done?
‎-She's swiped your power!

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.140
‎That copycat! Get ‎backup‎! I'll handle her!

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.580
‎Cataclysm!

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.700
‎What's the phrase again?
‎Oh! Cataclysm!

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.460
‎Oh, Chloé's ‎gonna‎ love our powers!

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.300
‎I'm sure you're right, Miraculer!
‎Run and find her, now!

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.940
‎Plagg, claws in!

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.300
‎So, that's what it feels like
‎to get cataclysmed!

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.180
‎I promise I'll never call the dinosaurs
‎a bunch of wusses ever again!

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.780
‎Plagg, grab some camembert in my jacket.
‎We'll rest till Ladybug comes back.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.300
‎Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
‎you must pick an ally you can trust

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.380
‎to fight alongside you on this mission.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.580
‎Once the mission is over, you will get
‎the Miraculous back and return them to me.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.100
‎Miraculer has stolen both of our powers.
‎We're going to need everyone.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.260
‎-Even... Chloé?
‎-This person is her best friend!

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.740
‎If anyone can help us, it's Chloé!

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.900
‎-You sure?
‎-It might be the last time,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.540
‎but we definitely need her this time!

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.060
‎-Cat Noir? Are you OK?
‎-It's nothing.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.700
‎I just got cataclysmed in the ribs.
‎I'll be fine.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.180
‎I promise you we'll get our powers back,
‎Cat Noir, and I'll heal you!

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.900
‎I can't wait!

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.660
‎Aaah!

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.980
<i>‎-We don't know how Ladybug and Cat Noir--</i>
‎-Chloé!

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.740
‎I have powers now.
‎We can play together again!

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.500
‎-Sabrina?
‎-I'm Miraculer now!

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.180
‎I've stolen Cat Noir and Ladybug's
‎superpowers. Do you want Ladybug's?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.900
‎Then you can be Ladybug
‎and I'll be Cat Noir!

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.660
‎-Just like we've always dreamed of!
‎-Not like this!

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.900
‎You are so far off the mark!
‎I don't want to be Ladybug!

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.380
‎There's only one Ladybug and she isn't me!
‎I am...

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.980
‎Queen Bee?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.980
‎Ah! About time too!

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.220
‎Right on time.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.380
‎Hey!

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.660
‎-Who are you?
‎-I am Mayura!

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.980
‎If you team up with us,
‎your dream will finally come true!

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.460
‎-She's with Hawk Moth and me!
‎-Watch out.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.420
‎It sounds like a nightmare to me!

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.860
‎You'll be the one living the nightmare,
‎Kitty!

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.620
‎-We're getting good at this!
‎-Focus, Turtle Boy!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.460
‎Lucky charm! Cataclysm!

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.460
‎Ha!

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.620
‎We wouldn't be in this situation
‎if you and Ladybug had gotten me sooner!

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.900
‎-Thanks, Chloé, that's super helpful!
‎-If I'd had my Bee Miraculous,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.220
‎I could have helped you!
‎I'd have floored those two by now!

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.900
‎-Finally!
‎-Shh! I've got a plan. Just listen.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.540
‎Stay still, you mangy cat!
‎Here, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on!

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.340
‎Sabrina! I've changed my mind!

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.620
‎I do want Ladybug's power!
‎They should have gotten me sooner!

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.980
‎But since they chose not to, I've decided
‎I'd rather play with you instead!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.340
‎Perfect! Just as I planned it!

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.980
‎Mayura, grab Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.340
‎Oh, I'm so happy!
‎We're going to have so much fun!

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.660
‎Here's Ladybug's power!

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.260
‎Thank you, Miraculer!
‎I really needed that back!

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.740
‎You confused me for a pathetic illusion
‎and you claim to be my best friend?

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.860
‎-Huh?
‎-Not on my watch!

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.060
‎Cataclysm!

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.140
‎-Cat Noir!
‎-I'm sorry, Milady.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.780
‎-I held out for as long as I could.
‎-Lucky Charm! Cataclysm!

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.340
‎Shelter!

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.420
‎Come back, Mayura.
‎You've got the Bee Miraculous already.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.940
‎Miraculer will take care
‎of Cat Noir and Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.660
‎I got this!

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.660
‎Lost something?

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.860
‎Chloé! Follow Mayura!
‎She's probably going back to Hawk Moth.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.260
‎You won't regret this, Ladybug!

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.260
‎Pollen, buzz on!

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.100
‎Chloé!

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.580
‎Where did she go?
‎Ladybug's going to think I'm incompetent!

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.220
‎Don't mess with Bee! Stand still!

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.540
‎Let me ask you just one question.
‎Do you enjoy being Ladybug's servant?

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.820
‎Having to wait
‎for the loan of a Miraculous?

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.700
‎Wouldn't you rather
‎have boundless powers of your own?

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.540
‎-That's three questions.
‎-Come with us, Chloé.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.180
‎You can be Queen Bee
‎whenever you want.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.380
‎Ladybug gave me a new chance,
‎so I'll give her one too.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.580
‎You'll regret this!

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.660
‎You'll regret underestimating me,
‎you despicable bird!

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.900
‎What would happen if I took this from you?

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.420
‎Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
‎Where did she go?

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.500
‎Mirage!

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.900
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.860
‎Shelter!

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.020
‎Good luck getting hold of my akuma now!

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.940
‎Lucky charm!

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.860
‎A pillow?

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.060
‎The more there are of you,
‎the dumber you get!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.900
‎What am I supposed to do with this?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.220
‎-Tickles!
‎-Of course!

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.940
‎-I thought we were friends!
‎-Well, you were wrong!

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.180
‎Sabrina is my friend, not Miraculer!

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.420
‎-Ha, ha, ha! That tickles!
‎-Want some more?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.460
‎No! No! Shelter!

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.460
‎No more evil-doing for you,
‎little akuma.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.060
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.500
‎Gotcha!

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.140
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.020
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.340
‎Ladybug, Mayura got away from me.
‎I'm sorry, utterly sorry.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.660
‎That's OK, Queen Bee.
‎We'll get her next time.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.820
‎If you'd given it to me earlier, we
‎probably would've defeated Hawk Moth.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.260
‎I'm sorry, Chloé. I should have
‎told you this a long time ago.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.820
‎I might never be able
‎to let you be Queen Bee again.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.060
‎What?
‎But I did everything you asked me to!

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.700
‎I know. But this is for your own safety.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.260
‎It's too dangerous for you, because
‎Hawk Moth knows that you're Queen Bee.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.940
‎Buzz off!

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.780
‎I understand. But I'm sure
‎that you'll need me again, Ladybug.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.540
‎I know that I'll be Queen Bee again,
‎some day. I will always be Queen Bee.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.180
‎-Thank you, Chloé.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.060
‎Let's go!

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.540
‎Ladies...

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.300
‎I guess you'll never
‎want to play with me again, now.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.780
‎Of course I will.
‎I just don't want to be Ladybug any more.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.820
‎-You can keep the costume if you want.
‎-Oh, goody!

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.260
‎I'm sorry, Hawk Moth. I failed.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.580
‎No, Mayura.
‎We've set the stage for the future.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.300
‎Queen Bee will change her mind.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.540
‎-Hey! You!
‎-Chloé!

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.940
‎That magic code you told me,
‎to call Ladybug.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.900
‎-It was just a big joke, wasn't it?
‎-Of course it wasn't!

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.940
‎-Why? Weren't you with Ladybug yesterday?
‎-Uh... Yes.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.740
‎-So it worked, then.
‎-Uh... Yes.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.220
‎Ugh! OK, fine.
‎You're not completely useless!

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.180
‎I hope I didn't hurt Chloé's feelings
‎too much. She's worked so hard.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.540
‎It's for her own good.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.740
‎And you're also protecting
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir by doing that!

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.340
‎That's what being
‎a superheroine is all about!
