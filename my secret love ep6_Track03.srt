Kritsada Bhakdi.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,125
I have a new prank idea.

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,963

it's up to you.

And now you can get out of my room!

12
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:33,392
Tim, it's time for you to get the taste of
Shrimp Paste Goddess.

13
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:35,714
It's decorated with orange to add a sense of refreshment...

14
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:37,000
Tim!

15
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:40,645
Mek changed it. He said you said
the other one can't be used.

16
00:00:41,346 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry. That was not at all my intention.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I didn't know he's allergic to shrimp paste.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,622
I suppose this bad habit of yours cannot be cured.

19
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,240
In the end, all you do is make rubbish content.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,668
He'd already apologized and you still said that to him.

21
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,470
Dao!

22
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:15,000
The situation is concerning around here.

23
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,000
It's almost noon and Kim hasn't come out of his room yet.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,484
He never makes me miss breakfast ever.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,701
Same here, Q.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,840
Mek was driving like we were in Fast & Furious.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,977
I thought I was in Dominic Toretto's car.

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,807
Seriously, I was so nervous all the way.

29
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:36,000
We can't just let this go on.

30
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,414
How about you send me your location real quick?

31
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll bring Kim there asap.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sure, Captain Q! I'll do it!

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,747
Okay, Captain Dao!

34
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:55,379
Here.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,752
Kim.

36
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,745
Are you awake?

37
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,792
Yes. What's up?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here's the thing.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,668
You seem to be in such a bad mood lately.

40
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:22,115
I think you should go relax somewhere.

41
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:32,848
Relax where?

42
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:37,109
Like...we go chill somewhere nice.
Enjoy some good vibes.

43
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:38,178
So you can feel better.

44
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,608
Look at you now.

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,670
So blue.

46
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:44,139
No. I don't want to go.

47
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:49,000
Then, I'm using our brother-sister trip quota now!

48
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,710
If you refuse, I'll be mad at you for real!

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,680
I just don't want to go.

50
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,392
I don't care! You need to pack now because we'll leave in 15 minutes.

51

No, I''m not.

Because I have you by my side.

110

I kept only thinking if I'd make it here or not!

126
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,691
- Why?
- Because Mek was driving so fast.

134
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,829
Since it's your birthday,

135
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,560
we should all be here together.

136
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,231
That feels much better!

137
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,507
But if you really run out of money,

138
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,000
just call mom.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,576
And you'll get the money transferred right away.

140
00:08:57,576 --> 00:09:00,668
With me, whenever I ask her for money,

141
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:03,783
she'd complain all day long!

142
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,825
None of you are better than the other.

143
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,184

146
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,106

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,894

148
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,862
Do you like it?

149
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,210
Is it that good?

150
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,440
It's the best, mom!

151
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:26,323
Dad, how's business?

152
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:27,631
Lots of customers recently?

153
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,175
This season? Not really.

154
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,000
So your mother and I get to relax a bit.

155
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,345
Now you have us as your VIP guests.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,691
You're not going to get bored anymore.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Enough already!

158
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,080
It's his birthday. Just let him rest.

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,960
It's okay. I can handle it.

160
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,351
Of course, you're my VIP guests.

161
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:51,414
Anyway, since today is dad's birthday,

162
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,461
did you prepare any present for him, mom?

163
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,530
We've been together for so long.

164
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,898
I guess a present is no longer necessary.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,907
Right, honey?

166
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

167
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:04,460

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,000
Since I've been with you all my life,

169
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,000
I guess you don't need this anymore, do you?

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,655
Wow, you have a gift for me?

171
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:16,290
This is such a surprise.

172
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,438
Thank you so much.

173
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:18,142
So...

174
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:20,256
I suppose now you you'll need to make us dinner

175
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:21,228
in exchange with the gift.

176
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:22,252
Am I right, Mek?

177
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:25,515
Sure, I can.

178
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:28,658
Just tell me what you want to eat
and I'll make it for you.

179
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,520
Since we're here,

180
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,947
it can't be anything other than Moo Krata,

181
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,917
the famous specialty of this resort!

182
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,000
Exactly!

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,184
I'd love to have some tender pork.

184
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:41,052
But I think, since we're not together often,

185
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:44,705
shouldn't we go out and have some fancy food instead?

186
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,640
Moo Krata is fine.

187
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,295
It's nice weather around here.

188
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,920
Nothing can beat some nice grilled pork.

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,837
Yes.

190
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,959
For me, Moo Krata here is the best.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,908
Let me check your gift first
and see whether it's worth it or not

192
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,707
Let me see.

193
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,000
Wow!

194
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,277
Okay, let's have it!

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
[Where are you? Why didn't you come back?
Let's talk. Babe, don't be like this.]

196
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:03,645
Park!

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,677
Pick up the call!

198
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,793
I can't work like this!

199
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,631
It's just one of those call center frauds.

200
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,654
I don't want to take it.

201
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,897
Why didn't you just tell me?

202
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:18,410
So I could take it

203
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,200
and spook them back.

204
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
I saw this in the news.

205
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,413
People lost a lot of money because of them.

206
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:23,918
Don't you ever fall for their tricks!

207
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,369
So you're really not going to tell me what happened?

208
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:32,415
You're looking like vegetables in a pot right now.

209
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm okay.

210
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,276
Don't lie to me, Park!

211
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,355
I may be dumb

212
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:42,092
but I can tell that something is troubling you.

213
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,148
Let me guess.

214
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,480
You...

215
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,769
You lost your money because of the lottery, right?

216
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,240
Yeah.

217
00:12:58,553 --> 00:12:59,793
You're indeed a fool.

218
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,000
It's okay, my friend.

219
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,492
You know what they say.

220
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,263
Whenever we fall,

221
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,360
it's because we stumbled.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,346
Bear, can you just leave the room?

223
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,447
I want to be alone.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, I'm sorry.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,138
I won't bother you then.

226
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,691
We have guests.
Let's go to the reception.

227
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,622
Oh, Q, Kimhan.

228
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,000
How come you are here!?

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,908
Dao, you stay here as well?

230
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,720
What a coincidence!

231
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:29,608
Hey.

232
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,520
Are you free today?

233
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,867
I need your help on something.

234
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,907
I'll take a break in half an hour. Can you wait?

235
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,063
Sure.

236
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:52,787
What do you need me to help you with?

237
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,097
Since you're a big fan of mine,

238
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,932
I'd like to appoint you as a honorary consultant

239
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,415
for my new channel!

240
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:01,668
What?

241
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,347
Just like that?

242
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,027
It's like you're forcing me to take it.

243
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:07,754
I don't think so.

244
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:11,787
It's the right time and the right person.

245
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,287
So...

246
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,725
What exactly do you need from this consultant?

247
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,291
It's the same old problem.

248
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,291
I don't know what kind of content I should make.

249
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,861
I've thought about it days and nights but couldn't come up with any idea.

250
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,519
Can you help me on this, Bomb?

251
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,867
Please, please, please.

252
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:34,928
Alright.

253
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,551
Can you write down all the things you want to do?

254
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:40,283
And I'll help you after that.

255
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,787
The problem is...

256
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,436
I don't know where to start.

257
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:51,221
I have to admit

258
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,787
all this time I only followed Mek's lead.

259
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,498
I want to be like him.

260
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,291
But when I finally do it on my own,

261
00:15:59,787 --> 00:16:01,919
I don't really know what kind of content suits me.

262
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:06,787
You should start with being yourself then.

263
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:10,077
Stop thinking too much
and try to keep your chin up.

264
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,551
It's that simple. You can do it.

265
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,704
You got me right here to help you.

266
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,147
Okay?

267
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,320
Okay!

268
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:20,808
Let's start then.

269
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:23,891
Let's write it down.

270
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:29,379
How about this one?

271
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:55,117
Let's go.

272
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,010
- Hang on for sec.
- Follow me!

273
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:06,999
Welcome.

274
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:07,664
Hello.

275
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:08,587
Do you have a reservation?

276
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:10,333
Yes, we do. The name is Q.

277
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,467
Let me text my friend a bit.

278
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,151
Sure.

279
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,601
Mek.

280
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,890
We have guests. Let's go to the reception.

281
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:37,447
Q, Kimhan!

282
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:39,360
How come you are here!?

283
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,092
Dao! Didn't know you stay here as well.

284
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:42,187
Such a coincidence.

285
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,787
Actually, my parents own this place.

286
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,064
I told you before, remember?

287
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,221
What a coincidence!

288
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:51,494
Q...

289
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,005
You can drop your act.

290
00:17:53,976 --> 00:17:54,787
You can't fool me.

291
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:57,448
You know you're so bad at pretending.

292
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:59,347
Don't ever tell anyone that you're my sister.

293
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,395
Dao, Mek, are they your friends?

294
00:18:02,587 --> 00:18:04,787
They are Q and Kimhan.

295
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:07,696
The siblings who moved to Auntie Yupa's house next door.

296
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,787
- Hello again.
- Nice to meet you.

297
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,386
Now I remember. You told me that...

298
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:15,667
a new guy next door
often cooks good food for you.

299
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:16,827
Yes!

300
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,580
It's good then that you two come here

301
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,724
so now I can return the favor

302
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,787
after you fed my kids with lots of good food.

303
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,911
When you say "fed",

304
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,476
it sounded like he was feeding dogs and cats.

305
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,814
Are you talking about Mek?

306
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,541
Watch your mouth!

307
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,267
I'm talking about both of you.

308
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,067
Come on, dad!

309
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,389
Your friends must be tired after a long drive.

310
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,592
Mek, can you help carry their luggage
and show them to their room?

311
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,787
And this evening, don't forget to come...

312
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,684
have Moo Krata with us.

313
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:45,787
It's on me!

314
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,787
I'm sure you're going to love it!

315
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:50,326
Sure, sir, we'll come.

316
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:52,704
Here's the key.

317
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:02,881
Alright, then...

318
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:07,787
Mek, you bring Kimhan to the room.

319
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,828
Q, let's go take some pictures over there.

320
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:11,567
The light here is perfect.

321
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,312
Okay.

322
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:14,828
Now that you're here, you should talk.

323
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,114
Q!

324
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,716
It's okay. I can take them.

325
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,787
There're a lot of mosquitos here.

326
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:58,262
I'll bring you mosquito repellents.

327
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,262
Thank you.

328
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:06,312
Also...

329
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,787
over there is the pathway to the dining room.

330
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:11,787
And if you want to take a walk,

331
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,066
there's a creek there.

332
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,333
I think you'll like it.

333
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:19,341
Mm.

334
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,292
So...

335
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,457
If you need anything...

336
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,370
Well...

337
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,973
You can call room service.

338
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,312
Or you can just tell me.

339
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:34,307
But...

340
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,611
If you don't want to talk to me

341
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,158
you can just text me.

342
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:01,775
Why didn't you say anything, Kim?

343
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,507
Kim!

344
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,241
Let's go ride a bike!

345
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,808
We should get some air.
The weather is so nice!

346
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,378
One second.

347
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:14,601
I'm unpacking.

348
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,324
Just come out. Hurry!

349
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:23,787
What took you so long?

350
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,067
It's all your stuff!

351
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:27,760
You're such a mastermind!

352
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,027
I just don't want you to be upset at home.

353
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,227
So...

354
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,547
Have you two made up?

355
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,642
You're so nosy!

356
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:39,535
Okay.

357
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:41,667
Once you finish with this,

358
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,787
you can follow me.

359
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:44,787
I'll wait outside.

360
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:46,312
Alright, Miss Q.

361
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:47,321
Bye. Hurry up.

362
00:21:56,973 --> 00:21:58,601
Kim, come on.

363
00:21:58,952 --> 00:21:59,758
Yeah.

364
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:00,787
Hurry up!

365
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,993
I'll ride with Mek then.

366
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,610
Why are you like this?

367
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:07,956
You know you're not small!

368
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,333
And you have your own bicycle.

369
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,787
Stop complaining and just go.

370
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:17,737
Last time I checked,
you're not so good with bicycles.

371
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,324
Let me.

372
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:23,932
I know. That's why I brought you with me.

373
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:26,167
You don't have any plan in mind, do you?

374
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:27,633
- No!
- No!

375
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,262
Nothing at all.

376
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:31,416
Let's go.

377
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,609
The weather is good now.

378
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,997
We should be going before it gets too hot.

379
00:22:33,997 --> 00:22:35,074
Go, go, go.

380
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:40,786
Let's follow them.

381
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:44,916
Yay! I got this.

382
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:50,094
Oh, it's tilting.

383
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,787
It's so nice out here!

384
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:14,878
Yeah, it's beautiful.

385
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,467
Hurry up!

386
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,173
Coming.

387
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:25,138
It's been so long since we went on a trip.

388
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:26,961
Mm.

389
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,683
When mom and dad come back,
we should go on a trip again.

390
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:32,158
Mm.

391
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,150
I'd like to go with all of us together.

392
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,787
Q, let's go take some pictures.

393
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,014
Sure, let's go.

394
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:45,987
I'll go with her and be right back.

395
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:00,703
Would you like a picture here too?

396
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:02,754
I can take it for you.

397
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:18,598
You're on a holiday, remember?
I guess a smile wouldn't hurt.

398
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:19,421
It's cuter that way.

399
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:29,754
Ready?

400
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,067
1, 2, 3!

401
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:34,887
3!

402
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:38,787
3! 3! 3!

403
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:40,787
3! 3! 3!

404
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,911
3! 3! 3!

405
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,899
Enough!

406
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,837
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry again!

407
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,787
I think the fact that you can't do things,

408
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:15,027
is your selling point.

409
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:15,853
How?

410
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:17,353
You're such a dumbass.

411
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:21,267
I've come to realize that I shouldn't prank people just because...

412
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:51,583
Are you trying to make up with me?

413
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:57,843
Mm.

414
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,423
I was too harsh with you.

415
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:05,300
And I felt bad for it.

416
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:08,612
I guess you felt sorry too.

417
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,471
It's okay.

418
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:16,841
I deserved that.

419
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,419
I really did Tim wrong.

420
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,903
Thank you anyway

421
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,297
for thinking of me.

422
00:26:32,445 --> 00:26:34,322
But I really want you to know, Kim,

423
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,026
that I never meant for it to happen that way.

424
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,612
I really should have known better.

425
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:48,363
But now...

426
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,448
I've realized...

427
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,270
that I shouldn't play a prank on someone

428
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,115
just because...

429
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:13,593
I think I've ranted enough.

430
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,412
Should we get back?

431
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:29,575
Where are the two little monsters?

432
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,745
Over there.

433
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,288
Mission complete!

434
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,671
Bye-bye!

435
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,561
I knew it.

436
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:43,704
You can ride with me.

437
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,596
Woah!

438
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:44,968
Mek!

439
00:28:55,884 --> 00:28:56,737
Be careful.

440
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,953
Don't swerve.

441
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,252
I happened to take a photo of you.

442
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:39,943
I got my film developed and thought it looked nice.

443
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:40,932
So I'd like to give it to you.

444
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,372
It looks nice indeed.

445
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:46,806
Thank you.

446
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,479
I'm Lee, by the way.

447
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:51,100
Grade 10 Class 1.

448
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:52,670
I'm Park.

449
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,002
I study right next to your class.

450
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,648
Can I touch...

451
00:30:01,764 --> 00:30:02,972
...your camera?

452
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,076
Sure.

453
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:10,118
Taking photos is your thing?

454
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:11,362
Yeah.

455
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,691
It's the thing I love doing the most now.

456
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:20,012
I've never figured out what my calling is.

457
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,713
Can I also take a look at the other photos?

458
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,018
Woah.

459
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:35,220
These are beautiful.

460
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:38,665
Would you like to try taking photos?

461
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,261
I can teach you.

462
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,457
Well, if you don't mind.

463
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:42,345
Not at all.

464
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:43,100
I'm happy to.

465
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,665
Now I'll have someone to keep my company
when I go out taking photos.

466
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:46,336
Cool then.

467
00:30:47,294 --> 00:30:47,796
Here.

468
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,894
You don't need to reply.

469
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:02,035
Just make sure you watch this video.

470
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:05,713
Please don't misunderstand me.

471
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:07,446
I tried to explain it to you
but you wouldn't let me.

472
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:08,702
You didn't pick up my calls.

473
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,079
And you didn't come home.

474
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,421
Do you know that you screwed up my plan big time?

475
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,113
Who are you texting?

476
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:17,274
I'm texting Kimhan.

477
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:19,232
I bought a gift to surprise you.

478
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:22,751
But you dared to forget our 7th anniversary!

479
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:24,482
Park!

480
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:26,953
You think I'm a fool?!

481
00:31:27,878 --> 00:31:28,721
Park!

482
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,932
Did you get hurt?

483
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:32,967
I'm so sorry.

484
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:35,420
Here you go.

485
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,897
I suppose this is a gift for your boyfriend?

486
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:40,038
Yes.

487
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,413
It's my 7th anniversary gift for him.

488
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:44,332
You said you'd always remember.

489
00:31:44,332 --> 00:31:46,427
Once you get back,
I'm gonna teach you a big lesson!

490
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,259
Be prepared to suffer!

491
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,034
Your gift is waitng.

492
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,058
Won't you come back for it?

493
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,391
If you're curious to know what's inside,

494
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,612
you need to come back and open it yourself.

495
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:57,806
You dummy!

496
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:00,443
If you don't come back by this evening,

497
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:01,769
I'll break up with you for real.

498
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:15,866
Bear.

499
00:32:18,692 --> 00:32:20,176
You did nothing but sleep.

500
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,781
How are you going to get any work done with that?

501
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,505
Where's your list of ideas?

502
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:25,359
Show me.

503
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,896
Baking.

504
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,273
Skateboarding.

505
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,454
Styling outfits.

506
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:36,212
Drawing.

507
00:32:36,212 --> 00:32:37,401
Knitting.

508
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:38,740
In parentheses...

509
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:40,989
I don't freaking know how to it!

510
00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:43,214
Why are you laughing?

511
00:32:43,572 --> 00:32:44,632
Nothing.

512
00:32:46,683 --> 00:32:47,652
I just thought it was cute.

513
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,703
You don't have to sweet-talk me.

514
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,621
I know I'm such a loser.

515
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,118
I'm not good at anything.

516
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:57,216
I think...

517
00:32:57,437 --> 00:32:58,858
I'm never gonna make it with my channel.

518
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,318
I was acting all tough and braggy in front of Mek.

519
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,220
But now...

520
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,852
Seems like I won't be able to deliver what I promised.

521
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:08,510
Bro.

522
00:33:08,972 --> 00:33:10,171
Don't say that.

523
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,372
I think the fact that you're not good at anything

524
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,528
is actually your selling point.

525
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,005
How?

526
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,648
I think comedy content will suit you.

527
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:19,734
And most importantly...

528
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:22,993
You're such a dumbass!

529
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,809
Wait a minute.

530
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:26,972
Are you trying to insult me now?

531
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,929
No, not at all.

532
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:30,609
What I meant to say is...

533
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:33,634
The fact that you're a dumb, no-filter kind of guy

534
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:34,757
is good.

535
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,500
That's the reason why I like you.

536
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:42,021
As a fan, obviously.

537
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:44,833
So...

538
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:46,713
What's the next step?

539
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:47,947
Well...

540
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,858
You can go ahead and do everything you wrote down in here.

541
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,401
It's okay if you're not good at it.

542
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,664
Even just a thought of you cooking...

543
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:57,991
...is already hilarious.

544
00:33:58,634 --> 00:33:59,663
You don't need to be good at it.

545
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:02,125
Just show the world how you suck at it.

546
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:04,071
And you should name your channel

547
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,534
with something that truly represents you.

548
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:07,629
Something that tells your viewers that

549
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,262
you are a representative of people who have no talent

550
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:12,530
but tries to do a variety of things along with them.

551
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,373
And then...

552
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:16,008
Your viewers will feel that they can relate to you

553
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,330
and identify with your personality.

554
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:20,460
Now, do you get a picture of what I said?

555
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:24,142
You seem to know me even better than I know myself.

556
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,245
I'm sorry

557
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,091
that you have to be a fan of someone like me.

558
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:36,478
What I do is not nearly enough compared to what
you've been doing for me.

559
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:40,755
What's worse is I even asked you to come up for content ideas for me.

560
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:44,972
Truly...

561
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:47,395
I'm such a loser.

562
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,931
You probably think that it sucks to be you.

563
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:53,651
And that there's nothing good about it.

564
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,641
But for me...

565
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,792
who gets tired of life every day...

566
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:01,291
Sometimes seeing people like you having fun,

567
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:02,693
living freely

568
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:05,753
and doing something stupid

569
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:07,763
gives me energy to go on.

570
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,840
You make my dull days brighter

571
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:13,149
and full of laughter.

572
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:16,931
Being your fan brings me so much joy.

573
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,315
Actually,

574
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,475
I should be the one to thank you...

575
00:35:48,858 --> 00:35:50,858
Thank you, my dear fan.

576
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:54,277
What do you say if I promote you my boyfriend instead?

577
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,423
Can a BL couple turn into a real couple?

578
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:15,028
And you don't care about the gift at all?

579
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:16,412
It's not important anymore.

580
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:17,960
Now, all I care about is you.

581
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,044
How is it? Do you enjoy the meal?

582
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:48,461
It's so good just like Dao used to say.

583
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,355
Then, you should eat some more.

584
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,857
Thanks, ma'am.

585
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,901
By the way, what's your relation with Yupa?

586
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:55,781
We're her nephew and niece.

587
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,140
We've moved in to the house for a while.

588
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,403
So it's just the two of you there?

589
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:04,761
Yes. Our mom and dad open a restaurant overseas.

590
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,781
They come back here from time to time.

591
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:08,781
Mom, you see,

592
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:11,594
Kim and Q stay together just them two.

593
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:14,781
But Kim takes a really good care of Q.

594
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,021
Their house is squaky clean.

595
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:19,061
Mek, you should do the same!

596
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,781
Enough! Just eat.

597
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,861
So you can stop talking.

598
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,231
Son, don't tease your sister.

599
00:37:26,972 --> 00:37:29,781
I think you look familiar, Kim.

600
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,781
Are you the one making BL content with Mek?

601
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,614
Yes, he is!

602
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:35,741
This is him.

603
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:38,594
Doesn't this mean that you two...

604
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:40,279
are quite close?

605
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:42,341
Yes, sort of.

606
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:46,068
You know, I still want that official Mek-Kim t-shirt for myself.

607
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,255
Do you have some left?

608
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,402
Do we?

609
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:49,800
Let me tell you something.

610
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,261
Your mom...

611
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:53,701
She increases views for your content every day.

612
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:57,096
She tells everybody, "This is my son."

613
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:58,164
She always shows it around.

614
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,207
By the way...

615
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:03,301
Can a BL couple turn into a real couple?

616
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,962
Right. I'm curious.

617
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:11,068
Don't be shy.

618
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:14,025
Your mom and I can handle it.

619
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,781
We don't mind at all,

620
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,781
if you really love each other.

621
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:21,451
When people campaign for equal marriage

622
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:24,341
I always support them by helping spread the word.

623
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:25,781
That's really cool.

624
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,661
For now, I'll just be a shipper then.

625
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:31,781
But if you decide to become a real couple,

626
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:33,781
please make sure that we are the first to know.

627
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:38,219
Well, well, well.

628
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,256
I guess it'll be real soon.

629
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:39,956
I know, right?

630
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,301
- Stop talking. Just eat.
- Thanks.

631
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:00,781
Finally, you came home, dummy.

632
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:02,886
You ruined my surprise plan.

633
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,689
How are you gonna fix that?

634
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:14,351
Wait.

635
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:17,666
What's wrong with you?

636
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:22,614
This is how I fix it.

637
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,284
After ruining your plan.

638
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:35,279
And you don't care about the gift at all?

639
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,518
It's not important anymore.

640
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,398
Now...

641
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,283
All I care about is you.

642
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:54,446
You know...

643
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,996
When I got you wrong,

644
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:00,211
thinking you had an affair,

645
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:03,614
I was devastated.

646
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,518
I thought...

647
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:13,068
I was gonna lose you.

648
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:19,211
How could I do that to you?

649
00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:22,781
You are my happiness.

650
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:27,068
And I can't live without my happiness.

651
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:35,801
So...

652
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:40,681
What are you gonna do to me

653
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,658
now that I come back?

654
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,493
Hello. What's up?

655
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:24,232
Today?

656
00:41:24,973 --> 00:41:26,160
Yeah, sure.

657
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:27,777
Same place?

658
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,610
Okay, see you.

659
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:32,610
Who's that?

660
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,808
It's Mangkang.

661
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,236
He invited me to dinner at Thonglor.

662
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:40,615
Haven't seen him for a while so I thought I'll go.

663
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:42,567
Can you just not go?

664
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,376
I'm feeling better now but...

665
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,102
I don't want to be alone.

666
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:49,782
Don't you say that.

667
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:51,447
Keep that for someone else.

668
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:53,185
No.

669
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:54,782
Please don't go.

670
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,782
I'll tell Mangkang for you

671
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,141
that you'll hang out with me.

672
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:02,093
He won't mind, believe me.

673
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:06,802
Tim!

674
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,897
Let me live my life.

675
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,782
Whenver you want to go anywhere or do anything,

676
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,089
I never forbid you.

677
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:16,447
Do I need to stick with you forever?

678
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:21,782
Why do you have to be mad at me?

679
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:23,208
I was just kidding.

680
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:25,462
Why do you have to be so upset?

681
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:28,825
Mai.

682
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:35,970
Don't leave it like this.

683
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:37,782
You can tell me everything.

684
00:42:38,543 --> 00:42:41,302
We can talk to each other about everything, no?

685
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,064
Then, I suppose I can talk to you about this.

686
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,902
About how I think you always take me for granted.

687
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:52,509
Are you really sure we can have this conversation?

688
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:54,686
What do you mean by that?

689
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:58,375
I don't get it.

690
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:00,634
You know what...

691
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,634
I'm so sick

692
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:06,164
of hearing you say you can't live without me.

693
00:43:06,662 --> 00:43:08,662
At the same time, I feel good about it.

694
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:12,165
Because it means you still want me.

695
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:17,089
That's why I choose to tolerate it

696
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,495
while I always think of you
more than just a friend.

697
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,089
Even since we were in school.

698
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:25,060
Tim.

699
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,782
Have you ever thought...

700
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,718
about how you'd live
if I'm not in your life anymore?

701
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:33,663
Or maybe you've never thought of that at all

702
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,782
because you always take me for granted.

703
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:39,949
You think I'll always be here for you.

704
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:51,734
Can you answer me first?

705
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:32,112
Can I sit with you?

706
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:34,371
Of course.

707
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,525
Here, drink this.

708
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:06,398
You mom and dad are adorable.

709
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:10,159
Chatting with them is fun.

710
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:13,901
And they seem to understand their children well.

711
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:16,188
They don't want to feel old

712
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:17,901
so they always do what teens do.

713
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:20,901
I guess that makes them understand young people.

714
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,270
In the past...

715
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:28,924
Mom used to take Dao to fan meeting events
of BL couples that she liked.

716
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,733
She just went fangirling together with Dao.

717
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,451
Both of them always came back home losing their voices.

718
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:36,068
It's still funny thinking about it now.

719
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:37,848
Really?

720
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:43,581
Seeing your family today,

721
00:45:43,581 --> 00:45:45,781
it makes me miss my parents.

722
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:56,231
Your face...

723
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,701
Which one of your parents do you look like?

724
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:04,303
Is it your dad? Or your mom?

725
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,188
I guess I look like my mom.

726
00:46:07,522 --> 00:46:08,422
You do?

727
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:13,038
I don't think you look like her.

728
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:17,279
I mean my real mom.

729
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:22,781
You still remember when we did the Q&A session?

730
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,116
When you got a question about dad,

731
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,781
I truly understood how you felt, Kim.

732
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:35,628
When mom first joined the family,

733
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:42,379
I honestly didn't know what to feel

734
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:44,781
or how I should react.

735
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:47,112
I felt awkward.

736
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:51,781
I was sad because I missed my real mother.

737
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:54,781
I was also afraid of being left alone.

738
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:56,948
I was afraid dad wasn't gonna love me anymore.

739
00:46:57,283 --> 00:46:58,924
Mixed feelings, really.

740
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:05,474
I was just a child, but I had to carry so many emotions.

741
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,064
Are you okay now?

742
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:11,398
I'm okay.

743
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,834
Don't worry.

744
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:21,777
So...

745
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,633
What made you accept the change?

746
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:32,303
Was it because of time?

747
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:34,992
For me,

748
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,164
It took me so long for me to finally accept reality.

749
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,877
I always snuck out to cry alone.

750
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:45,819
I just thought that she...

751
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,261
made dad, Dao and me very happy.

752
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,087
I think that's enough.

753
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,044
I was trying to understand the others' feelings.

754
00:47:57,379 --> 00:47:59,781
I had no reasons to feel that possessive of my dad.

755
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:01,688
Are you a possessive person in general?

756
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:03,025
Yeah.

757
00:48:03,766 --> 00:48:05,901
I may look like I can handle it now.

758
00:48:06,355 --> 00:48:07,527
But when the time comes

759
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:10,701
and somebody tries to get close with the person I love

760
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:13,116
I always lose my cool and end up doing stupid things.

761
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:15,092
It's not cool, right?

762
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:21,135
Mek.

763
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:26,374
Can I ask you one thing?

764
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:29,581
Earlier...

765
00:48:29,581 --> 00:48:30,762
you said

766
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,341
you finally realized you shouldn't prank people

767
00:48:34,546 --> 00:48:35,732
just because of what, exactly?

768
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,101
Just because they try to get close with someone I care about.

769
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:51,920
And that person...

770
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:57,141
is you, Kim.

771
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:10,235
I'm so curious

772
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,427
about what you did at Mek's resort?

773
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,781
I bet he got a free night promotion

774
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:17,347
plus the son of the owner!

775
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,403
I'm gonna end all BL content activities.

776
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:24,301
About the other day, I...

777
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:25,570
I understand.

778
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,068
Don't worry. I won't leave you.

779
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:29,221
Have you ever thought of telling people

780
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:30,614
that we're together?

781
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:33,188
I know how you feel

782
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:34,925
but why do we have to keep this a secret?

783
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:36,542
Why would you want to be around Kim all the time?

784
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:38,364
You act like you own him.

785
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:39,781
Are you dating now?

786
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:42,781
Do you really like Kim
or just want to take him as a win against me?
