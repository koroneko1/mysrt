ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:09,882
CHA HYUN-SU, 19-YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOLER
CURRENTLY REFUSING TO ATTEND SCHOOL

3
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,594
HIKIKOMORI WITH HISTORY OF
HABITUAL SELF-HARM

4
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:15,805
MOM
HYUN-SU, ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T COMING?

5
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,481
It'll be a good change of scenery.

6
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:29,527
You haven't been out of your room
in so long.

7
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,913
MOM
WE'RE LEAVING

8
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:42,832
RICE IS IN THE FREEZER.
MAKE SURE YOU EAT, OKAY?

9
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,335
Load ammunition.

10
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:53,843
How long is Hyun-su
going to behave like that?

11
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:57,221
Why didn't you do anything

12
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,765
to make sure he never got this way?

13
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:00,766
Dad.

14
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,601
It's not Mom's fault.

15
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:03,936
Why are you yelling at her?

16
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,229
Don't give me attitude.

17
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,607
This family's falling apart.

18
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:12,069
You're ridiculous. Since when do you care?

19
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,155
I don't know why I had any children.

20
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:16,365
They're never grateful for anything.

21
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,075
Stop. Both of you.

22
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,493
This is a family trip.

23
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:22,872
Don't be like that.

24
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,709
Sure.

25
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,878
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,798
Dad.

27
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:33,716
Dad!

28
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:44,768
Is that Hyun-su?
Where the hell have you been?

29
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,937
Don't be like that.
The poor boy must be devastated.

30
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,398
He looks like a mess.

31
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:53,861
Hyun-su.

32
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,574
I really didn't want to come outside.

33
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,913
But I couldn't believe it.

34
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,878
Only 30 million won.

35
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,255
You're basically telling me to die.

36
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,509
How am I supposed to get by with this?

37
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,263
How can I live on this
for the rest of my life?

38
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,308
What do you want me to do?

39
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:25,559
-Drag him out.
-Take him.

40
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:27,853
How can I live?

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,522
-What do you want me to do?
-Take him out.

42
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:32,149
Hurry.

43
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,747
How could he just leave him here
like this?

44
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,177
Why is he so cold?

45
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,108
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

46
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,527
AUDITORY HALLUCINATION,
PANIC BUYING, SHELTER, CHAOS

47
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,657
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

48
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,288
Hey, I'm on my way.

49
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,290
The elevator isn't working,
so I'll be late.

50
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,251
No, the elevator is out of order.

51
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:34,670
I'm not lying.

52
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:47,808
I can't hear anything.

53
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:49,560
Hello?

54
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:50,728
Oh, no!

55
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,222
Just go.

56
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,474
I'm resting.

57
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:07,721
I'm hungry…

58
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:14,853
It's you.

59
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:21,628
Thanks for your help.

60
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,131
LEE SU-UNG

61
00:07:24,214 --> 00:07:25,090
Su-ung.

62
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,468
Someone had to do it.

63
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,607
AUGUST 15TH SATURDAY

64
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,442
There's no service, is there?

65
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,444
I'm checking his family's phone number.

66
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:46,653
I should let his family know.

67
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,620
SATURDAY, AUGUST 15

68
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,042
What are you doing?

69
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,961
They can't see him in person.
This is the least we can do.

70
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,130
It'd be better if his family
didn't see him like this.

71
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:08,091
No.

72
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,220
It wouldn't be.

73
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,987
Damn it, the motion sensor
isn't working either.

74
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:41,583
Why is it my fault?
It's not even my problem…

75
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,295
The world's just so fucked…

76
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,713
Excuse me.

77
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,091
That's how the world is.
What hell do I know?

78
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,302
-Excuse me.
-Why is it my fault…

79
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:55,138
It's not my fault, and now
they want to get rid of me?

80
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,979
I want to kill them all.

81
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:16,952
Manager Han.

82
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:22,332
Manager Han, that son of a bitch.

83
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,218
Manager Han!

84
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,985
Excuse me.

85
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,236
Ji-su.

86
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:52,988
Don't go near him.

87
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,073
He might kill you.

88
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,744
Watch out!

89
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,377
My daughter isn't back yet.

90
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:10,255
You can't block this.

91
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,633
If anything happens to Min-ju,
it's all your fault!

92
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:14,801
-Please calm down.
-Block it.

93
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:18,513
Please wait.

94
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,808
I said, wait.

95
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:26,480
She's here.

96
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,982
I'll go get her quickly.

97
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,901
Open it. Please?

98
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:32,944
No.

99
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:37,991
Who are you to say no?
Do you know who I am?

100
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,453
I can't let this place fall into danger.

101
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,374
Stop, please.

102
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,833
Please open it.

103
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:48,835
It's working.

104
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:00,681
What's going on?

105
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:01,848
EMERGENCY ALERT

106
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:02,974
Is it an epidemic?

107
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:07,270
That man said he was going to the hospital
this morning.

108
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,189
Did the hospital do a test?

109
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:11,942
It must be the radiation.

110
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:25,997
SUPERMARKET

111
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,937
THOSE WITH THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
MUST BE QUARANTINED IMMEDIATELY

112
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,064
NOSEBLEEDS, BLACKOUTS,
OR SUDDEN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

113
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,609
7,800 WON
NEW MESSAGE

114
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:14,463
How come you're so calm?

115
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,049
I am extremely shocked
and nervous right now.

116
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:23,346
That man…

117
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,932
No, that thing…

118
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:29,770
Do you think it's dead?

119
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,689
Probably.

120
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:01,551
Let's all go home.

121
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,678
What are we doing sitting here?

122
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,097
Won't the rescue squad come?

123
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:08,517
Do you not see this?

124
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,726
We're all screwed.

125
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:12,229
Our country won't go down like this.

126
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,023
Right, Military Man?

127
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,609
Yes. You're right.

128
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,860
If you stay calm and wait--

129
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,029
I can wait at home!

130
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:23,740
There must be an emergency shelter nearby.

131
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:25,408
Where exactly?

132
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:26,535
If we drive--

133
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,328
The underground parking lot
is blocked, too.

134
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,127
We have to go up!

135
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,630
Does anyone live on the seventh floor?

136
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,465
Me.

137
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:44,719
Hey, we can go up together.

138
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,096
Wait a minute.

139
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,473
If you're going up, we should all go up.
Don't you agree?

140
00:13:48,557 --> 00:13:50,100
Let us all go.

141
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:52,060
-All right.
-No.

142
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:55,021
Wait. We need to block the entrance first.

143
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,398
Let's wait and see--

144
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:58,984
You can block, or wait.
Do whatever you want.

145
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:00,735
I'm going up.

146
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,779
-Wait.
-You can't.

147
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:06,533
You punks!
Where do you think you're running away to?

148
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,451
You selfish cowards trying
to save yourselves.

149
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:11,329
You're just worried about your shop.

150
00:14:12,706 --> 00:14:14,082
I can't believe you just said that.

151
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,376
Byeong-il. Come here.

152
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,378
Do you all want to get killed?

153
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:21,006
Come here. Now!

154
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:23,425
He's right.

155
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:26,052
If we open the entrance,
we'll all be dead.

156
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:30,640
Move aside. Now.

157
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,476
You don't know what's out there.

158
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,103
I won't move aside!

159
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:36,813
-Come on.
-Why are you doing this?

160
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,607
-Stop.
-Don't do this.

161
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,066
-Come on.
-Stop.

162
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:42,444
What's that?

163
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,446
-What's that noise?
-What's that?

164
00:14:51,161 --> 00:14:52,787
-What is that?
-Move back.

165
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,544
Jeez.

166
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:07,928
What are you looking at?

167
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,686
Is that a bite mark?

168
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,896
Stop right there!

169
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:19,356
Byeong-il.

170
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,983
Check him. Go and check him.

171
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,409
It's a bite. He's been bit!

172
00:15:31,493 --> 00:15:33,703
Oh, goodness.

173
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,802
I got him!

174
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:52,263
You saw me, right?

175
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:55,809
Look at the bite mark on his shoulder.

176
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,104
I got him.

177
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,231
Bastard.

178
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,358
Zombie bastard.

179
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:07,904
It's all okay. It's fine.

180
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,993
8 HOURS LATER

181
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,216
It's not a disease.

182
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,384
It's a curse.

183
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,261
CRUCRU

184
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:18,558
IT'S NOT A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

185
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,688
They complained of frequent nosebleeds…

186
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:24,939
…and auditory hallucinations.

187
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,233
The cause could not be determined.

188
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,486
They weren't from here originally.

189
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:33,490
They came here
because they showed symptoms.

190
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:37,285
They turned into miserable,
desperate beings.

191
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,120
Every prediction was wrong.

192
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,830
It suddenly begins one day

193
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,207
and it never stops.

194
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,834
I was consumed by it, too.

195
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:47,462
Humans will not be able to overcome this.

196
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,964
If you have symptoms,
kill yourself before it's too late

197
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:52,050
because being alive will harm others.

198
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,260
But if you decide to live to the end,

199
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,387
there's something you must know.

200
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:57,555
-That is…
-That is…

201
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:05,563
THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION

202
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:09,275
REFRESH

203
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,153
Nothing's working.

204
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:24,791
Will it still be there?

205
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:30,463
RAMYEON

206
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,308
There's probably no one out there, right?

207
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,496
I can't see.

208
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:27,687
I can't see.

209
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:39,908
I can't see.

210
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:02,430
I heard you.

211
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,448
I…

212
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,994
can't see.

213
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,477
I can't see.

214
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,145
I can't…

215
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:56,693
We have to kill him.

216
00:20:59,028 --> 00:20:59,946
Kill him?

217
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:02,031
Yes, of course.

218
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:05,743
Can you do it?

219
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:09,747
Me?

220
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,249
You're the leader.

221
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:15,169
-I am.
-Yes.

222
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:17,505
He's still human, though.

223
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,132
Come on.

224
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,843
Seung-wan, have you ever seen a movie?

225
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,053
If you let the one who got bit live,
then everyone dies.

226
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:25,930
It's okay because it's self-defense.

227
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:28,349
Right, Seok-hyeon?

228
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,480
Won't he die of starvation
if we just leave him?

229
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:37,734
What if he gets hungry and eats everyone?

230
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,069
-We should do something.
-"We should do something."

231
00:21:40,153 --> 00:21:41,321
Knock it off.

232
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,033
Seok-hyeon, you go in.

233
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:45,950
What?

234
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:48,369
Yes.

235
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,668
-Jae-heon, someone is in there.
-Three…

236
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,837
two, one…

237
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,673
Two…

238
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:25,425
-Do you think it's a person?
-One…

239
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,677
It's a person.

240
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:29,887
They're telling us the pass code.

241
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:35,226
Two, one, three, two…

242
00:24:16,434 --> 00:24:17,643
Thank you.

243
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,521
I thought I was going to die.

244
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:23,274
-What happened--
-A burglar

245
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,860
came in.

246
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,995
How long have you been like this?

247
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,331
It's been a few days.

248
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:41,959
Did something happen outside?

249
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:45,296
I heard strange noises.

250
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:50,301
You should see for yourself.

251
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:55,681
Okay.

252
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,109
Wait.

253
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:28,047
I thought I better carry something, too.

254
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,808
Let's live together in one place
until the rescue squad comes.

255
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:40,560
It's safe to be together.

256
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:42,770
Where will all of us go?

257
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,063
The daycare center.

258
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:48,734
It's relatively safe
because it's far from the entrance.

259
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:49,986
It will also be better

260
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:52,446
to sleep there than here.

261
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:54,282
I won't allow it.

262
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,743
-No.
-Who are you to say no?

263
00:25:57,827 --> 00:25:59,036
She's director of the daycare.

264
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,538
Scumbags.

265
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:02,081
Pieces of shit!

266
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:04,667
You ignored me when I begged.
You're shameless!

267
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,922
Your daughter probably
needs someone's help, too.

268
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:24,729
That's why I'm saying I'll go. Let me go.

269
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:27,231
You can do whatever you want
after I leave.

270
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:28,691
What about you?

271
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:29,942
Are you okay with dying?

272
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:33,696
Do you have a plan?

273
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,489
There's no internet or phone service.

274
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:37,116
How can you be sure where she is?

275
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,745
-Still--
-First, you have to live.

276
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,458
Otherwise you won't be able to find
or see your daughter.

277
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:54,091
Please calm down

278
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:56,344
and help us.

279
00:26:57,553 --> 00:26:59,221
I'll be sure to help you later.

280
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,101
Do whatever you want.

281
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,485
This door is open.

282
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:22,370
I don't think you should see this.

283
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,557
NOW IT'S YOURS

284
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,730
Did he kill himself
because the world is doomed?

285
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:52,316
No, he's been dead for over a week.

286
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:54,527
How do you know?

287
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:59,073
It just seems like that, no?

288
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:17,633
AUGUST 25, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

289
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:19,093
Should I just kill myself now?

290
00:28:23,305 --> 00:28:24,932
At least then

291
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:27,977
I'd die a human.

292
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:53,753
Dad, don't go. It's too dangerous.

293
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:54,879
Don't cry, Su-yeong.

294
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:58,215
Take good care of Yeong-su while I'm away.

295
00:28:58,299 --> 00:28:59,133
All right?

296
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,887
-Dad.
-Don't cry, Su-yeong.

297
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,055
Monsters might come if they hear us.

298
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:07,892
You know
I was in the special forces, right?

299
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:12,605
I'll come back with food.
Yeong-su, listen to your sister, okay?

300
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,065
Get out of there.

301
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,194
Get out of there!

302
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:22,948
-Dad!
-Dad!

303
00:29:24,408 --> 00:29:25,618
Dad!

304
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:27,870
-Dad!
-Dad!

305
00:29:27,953 --> 00:29:28,996
Dad!

306
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:33,959
Go away!

307
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:36,712
Go away, monster!

308
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,175
Go away!

309
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,385
Help us!

310
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,764
Help us!

311
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:49,225
Help us!

312
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:51,602
Please help us!

313
00:31:29,074 --> 00:31:30,284
I…

314
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,627
THEY MIGHT COME IF THEY HEAR ANYTHING

315
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:44,632
THOSE THINGS DON'T DIE

316
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:57,811
Dad!

317
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:03,734
-Dad!
-Dad!

318
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:06,820
-Dad!
-Dad!

319
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:08,072
Dad!

320
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,410
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

321
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:19,625
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

322
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,723
IF YOU MAKE A CALL AND LEAVE THE PHONE ON

323
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,558
IT'LL MAKE A NOISE
WHEN A MONSTER IS NEAR YOU

324
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:40,729
EMERGENCY

325
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:46,193
COME WHEN YOUR MIND IS MADE UP

326
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,433
I think

327
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:21,103
I better stay home.

328
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:23,564
I think you should come with us.

329
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:27,026
No.

330
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,696
I don't want to burden you anymore.

331
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:33,615
I'll find my own way to survive.

332
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,367
-Still…
-Okay.

333
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,204
Take care of yourself.

334
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:53,010
Everyone has their own way of living.

335
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:56,221
I'll be fine.

336
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:00,142
Of course, I'll be fine.

337
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,980
What's wrong with him?

338
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,148
Salute!

339
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,194
We met in the elevator last time.

340
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:14,073
Right. I'm Lee Su-ung.

341
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:15,032
You live in Room 1305.

342
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:17,785
And you're in Room 308.

343
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,997
I live in Room 1009. I'm Son Hye-in.

344
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:23,957
Nice to meet you.

345
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,667
I'm Ryu Jae-hwan.

346
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:27,461
Does anyone have sunscreen?

347
00:34:28,045 --> 00:34:28,879
What?

348
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:30,923
-I'll look for it.
-Okay.

349
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:32,382
You don't have to look for it.

350
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,176
Anyway, I'm No Byeong-il.

351
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,886
We're neighbors, but we've never…

352
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,179
Wait a minute.

353
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,723
You're not a familiar face.

354
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:41,683
Right.

355
00:34:43,393 --> 00:34:44,353
She doesn't really talk.

356
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:45,896
Oh, I see.

357
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,190
You seem to know everything, ma'am.

358
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:51,985
Don't call me, "ma'am."
I'm sure I'm much younger than you.

359
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:54,404
Pardon? What makes you so sure?

360
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:56,323
Where is he?

361
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,158
-Oh my God.
-Where is he?

362
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:00,369
-Where is he?
-Who?

363
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:02,871
-Seok-hyeon, who are you looking for?
-That thug!

364
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:05,082
That thug did this to me!

365
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,417
Son of a bitch.

366
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,570
You go your way.

367
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:35,988
I'll go mine.

368
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:43,328
How do you feel?

369
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:46,165
Do you feel like biting into people
and tearing them apart?

370
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:48,834
Which floor are you going to?

371
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:52,462
It's okay between us. We killed together.

372
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:55,007
Shut the hell up or go downstairs.

373
00:35:57,176 --> 00:36:00,929
I don't want to.

374
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:05,684
It'd be freaking embarrassing
if I changed into something like that.

375
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,228
I'll kill you if you change.

376
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,480
Likewise.

377
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,904
I think this works for you.

378
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:23,202
Walk carefully.

379
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,018
I'm Han Du-sik.

380
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:49,728
And you are?

381
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,356
I'm Cha Hyun-su.

382
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:55,776
A slow speaker.

383
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:57,778
How

384
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:00,447
can I save the kids?

385
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,532
What do you mean by how?
You'll have to go.

386
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:12,876
Should I go?

387
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:23,470
I used to be a legend in Cheonggyecheon.

388
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,889
You know how you can get a tank made there

389
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:28,183
if you have a blueprint?

390
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:40,946
That means I can transform your stick
into something more useful.

391
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:46,034
-Give me that.
-Pardon?

392
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:49,621
Give me that stick.

393
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,124
Oh, the weapon.

394
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:23,113
Honey.

395
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:27,117
You didn't even notice I was gone.

396
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,370
Bring the eggs. Now!

397
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:38,128
Stupid bitch.

398
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:39,629
Jeez.

399
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,382
SUPERMARKET

400
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:44,509
Bite him.

401
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:46,887
Bite him hard.

402
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,438
It's done.

403
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,067
Hey.

404
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,361
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
FIRST LIEUTENANT HAN DU-SIK

405
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,331
They still move around
with their heads chopped off.

406
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:15,582
A kitchen knife won't work.

407
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,084
But this will do.

408
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,254
Can I kill them with that?

409
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:24,633
No, you can't.

410
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,094
How do you know?

411
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:32,766
I just do. Avoid them at all costs.

412
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:35,560
If you come across them,
run for your life.

413
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:36,478
No.

414
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,481
Don't get caught in the first place.

415
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:46,530
Then please lend me that canon.

416
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:48,490
No.

417
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:51,785
It isn't stable,
so it can fire only a few shots.

418
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,746
I fired earlier.
I'll fire again if it breaks in.

419
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:58,333
The last shot is for me.

420
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:01,670
So I can go easy.

421
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:04,483
I can't see.

422
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:38,558
I found you.

423
00:41:48,235 --> 00:41:50,111
Don't run…

424
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,635
Where are you?

425
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,249
Man, everything's melting already.

426
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:10,627
They'll all go to waste.

427
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,433
Hey, can't you see they're all going bad?

428
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:28,478
The power went out.
What do you want me to do?

429
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:30,897
How dare you talk back to me?

430
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:38,279
Well…

431
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:41,241
Can you be in the management office?

432
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,493
I need to check the electrical room.

433
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:46,413
I saw some places with lights on outside.

434
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:48,915
A blackout would affect
the whole district.

435
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:53,169
Only this building is experiencing issues.

436
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,547
I'll find out when
I go to the electrical room.

437
00:44:56,798 --> 00:44:58,800
That's all the food we have,
so we have to hurry.

438
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:02,345
What? Hey, do you think this is all yours?

439
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:05,890
Don't be ridiculous.

440
00:45:05,974 --> 00:45:08,017
We'll have nothing
if everything melts, anyway.

441
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:09,602
-Why don't we hand out--
-Be quiet!

442
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:12,272
I'll go.

443
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,484
Hey!

444
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:17,610
What are you doing?

445
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:19,154
Hey!

446
00:45:19,654 --> 00:45:21,156
What are you doing?

447
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,991
You're stealing!

448
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:24,826
It's an emergency.

449
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:28,663
Hey!

450
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:32,292
Hey! Why you…

451
00:45:32,792 --> 00:45:36,337
I can't believe the way these
punks are treating me, goddamn it.

452
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:38,715
Damn it.

453
00:45:40,884 --> 00:45:44,095
This is all because you look down on me,
you bitch.

454
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:50,727
It was charging.

455
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,520
I don't know how long it'll last.

456
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:56,649
One more thing.

457
00:45:57,484 --> 00:45:58,735
Be careful.

458
00:46:11,164 --> 00:46:12,540
What do you do in this situation?

459
00:46:15,627 --> 00:46:17,462
Isn't there a firefighters' manual?

460
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,424
We have to calm people down
and make them act collectively.

461
00:46:21,508 --> 00:46:23,551
Food and drinking water must be secured.

462
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:25,470
And an escape route, as well.

463
00:46:25,553 --> 00:46:26,721
Most importantly,

464
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:29,474
we need to understand the situation.

465
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:30,934
What about the cameras?

466
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:38,149
They can only help so much,
since there's only a few of them.

467
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:42,278
-There must be recordings.
-We need a password.

468
00:46:43,488 --> 00:46:45,031
The security guard must know it.

469
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:48,243
The building was blockaded…

470
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:50,370
Not to lock us in,

471
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,581
but to protect us?

472
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:07,178
Hey.

473
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,097
You shouldn't go there.

474
00:47:12,058 --> 00:47:13,226
Why not?

475
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:15,854
My dog's been barking like this.

476
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:17,522
I'll be careful.

477
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,108
What?

478
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:25,071
What's wrong? Are you scared?

479
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:27,156
Is something there?

480
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:29,117
Okay.

481
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:32,662
Su-yeong.

482
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:34,831
I'm scared.

483
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:38,293
Su-yeong.

484
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:40,003
It's too dark in here.

485
00:47:41,588 --> 00:47:42,672
It's okay.

486
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:44,424
We'll be fine.

487
00:47:45,216 --> 00:47:46,384
Dad.

488
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:49,554
He'll be back soon.

489
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,782
Kids. I'm here to help you.

490
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:16,956
Sir.

491
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,376
Please save our dad.

492
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:22,337
What?

493
00:48:23,421 --> 00:48:24,589
Dad

494
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:27,967
fell down.

495
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:32,263
I know.

496
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:34,515
Maybe he's still--

497
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:37,226
Nobody can survive a fall
from the 12th floor.

498
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:55,745
There's a man on the 14th floor
with a lot of food.

499
00:48:58,206 --> 00:49:00,083
You're hungry, aren't you?

500
00:49:04,629 --> 00:49:06,631
You won't stay here by yourselves,
will you?

501
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:16,057
We need to go into the hall
where monsters are running wild.

502
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:18,059
Are you ready?

503
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:23,856
How old are you guys?

504
00:49:25,483 --> 00:49:29,445
I'm nine years old and my brother is six.

505
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,537
Those are perfect ages to fight monsters.

506
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:52,218
Don't worry.

507
00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:55,054
I'll protect you.

508
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:12,864
FIRE HYDRANT

509
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,293
Protect them?

510
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:12,340
Is that what you want?

511
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:24,435
Are you okay?

512
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:27,063
Get away from me.

513
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:29,774
Go!

514
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,534
Yes, you always liked to act cool
in front of the weak.

515
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:41,077
And then what happened?

516
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:44,831
It was my fault.

517
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:45,998
CHA HYUN-SU

518
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:50,086
Come out!

519
00:51:51,462 --> 00:51:53,422
-It was my fault.
-It wasn't your fault.

520
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:54,966
Bastard!

521
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:56,717
It was your fault!

522
00:52:00,763 --> 00:52:01,848
You're a sad case.

523
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:04,433
It was unfair.

524
00:52:08,437 --> 00:52:09,438
Die.

525
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:20,575
Yes.

526
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:23,202
It was unfair.

527
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:40,219
