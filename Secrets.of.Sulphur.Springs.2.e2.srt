Griffin:
Previously on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,797
Savannah:
The camp is opening today

3
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,757
and this time I'll be
the one creeping kids out

4
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,467
with the legend of Moss Man.

5
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,469
This place isn't haunted
by Savannah.

6
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,721
We know.
The mirror told us.

7
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,431
Wyatt: That's how
the ghost communicates.

8
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,976
Harper:
Elijah's ghost wants us to
go back to my family's farm.

9
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:16,893
We need to find out why.

10
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,853
(wailing)

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,440
It was never Elijah
leading us back here.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,858
It was her. Grace.

13
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,944
My great‐great‐grandmother.

14
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:27,070
Ghost of The Tremont.

15
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,869
Zoey: No way
this came down by itself.

16
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:38,248
This is not normal.
How else do we explain it?

17
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,917
Zoey:
Except ghosts.

18
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,961
Mom and Dad
definitely won't want
to hear that.

19
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,880
Wait, is that mine?

20
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,927
Oh, this? Yeah.
I had to drink it.

21
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,345
It was melting.

22
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,264
There's always
the refrigerator.

23
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,809
So what's with all this?

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,021
Isn't it obvious?
Paranormal activity.

25
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,314
Zoey: You were home
the whole time.

26
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:03,606
Did you hear anything?

27
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,776
Like screams?
Clawing at the walls?

28
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,738
(mimics eerie scratching)

29
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:12,073
I actually haven't
heard anything.

30
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:13,867
House has been pretty quiet.

31
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,703
Sarah: Griffin,
that you down there?

32
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:20,290
Um, yeah, I‐‐
I was just out back.

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,751
Sarah: Okay, well,
all of you, time for bed.

34
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,544
We'll clean that mess up
in the morning.

35
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,087
Coming.

36
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,301

Tomorrow.

Wyatt,
it's too early.

43
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:00,557
I've been waiting
for the sun to come up

44
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:01,766
for about an hour.

45
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,270
Daylight. Safety.

46
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:10,108
Or not.

47
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,652
Zoey, get over here.

48
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,904
It's her.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,450
The ghost. She's back.

50
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,706
‐Wyatt: Mom!
‐Zoey: Dad!

51
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,170
Hurry! The window!
You have to see this!

52
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,714
A ghost, right‐‐

53
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:35,425
There.

54
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,804
Plenty of mist
but no ghost.

55
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,682
She was there!
The silhouette of an old woman.

56
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,142
We both saw her.

57
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,435
We're thinking
maybe the same ghost

58
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,811
who tore down
the wallpaper.

59
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,438
We already talked
about the wallpaper.

60
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,482
A perfectly logical
explanation.

61
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,318
We're not buyin' it.
There is no explanation.

62
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,236
And there's
no old woman outside.

63
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,988
All we've got here
are two kids

64
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,615
with vivid imaginations.

65
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,242
They're referring to us.

66
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,578
Might I suggest
you two go downstairs

67
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,079
and pour yourself
some cereal?

68
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,039
We'll join you in a bit.

69
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,090
They're getting to you,
aren't they?

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,175
Yeah, a little.

71
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:20,720
You know, the mind
can play tricks on you.

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,222
Ghosts can play tricks too.

73

Look, I'm telling you,
it‐‐

74
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,900
It feels like
there is something
in this place.

75
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,569
Someone.

76
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,447
And it wants us out.

77
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,450
Wyatt: Mom! Dad!
Get down here!

78

They never mean anything.

Harper:
This was different,
real scary.

84
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,445
Griffin:
Like these pants.

85

It's like if I sneeze,
they're gonna split wide open.

Harper:
Then don't sneeze.

And remember the plan.

88
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,411
As soon as we realize
Daisy's not around,

89

I step in,
pretend I'm her,

why Grace wants us back here.

And I... play the new kid
next door.

Oh, uh, there you are.
Kirstin's coming in late,

169
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,391
so I need your help
at the café.

There's no time to explain.

Who are you?

172

What is this place?
I‐‐ I don't‐‐

173
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,609
I'm your great‐granddaughter,
and you traveled through time.

Time?

175

You're way in the future.

Like way, way.

177

Come on! No dawdling.

Go! Be me!

What's the update?

Kirstin (over phone):
I'm running Justin home,

187
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,315
and then I'll head back
to the café.

Off to the café, sounded like.
You've got to get to her.

Grace wants us to see?

possible.

324
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,466
Be right up!
You stay, Topher.

325
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,176
See if you can get it
to write something.

326
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:48,731
Hi. I'm Topher, by the way.
And you are?

327
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,694
Maybe instead I should ask,
who were you?

328
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,991
Okay. You don't like "who."
Let's try "why."

329
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,912
Why are you haunting this place,
these kids, this family?

330
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,002
Give me a letter.
Two letters, initials.

331
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,670
I'll take anything.

332
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,674
Whoa!

333
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,736

00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,670
No way!

336
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,553
Jess: Topher!

337
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,013
He was told
to come straight home.

338
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,932
Topher! Get down here!

339
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,226
Uh, Harper,
can you run upstairs
and get your brother?

340
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,894
Ten to one, he's streaming
some horror opus

341
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,354
instead of doing
his homework.

342
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,438
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,440
Ma'am?

344
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,526
Uh, Mother?

345
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,363
Mom is fine.
Always has been.

346
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,874
Griffin, what is going on
around here?

347
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,709
Oh, like I said,

348
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,628
it's a part
of her history class.

349
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,589
Harper's taking
this full immersion thing
very seriously.

350
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,050
Jumping in with
both lace‐up boots.

351
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,635
(sighs)
Nothing for dinner.

352
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,971
You know,
if you wouldn't mind,

353
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,931
can you tell Harper and Topher
I had to run to the market?

354
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,349
Oh, uh,
tacos are good for you?

355
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,892
Great!
I love tacos.

356
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,311
Of course,
they probably didn't have
tacos in the 1930s,

357
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,272
but I'm sure Harper
will gobble 'em right up.

358
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,149
Yeah.

359
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,713
She's an artist too.

360
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,090
Is that supposed to be
her father?

361
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,301
Griffin:
I guess so.

362
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,887
He died
when she was younger.

363
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,890
Like my mother died.

364
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,184
‐Grace?
‐Yes.

365
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,353
Grace.

366
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,647
I suppose
Harper misses her father

367
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,107
as much as
I miss my mother.

368
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,862
Look, Harper's mom
just ran to the market.

369
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,698
This is the perfect
opportunity to get you
back to 1930.

370
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,700
But we have to leave
right now.

371
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,910
Come on.

372
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,036
Leave, okay.
