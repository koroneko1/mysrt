1
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,708
Watch your nail.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,291
How is it, Doctor?

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,583
This is just an early symptom

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,375
of alcoholism.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,041
Chaba.

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,833
I'm not an alcoholic! I told you.

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,083
But he just said that.

8
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,708
I'm telling you I'm not.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,916
Listen, Chaba.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,416
If you're an alcoholic,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
you'll be dizzy. Your hands will shake.

12
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,708
He isn't like that.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,708
Right?

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,041
My name is Chaba.

15
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,375
My brother's name is Nun.
He's an alcoholic.

16
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,625
And I'm trying to get him to quit.

17
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:54,083
But I always fail.

18
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,125
But in the end,

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,333
do you know how he managed to quit?

20
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's find out.

21
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,375
Let's start at where he got addicted.

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,791
It began with this girl...

23
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,750
Nun!

24
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,500
What's up, Ning Nong?

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,166
Let's stay away from each other.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

27
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,750
Nun, you have no future.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,416
I have to do what's best for me.

29
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,250
What is this?

30
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,625
You're just an AC maintenance guy.

31
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,291
I'm not okay with that.

32
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,500
Ning Nong!

33
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,250
Ning Nong!

34
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,166
But I love you.

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,833
Don't you remember?

36
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,958
When you're with me,

37
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,750
I do everything for you.

38
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,541
When your ears are itchy, I scratch them.

39
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,500
When your back is itchy, I scratch it.

40
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:58,083
When your butt is itchy,
I scratch it, too.

41
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,541
And when your...

42
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,916
Hey! Stop!

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,333
And let me go!

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,625
I won't!

45
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,875
I love you.

46
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:10,416
I won't!

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,416
No! No!

48
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,500
Let me go!

49
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,041
You...

50
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,750
You want some more?

51
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,458
I don't want any,
but I don't want you to go.

52
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,083
If you don't stop, you'll eat this!

53
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,000
No! I won't stop!

54
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,833
I won't let you go!

55
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,791
Don't go!

56
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,541
Ning Nong! I won't let you!

57
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,708
Son of a bitch!

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,958
I'm right here.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,958
Right on my face.

60
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,250
She's gone!

61
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,291
I'll call the cops on you.

62
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,125
Your car is not up to standard!

63
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,208
Ning Nong!

64
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,208
Are you really going to leave me?

65
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,500
If the word love

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,041
Has hurt you

67
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,958
Far too much

68
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,083
Can you tell me...

69
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,833
Listen to me.

70
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,375
You are valued.

71
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,541
And you don't need anyone.

72
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,291
Singh.

73
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,500
You just shut up.

74
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,250
-Hey.
-I was wrong again.

75
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,875
Listen to me carefully.

76
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,708
There must be something good.

77
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,041
This is how girls are.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,125
They just pretend to be nice.

79
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,166
But a broken heart
does not know how to pretend.

80
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,041
Son of a bitch.

81
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,708
Shitty poem.

82
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,166
It doesn't even rhyme.

83
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,166
There are more girls than lizards.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,291
They don't even care
when their lovers disregard them.

85
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,750
Toss that damaged heart,
get out of the shade.

86
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,916
Right in the heart.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,333
Let's get wasted. Forget her.

88
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,541
Damn.

89
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,916
Cheers.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
If the word love

91
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,541
Has hurt you

92
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
Far too much

93
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,250
Can you tell me?

94
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,666
Let me wipe your tear

95
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,958
That's it.

96
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,083
That's it with suffering.

97
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,875
I'll throw that away...

98
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,000
with this glass.

99
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Yeah.

100
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,541
Hey!

101
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,875
From now on,

102
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,708
I will not suffer.

103
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,583
-You rock, Nun!
-Of course I do!

104
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,375
No more hurt feelings.

105
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,666
Only fun feelings.

106
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,916
We'll make merit by spreading liveliness.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,083
Of course!

108
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,041
Almost dislocated my shoulder there.

109
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,250
I feel like I'm a hero now.

110
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,625
Hell yeah.

111
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:17,458
We are heroes of fun.

112
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,916
Cheers!

113
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,875
Whatever's next has to be fun.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,791
I love you so much.

115
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,250
What's that?

116
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,375
HAPPY NEW YEAR HAPPY NEW YOU

117
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,000
-Hi, hello.
-Hi.

118
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,458
Sit down.

119
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,625
Wait.

120
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,333
-Uncle.
-Make yourself at home.

121
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,041
Hello, Uncle Cham.

122
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,333
-Hello.
-Who the hell are you guys?

123
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,708
Come on.

124
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,333
What kind of question is that?

125
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,208
I'm Nun.

126
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,333
Do I know you?

127
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,791
Why would I be here if you didn't?

128
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,125
I was here to fix your AC

129
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,500
five years ago.

130
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,541
Hey.

131
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,583
My AC only got installed seven months ago.

132
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,625
No.

133
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,250
The AC I'm talking about,
it was on the second floor.

134
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,666
My AC is on the floor downstairs.

135
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,833
You're messing it up.

136
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,875
-Why are you here?
-Well...

137
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,958
I heard there's a housewarming party.

138
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,041
For someone so close,
you'd be upset if I hadn't come.

139
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,083
Close?

140
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,166
We're close.

141
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,083
I'm bringing you some nice blessings.

142
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,458
-Okay.
-Well!

143
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,041
Come get your blessing.

144
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,916
He's not a monk,
but he's got some good blessings.

145
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,250
Okay.

146
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,583
I call for all blessings in the world.

147
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:46,625
Good, Singh.

148
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,000
Let you all be happy and well.

149
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,208
Let Uncle Cham be happy.

150
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,541
No suffering.

151
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,916
No poverty.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,041
No sickness.

153
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,458
Only wealth.

154
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,291
Wealth!

155
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,333
Thank you.

156
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,708
Wait up, Uncle.

157
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,791
Let me ask you something.
Are they done praying?

158
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,375
Oh, they're done.

159
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,375
So what happens when they're done?

160
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,500
Well, they go eat.

161
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,791
I see.

162
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,833
Correct. And after that?

163
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,416
They go back to the temple.

164
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,750
What about the guests?

165
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,750
They also go home.

166
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,583
What? Before that!

167
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,208
They eat before that.

168
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,708
I see.

169
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,041
Have you eaten?

170
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,125
Not yet.

171
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,083
Oh, come on! It's late! Why haven't you?

172
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
Why the fuck not?

173
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,416
What do you mean?

174
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,791
Remember? We're close.

175
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,333
-Right, I see.
-Just friends talking.

176
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,458
Then go eat.

177
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,500
Let me ask you frankly.

178
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you okay doing this?

179
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:48,500
It looks like you're a bit uncomfortable
to let us go in and eat.

180
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,500
But that's okay. We can just go.

181
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,333
-Let's go!
-Hey. Wait.

182
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,166
Good luck, then.

183
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,833
Uncle!

184
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:57,791
What's that for?

185
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,208
Just kidding.

186
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,791
-Let's go eat.
-Which table?

187
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,625
Any table that's empty. Go find your seat.

188
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,208
I want some booze.

189
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,833
Okay. Sit down.

190
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,041
Hello, Father.

191
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,458
Hello.

192
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,791
Hello. Hello.

193
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,375
Bless you. We have the same hair.

194
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,833
Wow.

195
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,250
Who arranged this meal?

196
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,375
There's only chicken.

197
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,583
Here.

198
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,166
My gosh, how do you chew this stuff?

199
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,041
Right? Come on.

200
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,666
Let's go.

201
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,708
Let's get it.

202
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,416
The chicken is so chewy it's dangerous.

203
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,250
-What about this?
-That, too.

204
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,875
Oh, what's this?

205
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,000
That is chicken. And this is chicken, too?

206
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,291
Take it.

207
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,458
-Hey, what about this?
-Take it.

208
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,750
Fish maw soup? Pig skin?

209
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
They're dangerous for you monks.
It'll get stuck in your throat.

210
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,916
Why don't you take the rice, too?

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,166
If we do that, what would you eat, then?

212
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,791
Like you care.

213
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,416
I'm Thai, too.

214
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,625
-Hey, Cham!
-Yeah.

215
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,250
Who are they?

216
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,375
Close friends.

217
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,541
Are you close with them?

218
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,500
They are with me.
I actually don't know them.

219
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,916
How is that close?

220
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,625
What the hell?

221
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,708
And this soup. Would you like me
to put it on the monks' table?

222
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,000
Hold on. No.

223
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,125
-I'll give it to them.
-Okay.

224
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,166
-Cham.
-Yeah?

225
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,666
-Let's go.
-Let's go, then.

226
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,333
-Give it to them yourself.
-All right.

227
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,500
Wait, wait, wait!

228
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,416
-What?
-What are you doing?

229
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,708
Is this fish soup?

230
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,458
-Yeah, for the monks.
-Hey!

231
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,916
What were you thinking?

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,666
You killed a fish
to cook it for the monks?

233
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,708
This is a sin for us all. Are you crazy?

234
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,583
And we don't even know if this fish is
a daddy fish, a baby fish or a mommy fish.

235
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,375
What if someone killed your parents, huh?

236
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,291
Huh, Uncle? What would you say then?

237
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,458
Bring it here.

238
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,375
Hey. That's for the monks.

239
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,458
Hey! Bring it here.

240
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,000
No, that's for the monks.

241
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,291
I told you to bring it here.

242
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,375
For the monks.

243
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey! My ceremony is fucking ruined.

244
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,208
Hey! You can't use that kind of language!

245
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,541
My ceremony is fucking ruined, sir!

246
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,833
That's nicer.

247
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,916
Chaba, your brother is causing
trouble here at Uncle Cham's.

248
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,750
-What?
-Come quick.

249
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,166
I'm going now.

250
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,125
Nun!

251
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,166
Wait. Help me!

252
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,791
Seab, get some water to clean him here.

253
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,916
Okay.

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,041
Quick!

255
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,208
You fugly face!

256
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,000
Please don't talk like that here.

257
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,500
Okay. You fugly face, sir.

258
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,958
That's nicer.

259
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,416
Seab! Who told you
to throw the water like that?

260
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,291
You did!

261
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,083
-You're talking back to me now?
-Why don't you do it yourself?

262
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,041
Hey! Stop talking back to me.

263
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,083
-Hey!
-Father!

264
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,833
-Hot!
-Water!

265
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,708
Father, come here.

266
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,791
-It's hot!
-Let's hurry.

267
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
What are you doing?

268
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,833
Come on now, jump.

269
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,833
Jump, Father! Jump!

270
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,250
Hey, Chaba.

271
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
-Yes.
-Over there!

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,875
Hey!

273
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,333
Come on, Father.

274
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,291
That must have been many gulps.

275
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,416
You can say "thank you" now.

276
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,791
I came down to help you.

277
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,000
He's so wet now.

278
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,375
Are these three your close friends?

279
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,583
I don't know them.

280
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,666
Why did you do this?

281
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,833
He could have died.

282
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,333
You didn't even know him.

283
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,500
Why did you even go there?

284
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,541
Oh, well. I know him.
I went to fix his AC once.

285
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,208
Fixing his AC once
doesn't mean you know him.

286
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,541
It means he's a customer.

287
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,083
You are so hard to be friends with.

288
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,833
You don't get it.

289
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,416
Thanks.

290
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,833
-You got it?
-Got it.

291
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,500
-Chaba.
-Oh, lots of snacks!

292
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,750
I didn't buy them.

293
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
This bag,

294
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,625
this comes from Noi,
the technique supervisor.

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
With a message.

296
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,458
"If you get tired of eating snacks,
you could come and eat me."

297
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,625
And this one,

298
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,041
this belongs to Peng,
the building supervisor.

299
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,833
With a message saying,

300
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,666
"Even if I look ordinary,

301
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,916
I'm groovy and serious about love."

302
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,208
Groovy, my ass.

303
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,875
Chaba won't be interested. You know why?

304
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,833
There.

305
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,708
Her bae is right there.

306
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,625
Hey. Come on.

307
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,125
-Chill.
-Always so flirty.

308
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,916
-Chaba.
-Yeah?

309
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,458
Yesterday, I saw your brother's gang going
to Aunty Sri's son's graduation party.

310
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,000
He knows a lot of people, right?

311
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,916
He doesn't really.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,625
He's just there to get free food.

313
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,833
It kinda sucks.

314
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,958
Why?

315
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,833
Look at my brother.

316
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,000
What's going to happen when he's old?

317
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,291
He'll probably die of alcohol poisoning.

318
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,000
Sister Jim!

319
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,625
-Who's that?
-Hello.

320
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,750
Who the hell are you?

321
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,125
Here.

322
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,375
Don't touch me.

323
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,791
Don't you remember me? I'm Nun.

324
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,875
Nun who?

325
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,375
If you can't remember Nun,
then you must know Seab.

326
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,833
Seab who?

327
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,791
Look familiar?
I installed an AC at your house.

328
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,625
There are three ACs upstairs
and two downstairs.

329
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,958
But I don't know you people.

330
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,458
That's okay. What are you all doing?

331
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,791
-This is my brother's ordination ceremony.
-Is that so?

332
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,291
We're drinking now.

333
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,500
What are you drinking?

334
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,000
You wouldn't know.

335
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,625
Look, sister.

336
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,666
I can smell it from here.

337
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,750
Come on here.

338
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,875
Rice whiskey with red soda.

339
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,875
-So good.
-Come here.

340
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,125
How is it, Seab?

341
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,333
Chinese liquor and Pepsi.

342
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,791
Hey!

343
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,041
I don't know. You take care of him.

344
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,875
But you, Chaba...

345
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,041
I'll take care of you.

346
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,583
How would you take care of me, huh?

347
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,791
Well...

348
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,666
with my whole life.

349
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
What? Too cheesy?

350
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,083
I like it.

351
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,750
Really?

352
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,916
-What?
-Nun is causing trouble here.

353
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,083
-Just come quick.
-What? Shit.

354
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,333
What?

355
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,625
Hey! Where are you going?

356
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,666
Hey.

357
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
Hey, out of the way!

358
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,416
Move.

359
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,916
Let go of me.

360
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,666
I'm fine.

361
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,958
Jim, my dear, hello.

362
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,208
My dear, my ass.

363
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,291
We meet again.

364
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,916
Don't you guys have anywhere to go?

365
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,791
Everyone is here.

366
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,750
Is this your daughter?

367
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,750
My daughter.

368
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
-Do you dance at every ceremony?
-This is my first.

369
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,625
I see the daughter. I want to see the mom.

370
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,750
You want some?

371
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,791
Music!

372
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,708
Hey! Cool!

373
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,250
Stop!

374
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,833
Who the hell is this?

375
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,750
Jim, we only have one minute
of auspicious time left.

376
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,333
Say that to Father.
Wait for me. I'm having fun here.

377
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,416
No, you have to go in now.

378
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,875
That's easy.

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,125
-Seab.
-What?

380
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,125
Run!

381
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,375
Quick!

382
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,458
Let's move so they can make it.

383
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,208
Oh, my God!

384
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,250
-Fuck.
-Run!

385
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,333
Stop. Where do you think you're going?

386
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,708
We're done here, so we're leaving.

387
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
Leaving, my ass!
My brother's ordination is ruined.

388
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,541
You bastard!

389
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,500
Asshole!

390
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,583
Sinner!

391
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,833
-Your face looks like feet!
-Is that so?

392
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll kick your ass.

393
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,958
Are you waiting for me?

394
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,666
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,916
Let's drink.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,833
Happy birthday.

397
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,708
Cheers.

398
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,125
Happy birthday, my dear friend.

399
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,375
-Yeah.
-I wish you the best.

400
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,958
Get 10,000 baht while you sleep.

401
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,750
And more when you wake up!

402
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,708
You're so loud that I'm scared.

403
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,833
Amen.

404
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,500
If I do get 100,000,
I'll spend it all in one day.

405
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,500
Crazy.

406
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,666
-Who would spend that in a day?
-Right.

407
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,375
Have you guys forgotten?

408
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,416
I've got debts. My house, my student loan.

409
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,041
The interest is blooming
better than any flower.

410
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,291
Better than the one on your head.

411
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,333
Bitch, if it blooms more than this,
there's no point in working.

412
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,875
No wishes here.

413
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,333
I know you're already happy.

414
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,000
And you know I love you no matter what.

415
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,208
I'm going to throw up!

416
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,416
Okay, then.

417
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,541
Chaba.

418
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,333
What I told you

419
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,833
that I quit working here to go to Bangkok?

420
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,375
You aren't mad at me, right?

421
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,500
Nonsense. Why would I be mad?

422
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,833
I know why you want to go there.

423
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,291
You want to earn more money.

424
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,875
-I want to tell you...
-What?

425
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,083
Even though we're apart...

426
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,625
our hearts...

427
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,166
are together.

428
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,250
Am I still here?
Did I even come here today?

429
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,083
You two go sit upstairs, then.

430
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,375
Look at her smiling.

431
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,708
Chaba.

432
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,416
Happy birthday.

433
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,208
A ring?

434
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,750
Watch me.

435
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,500
This year...

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
I'm giving you this small gold ring.

437
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,833
And next year,

438
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,166
I'll give you a big gold necklace.

439
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,000
I hope you aren't just saying that.

440
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,458
-If you can't do it, it'll look bad.
-Yeah.

441
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,666
It's gold. Not some shit. It's not cheap.

442
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,166
Can you even do that?

443
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,583
Don't listen to them.

444
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,083
I believe you.

445
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,958
Thank you, Chaba.

446
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,791
It's quiet.

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,333
Damn!

448
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,708
Let me just fart to break the silence.

449
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,416
-Don't call it a fart.
-What do they call it, then?

450
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,041
They call it sending a message.

451
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,958
Hey, come on, let's get us some.

452
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,416
Hello!

453
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,166
Today,

454
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,291
it's my dear sister's birthday.

455
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,291
And what a coincidence.

456
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,875
It's also Seab's birthday.

457
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,375
Still single here.

458
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,666
That means today

459
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,208
is such a blessed day.

460
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,708
That makes sense.

461
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,291
-Nun.
-Yes.

462
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,708
Since it's my birthday...

463
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,875
-What's up, sis?
-Can I ask for a present?

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,958
You are my dear sister.

465
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,500
Don't just ask for one present.

466
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,833
Ask for many presents.

467
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,375
Tell me.

468
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,791
I want to ask

469
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,375
that you quit drinking for life.

470
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,916
Can you do that?

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,416
It's my birthday.

472
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,875
I ask every year.

473
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,166
-To quit drinking?
-Yes.

474
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,833
Well... okay.

475
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,625
You asked, so I'll have to do it.

476
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,291
I'll quit drinking for you, Chaba.

477
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,416
All right.

478
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,083
I'll quit for you. Hey, you guys...

479
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,166
Come.

480
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,458
Let's get our glasses together.

481
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,916
We will quit drinking now.

482
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,083
Can we still have beer?

483
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,416
Hey.

484
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,333
Please? A chilled beer tastes good.

485
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,125
-Don't say that.
-No more.

486
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,583
Thank you, Nun.

487
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,875
-We have to quit all drinking.
-You said it.

488
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,166
Yeah. I do.

489
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,625
Nun.

490
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,916
-Today is my birthday, too.
-Yes.

491
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,791
What do you want?

492
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,791
Can I ask...

493
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,041
that we all return to drinking?

494
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,416
Yeah!

495
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
You can't do that.

496
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,791
It's my birthday, too! Why not?

497
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,916
I was born today. No!

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,166
Wait. Everyone, stop.

499
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,833
Since it's my sister's birthday,

500
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,250
I'll give it to her.

501
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,875
Now my brother is asking.

502
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,708
Of course I'll give it to him.

503
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,791
Bottoms up!

504
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,541
What the hell.

505
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,000
Careful, you'll get drunk
on that green soda.

506
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,416
This is for you to snack on in the bus.

507
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,083
Chaba,

508
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,208
the reason I'm going to work in Bangkok

509
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,250
is for me to earn money to pay your debts.

510
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey! But they're not your debts.

511
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,541
Your problem is mine.

512
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,000
I can do it. You'll see.

513
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,041
Come on.

514
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,958
Tee! Her debts are 100,000 baht.

515
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,416
You're daydreaming.

516
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,166
I only have you.

517
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,333
Of course I can do it.

518
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,583
Let's just say
it's our wedding dowry in advance.

519
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,291
You're going too far.

520
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,833
Are you serious?

521
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,166
I'll come back
and build a family with you.

522
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,041
Tee...

523
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,416
before doing that,

524
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,166
maybe you should check the time.

525
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,583
The bus is leaving, dude.
They're all waiting for you.

526
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,666
Are you going? Want a room here?

527
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,000
Go.

528
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,291
Take care of yourself.

529
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,916
You, too.

530
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,333
-Bye.
-Bye.

531
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,958
4 MONTHS LATER

532
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,750
Hey, did Tee get a job in Bangkok?

533
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,250
He told me he did.

534
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,125
I'm sorry. There's no job vacancy.

535
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,458
They said working in Bangkok is hard,

536
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,125
and life there is hard, too.

537
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,250
But he told me he's doing well.

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,291
Which company is he working at?

539
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,291
Right. He didn't tell me.

540
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,958
But he said he works at a big company

541
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,458
with a kind boss.

542
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:05,750
Hello.

543
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,458
Well, I'm happy for him, then.

544
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,583
Yeah.

545
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:18,125
WEDDING OF DAOREUNG AND AI-SOON

546
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,666
Hello, Joy.

547
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,583
-Hey, Chaba.
-Sis.

548
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,291
You look good today.

549
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,791
-Thanks.
-Congrats.

550
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,875
Ten and Piew couldn't make it today.

551
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,000
I have their gifts here.

552
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,916
That's nice, thank you.

553
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,791
Is there anything I can help with here?

554
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,791
It's okay. I don't want to bother you.

555
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:35,958
I'll help serve the drinks, then.

556
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,583
Is that okay?

557
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,041
Okay, Thanks.

558
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,250
It's nice to have good friends.

559
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,666
Thank you so much
from the bottom of my heart.

560
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,875
Thank you for coming here
to celebrate with us tonight.

561
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,625
We've been together for a long time.

562
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,250
And if you ask me

563
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,166
which part of her that I love the most,

564
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,375
I love...

565
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,375
her eyes.

566
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,416
The way she looks at me,

567
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,041
I can feel it instantly.

568
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,625
She's sincere

569
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,041
and she only loves me.

570
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,208
I love her.

571
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:20,000
Thank you to our honored guests

572
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:23,041
for joining us here
on our unfortunate event.

573
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,208
Fortunate.

574
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,791
Right.

575
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,208
Fortunate event

576
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,916
between me... and Joy.

577
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,375
Lastly...

578
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,875
I'd like to tell our guests...

579
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,500
please don't eat too much.

580
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,333
We'll check your gifts.

581
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,041
Just let them eat.

582
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,583
Enjoy the food.

583
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,125
Hey!

584
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,541
Honey.

585
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,125
Did you invite them?

586
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:52,875
No. I don't know them.

587
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,625
Actually, no one invited us.

588
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,375
But today is a good day.

589
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,041
Good day.

590
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,166
We'd like to make a toast
to the bride and groom.

591
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,916
Let me say this.

592
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,791
We know the bride, Chaba's senior.

593
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,833
But we're not so close.

594
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,833
The one who is close is...

595
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,041
-Nun.
-Hey.

596
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,750
Nun. Come here and make a toast.

597
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,500
Of course, I'm already here.

598
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,500
You don't have to.

599
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,083
Please give them a toast.

600
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,875
I didn't even finish pissing yet.

601
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,125
-Hello to the groom.
-Hello.

602
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,041
I'm not that familiar with the groom.

603
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,000
I barely know him.

604
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,666
-But Joy here.
-What?

605
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,958
I'm super close with her.

606
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,791
I've known her since she was little.

607
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,833
It is her.

608
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:44,583
She was a lot thinner earlier.

609
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,500
Now she's fat
and she takes too many pills.

610
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,083
This bitch,

611
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,375
she's been married three times already.

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,500
She ran away with a boy when she was 14.

613
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,541
She got pregnant,

614
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,958
and then he left her.

615
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:03,541
She came back to live with her mom
and brought a kid for her to raise.

616
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,458
Well, can you handle that?

617
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,416
Yes, it's all in the past.

618
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,041
That's good.

619
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,166
My dear.

620
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,291
Thank you.

621
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,791
After coming back to live with her mom,

622
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,625
she only stayed for two months

623
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,791
before running away to live in Pattaya.

624
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,833
Then she got together with a Black guy.

625
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,041
Can you also handle that?

626
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,791
Yes. It's the past.

627
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,125
-Wow.
-Joy.

628
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,416
You're a saint.

629
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,958
Thank you.

630
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:35,291
Your ex is also here. There in the front.

631
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,458
Hi.

632
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:41,208
Is that alright with you?

633
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:43,541
Bitch.

634
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,541
Why did you lie to me?

635
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,583
I didn't lie.

636
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,125
Who's that? Is that your ex?

637
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,083
I don't know him. Nun is lying.

638
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,125
-Nun!
-What?

639
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:53,500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

640
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,750
You're ruining my wedding!

641
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,083
I'm just telling the truth.

642
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,541
Why did you do that?

643
00:27:58,625 --> 00:27:59,750
Can you even handle the truth?

644
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,125
What the fuck is the truth?

645
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,208
Calm down.

646
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,125
Look.

647
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,666
Sis, I'm sorry.

648
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,625
-Chaba!
-I'm sorry.

649
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,666
-You get your brother down.
-He's drunk.

650
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,750
Please don't mind him.

651
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,166
Drunk, my ass! He's telling the truth.

652
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,083
Get out of here, Chaba!

653
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,000
-Get your brother out of here.
-I'm sorry, sis.

654
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,041
-Go.
-Go, Nun!

655
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,208
You bastard!

656
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,125
Dear.

657
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,375
Leave me alone.

658
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:21,791
You take care of this.

659
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,500
Take care of this Black guy here.

660
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,916
That Joy.

661
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,291
The rule is, no exes at the wedding,

662
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,500
and she invited him.

663
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:34,041
I think after this,
they should set a new rule.

664
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,000
What's that?

665
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,041
Not just no exes at the wedding.

666
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,958
Your brother's gang as well.

667
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:43,250
Look, I've said it so many times already.

668
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,916
And Tee doesn't pick up his phone.
Damn it.

669
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,583
Do you think he's got
a new girl in Bangkok?

670
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:49,666
Hey.

671
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,958
Hey.

672
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,041
Have you been very busy lately?
You haven't picked up my calls.

673
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,166
Well, just now...

674
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,375
I just got promoted to assistant manager.

675
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,583
Hey.

676
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,541
Too much work and too little time.

677
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,083
He got promoted to assistant manager.

678
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,791
Assistant manager?

679
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,541
That's a quick move up. Seriously.

680
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,708
Is your boyfriend an elevator?

681
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:18,666
Yeah.

682
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,125
I see. I'm happy for you.

683
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:24,000
-Yeah.
-So...

684
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,833
you haven't come home recently.

685
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,250
Are you sure you're not seeing a new girl?

686
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,833
Come on. Nothing like that.

687
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,458
Are you coming back for the new year?

688
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,750
Of course.

689
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,250
I miss you with all my heart.

690
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,791
Okay, then I'll see you.

691
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,791
I won't bother you anymore.

692
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,458
Why don't you eat the phone, too?

693
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,500
Yeah.

694
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,583
Mom...

695
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,166
I miss you.

696
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,916
Can you somehow get Nun to quit drinking?

697
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,833
I don't know what to do anymore.

698
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,166
It's late and I don't know where he is.

699
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:15,375
I'm so sorry.

700
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,375
Thank you.

701
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,000
You can go over there to see him.

702
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,833
Poor woman. It's only her now.

703
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,916
She doesn't have a job.
She's just a housewife.

704
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:27,916
Yes.

705
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,291
Bad luck.

706
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,625
It was only her husband who worked.

707
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,916
And now, what's she going to do?
Quite difficult.

708
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,958
And this.

709
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:41,166
How much would the funeral cost?

710
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,083
How far can she even go?

711
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,750
I only gave her 20. I feel a bit guilty.

712
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,916
Hey, are we in the world of cartoons now?

713
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:54,333
I want to see her face.
I've only heard the voice.

714
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,583
I think this family is weird.

715
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,333
-Yeah.
-How's that?

716
00:30:59,416 --> 00:31:01,916
They like to make the food
according to the name of the dead.

717
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:05,125
Remember?
His sister died and her name was Fish.

718
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,375
Fish died. Her funeral food
was fish maw soup.

719
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:12,375
And when Uncle Pig died,
it was pork porridge.

720
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,000
And what if his eldest brother dies?
Brother Dog?

721
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,041
Are we all going to have to eat dogs?

722
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,458
Shut up.

723
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:27,791
I really want to know,
who the hell are you?

724
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,416
Whenever someone in my family dies,
you're always at the funeral.

725
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,083
None of my relatives know you.

726
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,416
Quiet, this is a funeral.

727
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,875
I'm Nun.

728
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:38,791
Nun who?

729
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:43,166
Hey! I fixed your AC.
I'm the legendary AC guy.

730
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,875
You're just an AC guy.

731
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,916
You fixed it for me once
and now you think we're close?

732
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,125
So close that you're attending
my husband's funeral?

733
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,291
That's right.

734
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,291
Let me say this.

735
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:55,958
I'm sorry for your loss.

736
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,750
Is this how you look when you're sorry?

737
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,708
Give her some good quotes.

738
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:05,041
"When we leave this world, boy and girls,

739
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,875
only good things are left to ponder.

740
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:11,875
The bond will always be here

741
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,916
forever and ever."

742
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,666
Mom, I hope it's not about Nun.

743
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,500
Yes.

744
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:37,541
Chaba, come take care
of your brother at the funeral.

745
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,208
This is common.

746
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,250
You have to gamble at a funeral.

747
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,875
They say it's to keep the dead company.

748
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,125
So the dead won't be lonely.

749
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,916
Trust me on this one.

750
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,291
Two, three and four.

751
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,208
Two, three and four

752
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,791
Goddamn! You're right on.

753
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,875
Are you still here?

754
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,125
Let's play this then.

755
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,375
What's this?

756
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,833
This is one, six and four.

757
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,416
One, two and two.

758
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:27,458
All six.

759
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,041
All in! I'm not scared of losing.

760
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,916
-Wait.
-Hey, sis.

761
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,208
-What?
-I want number six.

762
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,958
All of this. 10,000 baht.

763
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,041
All in! I'm not scared, either.

764
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,166
You're dead. You're dead.

765
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,875
Fuck! Fuck!

766
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,833
The cops are here!

767
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,708
The cops are here?

768
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,250
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to pee.

769
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,333
Not yet.

770
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:01,791
-I'm going to pee.
-Gather here.

771
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,750
-Hold up.
-I'm gonna pee over there.

772
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,791
Stop! Stop!

773
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:08,875
I'll be really quick.

774
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,708
Nun! You asshole! Come and get some.

775
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,250
Hey, sis. What's this?

776
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,750
-I thought you said all six.
-I was just guessing.

777
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,000
Six, my ass.

778
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,125
Arrest her! She's using profanity.

779
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,500
That will be two charges!

780
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,583
I'm going to pee
and then I'll come back to you.

781
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,958
I'm sorry.

782
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,083
I'm sorry.

783
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,750
Let's go.

784
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,291
A little lower.

785
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,500
-Get it in.
-Tee.

786
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,250
Hello, sir.

787
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,208
How are the lights
I asked you to fix at my condo?

788
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,583
All done, sir.

789
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,000
This evening, get my car
and go park it there for me.

790
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,416
Yes, sir.

791
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,375
Okay.

792
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,708
Hello, Mr. Wat. How can I help?

793
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,166
Hey!

794
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,500
He bought a condo for a safehouse?

795
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
Is it true?
They said he likes to have fun there.

796
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,166
With the mistress.

797
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,708
I guess so.

798
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,250
How is he so rich?

799
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,875
He's the owner of a used-car dealership.

800
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,875
Of course he's rich.

801
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,750
I know he owns this,
but it just seems too much.

802
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:19,791
What's your problem with him?

803
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,750
Hey.

804
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,041
-What?
-I think the best way

805
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,833
is you take your brother to rehab.

806
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,666
The last time I saw him, he was like...

807
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,708
He was shaking like a generator.

808
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,583
He can't quit. I give up.

809
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,875
There are people who can quit, you know?

810
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,208
There are many good doctors.

811
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:42,583
I know someone.

812
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,750
Do you want to try?

813
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,041
Which doctor?

814
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,291
Why is everyone here?

815
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,833
We were told you can help us.

816
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,625
I want my brother to stop drinking.

817
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,375
You want him to stop drinking?

818
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,458
Easy, don't bother him.
He will stop himself.

819
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,250
Not drinking like that.

820
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:03,875
He's an alcoholic.

821
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,541
But before we start...

822
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,375
I have some amulets for sale.

823
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,291
This one is for protection.

824
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,583
I'll give it to you for 200 baht each.

825
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,958
Raise your hand if you want one.

826
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:16,333
Do you see any hands?

827
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,875
You want some, you get some.

828
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,666
That's pushing.

829
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,458
You want to quit drinking?

830
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,583
-Yeah.
-Give me your hand.

831
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,250
-Hey.
-Hey!

832
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,541
Shit! What the hell did you do?

833
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,583
No disrespect.
I'm starting the ceremony now.

834
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,958
I'm going to get the alcohol out.

835
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,708
I need to get the blood.

836
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:42,458
I will cast my spell on it,
then put the blood back in.

837
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,250
Hey! What are you thinking?

838
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,791
Is there any other way?

839
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,208
There are other ways.

840
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,916
-Why don't you use them, then?
-Well, you didn't ask.

841
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,125
What the hell?

842
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,833
-You're saying that to me?
-Hell yeah.

843
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,708
Damn it. I thought so. Let's do this.

844
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,333
Take this candy, and this rishi's mantra.

845
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,250
I'll cast my spell on it.

846
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,458
No sleep for seven days and seven nights.

847
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,250
Everyone's in on this.
All three parts, they're here.

848
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:08,125
Then it comes out. All for us. All right.

849
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:09,208
Open your mouth.

850
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,416
Oh, my God.

851
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,291
Give it a try.

852
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,958
Here.

853
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,333
I'm not an alcoholic.

854
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,208
Master! Why did you slap me?

855
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,291
Keep it in your mouth. No chewing!

856
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,375
Why didn't you say that before?

857
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,291
Well, you didn't ask.

858
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,583
-You have to tell me that.
-Do you want to do this?

859
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,750
Calm down.

860
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,958
Get the pig near the bear.

861
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,500
-The bear--
-Wait.

862
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:36,000
-What's this?
-This is a chanting spell.

863
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,875
To call the spirit of the pig and the bear

864
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,291
to fight alcohol out of the body.

865
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,958
Get the pig near the bear.

866
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,166
Put the pig's tail inside the bear's ear.

867
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,541
Pig's tail, bear's ear, look carefully.

868
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,458
Banana tree hanging low.

869
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,041
Bananas dangling around. Got it?

870
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:57,958
What the hell!

871
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,250
Pig, squid, shrimp. Cook, steam, boil.

872
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,208
Master!

873
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,000
Hey, master!

874
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,250
What the hell?

875
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,458
I'll kick you in the face.

876
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,791
If you don't have faith, get out!

877
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,125
Why did you hit me so many times?

878
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,458
I'm not your kid.

879
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:09,583
You want to be better?

880
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,166
Yeah. But I don't want it from you!

881
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,125
No disrespect!

882
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,708
I'll disrespect the hell out of you. Damn!

883
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,791
Go! Get out of here.

884
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,416
Go. Get up, Chaba.

885
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,208
I didn't believe it in the first place.

886
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,250
-I don't want to quit anymore.
-Come on.

887
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:30,791
-Somebody got murdered for a bit of gold.
-Hey!

888
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,250
I need someone to work
during the New Year holidays.

889
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:36,458
Something urgent has come up.

890
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,125
Someone needs to be here
to receive the parts.

891
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,833
My wife is pregnant.
I need to take care of her.

892
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,500
I have to visit my mom in the country.

893
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,000
What?

894
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,458
What about you, Tee?

895
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:53,125
If you don't have a plan, I want you here.

896
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,083
And get my car washed.

897
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,500
I'll give you some extra.

898
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:57,750
Well, actually--

899
00:38:57,833 --> 00:39:00,000
It's only three days. Okay?

900
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,541
-Okay, sir.
-Okay.

901
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,625
Stop by my condo today.

902
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,166
The bathroom sink,

903
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,583
it's dripping. Check it out for me.

904
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,375
But go there after 1:00 p.m.

905
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,291
Yes, sir.

906
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,333
I'm off now.

907
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,500
James.

908
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:26,416
James.

909
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,625
Shit.

910
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,166
What are you doing?

911
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,625
Looking for fucks to give.

912
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,375
Why are you like this?

913
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,500
Hey, I'm the head of security.

914
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,291
But I only see you on this floor.

915
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:42,708
-I like this floor.
-Why so?

916
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,500
There are many mistresses here.

917
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,458
So?

918
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,458
I only have to walk past.

919
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,083
Just the sound makes me feel good.

920
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,208
You're a creep.

921
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,458
Hey, don't call me a creep.
I'm more like a pervert.

922
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,500
Okay.

923
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,000
What are you doing here?

924
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,083
Well...

925
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,666
my boss sent me to check the water pipe.

926
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,708
He said...

927
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,708
there would be no one here after 1:00 p.m.

928
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,333
Where did he go?

929
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:28,125
I can't reach him.

930
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,666
I don't know.

931
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,041
Then I'll...

932
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,083
wait outside, then.

933
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,833
-Hi, Chaba.
-Hello?

934
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,541
What are you doing?

935
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:58,625
I'm at the condo.

936
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,125
What's up?

937
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,291
I know.

938
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,708
You're never going to break up with her.

939
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,041
Why did you lie to me?

940
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,583
Why did you give me hope?

941
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,166
You said we'll be together on New Year's.

942
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,125
You won't be here, right?

943
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,458
Whose voice is that?

944
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,666
No one. It's the TV.

945
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,125
How does the TV sound so clear?

946
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:21,500
Well, the TV here is very big, Chaba.

947
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,166
So your condo...

948
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,916
is it that big and fancy?

949
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,375
Well, yeah.

950
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,708
It's arranged by the company.

951
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,375
But I don't like it so much.

952
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:31,625
That's weird.

953
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:34,458
What? Yeah, that's weird.

954
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,000
Are you finished?

955
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,166
I'm done now.

956
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,916
Can I see your face?

957
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,083
Hold on, Chaba. I'll pack my stuff.

958
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,208
What are you doing?

959
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:49,750
Quick.

960
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,416
Turn on your camera.

961
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,791
Just a moment.

962
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,541
Here, Chaba.

963
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:05,666
I'm at the condo.

964
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:12,250
Is this your condo? It's so fancy.

965
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:16,708
Well, the company I work for,

966
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,166
they also own this condo.

967
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,500
So I get the benefit.

968
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:22,791
I see.

969
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,416
I just wanted to ask,

970
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,083
what time are you coming back?

971
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:28,166
I was about to tell you.

972
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:29,708
Actually...

973
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,250
I have to work.

974
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,208
I can't go back this time.

975
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,375
What? Why?

976
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:39,208
FREE NEW YEAR PARTY 2020 FOR VIP
WITH CELEBRITY GUESTS AT MASTER VILLAGE

977
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,458
Well, actually,

978
00:42:43,541 --> 00:42:45,541
they're having a party here.

979
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,625
And I'm the vice-chairman of the party,
so I have to be here.

980
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:51,041
So many celebrities will be here.

981
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:54,041
I have to come or I'll get chewed out.

982
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:56,958
I'll come back to see you
after New Year's.

983
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,750
What?

984
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,166
I have to go back to work now.

985
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,375
See you.

986
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,750
What the hell?

987
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,166
Why is he in such a hurry?

988
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,791
So obvious.

989
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,833
A woman's voice saying she's done?

990
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,875
Bitch, you don't have to stress me out.

991
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,875
He said it came from the TV.

992
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:21,083
You cannot trust guys on this.

993
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,208
Have you seen that soap opera?

994
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,833
That guy.

995
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,541
He has a mistress

996
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,750
while his wife is staying home

997
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:30,833
because she trusts him.

998
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,833
And what about that other soap opera?

999
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,458
Her husband leaves this girl
to join the military.

1000
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,833
And then what?

1001
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,166
He gets another wife.

1002
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:45,375
Come on. You just watch too much TV.

1003
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,791
You're overthinking it.

1004
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:56,916
You look like you're way worse.

1005
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,875
SANUN AIR-CON SERVICE

1006
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,291
Okay, let's get our stuff.

1007
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,875
What?

1008
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,833
-Why is it so hot?
-Bro.

1009
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,666
-Yeah.
-I won't be here for a few days

1010
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,583
during the New Year holidays.

1011
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:17,791
Where are you going?

1012
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,708
I want to go see Tee.

1013
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,375
What?

1014
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,541
I thought he was coming to see you.

1015
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,208
Yeah.

1016
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,666
And now he's not.

1017
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,833
He told me he needs to be at the condo.

1018
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,291
There's a countdown party.
Something about a concert.

1019
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,333
For New Year's?

1020
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,250
Yeah.

1021
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,625
Chaba. Are you serious?

1022
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:37,833
I'm going, too.

1023
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,416
I want to go to the party in Bangkok!

1024
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,750
What's up, Chaba?

1025
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,083
I'm coming to see you in Bangkok.

1026
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,041
What?

1027
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,000
You're coming here?

1028
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,250
Yeah.

1029
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,458
Can't I?

1030
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,500
Okay.

1031
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,333
But I'd also like to bring my brother.

1032
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:04,625
Nun, Singh, Seab.

1033
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,333
What? Everyone's coming?

1034
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:16,666
How long will you be gone, sir?

1035
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,625
Maybe three or four days.

1036
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,541
What's up?

1037
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:22,500
Nothing, sir.

1038
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:31,458
What's up, Chaba?

1039
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:32,666
Hello?

1040
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,041
Tee, I'm here now.

1041
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:35,958
What?

1042
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,291
Are you in Bangkok?

1043
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,208
The taxi is here. I have to go.

1044
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,083
Okay, see you.

1045
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:46,916
Damn!

1046
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,000
Tee.

1047
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,541
-Better be early than late, sir.
-What?

1048
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,375
Dude. Is this a cab or a temple?

1049
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:06,625
It's full of Buddha statues.

1050
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,458
All the good ones.

1051
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:09,875
Let's all pay some respect.

1052
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:14,125
Where to?

1053
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,583
Sathorn.

1054
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,041
Come on.

1055
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,833
Why Sathorn?

1056
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,958
No parking, bad traffic.

1057
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:21,958
Cops everywhere.

1058
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:25,291
Why so grumpy? We're not from here.

1059
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,291
Why do so many of you come here?

1060
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:28,916
Jesus.

1061
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:32,458
Bangkok wasn't like this before, you know.
Not so many people.

1062
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,375
Now, with people coming from the country,

1063
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,250
everyone is fighting to live.

1064
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,625
Bangkok is full now.

1065
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,666
The weather is bad, air pollution.

1066
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:42,000
Do you know about this PM 2.5?

1067
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:43,250
It's everywhere now.

1068
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,875
People have to wear masks outside.

1069
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,375
It's like that TV show, The Masked Singer.

1070
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,500
Bro. Have you seen The Masked Singer?

1071
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,875
-Of course.
-Which mask is your favorite?

1072
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,375
-Bael fruit.
-Bael fruit?

1073
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,125
-Is there one?
-Will I go blind?

1074
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:59,291
They even have a durian mask!
Of course they have a bael fruit mask.

1075
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,875
Are you from Bangkok?

1076
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,541
Yeah. Since my past life.

1077
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,916
A real Bangkokian.

1078
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,833
There are a total of 50 districts.

1079
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,958
-I see.
-This is Chao Phraya River.

1080
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,041
It's right between
Thon Buri and Phra Nakorn.

1081
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,208
5,680,000 people live here.

1082
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,375
What are their names?

1083
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,125
Go ask your dad!
How the fuck would I know?

1084
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,291
Does that mean you know every place?

1085
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,500
Every place I told you.

1086
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,041
Do you know this place, His Fish Hill?

1087
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,625
His Fish Hill, that's downhill.

1088
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,833
There are many fishes there.

1089
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,041
Many.

1090
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,625
The owners of the land really like fish.

1091
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,791
So they said, "It's his fish."

1092
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,916
That's why they call it "His Fish Hill."

1093
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,458
I see.

1094
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,666
What about Hole Keaw Hill?

1095
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,625
This grandma, Keaw, owned the land.

1096
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:42,541
They dug a hole to bury her when she died.

1097
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,166
So that's why they call it that?

1098
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,541
-Hole Keaw Hill.
-Who is this Grandma Keaw, by the way?

1099
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:47,958
Do I look like fucking Wikipedia?

1100
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,875
Why are you so grumpy?

1101
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,541
-The economy is bad.
-Yeah?

1102
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,416
Times are hard. Poor people stay poor,

1103
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,083
and the rich keep getting richer.

1104
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,708
Rich people work hard. That's why.

1105
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,500
They sell drugs, that's why.

1106
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,708
How do you know that?

1107
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,333
I buy everyday.

1108
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:05,416
Are you using?

1109
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,250
I'm not using, I'm a spy for cops.

1110
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,500
A secret weapon.

1111
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,166
Don't mess with me.

1112
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,291
I'm a spy.

1113
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,250
Spy, my ass.

1114
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,750
You want me to help you pretend
that you're the boss?

1115
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:21,916
Yeah. Please help.

1116
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,375
I don't think so.

1117
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,666
No. I don't want any trouble.

1118
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,375
Bro, it's just three days.
He won't be here.

1119
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,000
It's just between me and you, okay?

1120
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,333
I'll give you 500 baht.

1121
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:34,583
How about 1,000?

1122
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:35,958
-1,500?
-Oh, my God.

1123
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,541
-2,000 then.
-You can't buy me.

1124
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,791
How about...
I could add some good porn links to that.

1125
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,708
Son of a bitch. You know my weak spot.

1126
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,500
Damn.

1127
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,291
Can I just stay in the car? It's so hot.

1128
00:48:58,375 --> 00:48:59,583
Can you take my jacket?

1129
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,541
Thanks.

1130
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:04,583
What?

1131
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,583
Chaba.

1132
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,750
Tee.

1133
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,375
Hey, Tee.

1134
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,625
Is this where you live?

1135
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,541
Yes.

1136
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,041
Oh, my.

1137
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,541
Would it be too big to walk around?

1138
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,041
Let's go.

1139
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,750
You keep the AC on all day?

1140
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:23,625
James.

1141
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:24,583
What?

1142
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,791
This... This is my girlfriend.

1143
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,000
And these are her brothers.

1144
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,166
So what?

1145
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,125
Say hello.

1146
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,708
-Do it.
-Really?

1147
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:36,666
Come on.

1148
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,208
Is the chicken cooked?

1149
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,583
Hello.

1150
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:43,500
Hello.

1151
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,250
Looks like a human.

1152
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,208
I like this one.

1153
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,208
Is that a nose or some sort of pipe?

1154
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,500
What the hell are you looking at?

1155
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,750
Let's go.

1156
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,333
Are you coming?

1157
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,125
It's okay.

1158
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,541
I don't like creeps.

1159
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,375
Such a big room.

1160
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,208
It's so fancy, Tee.

1161
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:41,416
Who is this?

1162
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,750
The previous tenant.

1163
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,416
I told him to come get it,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

1164
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,583
People who can't keep their word,
I don't like it at all.

1165
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,458
Right. You can't talk to those people.

1166
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,041
If you see them, just smack them.

1167
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,000
Make yourself at home, my place is yours.

1168
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,416
Can't take that back.

1169
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,041
Let's go.

1170
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,541
It's going to be fun.

1171
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,583
Quick.

1172
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,000
-These are expensive.
-Which one?

1173
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,750
We have to start from wine.

1174
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't know if there is a wine opener.

1175
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:23,833
Of course there is. Just keep looking.

1176
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:24,875
Hey, Nun.

1177
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,625
Let's pick this one.
Someone left it open. It's easy.

1178
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,000
Okay.

1179
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:31,791
Open it.

1180
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,208
Quick.

1181
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:39,250
Can you? I can't open it.

1182
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,250
-What smell is that?
-Let's do this.

1183
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,166
I'll go get the soap.

1184
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,833
Then it'll come off easy.

1185
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,833
Let's get to it, then.

1186
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:55,041
There are so many skyscrapers.

1187
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,375
-It looks really fancy.
-Yeah.

1188
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,708
-Found it?
-No.

1189
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,333
Hey, Seab.

1190
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,375
What's taking so long?

1191
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,416
What is going on?

1192
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,541
I'm trying to open up here.

1193
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,541
Quick. Come on.

1194
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,458
Find it.

1195
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,958
I can't find it.

1196
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,583
Seab, this is taking too long.

1197
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,375
It's okay, let's continue.

1198
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,625
Hey, bro, I don't think he's okay.

1199
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,416
Bro!

1200
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,000
-What?
-He's having a seizure.

1201
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:04,666
Can I ask...

1202
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,041
have you brought someone here?

1203
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,291
Hey. What makes you think that?

1204
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,708
I never bring anyone here.

1205
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,250
Seriously?

1206
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,750
Seriously.

1207
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:16,916
Look, Chaba.

1208
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:20,041
I have only one.

1209
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,125
Don't make that face.

1210
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,291
I'm hungry.

1211
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,125
Let's go eat something.

1212
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,541
The cork!

1213
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:30,708
What cork?

1214
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,750
The wine cork!

1215
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,500
Calm down, pull yourself together.

1216
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,916
Slowly.

1217
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,333
One, two...

1218
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,000
-Stay focused.
-It's still in there.

1219
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:46,791
-This is bad.
-This is bad, bro.

1220
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,583
Hey. Lay down.

1221
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:50,541
Pull.

1222
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,500
Okay.

1223
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,375
-It has to be this way, yeah?
-Keep his head high.

1224
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,458
Like this?

1225
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,250
Hold him.

1226
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,000
-Relax.
-Now, bro.

1227
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,375
-What are you doing?
-I'm watching you.

1228
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,583
Are you hiding something?

1229
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:18,500
No.

1230
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:20,916
But you're acting weird.

1231
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:24,958
How?

1232
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,166
The woman's voice that I heard...

1233
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:31,041
that wasn't coming from the TV, was it?

1234
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:33,125
What?

1235
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,625
That really was the TV.

1236
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,666
I video-called you.

1237
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,291
I don't think so.

1238
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,291
Yes, sir.

1239
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,125
Tee, where are you?

1240
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,125
What's up, sir?

1241
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:50,625
Get my keys and go to my condo.

1242
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,541
My VIP customer is going there
to use the room.

1243
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:55,833
Okay, sir.

1244
00:54:58,708 --> 00:54:59,583
What's up?

1245
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,666
Are you full?

1246
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:06,375
Who's that?

1247
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,333
No need to look.

1248
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:12,875
Open it.

1249
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:16,875
Hey!

1250
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:19,125
Are you here to plant
a bomb or something?

1251
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:22,041
How come you people are in Joe's condo?

1252
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,291
Joe?

1253
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:25,708
Which Joe?

1254
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,583
What? It's Joe.

1255
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,833
The thin guy.

1256
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,291
He's got a mustache.

1257
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,375
He looks like a bad guy.

1258
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:35,541
You must have the wrong room.

1259
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,291
Oh, right.

1260
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,208
We must have the wrong room, honey.

1261
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,583
Let's go.

1262
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,375
Wait up!

1263
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:45,583
Since you're here,
are we the same kind of people?

1264
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:51,041
You wanna come in and drink?

1265
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:52,791
Is that okay?

1266
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:53,916
Hey!

1267
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,625
You sure? It's not our room.

1268
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:01,125
-Singh.
-Asshole.

1269
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,791
Shut your mouth. Look who he's with.

1270
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,666
-Slap his mouth.
-Let's go.

1271
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:08,708
Hey, wait. Asshole.

1272
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,041
That's my girl.

1273
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,083
Hey!

1274
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,375
If that's how you think,
you're not open-minded enough.

1275
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,625
And you can go.

1276
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,583
Hey.

1277
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,958
Ronaldo.

1278
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,083
You really cut me off.

1279
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,041
You're too much.

1280
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,583
Can I go with you?

1281
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,208
No problem.

1282
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,958
If you want to be friends,
you must be open-minded.

1283
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,041
Come on in.

1284
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,458
You can't even walk straight.

1285
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,791
-Where's my girl?
-Here.

1286
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,833
Can't you see?

1287
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:44,041
Still here? Hey!

1288
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:47,541
This is a photo of Joe! This is him.

1289
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,541
Who?

1290
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,708
Don't bother. This is old stuff.

1291
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,291
He moved out and left his photo here.

1292
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,833
Why do you care?

1293
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:02,583
He told me to come use the room.

1294
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,416
Hey! Do you want to drink?

1295
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,000
Don't bother about that Joe. Sit down.

1296
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,500
-Hey, wait. What's this?
-What?

1297
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,208
That's another box.

1298
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,083
This is a cosplay costume.

1299
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,666
Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus.

1300
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,333
I brought it to wear with her.

1301
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,083
Can I see?

1302
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:24,708
Hey, for you, no problem.

1303
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:26,500
Hey!

1304
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:32,750
Santa.

1305
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,625
Hey. Let's play cards for fun.

1306
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,666
Whoever loses drinks a shot.

1307
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,333
We've been drinking a lot already.

1308
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:50,000
Let's just say, playing cards,

1309
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,541
whoever loses point...

1310
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,458
takes off their clothes one at a time.

1311
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,125
Hey, I don't mind.

1312
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,000
But is she going to mind?

1313
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,500
I'm all in. I don't mind.

1314
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:11,041
-All right, let's start.
-Let's go.

1315
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,041
-Open it.
-Ten!

1316
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,500
Queen. It's mine.

1317
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,916
What? I got two!

1318
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,250
Queen of hearts.

1319
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,416
Ten!

1320
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,083
Eight.

1321
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,291
Lower.

1322
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,125
Bottom up.

1323
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,875
One, two, three, four,

1324
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,083
five, six, seven,

1325
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,250
eight, nine,

1326
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,833
ten.

1327
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:57,875
You're great.

1328
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,916
-Hey. Baby.
-Hey, old man.

1329
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,958
-Old man.
-Baby. What?

1330
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,083
What's going on? Is he faking it?

1331
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,458
-He's in shock.
-Shock? What's wrong?

1332
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,041
-Shock?
-I'm out.

1333
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,041
-Hey.
-I'm leaving.

1334
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,583
Wait! How can she ditch us?

1335
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,458
Hey. Sir.

1336
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,291
Hey, I think it's serious.

1337
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,083
I can't even walk.

1338
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,833
Let's take him to the hospital.

1339
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:25,750
You can't die in here.

1340
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:26,791
What about Singh?

1341
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:28,250
Just leave him here.

1342
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:29,916
Quick.

1343
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:34,333
Oh, God. You drink too much.

1344
00:59:36,416 --> 00:59:38,416
-Damn.
-There are many more floors to go.

1345
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
What do we do?

1346
00:59:39,583 --> 00:59:41,916
Let's take the fire exit.
This is taking too long.

1347
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,833
Let's go.

1348
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,083
Bro.

1349
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:54,583
Hey.

1350
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:00,625
Sir.

1351
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,375
Hey! Sir.

1352
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,708
Get him.

1353
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,583
What's going on?

1354
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,000
-Hey!
-Call an ambulance!

1355
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,375
What's up with him?

1356
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,958
Can't you see? He's in shock.

1357
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,625
Call an ambulance!

1358
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:21,916
Is he still alive?

1359
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,125
I'm sorry.

1360
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,083
Let's go back and drink.

1361
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:31,583
Bye.

1362
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,416
Hey.

1363
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,625
What did you guys do?

1364
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,083
-Yes.
-What happened?

1365
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,375
This guy got the wrong room.

1366
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,833
Then he invited us for drinks.

1367
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,916
Then he went into shock.

1368
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:48,333
He's off to the hospital now.
Everything is fine.

1369
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:51,000
Nothing is certain about human life.

1370
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,083
What's up?

1371
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,208
James.

1372
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:00,375
Your friends are getting messy.

1373
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,875
Get them under control.

1374
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,208
Nun, Seab.

1375
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,958
What did you guys do?

1376
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:06,875
Yeah.

1377
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:08,958
What are you gonna do if he dies?

1378
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,125
Funeral?

1379
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:12,625
Easy to say.

1380
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,833
How are you going to be
responsible for his life?

1381
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:17,166
I'll get ordained for him for three days.

1382
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:19,666
-Four, then.
-Not funny.

1383
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,916
When he wakes up, if he does,
would he know who did it?

1384
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:25,250
He won't remember.

1385
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:28,166
He peed in the elevator
last time he was drunk.

1386
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:30,083
And the next day,
I asked him if he'd peed.

1387
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,583
He couldn't remember.

1388
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:32,583
Really?

1389
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,291
You guys almost became murderers!

1390
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,375
Murderers?

1391
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,916
Really?

1392
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,291
Let's go find a new place to drink.

1393
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,375
Seriously?

1394
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,083
Are you still going to drink?

1395
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:47,958
Where are you going?

1396
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,583
This is Bangkok. Where can you go?

1397
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,583
Chaba.

1398
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,833
Don't even dare question me like that.

1399
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,916
I'll find my own way.

1400
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,541
Yeah. Be my guest.

1401
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,583
You...

1402
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,250
You're not my mom.

1403
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:05,541
Tee.

1404
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,208
I'm sorry about Nun and his gang.

1405
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,208
I almost got you in trouble.

1406
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,458
It's okay. I think it's fine.

1407
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,166
How is this fine?

1408
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,166
Look.

1409
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,541
Trust me. It's fine.

1410
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:20,958
Let's go. Let's go up to the room.

1411
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,083
Hey! Follow me.

1412
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:31,250
Let's keep drinking.

1413
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,250
Tee.

1414
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,375
What is this room?

1415
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,125
Probably nothing.

1416
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,958
Why is there a number pad here?

1417
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,625
It's nothing.

1418
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,000
Just...

1419
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,708
another storage room.

1420
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:59,458
Can you open it for me?

1421
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:00,541
I don't remember the code.

1422
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,666
Liar.

1423
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,833
Are you hiding something from me?

1424
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:07,541
No. It's really just a storage room.

1425
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,791
Trust me. Please.

1426
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,333
What is this room and what's inside?

1427
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,708
Tell me.

1428
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,625
Say it.

1429
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,625
I said, tell me.

1430
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,083
Hello, what's up?

1431
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,250
Tee.

1432
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:27,000
Come down here, quickly.

1433
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:28,041
Your friends,

1434
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:30,125
they took a motorbike and left.

1435
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,333
Okay, I'm coming.

1436
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,750
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1437
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:40,708
Hey.

1438
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,458
A date. His birthday.

1439
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:54,916
Wrong password.

1440
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,041
My birthday.

1441
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,750
Wrong password.

1442
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,916
The first day we met.

1443
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,916
Wrong password.

1444
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,583
House registration number.

1445
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:06,791
Wrong password.

1446
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,833
I'll just guess it, then.

1447
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,583
-Where?
-They're gone.

1448
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:19,083
Password accepted.

1449
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,458
What?

1450
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,541
What?

1451
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,375
Whose motorbike did they take?

1452
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,791
How would I know?

1453
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:49,166
I saw them talking just a moment ago.

1454
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,125
They probably went for more booze.

1455
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,458
Shit. What the hell?

1456
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,083
Chaba.

1457
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:13,625
Are you okay?

1458
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,083
You said you have nothing to hide.

1459
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,500
Why did you lie?

1460
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,416
What lie?

1461
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,583
What about this wedding dress?

1462
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,708
I knew it.

1463
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:34,375
You're seeing someone else.

1464
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,333
Okay, I'll confess.

1465
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:43,958
This wedding dress...

1466
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,541
I got it for you.

1467
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,583
What?

1468
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:53,166
-How?
-Well...

1469
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,708
I wanted to surprise you.

1470
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,041
Really?

1471
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,125
Yes.

1472
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,958
I wanted to ask you to marry me.

1473
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:05,916
But...

1474
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,291
I guess it's not a surprise anymore.

1475
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,541
I see.

1476
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,000
It's still a surprise. I'm sorry.

1477
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:15,291
Hey. This dress.

1478
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:16,500
It's so beautiful.

1479
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:19,541
Can I ask...

1480
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,750
when are you going to propose?

1481
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:25,541
Well...

1482
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:27,625
I thought tonight.

1483
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:29,791
But...

1484
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,333
the plan is ruined now.

1485
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:33,416
How is it ruined?

1486
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:38,250
I was going to take you out for a drive,

1487
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:41,000
then ask you to marry me
on New Year's Eve.

1488
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:42,583
But that's not happening now.

1489
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:44,541
It can happen.

1490
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,916
Of course.

1491
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,958
Let's just say,

1492
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,750
I don't know about any of this, nothing.

1493
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:50,791
Let's start again.

1494
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:54,666
Walk in again.

1495
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,625
Tee...

1496
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,208
what kind of dress is this?

1497
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:06,541
Does this work?

1498
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,166
Yes.

1499
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,625
Did you buy this for me?

1500
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:15,208
That's so sweet of you.

1501
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,708
Can we go take a drive?

1502
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:22,583
Maybe you have something to ask me.

1503
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,291
Let's go.

1504
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,458
I want to go for a drive.

1505
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,791
Wait here. I'll get us some beer.

1506
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,875
Not a lot of ice this time.

1507
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:03,250
Hey.

1508
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,375
Is that a person?

1509
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:06,166
-What do you think?
-Boy.

1510
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,125
Please help me.

1511
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,000
Can you buy my lottery tickets?

1512
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,791
I haven't eaten since this morning.

1513
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,458
I'm so thin my pants are getting loose.

1514
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:16,416
Come on, man, pull them up.

1515
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,458
Do it for me. I'm blind.

1516
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,875
Damn.

1517
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,208
I haven't showered for days.

1518
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:25,833
There.

1519
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:27,125
Please buy some.

1520
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,375
Otherwise, I won't get to eat.

1521
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:31,916
You got number 54?

1522
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,125
No. I have 55.

1523
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,416
Then 56.

1524
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:39,250
I have 57.

1525
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,833
-I want 58.
-Son of a bitch.

1526
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,625
Are you messing with me?

1527
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,166
If you don't want to buy them,
just say so!

1528
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,541
Well, I don't.

1529
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,541
I'd rather go get some liquor.

1530
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,000
Go sell it to someone else.

1531
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,583
Hey, I'm bringing you luck.

1532
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:52,166
Who are you talking to?

1533
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,291
I don't know.

1534
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,208
Here.

1535
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:55,833
Beer.

1536
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:57,625
Hey!

1537
01:08:58,375 --> 01:09:00,000
-That sounds familiar.
-You.

1538
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,000
Nun.

1539
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:02,958
You have a good memory. Sharp ears.

1540
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,500
-Is it you, Nun?
-This way.

1541
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:06,791
Hey, it's really you.

1542
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,166
What a small world.
What brings you here? A dog?

1543
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,291
I'm working for the government.

1544
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:13,291
Oh, Nun.

1545
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,333
-Hey!
-You know him?

1546
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,958
This is my master. The legendary AC guy.

1547
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,708
He's a little cuckoo.

1548
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:23,708
Look at how he dresses.

1549
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,166
Son of a bitch.

1550
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,583
Call me crazy and I'll shoot your ass.

1551
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,625
This way.

1552
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,875
Do you have a gun?

1553
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:29,833
Hell yeah. Here.

1554
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,291
Bang. Bang. Bang.

1555
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:34,458
Better put that away.

1556
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:35,375
That's funny.

1557
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,125
Hey, you. Hold on.

1558
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,000
-What are you doing here?
-Government work.

1559
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:41,166
Selling lottery tickets
is government work?

1560
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,208
This is just a part-time job.

1561
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,416
So the government is your main job?

1562
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,833
-Yeah.
-Where do you work?

1563
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:45,750
MBK.

1564
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:48,458
Hey. My friends go there a lot.
They never see you.

1565
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,375
-Which floor did they go to?
-Every floor.

1566
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,458
I'm up on the roof.

1567
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:53,208
-What the hell, the roof?
-Sunbathing.

1568
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:55,125
-How did you get here?
-I drove here.

1569
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:57,916
You're blind. That's nonsense.

1570
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,250
I used GTH.

1571
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,166
-You mean GPS.
-Yeah.

1572
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,541
So, when they say, "Turn left,"
I turn left.

1573
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,666
Don't tell me.

1574
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,666
That yellow car with a siren is yours?

1575
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,916
Company car.

1576
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,166
What about the net in the back?

1577
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,666
That's for fishing.

1578
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,250
Why is there a dog in the car?

1579
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,333
-That's a police dog.
-What about the stray one?

1580
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:15,541
That's the undercover one.

1581
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:17,416
When he's sick, I have to go instead.

1582
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,583
Wait, your lottery tickets,
are they selling well?

1583
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,166
-I haven't even sold one today.
-What?

1584
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,333
Not even one. They're all here.

1585
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,125
Where do you get your money then?

1586
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,958
Around here, I'm also a fortune-teller.

1587
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,666
Are you crazy?

1588
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,666
You're blind and a fortune-teller?

1589
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,750
Yeah, I just feel it.

1590
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:33,208
Feel what? How?

1591
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,500
Like this.

1592
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:35,625
My eyes! My eyes!

1593
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:36,625
Wait.

1594
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,000
I'll go blind, too.

1595
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,333
Oh, my God.

1596
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:42,666
Did you burn a monk's robe?

1597
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,750
That's nonsense.

1598
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:45,666
You got a wine cork in your throat.

1599
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:46,750
Damn!

1600
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,041
He's just guessing.

1601
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:50,291
-And very recently...
-Why?

1602
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,791
...you got kicked in the face by your ex.

1603
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:53,208
Hey, you...

1604
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,791
how did you know that?

1605
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,791
And soon, you'll get shot.

1606
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,458
-Me?
-Yeah.

1607
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:00,458
Your face is shit and your mouth is shit.

1608
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,791
So stubborn.

1609
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,208
I won't believe you.

1610
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:05,958
-Let's go
-Take me, too.

1611
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,541
-Hey.
-I can't drive like this.

1612
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:08,625
Right.

1613
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:11,916
Nun.

1614
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,250
Don't you believe me?

1615
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,000
You'll get shot. Very soon.

1616
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,166
This is your car?

1617
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:29,583
Yes. For my position.

1618
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,708
But I don't really use it. Too much gas.

1619
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,291
Okay.

1620
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:34,791
And...

1621
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,500
where are you going to take me?

1622
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:45,125
Where should we go?

1623
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,083
Hello.

1624
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,125
Hello.

1625
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,541
Hello, everyone.

1626
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:04,208
Master Village's friends.

1627
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:09,250
I should have
come to Bangkok long ago.

1628
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:10,666
This is heaven.

1629
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,750
We go big every year.

1630
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:21,541
We hope that, for tonight,
everyone is happy.

1631
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,875
It's gonna be a fun night.

1632
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,250
Hey, the same taste.

1633
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:31,666
I won't waste any more time.

1634
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:36,041
Please welcome Deputy Not
to say a few words.

1635
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,250
Say something? Does that mean two words?

1636
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:49,541
Thank you.

1637
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,583
Is that really a cop?

1638
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,875
Yes, sir.

1639
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:56,666
At first glance, you look like a fugitive.

1640
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,583
Your body looks it.

1641
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,166
Hello, everyone.

1642
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,458
I am Deputy Not.

1643
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,958
My full position is...

1644
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:13,041
Deputy Commander of Narcotics Control.

1645
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,791
I'm appointed to this area.

1646
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,583
This New Year,

1647
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:22,291
I promise to hurry and get rid of drugs

1648
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,666
from this area.

1649
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,375
I guarantee you,

1650
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:30,083
this city will be drug-free.

1651
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,166
Drug free.

1652
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:34,583
I'm sorry.

1653
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,583
When you say "drug free,"
does that mean...

1654
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,333
that you're keeping the drugs
for yourself?

1655
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,500
I must inform you...

1656
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:48,791
we are officers.

1657
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:51,708
We don't do drugs.

1658
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,625
Let me ask you something.

1659
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,208
What do you want to be called?

1660
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,500
Whatever you'd like.

1661
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:57,541
Hey, Not!

1662
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:01,666
Criminals are everywhere in the city now.

1663
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:05,291
How do the police plan to take care of it?

1664
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,791
I want to tell our people here,

1665
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:13,458
we need some more time

1666
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:16,333
because our police are understaffed.

1667
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:20,375
Hey, what about those police
who break their own rules?

1668
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:22,208
What are you going to do?

1669
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,166
We need more time on that as well.

1670
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,583
Since we have too many officers,

1671
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,958
we cannot take care of everything.

1672
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,916
Too many or too few.

1673
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,708
What is it then?

1674
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:38,000
Well...

1675
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,625
-Then...
-Hey, be clear on this, Not!

1676
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:43,208
-Sir.
-Yes.

1677
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:45,041
I think...

1678
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,166
if you're drunk,

1679
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,833
you should take care of yourself.

1680
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:52,416
Come on. Be clear on this, Not!

1681
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,291
-Sir.
-Yes.

1682
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,875
Please respect the uniform and my rank.

1683
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,000
Seriously?

1684
01:14:58,083 --> 01:15:00,791
Have you ever used a gun?

1685
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:03,291
Why don't you answer?

1686
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:06,166
Or are you keeping it for Songkran?

1687
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,291
Hey.

1688
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,000
Oh, Father.

1689
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,625
-That's the police.
-He looks like a monk.

1690
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:15,791
Sir.

1691
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,250
Sit down.

1692
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:19,541
Look at your gut.

1693
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,000
We don't mind the crazies,

1694
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,875
and we don't blame the drunks.

1695
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:28,958
I will excuse myself now.

1696
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,500
I want to dance.

1697
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:31,875
Please enjoy yourself.

1698
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:33,583
Okay.

1699
01:15:33,666 --> 01:15:36,583
Let's give Deputy Not a hand.

1700
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:41,458
To not waste any more time,
our singer is here.

1701
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:43,458
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

1702
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:45,708
If you are, please welcome

1703
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,500
Lumyai Hai Thongkam!

1704
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:55,041
Lumyai! Lumyai! Lumyai!

1705
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:57,916
Hello.

1706
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,625
I'm Lumyai Hai Thongkam.

1707
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,291
Let's listen to my new single,

1708
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:02,708
"Girl Who Wants to Have Fun."

1709
01:16:10,291 --> 01:16:12,416
-Lumyai!
-I like her so much!

1710
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,000
Let's hear it!

1711
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:26,291
I'm the girl who wants to have fun

1712
01:16:26,375 --> 01:16:28,458
I'm not the girl who likes school

1713
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,291
I don't work really hard

1714
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:33,166
Always borrow a pen from my pals

1715
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,250
I never do my homework

1716
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,541
I don't know how exams work

1717
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:41,166
I only know today and tomorrow

1718
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,291
I'm waiting here to see

1719
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,666
If you can

1720
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,083
Break up with her

1721
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:51,125
Would it be possible for us?

1722
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:53,791
I'm not here to pressure you

1723
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,250
I'm just here waiting

1724
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,208
Can you please hurry and break up?

1725
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:00,500
A girl who wants to have fun

1726
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:02,958
She want to be yours

1727
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,625
Lumyai.

1728
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,625
Wait.

1729
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:12,208
Why did you stop?

1730
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,875
Sir, I'm sorry.

1731
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:15,583
Could you please dance down there?

1732
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,500
You're in my dancers' space.

1733
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,833
They need space to dance.

1734
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,375
You look so cute in real life.

1735
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:21,791
Finally, I get to see you.

1736
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,791
Thank you. You better dance down there.

1737
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:25,750
I come from the suburbs.
I come from the suburbs.

1738
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:26,958
Lumyai is so pretty in real life.

1739
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,625
Thank you. Please dance down there.

1740
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:31,208
My dancers need this space.

1741
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:32,708
-Please.
-Damn. What?

1742
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,583
They hired you here to entertain.

1743
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,708
So just do it. Give it your all.

1744
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,375
You're very drunk and talking nonsense.

1745
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,708
I can't dance now and I also can't sing.

1746
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,875
Am I choking you now or something?

1747
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:46,708
You've gone too far.

1748
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:48,833
I'm disappointed.
You're so arrogant in real life.

1749
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm not arrogant.

1750
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,541
I really can't perform
with you bothering me. I can't do it.

1751
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:56,125
-Shit. Take a video of this.
-Hey.

1752
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:57,041
What?

1753
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,708
If you don't stop now, I won't hold back.

1754
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:00,250
Hold what back? What are you going to do?

1755
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,833
Why?

1756
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:04,750
Did you just slap me?

1757
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:06,791
You're so arrogant in real life.

1758
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:07,791
What do you want with me?

1759
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,666
-What?
-What? You want to get some?

1760
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,208
-Yeah?
-Such an arrogant bitch.

1761
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,583
-Yeah?
-Hey.

1762
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:15,000
-Damn it.
-Seab!

1763
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:16,000
I don't like her anymore.

1764
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,500
Stop! I told you to stop.

1765
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,916
I'll take care of this. No problem.

1766
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,500
Miss Lumyai, I'm so sorry.

1767
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:23,875
He's drunk.

1768
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,250
Mister, please take care of this.

1769
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,875
This is too much.
I can't perform like this.

1770
01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:29,250
-I'm sorry.
-Let go.

1771
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:30,458
Let go now.

1772
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31,791
Seab.

1773
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,750
Follow me. Go down.

1774
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,250
Right now. You.

1775
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,500
Always causing trouble.

1776
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,208
Sit.

1777
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:40,666
Hey.

1778
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,791
Seab.

1779
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,166
I told you to be quiet.

1780
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,500
Okay. Quiet.

1781
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,458
Miss Lumyai.

1782
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:48,791
Please go on. Please continue.

1783
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:51,083
He's drunk. I'm sorry.

1784
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,666
I'm waiting to see

1785
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,083
If you do

1786
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,750
Break up with her

1787
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,625
The stage is theirs.

1788
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,375
They paid her to dance.

1789
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:01,666
Why did you go up there?

1790
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,666
I was just having fun.

1791
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,750
Seab!

1792
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,000
-What?
-I told you to stop!

1793
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,000
-Are you listening?
-Hey!

1794
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,375
Son of a bitch.

1795
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:14,291
That one is not so loud. You, however...

1796
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,208
What?

1797
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:17,833
You are being so loud. I can't focus.

1798
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:19,291
Me? Being loud?

1799
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,583
Well, I'm sorry, then.

1800
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:25,541
Once again. I'll lower my voice.

1801
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:27,208
Continue.

1802
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:29,375
I'm waiting to see

1803
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:30,791
If you do

1804
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:33,416
Break up with her

1805
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,458
Would it be possible for us?

1806
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,833
I'm not here to pressure you

1807
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:42,708
I'm just waiting

1808
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,375
Can you please hurry?

1809
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:46,458
A girl who wants to have fun

1810
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:48,041
She's waiting for you

1811
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:49,375
Hey!

1812
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,541
If you break up with her

1813
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,583
I told you to dance down there,
understand?

1814
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,666
What are you doing here? They can't dance!

1815
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,458
What are you looking at? Go down!

1816
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,083
-Can't understand a word.
-Are you crazy?

1817
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:01,208
-No idea.
-Go dance down there.

1818
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:03,375
-Stop.
-Why can't I dance here?

1819
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,375
Hey, you.

1820
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,125
Stop it.

1821
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,875
-I'm sorry.
-I can't stand it anymore. Please help.

1822
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:09,958
This is so bad.

1823
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:11,916
-Hey, you. Hey!
-So arrogant.

1824
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,083
Are you picking on a citizen?

1825
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:16,250
Hey! I think you need help now.

1826
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,333
Hey, Seab.

1827
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,333
I don't care. I'm going to stay.

1828
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,541
You have a problem.

1829
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,625
Well, she started it!

1830
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:23,583
Lumyai.

1831
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:25,708
I'm sorry again. Okay?

1832
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,541
I can't stand it anymore.

1833
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:29,291
I told him to go down.

1834
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,750
If you want to dance, go down.
This is my space.

1835
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,583
I want to perform a concert.

1836
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:36,000
Where are my dancers going to dance?

1837
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:37,833
There's so much space.
What's wrong with him?

1838
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,791
Why the hell does he want to dance here?

1839
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,166
This is not his space.

1840
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,750
I told him many times to dance down there.

1841
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,250
He keeps being funny and loud.

1842
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,708
Who on earth can sing with that?

1843
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:47,250
I don't want to sing anymore.
Are you crazy?

1844
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,500
Calm down. Let's talk it out.

1845
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,625
-Seab! Hey!
-I don't care. I don't care.

1846
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:52,666
-Why?
-I'm begging you.

1847
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,958
What do you mean you don't care?

1848
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:55,000
I'm just having fun.

1849
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,500
-Stop.
-No one is having fun.

1850
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,583
I'm just dancing.

1851
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,625
-Hey.
-You stay out of this.

1852
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:00,583
Hey!

1853
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,416
Is he dead?

1854
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,083
Not yet. So lucky.

1855
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,166
He just jumped suddenly.

1856
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,291
Let go!

1857
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:11,708
Let's get him!

1858
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,000
Get him out of here!

1859
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,625
Get out!

1860
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,750
What? What's this?

1861
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:18,791
Hey.

1862
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,125
This place looks so pretty.

1863
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:29,666
Do you like it?

1864
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:32,958
Well, I like it everywhere...

1865
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:34,916
when you're with me.

1866
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:39,458
Well, then,

1867
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,958
come home and be with me.

1868
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:43,458
You already have this much here.

1869
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:47,083
If you come home,
we can build a really big house.

1870
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:51,000
And what if...

1871
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,333
What if I'm not rich?

1872
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,125
Come on.

1873
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,041
Are you testing me?

1874
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,000
Just asking.

1875
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,166
I promise you.

1876
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,041
I'll have everything one day.

1877
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,250
A house and a car.

1878
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,125
But you have it all now.

1879
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,041
Both a house and a car.

1880
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:14,000
Hey.

1881
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:16,708
Is it that time?

1882
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:18,083
Are you going to propose?

1883
01:22:19,166 --> 01:22:20,416
Five...

1884
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:21,833
Four...

1885
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:23,416
Three...

1886
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:24,625
Two...

1887
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,000
One.

1888
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,916
Hey, look at that one. So pretty.

1889
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,791
That one, too.

1890
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,041
But this one is prettiest.

1891
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:42,791
Stop it.

1892
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,083
Are you ready?

1893
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,291
I'm waiting.

1894
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,375
There.

1895
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:01,958
Are you going to propose?

1896
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:04,000
Don't be shy. I'm waiting.

1897
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:14,125
Hello. What's up?

1898
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,083
Tee.

1899
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:16,958
Something's up.

1900
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:19,125
Have you heard?

1901
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,333
Jenny overdosed on pills.

1902
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,625
Really?

1903
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,041
And there's more.

1904
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:27,041
She poured acid over herself.

1905
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,791
This is so scary.

1906
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,291
She probably wanted to commit suicide

1907
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,541
because Joe didn't see her
on New Year's Eve.

1908
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:36,291
He went to see his wife instead.

1909
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:37,625
You mean today?

1910
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:38,708
Yeah.

1911
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:40,458
She left him a letter.

1912
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:44,083
She said, alive or dead,

1913
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:46,125
she'll be waiting for Joe at his condo.

1914
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:48,875
And she said to burn
the wedding dress with her

1915
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,416
at her funeral.

1916
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:54,083
That's it, then. I have to work.

1917
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,416
You be careful.

1918
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,416
Okay.

1919
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,333
Is something wrong?

1920
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,708
Hey. What's up?

1921
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:04,916
We haven't finished.

1922
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:21,375
Hey!

1923
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,791
Someone is sleeping over here.

1924
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:27,500
Come on.

1925
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,083
Chaba.

1926
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,750
Is that you?

1927
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,000
Where are you?

1928
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,166
Where'd she go?

1929
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,125
What?

1930
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:03,958
What's this?

1931
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,916
A hat.

1932
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,333
I see.

1933
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:11,375
A bridal hat.

1934
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,125
Let's try it on.

1935
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,000
Looks pretty.

1936
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:26,333
Hey!

1937
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,750
Chaba! Don't do that!

1938
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:30,916
I'm scared!

1939
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,416
Everyone is looking.

1940
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,291
It's because you're dressed this way.

1941
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,041
All my life...

1942
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,625
I've never seen Lumyai.

1943
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:42,916
This was the first time.

1944
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:22,458
Hey!

1945
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:24,625
Where did it go?

1946
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,750
Hey, mannequin!

1947
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,375
Oh, my!

1948
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:28,500
Oh, my!

1949
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,625
Hey! What's this?

1950
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:34,625
Hey!

1951
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:36,708
What's up with you, Singh?

1952
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,416
-Wait.
-Let me go.

1953
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,583
-Wait.
-I'm going home.

1954
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:41,208
-What's with you?
-Singh!

1955
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,375
A ghost!

1956
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:43,583
-What?
-I saw a ghost!

1957
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:44,583
A ghost, my ass.

1958
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,708
Keep him still.

1959
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:47,666
-Keep him.
-It's the ghost!

1960
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,500
Get him. Don't let him go anywhere.

1961
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:51,291
I'll be right back. I'll take care of it.

1962
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,375
You stay here, Singh.

1963
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,458
Seab.

1964
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,875
You come with me.

1965
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:56,666
-Okay.
-What ghost is he talking about?

1966
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,958
I want to know, too.

1967
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,208
Nonsense.

1968
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:00,333
Seab, come.

1969
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:02,833
What the hell are you talking about?

1970
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:03,833
Oh, come on.

1971
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,333
Seab! Why did you close the door?

1972
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:11,500
You want to scare me?

1973
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,625
Singh, did you close the door?

1974
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:15,833
Singh!

1975
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:17,750
Oh, my.

1976
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:21,416
Why do you stop?

1977
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:25,458
I... I don't want to stop.

1978
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:27,250
But I can't go on.

1979
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,041
You must see for yourself.

1980
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,625
Is it the ghost?

1981
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,708
Yes.

1982
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:39,041
Fuck.

1983
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,208
Why couldn't you say no?

1984
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:42,708
Shit.

1985
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:45,125
Left or right?

1986
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:47,083
On the right.

1987
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:49,375
Oh, shit!

1988
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,833
Just hurry up. Do something.

1989
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,916
Help me. Pray!

1990
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,541
Shit! She can pray.

1991
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:07,083
Where is your amulet?

1992
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,875
-You have it. Quick.
-Here.

1993
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:13,708
Go get it. Get it!

1994
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,041
Shit, open the door.

1995
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,166
Damn it! It's locked.

1996
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,416
Hey.

1997
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,791
She's not even afraid of it.

1998
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:25,333
It's open.

1999
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,875
Singh! It's real. The ghost!

2000
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,125
She committed suicide, sir.

2001
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,625
We should go back to the condo

2002
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:38,416
and get our stuff
before the police arrive.

2003
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,125
You need to pack and leave.

2004
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,625
I'm flying back soon.

2005
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,041
Fuck!

2006
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:46,875
On both sides.

2007
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,916
Gotta go straight.

2008
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,083
Quick!

2009
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:06,125
What is this?

2010
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,666
Hey, let's go.

2011
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:32,041
Hey. Who else?
Why are there so many?

2012
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:37,541
Follow them!

2013
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,958
So many ghosts!

2014
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,166
Why are there so many?

2015
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,416
Are they here?

2016
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:54,416
Let's hurry.

2017
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:56,500
It's here.

2018
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,000
Run!

2019
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:03,916
Hey!

2020
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:09,958
What the fuck?

2021
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:17,833
It's so cold.

2022
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,166
Son of a bitch. This is cocaine.

2023
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,208
Are you all scared?

2024
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,375
Hey!

2025
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:39,375
Who are you?

2026
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:41,791
There it is. You.

2027
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,041
Is this a toy gun from the fair?

2028
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:45,541
Why is the fair so quiet?

2029
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:49,458
The fair must be loud with fun music.

2030
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:05,458
This is not funny.

2031
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:13,458
I remember you.

2032
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:15,375
You're the one in the photo. In that room.

2033
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,000
Hell yeah!

2034
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:18,375
You come to pick up the photo?

2035
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:19,458
Hey. We should get it for him.

2036
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:20,416
Quiet!

2037
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,833
I will ask you one more time.

2038
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:26,666
What were you doing in my room?

2039
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,500
Well... it's not your room.

2040
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,375
It's Tee's room.

2041
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:33,666
He's the boyfriend.

2042
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,583
He's my sister's boyfriend.

2043
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:39,250
Are you a snitch for the cops?

2044
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:43,625
What snitch?
I don't know anything about that.

2045
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:44,541
Answer me!

2046
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:48,250
Well...

2047
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:49,416
Well, I...

2048
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,041
I... I don't know, sir.

2049
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,666
How could I answer if I don't know?

2050
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,791
-Hey.
-Nun!

2051
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:02,416
Hey, Nun!

2052
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,583
Nun!

2053
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:04,583
Nun!

2054
01:32:05,416 --> 01:32:06,333
Tee!

2055
01:32:06,416 --> 01:32:07,791
Are you working for the cops?

2056
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,375
No.

2057
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:11,291
I don't know.

2058
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,125
What is all this?

2059
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:15,833
Don't!

2060
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,708
They're not making any sense.

2061
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:20,000
What should we do?

2062
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:21,958
What should we do?

2063
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:23,250
Take care of them.

2064
01:32:41,125 --> 01:32:42,166
Follow them.

2065
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,583
What's up?

2066
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,166
Look at you all weary.

2067
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:29,333
You're safe now.
Nothing to worry about.

2068
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:31,083
Thank you.

2069
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:35,375
Bro.

2070
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,458
How are you?

2071
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:42,458
There was a haunting incident
at Master Village Condo.

2072
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:44,458
It's suspected to be
the spirit of grieving mistress

2073
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:46,125
of the infamous owner of a car dealership.

2074
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:49,166
The police have investigated
and discovered...

2075
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,708
Look at this news. At the condo.

2076
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:52,375
...there was a hidden drug supply.

2077
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:01,041
When did you become a liar?

2078
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:04,416
Nun almost got shot to death!

2079
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,708
What's that?

2080
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:09,666
What's that, Tee?

2081
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,750
-Chaba.
-What's that?

2082
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:11,708
Chaba.

2083
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,541
I'm very tired, you know.

2084
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:19,708
You think working in Bangkok is easy?

2085
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:23,583
I know you dream
about paying off your debt.

2086
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:25,125
I know you dream about getting married.

2087
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:27,375
And I really want to do that for you.

2088
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:29,166
But it's so damn hard.

2089
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:33,250
Have you ever noticed
what I've done for you?

2090
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:38,583
What you've done for me, Tee...

2091
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,958
I never asked you to do it.

2092
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,583
You said everything yourself.
Promised everything yourself.

2093
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:51,583
I'm so...

2094
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:54,916
I'm so disappointed in you.

2095
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:39,750
Chaba.

2096
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:40,875
Nun.

2097
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:43,708
I've decided...

2098
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:45,333
that I...

2099
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:47,041
I will be like you guys.

2100
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,291
What does that mean?

2101
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:50,208
You know...

2102
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:54,666
no sad feelings, only fun feelings.

2103
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,833
From now on,

2104
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:58,416
I don't want to do anything else.

2105
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,041
I want to become like you guys.

2106
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,541
It's so good.

2107
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:03,166
No stress...

2108
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,625
plus free food.

2109
01:36:06,083 --> 01:36:07,166
Isn't that nice?

2110
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,166
-I don't want you to become--
-Look.

2111
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:10,791
No. No.

2112
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:12,625
Don't try to stop me.

2113
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:14,083
Why?

2114
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:15,791
What's wrong with
becoming one of you guys?

2115
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:18,666
Look. I'll stop being sad.

2116
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,375
Singh, Seab.

2117
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,458
Every party you go to...

2118
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,791
you have to take me with you.

2119
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:30,833
Because... I am so ready
to give away happiness.

2120
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:34,333
Stop it, Chaba!

2121
01:36:34,875 --> 01:36:35,708
Hey.

2122
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,083
-Stop!
-I want to drink!

2123
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,833
I'm telling you to stop!

2124
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,500
I can have a shit life,

2125
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:44,208
but my sister can't.

2126
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:48,833
That's funny.

2127
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:52,625
When I asked you to stop drinking...

2128
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,416
no matter how hard I've tried...

2129
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,291
you still wouldn't quit.

2130
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:00,958
So now...

2131
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,583
why bother stopping me?

2132
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,000
I'm sorry, Chaba.

2133
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:16,708
You can ask me to do anything now.

2134
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:21,125
You cannot get drunk like this.

2135
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:26,291
If you want me
to quit drinking for life...

2136
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:27,916
I can do that for you.

2137
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,416
I love you, Chaba.

2138
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:46,000
Brother.

2139
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:53,916
From now on...

2140
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,750
I won't drink anymore.

2141
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,916
Both of you, too.

2142
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:11,416
Top it up.

2143
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,291
I have a date.

2144
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:14,916
You? Really?

2145
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,083
-I feel for your date.
-Why are you smiling?

2146
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,291
Ten.

2147
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:26,750
Can I have Tee's number?

2148
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:36,000
Hello?

2149
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:37,041
Tee?

2150
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:54,208
Chaba!

2151
01:38:55,166 --> 01:38:56,416
Something's up with Ten.

2152
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,875
Come on!

2153
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:03,125
Where?

2154
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:05,166
How could you do that to me?

2155
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:07,083
How could you lie to me?

2156
01:39:07,166 --> 01:39:08,791
You're so selfish.

2157
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,666
-Ten
-You've never thought about me at all.

2158
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,250
Ten, what's going on?

2159
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,291
Why are you smiling?

2160
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:23,500
Talk it out, okay?

2161
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,208
Chaba.

2162
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:30,458
I'm sorry.

2163
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,333
I just wanted to tell you...

2164
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:34,166
that I didn't succeed,

2165
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,125
and that I lied.

2166
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:37,791
Today...

2167
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,041
I'm here to tell you the truth.

2168
01:39:41,416 --> 01:39:44,083
I might have lied that I succeeded,

2169
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:47,250
but... I didn't lie

2170
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:49,125
about wanting to have a family with you.

2171
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,291
I might have failed...

2172
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:53,625
at making money in Bangkok...

2173
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:55,500
but I'll continue to fight.

2174
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:56,875
I won't give up.

2175
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:00,916
Just...

2176
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,916
can you still stay by my side?

2177
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:09,000
That's it.

2178
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:11,333
That's all I want.

2179
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:13,416
Does this mean...

2180
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:15,541
you've accepted my apology?

2181
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,916
What has already happened...

2182
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,000
just let it pass.

2183
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:21,500
Okay.

2184
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:23,125
Yeah.

2185
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:25,750
We must stay in the present, right?

2186
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,291
We must have...

2187
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:29,666
some scars and wounds.

2188
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,250
Tee.

2189
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,416
What?

2190
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:38,791
I have something to tell you.

2191
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,416
Yes?

2192
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:41,833
So...

2193
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:43,041
when you were away...

2194
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,625
I slept with someone else.

2195
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:45,625
What?

2196
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:47,916
Are you serious?

2197
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,166
But...

2198
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,625
that's the past, right?

2199
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,750
We should be in the present.

2200
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:56,500
We must have some scars...

2201
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:57,916
and some wounds.

2202
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,208
Chaba.

2203
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:02,625
I'm kidding.

2204
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:10,833
-Look. Wait.
-What?

2205
01:41:10,916 --> 01:41:12,500
So whose plan was this?

2206
01:41:19,166 --> 01:41:20,208
You saw me?

2207
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:21,625
Nun.

2208
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:25,791
Here.

2209
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,250
Chaba.

2210
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,708
Did you sleep with someone else?

2211
01:41:31,791 --> 01:41:33,083
Tee's the only one.

2212
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,666
I can't believe
the three of us quit drinking...

2213
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:57,750
just because we don't want
someone we love to drink.

2214
01:41:57,833 --> 01:41:58,708
Yeah.

2215
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:06,625
Singh.

2216
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:17,833
Ning Nong!

2217
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,083
-Ning Nong.
-Nun.

2218
01:42:20,166 --> 01:42:22,333
I'm sorry.

2219
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,166
Ning Nong, you slut.

2220
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:30,333
How dare you come here and apologize?

2221
01:42:30,416 --> 01:42:32,791
Do you really think
he'll forgive you, bitch?

2222
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,708
Yeah.

2223
01:42:34,791 --> 01:42:36,875
You dumped him for someone else.

2224
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,458
You don't deserve him.

2225
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:40,625
He doesn't want you, bitch!

2226
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:44,041
Ning Nong.

2227
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,583
Listen to me.

2228
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:49,916
I...

2229
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,041
I can't be mad at you.

2230
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:52,791
Son of a bitch.

2231
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,958
And I was on his side.

2232
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:56,416
Now look at me.

2233
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,291
I want you...

2234
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,458
Ning Nong, let's go talk upstairs.

2235
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,166
I want to let go of something, too.

2236
01:43:06,708 --> 01:43:07,958
Let's go.

2237
01:43:08,041 --> 01:43:09,416
Come on up.

2238
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,416
Come explain.

2239
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:13,458
Look at them go. They're running.

2240
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:14,416
Let's go.

2241
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,791
Get in the room.

2242
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:17,416
They're so hurried.

2243
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,500
He's really horny.

2244
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:20,916
Hey, it's falling off now.

2245
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:29,458
Damn it, Nun!
