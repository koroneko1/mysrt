1
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,119
When you've been through cancer,
you associate fucking everything with it.

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,520
At first, you deny it,
but then you can't stop bringing it up

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,759
all the time,

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,799
always kinda shoehorning it in there.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,399
But when it comes to those four,
cancer's a pretty decent analogy.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,079
What four are you referring to?

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,439
Um, Benjamín and company.

8
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,280
Benjamín, Patrick, Mencía.

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
And Ari.

10
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,920
What happened when they got here?

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,120
They destroyed what they touched,
like a metastatic growth.

12
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,000
Uh, yeah. It's me.
Do you still want us to be besties again?

13
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,120
'Cause, well, look, I woke up obsessed,
so you win, partner.

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,959
With Mencía?
Yeah, you guys were all over each other.

15
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,560
We had the best time ever.
She's just so fuckin' incredible, man.

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,199
And now I'm doin' that thing I do,

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
where I start projecting, pining,
and getting completely addicted.

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,199
I'm tellin' ya, it's bad.
I can barely sleep.

19
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,319
But whenever I do sleep, I dream of her.

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
And she hasn't texted since the party.
I've been stalking her Instagram.

21
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,360
She's still posting, so she's not dead.
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,759
What in the fuck is this bullshit?

23
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,919
Hey, Rebeka.

24
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,719
Yeah, it's nuts.
They're all over the school.

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,199
So, like one of her posts
or text her yourself.

26
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,479
Advice from a crazy dude.

27
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,199
Good morning, students.

28
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,919
I'm greeting you virtually
this fine morning

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,840
to bring you some exciting news.

30
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,120
An idea proposed
by one of your classmates.

31
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,639
Hello, everyone.

32
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,159
To thank you for the warm welcome
you've given me at the school,

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,680
I wanted to offer
a, uh, a kind gesture to you.

34
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,919
Well, I suppose that,
uh, the majority of you

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
know about Paris's le Bal, no?

36
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,919
Well, I want to organize it,
and I'm throwing it here with all of you.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,599
It's something
that I'm really looking forward to,

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
and I know
I certainly wouldn't want to miss it.

39
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,400
I hope you won't either.

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, but, come on, Samuel.
How can I tell her what I feel for her

41
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,719
when what I feel
is that I am fucking crazy, ya know?

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,479
I don't wanna overwhelm her,
and this is overwhelming shit, man.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,639
Uh, well, listen to it.

44
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,840
-I'm not gonna repeat it.
-To what? You didn't send anything.

45
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,960
What do you mean, I didn't send anything?

46
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,280
-No, no, no!
-Wait, did you just send--?

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,240
-What did you say about her?
-All good things.

48
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,719
-But, like, too good.
-So what's the problem here?

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,680
She's online.
She'll see it. She's online, dude.

50
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,599
Uh…

51
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,519
Single. Seriously?

52
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,759
Well, that was fast.

53
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,120
I guess I thought
maybe we would work it out.

54
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,040
Didn't you break it off with her?

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,759
Yeah, but she agreed to it.

56
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,959
Nadia knows what she wants.

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,079
Do you?

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,920
I mean, what got into you after the party
that made you break up with her?

59
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,000
Distance. It's a major bitch, you know.

60
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,439
Would "distance"
happen to be a cute swimmer?

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,800
What is your problem, dude?

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,199
You saw us hooking up,
it annoyed you, and you broke up with her.

63
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,480
Okay. Your crazy's showing.
I need you to tone it down.

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,079
It really annoys you that much
Ari wasn't my fucking Pluto?

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,519
-Like, really?
-That's why you did it? To piss me off?

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,160
The world doesn't revolve around you.
We felt like it.

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
-Yeah, sure.
-It's not like you're a couple.

68
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,519
If you hadn't gotten in the way,
who's to say?

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
-See? It was about Ari.
-Let's get one thing straight.

70
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,040
If you keep this up,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

71
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,439
I need you to take a breather.

72
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,040
Whether you have something with her
is between you and her.

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
Leave me out of it.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
Okay,
so, le Bal is a charity ball,

75
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
organized as a way to present
debutantes from the best families

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
to society, okay?

77
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Ah, right, it wouldn't be complete
without its fancy chandeliers,

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,240
its guillotine, and,
oh, the Black Death's so hot right now.

79
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,319
Cayetana, that's some retrograde,
sexist-ass bullshit.

80
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,839
Actually, it's not sexist,
'cause, for le Bal, we girls

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,560
are the ones who are gonna be choosing
our cavaliers, or dates.

82
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,839
-Hmm.
-In other words, you mean us girls, right?

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Ah. Ari, how should I explain this?
You're invisible to me.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,680
-Worse, you're beige. Ciao.
-Buh-bye.

85
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,199
What was that look you just gave me?

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
About the classist way
you just came for Cayetana.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
Look,
I was just trying to be objective, Samuel.

88
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,240
She's the cleaning lady.

89
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,720
And I'm the waiter on scholarship.
That's why you won't invite me, isn't it?

90
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,480
I mean, I can't go anyway.
They hired the Lake Club to do catering.

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,439
Well, I'm sorry you can't come as a guest.

92
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,839
It's not really my thing.

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,519
Festivals of fakes and poseurs.

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,839
When are we meeting up again?

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,279
-I can meet today.
-No, not today.

96
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,399
Why? You can't meet up after work?

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah, but I'd rather chill on the sofa.

98
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,759
Really?

99
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,319
Ander, I'm the one who's working.
I'm kinda tired, okay?

100
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:04,040
NADIA, I'D LIKE TO CHAT TONIGHT.
CAN YOU?

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,360
-Can I talk with you just a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

102
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,040
Okay, so, basically,

103
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,800
I'd love to have a cavalier
walk arm in arm with me at le Bal,

104
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,399
and I heard you're available.

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,399
How would you know?

106
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
Facebook.
It told me and the entire school.

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,639
-Right.
-Wanna go with me?

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Well, I'd love to go to the ball,
but I'm not that into sloppy seconds.

109
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,480
Sorry, what?

110
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,319
You asked Samuel to go,
and he said no, right?

111
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,959
Uh, no.

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,519
He didn't say no,
because I never asked him to be my date.

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,519
I'm surprised. It seemed like you had
a good time at the towel party.

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,199
-Who told you that?
-Facebook, do ya think?

115
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,680
Nothing happened at the towel party.

116
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,759
And, anyway,
I'm not asking him, 'cause he's…

117
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,879
'Cause he's a waiter. Just say it.
He's a waiter.

118
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,319
Because he's not my type.

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,759
Right. Let's say if Samuel

120
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,639
was a count instead of just a waiter,
would you be interested?

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,079
Okay. If you were a redhead
and half as tall,

122
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,519
maybe you wouldn't be you,
and I wouldn't ask you either.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,839
-Yeah.
-Are you hearing yourself?

124
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,480
Yeah, I hear it.
And I don't feel like going anymore.

125
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
Can you please get outta my car?

126
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:58,480
SURE, CALL ME

127
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,799
Balenciaga was born in 1895 in Getaria.

128
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,480
Jávea, um…

129
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,399
You scared me!

130
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you the Miss Grajera Pando?

131
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
-That would be me.
-How are you?

132
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm fine. And you?

133
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,799
Good. I came by to ask you something.
What are your plans for this Friday night?

134
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,000
Um…

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Nothing. Just studying.

136
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,679
I may not look like it,
but I'm getting a degree.

137
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,320
I see. I'd like, um,
for you to accompany me to the ball.

138
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,600
Well, really,
I want you to ask me so I can say yes.

139
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,440
But I wasn't invited.

140
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,159
You are now.

141
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,679
-Why me, though?
-Why not?

142
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,639
There's no way
they'll let me be your date.

143
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,600
I choose where it happens
and who gets invited.

144
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,679
The others just donate
and pose for the photos,

145
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,879
which is all they want.

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,480
In other words, you wanted a second date,
and you didn't know how to ask for it.

147
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,519
Come on, now.
Don't jump to conclusions, all right?

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
Yeah? And what conclusions could those be?

149
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
-What conclusions?
-Did I stutter?

150
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,600
"If he asks me on a second date,
it's because he likes me a lot."

151
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,240
"And, if things go well, who knows?
There could even be a third."

152
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Third, huh? Oh my my my, no.
You need to slow way down.

153
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
-I do?
-Uh, yeah.

154
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,879
But you are the one thinking all that.

155
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, do you like what I think
in your scenario?

156
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,879
Fuck.

157
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,120
Yeah, I'm coming! Chill out!

158
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,639
-Room service.
-What are you doing here?

159
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,279
If Muhammad won't go to the mountain…

160
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,600
Yeah, it's just that,
uh, Muhammad isn't feeling well.

161
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,399
Well, this cures everything.
Come on. Let's go.

162
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Jesus Christ.

163
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Mm-hmm.
Shot glasses, where are you hiding?

164
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,639
Aha! I'm kind of a genius.

165
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Uh, it's just that I can't today, Mencía.

166
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,919
It's not a good time for me,
and I'm so busy.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Come on. Just take a seat.

168
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,039
We need to talk about
your little voice message from earlier.

169
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,919
Please don't do this to me.

170
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,200
Would you sit down?

171
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,399
I really can't see a thing.

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,279
-Ah! Straight?
-Step by step, step by step…

173
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,200
-Straight ahead of you.
-Okay. Like, forward?

174
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,399
I got you.

175
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,559
-Just a little further, a little further.
-Uh-huh.

176
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,840
A little…

177
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,320
-What is all this?
-Pick whichever ones you want.

178
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh my God! But, Phillipe!

179
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,399
All right.

180
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,840
Okay. For every question you ask me,
I'll ask you another.

181
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Oh, I thought you'd say to remove
a piece of clothing or something.

182
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,200
Well, that's when your answer is wrong
or you don't answer the question.

183
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
'Kay.

184
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Uh…

185
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,879
-Describe yourself in three words.
-Hmm.

186
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,399
-Fearless.
-Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
And passionate.

188
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,480
And… messed up.

189
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,279
That was four words.

190
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,840
Yeah, but "messed up"
is a singular concept.

191
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,879
But, all right.

192
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,879
Yeah, that's four.

193
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,039
What do you hate
more than anything else in the world?

194
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,200
Being lied to, being taken for an idiot,

195
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
and being told something,
then finding out the truth.

196
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,919
Just being let down.

197
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,559
That was, like, 25 right there.

198
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,639
Okay.

199
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,759
No, no. Those don't count.

200
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,519
Okay.

201
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,399
What's your biggest secret?

202
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,679
Well, the thing is, if I told you…

203
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,720
…then it wouldn't be a secret.

204
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,440
-Would it?
-No.

205
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,080
What makes you happy?

206
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,279
Incredibly hard workers…

207
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,919
…who are always there,
always keep their promises,

208
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,639
like my old lady.

209
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,200
What's cool about your mother?

210
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,399
My old lady's the shit, kid.

211
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
She'll do anything for me.

212
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,039
Like quitting that shitty life
and all that dealing

213
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,799
and start again from scratch.

214
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,360
What, uh, happened to yours?

215
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,200
Hey.

216
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,799
We don't have to tell each other
everything today, you know?

217
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,240
You wanna kiss me real bad, huh?

218
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,799
Do it, then.

219
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,639
Oh. Ah, shit.

220
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,919
What? Aren't you gonna share?

221
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,960
Uh… uh, Mom?
It's not what it looks like, okay?

222
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,319
Sure? 'Cause it looks like
you were partying pretty hard

223
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,680
with a friend in the living room.

224
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,119
Mencía, my mother, Sandra.

225
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,079
Sandra, Mencía.

226
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,440
What a beauty.

227
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,799
Hey, honey.

228
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,680
My blood pressure's kinda low.

229
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,640
Why don't you bring us
beers and some olives

230
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,119
so we can get to know each other?

231
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,680
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll go get some. I'm going.

232
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,960
How much did you charge my daughter?

233
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,000
Nothing.

234
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,039
Oh, of course.
First round's on the house, right?

235
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,200
You tell her you're a prostitute yet?

236
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,759
I'm not a prostitute.

237
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,599
You sleep with men,
and they give you money.

238
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
Ask Google and see what it says there.

239
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,400
What I do with my life
isn't your business, so butt out.

240
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,440
It is if it affects my daughter.

241
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
So, you have three options.

242
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,200
You tell her,

243
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,079
I tell her, or you leave the picture.

244
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,079
You decide which.

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,279
Here are the beers.
They're nice and cold.

246
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,799
Thanks, sweetheart!

247
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,119
Come on,
let's toast to the two of you.

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,319
Cheers.

249
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,559
I just don't feel like having a threesome
with Patrick or anyone else.

250
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Like, been there, done that.
You know what I mean?

251
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,000
But it's just sex.

252
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,279
Do you trust us or not?

253
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
I'd rather not test us, honestly.

254
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,319
What?

255
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,279
NEW MESSAGE FROM PATRICK

256
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,200
-What?
-What about what?

257
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,200
It just looked like
you were gonna say something.

258
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,720
I'M IN THE PRIVATE ROOM. JOIN ME.

259
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,720
Who's texting you?

260
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,440
Patrick.

261
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,680
And? What does Patrick want?

262
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,839
No, never mind.

263
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,079
No, tell me.

264
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,759
It's okay.

265
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,920
Look, Omar, you're the one
who wanted to open this door.

266
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
And now you wanna close it?

267
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,880
It's not fair.

268
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Maybe I don't wanna close it.

269
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,559
I'm sleeping at my place tonight.

270
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:14,640
What should I have waited for?

271
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Oh, I don't know, Nadia.

272
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,119
A mourning period?

273
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,559
Maybe we pushed it too soon.

274
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,759
Or, I guess, I did.

275
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,279
I know that it's scary,
but if you hadn't taken that first step,

276
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,079
we would've let it die
in the worst possible way.

277
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
Yeah.

278
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,400
I don't know.

279
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,640
I'm terrified.

280
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,079
'Cause you're so sure about what you want.

281
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,799
Oh fuck.

282
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,799
Guzmán,

283
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,640
what I've always known
is that I didn't want either of us

284
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,359
to end up hurting the other one.

285
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,279
I don't know.
I think it might be for the best

286
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,799
that we both look ahead.

287
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah. You're right.

288
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,480
And, yes, it is scary.

289
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,759
I changed my status to single.

290
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,759
'Cause… I don't know, maybe it's stupid,

291
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:41,400
but the fact that it's out there
for the whole world

292
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,759
makes it real to me.

293
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,599
So I think
you should try to look ahead, too, Guzmán.

294
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,680
Okay.

295
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,440
Well, then, I guess…

296
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,880
…that's it, then.

297
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,680
It's been so good knowing you.

298
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,960
The drama queen, as usual.

299
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,119
We'll see each other again.

300
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,960
Well, that is,
of course, only if you want to.

301
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,160
Wherever the sun sets, I'll be there.

302
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,240
All right.

303
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,440
I'll try moving forward.

304
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,279
We can only try.

305
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,039
Okay.

306
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Adios, Nadia.

307
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,000
You all right?

308
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,279
No, yeah. Everything's fine.

309
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,640
Okay.

310
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,200
Mencía, what's the matter?

311
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,799
Sorry. I just can't do it.

312
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,160
-I don't know…
-Yeah, I… I got it.

313
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,640
Sorry. No, no, I get it.
I'm overwhelming you.

314
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,839
No, no, that's not it. It's just, uh,

315
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,039
I don't know,
your mother's right outside the room,

316
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,440
and she caught us, and--

317
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,799
My mother?

318
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,960
But who cares? She's cool with it.
Did she say something?

319
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,000
-No, it's not that.
-Okay.

320
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,640
She was really nice,
but, uh, I don't know.

321
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
It's just that
I can't do this sort of thing

322
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,200
at my house with Benjamín, and,

323
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,319
well, let's just leave it
for some other day, okay?

324
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,119
Someone is at the front door.

325
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,839
Um…

326
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,960
No.

327
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,599
-Forget it. Nah.
-What?

328
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
Oh, hi. How are you?

329
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,640
Hi.

330
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,079
Why are you here?

331
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,960
-Can I come in?
-No.

332
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,319
My father's inside. It's better out here.

333
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,519
I see. Um… I'm really sorry.

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,160
I acted like a caveman
and an arrogant prick.

335
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,759
-Wow.
-Heh.

336
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,839
Now, that's the way
to start a proper speech.

337
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,839
Well, I also came to say that…

338
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,440
that I'd love to go to the ball with you.

339
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,400
Oh?

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,480
And… wait for you
at the bottom of the stairs

341
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,039
with my arm like this…

342
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,960
…so I was waiting to see
if you'd invite me.

343
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,799
That is, if you still want me to come.

344
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,960
Is that a yes?

345
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,319
I'm getting to know you better, right?

346
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Yes.

347
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,160
That's a yes.

348
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,119
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

349
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,319
I mean, perfect. So let's talk and, uh…

350
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,960
-And we'll see each other.
-Okay.

351
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,599
-Good night, then.
-Good night.

352
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,480
Did Guzmán talk to you about Ari?

353
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,960
He left my sister for her.

354
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,400
How about Ander then?

355
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,079
No idea.

356
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,200
Did he talk to Samuel?

357
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,400
Samuel.

358
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,440
Hey.

359
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,880
-Yo. What's going on?
-Nothin'. I'm good.

360
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,119
Hey, you were right
about things with Ari and me.

361
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
-It was just up to us.
-Oh, yeah?

362
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,039
We met up last night,
and we're goin' to the ball together.

363
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,119
Oh shit. That's awesome.

364
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,079
-Yeah. You're not angry, are you?
-Me?

365
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,640
No way, dude.

366
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,640
Not at all.

367
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,119
Cool. You just had a one-night stand.
I mean, you're not actually into her.

368
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
Are you tryin' to tell me something?

369
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,319
No, I just think
she and I are legit into each other,

370
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,839
and I wanted to check
you weren't hopin' for more.

371
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,960
That we're cool.

372
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:49,039
Yeah? I don't know
why you're making me a part of your shit.

373
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,960
Hey! Whoa. I didn't mean to piss you off.

374
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,559
It seems like you don't really like her.
You're being an asshat.

375
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,359
See? I knew you'd get pissed,
though you went after her to annoy me--

376
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,279
Guzmán, get off my dick!
Seems like I'm the one you're into.

377
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,880
You can keep Ari,
keep the motorcycle, keep it all.

378
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,119
Guy can't decide what he wants.

379
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,599
-Good morning.
-Hey.

380
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,200
Listen, I've been thinking about this.

381
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,200
Like, I know you'll think
this is some vulgar, medieval shit.

382
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,359
And for the record, so do I.

383
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,279
But, I don't know,
maybe there might be something to it.

384
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,079
Since one of us
is supposed to ask, I thought,

385
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,880
"C'mon, Rebeka, just nut up and do it."
So, uh, wanna be my cavalier?

386
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm sorry.

387
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,039
I can't, hon. It's just that I have to…

388
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,759
What? What is it?

389
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,480
It's nothing exciting.
Just some things I have to take care of.

390
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,799
You know I don't like being dependent
on Benjamín for shit.

391
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,720
Oh.

392
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,039
Not here.

394
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:54,960
Why?

395
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:00,720
You have to tell me about the protocols
you established with your boyfriend.

396
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,240
It was just sex.

397
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,640
What happened?

398
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,079
-Why do you wanna know?
-Because I just wanna know.

399
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,000
Tell me.

400
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,759
 He texted when I got in the taxi.

401
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,599
You arranged to meet
while at my place?

402
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,799
-No.
-Yes.

403
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
I made up my mind in the taxi.

404
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,599
Hey, handsome.

405
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,680
How'd it go down?

406
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,920
We tell each other everything,

407
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,119
and I have to catch you
on this stupid bullshit? Seriously?

408
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,920
This is the Patrick method
for drinking tequila.

409
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,799
The first step…

410
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,440
is licking the salt.

411
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,279
Then he licked my neck.

412
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,920
He poured salt on it.

413
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,920
Then he dipped my fingers in lemon.

414
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,799
And the final move…

415
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,839
We started getting hot and bothered
right at the bar, and…

416
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,759
Uh, and so on.

417
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,599
And so on?

418
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,440
So we fucked, dude.

419
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,680
You're saying that you went for it?

420
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,400
-Why's it matter?
-I said, tell me about it.

421
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,240
He went to the bathroom,
and I followed him.

422
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:09,279
We closed the door after us
and started making out.

423
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,119
Then I unbuttoned his shirt.
I started kissing him.

424
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,240
Yes. Hey.

425
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,319
Under the clothes is cheating, remember?

426
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,039
Then I got to his dick and sucked it.

427
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,799
Then he grabbed me
and fucked me against the wall.

428
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,240
Until we both got off.

429
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
I don't get it.

430
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,400
You pissed off or turned on?

431
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,480
Omar, it was just sex. That's all.

432
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,079
You used condoms, or did you not bother?

433
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,680
Of course. What do you think this is?

434
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,599
I don't know anymore, to be honest.

435
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Can this not happen again? Hmm?

436
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,119
Yeah.

437
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,079
All right.

438
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,039
Do you want some?

439
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,519
It's the best in Madrid.

440
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,440
From the owner of that Speakeasy
we went to the other day.

441
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,359
Wait, the owner sold you that coke?

442
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,160
What are you doing?

443
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,240
Um, I gotta head out.

444
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,839
All right. So, where are you heading?

445
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,480
I need cash.

446
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,920
I'll make it up to you next time, okay?

447
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,759
Hold on!

448
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,319
Where's Rebeka?

449
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
Who the hell do you think you are?

450
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,640
What do you have in there?

451
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,000
We're gonna look fabulous, bae.

452
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,680
Just stunning.

453
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,559
I mean, we're gonna turn heads so hard,
necks are gonna break.

454
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,720
Where you ladies off to?

455
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,079
A party
a friend from class is throwing tonight.

456
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,519
I won't be too late. Shall we?

457
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,400
Guapa!

458
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
I know
you're back to dealing drugs again.

459
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720
-And that Rebeka doesn't know it.
-Yo, kid! You comin' or what?

460
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,680
We're gonna be
the first mother and daughter-in-law

461
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,440
who get along, aren't we?

462
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,320
I love the way
we send messages through fashion.

463
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,079
What message am I sending you
with this dress, huh?

464
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:35,960
Well…

465
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,079
That the night is yours.

466
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,840
And that
we'll blow them away on Instagram.

467
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,840
-I'm, like, so nervous.
-Don't be.

468
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm gonna start setting up
the cavaliers, okay?

469
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,800
No.

470
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,159
-Wow.
-You look great.

471
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,320
My, oh my.

472
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,239
-Hi, handsome.
-How are you?

473
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,920
-Good, you?
-Can you charge my phone for me?

474
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,079
Can I please get a glass of Cava?

475
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Sure.

476
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I've been walkin' around here,
and there are beds with headboards

477
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,400
where you can tie me up with my bow tie.

478
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
Stop it, Patrick.

479
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,400
But you like having sex with me.

480
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,199
This could ruin my relationship.
Don't you get it?

481
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,440
Ander…

482
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Look, I told you it's more dangerous
to say no than say yes to me.

483
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,639
-Thank you.
-Over here!

484
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
Are you okay?

485
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,840
What happened?

486
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:21,320
Is that the face
you want immortalized on social media?

487
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,079
What face would you be wearing
if I had recorded you while we fucked?

488
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,039
-What are you saying?
-What do you want it for, Phillipe?

489
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,840
Are you gonna send it to your friends?

490
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,639
Do you have a WhatsApp group
where you send

491
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,760
videos of yourselves
fucking commoners like us?

492
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,199
-What?
-Is it to jerk off to? What's it for?

493
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,119
Cayetana, I did it as a precaution. Okay?

494
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,880
What did you think of me?
That I'm some spy or terrorist?

495
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,400
I'll explain later, okay? In private.

496
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,000
Cayetana, please. Let me explain.

497
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:06,400
Just let me explain myself.

498
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,280
-Listen to me! Hold on!
-What!

499
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,519
Look,
I met… I met this girl, okay?

500
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:13,800
I thought she was charming, like you.
And I liked her the way I do you.

501
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,480
But she was just into me being a royal.

502
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,360
Because I guess a prince
is a perfect target

503
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,079
if you want to falsely accuse someone
of being sexually abusive

504
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
and make yourself a fortune
blackmailing him.

505
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,039
I'm sorry about that,
but you had no right to film me.

506
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,400
I mean, that's abusive.
For you to do that, without asking me.

507
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,079
Cayetana, sometimes security demands
we have to bend the rules a bit.

508
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,679
Okay, so you record me

509
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,320
then insult my integrity,
calling me a greedy scammer?

510
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,280
What?
But I never called you anything like that.

511
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Oh my God, you did!

512
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,039
I was being cautious.
You know what I've heard? Huh?

513
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,360
-No.
-They say you are a con artist.

514
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,239
A liar. Listen to me!

515
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Ex-girlfriend of a murderer.
Maybe an accomplice.

516
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:54,960
I don't know whether to give credit
for finding this information

517
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,320
to my intelligence services
or the bathroom stalls of Las Encinas.

518
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:02,480
Hey, listen to me.

519
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,119
-Don't do that.
-Listen to me, please, Cayetana.

520
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,639
-Cayetana!
-What? What, what, what?

521
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,679
Look, you're so intelligent and fun.

522
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,320
You know exactly what you want.

523
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,159
And I really like you.

524
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,559
And that's why,
despite everything I've heard out there,

525
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,639
I still want to get to know you
and hear your side of this.

526
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,000
And now you can choose
whether you still want to know me.

527
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,599
When I save up
the amount of money I'm hoping to,

528
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,719
you and I can move in together.

529
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,559
-That right?
-Yeah.

530
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,920
-All right. Where?
-Wherever you want.

531
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,920
Hmm.

532
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,880
Okay.

533
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,559
So, the thing right now is, finally,

534
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,159
if I'm being honest,
I'm pretty happy with my old lady.

535
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,280
Ah, well.

536
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,960
And what would you think
if I set up a place first?

537
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,960
And started makin' room for you?

538
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,559
Well, I think it sounds like I'm gonna
need to get at least two drinks

539
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,360
in order to properly mull it over.

540
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,159
-Mm-hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

541
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,159
-Hmm.
-This is Sandra, Rebeka's mother.

542
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,960
Honey, for my daughter's sake,
I'm gonna give you a word of advice.

543
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,079
Don't threaten me.

544
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,039
I swear, you don't even wanna think
about threatening me.

545
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,440
And especially not when Rebeka's involved.

546
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,599
Is that clear?

547
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:51,840
Who was it?

548
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,480
No one. It was nothing.

549
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,440
ANDER, WE NEED TO TALK

550
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,239
COME, PLEASE

551
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,400
ANDER, I WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU

552
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,440
I'M NOT A QUITTER

553
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:19,960
Omar, can I get my phone?

554
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,239
-I'm heading back home.
-How come?

555
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:33,519
I'm just kinda exhausted.

556
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,480
You stayin' late?

557
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,960
Yeah, until the party's over
and I put everything away.

558
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,679
See ya later.

559
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,960
-You check your boyfriend's cell phone?
-Leave Ander alone.

560
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,119
Leave us both alone.

561
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,039
Look, I can step aside.

562
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:32,159
But he might come for me.

563
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,039
I don't know. You just wrote to him,
and he didn't come, did he?

564
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,719
But you did.

565
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,079
Do Ander and I make you jealous,
or do you want a piece of it?

566
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:00,960
I can only think of one way
to improve this position.

567
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,320
What's up, man?

568
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,920
C'mon! What the fuck is this shit?

569
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,599
Samuel, what the hell are you doing?

570
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,679
-What are you?
-I was serving her a drink.

571
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,480
So, you're getting my girl drunk
so she'll hook up with you again?

572
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,800
-I'm sorry, what?
-Listen, man. I'm not interested.

573
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,159
Sure, laugh.
You're such a pain in my ass.

574
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,400
-What?
-Come here a minute.

575
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,519
-Don't grab me like that.
-I said come here.

576
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,480
Okay.

577
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,840
Okay, I'm not sure
what I liked least about the phrase

578
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,119
"You're getting my girl drunk
so she'll hook up with you."

579
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:54,599
-It-- I meant to say, "My date."
-"Your" girl?

580
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,159
Okay. So to you, I'm just a puppet
with no will of its own

581
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:00,519
that you take turns manipulating into
hooking up with you?

582
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,400
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean puppet.

583
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,280
-You think I'm your property.
-That's not what I meant, Ari. Okay?

584
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,039
You came here with me.
I came here with you. What is the problem?

585
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,559
We're off to a bad start
if you don't think there's a problem.

586
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,840
-Do you wanna be with me, or don't you?
-That depends.

587
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,119
You know what? For me, it depends on
whether you'll act like a Neanderthal,

588
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,400
turn around and apologize,

589
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,840
but then whip your club out again,
so on and so forth.

590
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,719
-Understand?
-Mm-hmm.

591
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,199
-You're right.
-Don't say I'm right to shut me up.

592
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,239
Come on.
I'm not telling you to shut you up.

593
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,559
I'm asking you to forgive me.

594
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,440
I'm gonna learn.

595
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,119
Step by step.

596
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,480
Step by step.

597
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,880
It also depends on if you kiss me.

598
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,119
No, I mean,
you're talking about a relationship,

599
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,039
and you haven't even kissed me yet.

600
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,679
Yeah.

601
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,320
-Should I?
-No, I'll go for it. I got nervous.

602
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,280
Okay.

603
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,960
You look nervous.

604
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:07,280
Are you worried
she might wake up and talk?

605
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,719
No. No.

606
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:13,440
I'm worried she might not.

607
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:14,920
What if she doesn't wake up?

608
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,599
Then I guess
we wouldn't be looking for an assailant.

609
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,320
We'd be looking for a murderer.
