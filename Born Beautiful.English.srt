I'm so tired!

He was always trying to be like me...

315
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,608
[sobbing]
...until he became gay.

316
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,197
But he didn't want that,
and neither did I.

317
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,282
That's why we're here.

318
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:34,663
I am Felix B. Ayag, a real man.

My name is Deacon.

[inhales manfully]

323
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,926
...I was unfaithful.

324
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:56,143
One night, I got drunk and ended up
sleeping with my male best friend.

325
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,355
I was formerly known as Barbs Cordero.

326
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,652
I changed my body into that of a woman.
I even had breast implants.

327
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:11,950
I really felt that I was born a woman.

328
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,870
Perhaps I was wrong,

329
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,583
because eventually my gay friends
died one by one.

You are lucky!

How will you choose to be straight?

347
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,160
Pray. Just pray.

348

You have to pray. Yes, what is it?

349
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,542
What prayer should I say?
This is so difficult.

350
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,587
I always pray
and I go to church regularly.

those things can be learned.

00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,166
-Hmph!
-[car revving]

472
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,755
[Michael]
I wanted to ask Trisha for forgiveness

473
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,466
but my fear got the best of me.

474
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,349
I told myself, "Maybe we'll see each other
again at the right time."

475
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,980
That's not going to happen
now that she's gone.

476
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:42,116
I wish I could have gone to her wake.

477
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,495
[sniffs]

478
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,958
I would have asked for forgiveness.

479
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,756
How will I make it up to her now?

480
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,137
At first, I thought that money
was the only thing I wanted from her.

481
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:10,436
But I kept searching for her
in my other gay relationships.

482
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,274
She was different.

483
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,030
Are you OK?

484
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
This sauce is really hot.

485
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,409
[laughs]

486
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,746
Mister! Why do you keep cutting onions?

487
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,748
[in Taglish]
Are those squid rings or onion rings?

488
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,041
[chuckles]

489
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,212
How are you, Barbs? Why do you...

490
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,465
Why do you look different?

491
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,555
Like you, I chose the straight path.

492
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,182
But it keeps getting crooked.

493
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,226
-[in Taglish] I keep making a U-turn.
-[laughs]

494
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,396
Oh, so that's it.

495
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,439
It doesn't suit me, right?

496
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,108
Trisha would find it repulsive.

497
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,446
[sighs]
If only she were here.

498
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,534
[in English]
Well...

499
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:16,043
Trisha's dead.
But Barbs is very much alive.

500
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,259
[Michael] Let me bring you home.
Where are you staying?

501
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,304
-My place is not that far.
-[Michael] Come with me. Let's go.

502
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,558
[knocking]

503
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,187
[both scream]

504
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,065
Why do you look like that?

505
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,194
What did I tell you? "You'll be back."

506
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,781
Enough with all that Bobby nonsense.

507
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,241
Oh, come on.

508
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,329
So, what now? Are you back to being Barbs?

509
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,833
[in English]
New and improved.

510
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,587
[in Taglish]
Improved? Something is lacking.

511
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,048
I'm going to have that fixed.

512
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,718
That is, if you'll take me back
so I can start saving up.

513
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,179
What did I tell you before?

514
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,183
[both in English]
Happy Ending Funeral Homes

515
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,685
[both in English]
will always be your home.

516
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,774
-I miss you, Ma.
-[soft laugh]

517
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,569
I missed you too, Barbs.

518
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,696
But the dead missed you more.

519
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,034
Your hands
can bring the dead back to life.

520
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,494
[laughs]

521
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,498
Barbs, have you checked her makeup?

522
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,124
Yes, I'm done with that.

523
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:43,172
-What about Arianne's?
-I'm also done with that.

524
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:48,344
-What about Selena's?
-Done.

525
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:55,059
[in Taglish] By the way, Barbs, the gowns
are ready for pick up at the boutique.

526
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,437
-All right. I will go there later.
-OK.

527
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,107
[knocking]

528
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,944
[in Taglish] Hello. Good morning.
I'm looking for Barbs.

529
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,779
Barbs! Someone's looking for you.

530
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,239
-Hello.
-Hello. How's your day?

531
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,994
-Hi, Michael. Thank you for this.
-You're welcome.

532
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,247
[all]
Michael Angelo?

533
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,708
[all]
We're all done with him.

534
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,339
Thank you for accompanying me.

535
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:27,633
You can always count on me.

536
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,846
[Barbs sighs]

537
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,727
I didn't know you played basketball.

538
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,605
[in Taglish] Yes, I'm playing
at the Taxi Drivers Association League

539
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,692
-the day after tomorrow.
-I hope you play a good game.

540
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,738
[in Taglish] You bet.
I can shoot three-points in the dark.

541
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,493
Why are you still holding that?
Let me take that.

542
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,703
[in English]
Thank you.

543
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,380
-Barbs?
-Yes, what it is?

544
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,092
I didn't know you worked with
Arianne and Selena.

545
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,636
Yes, but I just met them.

546
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,308
Mama Flora hired new people
because of her growing clientele.

547
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,063
-Why?
-Well...

548
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,276
Arianne and Selena,

549
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,071
they are my exes.

550
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,369
But our relationships were short-lived
because I went back to the province.

551
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,498
Come on. That's OK.

552
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,999
[in English]
Past is past.

553
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:46,545
[in Taglish] Besides, we don't have
a present, so there's no need to explain.

554
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,839
Not yet.

559
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,053
Hello?

560
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:23,642
-What happened?
-She had another asthma attack.

561
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,603
We didn't give her enough medicines
last week.

562
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,774
We went to the hospital earlier.
They prescribed a lot of costly medicines.

563
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,693
-Let me see.
-How can we afford to buy those?

564
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,363
I'll find a way.

565
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,576
[sighs] I'm sorry, Barbs.
I have to go and earn some money.

566
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,328
Hold on.

567
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,376
Here, Michael. I have some savings left.

568
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,339
-No, Barbs. I can manage.
-Take it. It's OK. Come on.

569
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,050
It's OK. It's my way of helping you.

570
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,218
I'm not after your money.

571
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,430
I know.

572
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,142
Please accept it. It's for your family.

573
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,524
Barbs, thank you very much.

574
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,402
I'll pay you back as soon as I am able.

575
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,905
Thank you.

576
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,910
[Michael]
Barbs?

577
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,161
[knocking]

578
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,579
[Michael]
Barbs? Hi.

579
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:31,085
Michael Angelo, quit being a pest.
Barbs isn't here.

580
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:36,465
She went to her aunt's place in Cebu.
We don't know when she will be back.

581
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,593
[in Taglish]
Is there anything we can do for you?

582
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,970
Does she have any other number I can call?
I can't reach her.

583
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,140
[Selena] None.
We haven't spoken to her either.

584
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,059
Mama Flora's also trying to find her.

585
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,646
[in Taglish] Ah! Speaking of Mama Flora.
We've got a lot of work to do.

586
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,564
-Wait a minute.
-Go ahead.

587
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,733
-Take care!
-Bye-bye!

588
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,735
[in Taglish]
It was nice seeing you. Bye-bye!

589
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,282
[sighs]

590
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,743
You're something else.

591
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,955
He's the one who borrowed money,
and yet you're the one hiding.

592
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,958
-What now?
-He's married!

593
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,961
Even though you knew Michael Angelo
and I had a past, you still accepted it.

594
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,421
-What makes this different?
-[in English] True.

595
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,755
[in English]
Well, past is past.

596
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,424
But his wife is still his wife.

597
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,633
[in English]
So present is present.

598
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,344
Just be frank.
Tell him it's over. The end!

599
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,723
-Right?
-You're scared, aren't you?

600
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:28,976
Scared of what?

601
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,938
When you see him, you might give in.

602
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,525
No, I won't.

603
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,026
-[in English] I'm sure.
-Really?

604
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,363
[in Taglish] I'm going to buy some stuff
for the new batch of corpses. Excuse me.

605
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,700
-Hey, be careful.
-Be careful out there.

606
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,626
Barbs?

607
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,801
Barbs!

608
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,595
[honking]

609
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,187
Michael, how are you? I didn't notice you.

610
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,272
When did you get back from Cebu?

611
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,983
[in Taglish]
Just now. I went right back to work.

612
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,320
[in Taglish] Why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.

613
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,448
[in Taglish]
Well, we're trying to cut costs.

614
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,451
Mama Flora told me to ride a jeep.

615
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,246
You wouldn't have to pay me.

616
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,624
[in Taglish]
Next time I'll ask you for a ride.

617
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,211
Wait a minute.

618
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,713
[in Taglish] Hey, how come you didn't get
in touch with me?

619
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,258
-Are you avoiding me?
-What?

620
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,638
Why would I do that?
I'm not avoiding you. Don't be silly.

621
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,848
Come with me then.

622
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,435
It's my daughter's birthday.
We're having a small gathering.

623
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:58,273
[in Taglish]
Michael, I have to finish so many...

624
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,276
Come on, this is my way
of saying thank you.

625
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,530
OK, but let me go back

Pampered mistress or battered wife?

783
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,567
Gregory has changed.
He's not the same as before.

784
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,612
[in Taglish] Besides, I'm not a mistress.
I have the wife's consent.

785
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,865
-[in English] And the winner is?
-Do I really have to choose?

786
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,618
[in Taglish] Of course! Even in pageants,
you can't share the crown.

787
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,830
[in Taglish] There's a queen
and a runner-up. You're driving us crazy.

788
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,708
I don't know. I love them both.

789
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:49,210
[in Taglish]
OK, I'll decide.

790
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:55,008
Whoever arrives first to support you wins.

791
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,677
And he should be wearing a pink top.

792
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,181
[in Taglish] What we've all been waiting
for, the announcement of top three.

793
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,685
[in Taglish] You're in the top three,
Ms. Selena Lovato!

794
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,478
[crowd cheering and applauding]

795
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,815
[pageant music playing]

796
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:17,280
[in Taglish] Sashay our way because
you also made it, Ms. Jinky Donaire!

797
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,032
[crowd cheering and applauding]

798
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:27,582
[in English] And to complete our top
three, congratulations, Ms. Barbs Cordero!

799
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,292
[crowd cheering and applauding]

800
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:42,555
[in English] Ladies and gentlemen,
your top three for Miss Zoning 2018!

801
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,934
[in English]
OK, Ms. Cordero, here is your question.

802
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:51,147
[in English] What is your greatest
realization about love?

803
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,485
[in English] Ms. Cordero,
you have five seconds to answer.

804
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,951
[romantic music playing]

805
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,753
[in English] Oh, I'm sorry,
Ms. Cordero, but your time is up.

806
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,256
[in Taglish] Wait. I haven't answered
the question yet. I'm sorry.

807
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,675
[in English]
I'm sorry, time's up.

808
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,344
[in Taglish] Next contestant, please.
Please take your place at the back.

809
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,899
[in Swardspeak] I can't believe you didn't
answer that question, it's so annoying.

810
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,402
Did you know that...

811
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,112
-Hi Barbs!
-Hi Barbs!

812
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,159
-Let's go, Barbs!
-Let's go, Barbs!

813
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,372
[Barbs chuckles]

814
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:54,585
[in Taglish] Hold on.
Let me introduce you to each other.

815
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,588
Michael Angelo, this is Greg.

816
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,591
Greg, meet Michael Angelo.

817
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,097
-Come on, Barbs. Get inside.
-[Greg] No, Barbs. Ride with me.

818
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:13,604
Barbs, ride my taxi. It's air-conditioned.

819
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:17,942
It's cooler here,
you can smell the fresh air.

820
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,569
And inhale all the dust.
[chuckles]

821
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,487
[Greg]
That's not a licensed cab.

822
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,197
[jeepney revving]

823
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,575
[Michael]
His tricycle reeks of rat.

824
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,494
That's enough!

825
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,581
-Barbs, he has a flat tire.
-Girls! Get inside.

826
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:35,460
-OK.
-This might be the death of us.

827
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,004
Let's be careful, OK?

828
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,301
I'll see you at home.

829
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,188
-Barbs!
-Barbs! Wait.

830
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,200
OK... This is the first time
I'm going to introduce you to each other.

831
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,243
I will use this opportunity.

832
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:15,625
[in Taglish] Michael Angelo,
this is my boyfriend, Greg.

833
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:22,173
[in Taglish] Greg, this is Michael Angelo,
also my boyfriend.

834
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,593
-[in English] Boyfriend?
-What do you mean?

835
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,970
This turd is your boyfriend?

836
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,348
-[laughs] Me, a turd?
-Yes.

837
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,683
You look more like a shit-face than I do.

838
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,561
Hey! Stop bickering!

839
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,939
What are you both mad about?

840
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,691
Barbs, are you blind?

841
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,278
There are two of us.
You only have one heart.

842
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,573
Wow, straight out of a movie!

843
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,451
Greg, you taught me
that I can love more than one.

844
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:53,704
I asked you to choose
between your wife and me.

845
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,831
You said you loved us both.

846
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,250
Are you the only one who can love
two people at the same time?

847
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,209
What about me?

848
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,461
I was wrong.

849
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,840
That's why I came back.

850
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,592
I realized that you were right.

851
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:12,890
There should only be one.
And it's you. You're the one I want.

852
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,476
And now you don't want to choose?

853
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,688
Pick me, Barbs.

854
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,775
Barbs, you don't have to choose.

855
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:28,573
Even if I'm married,
it's OK as long as we're together.

856
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:33,452
You're so sweet, Michael Angelo.

857
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:37,206
If I were you, I'd choose Michael Angelo.

858
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,543
Did you hear what he said?
It doesn't matter that he's married.

859
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,838
It's better to be a mistress
than to get beaten up.

860
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,634
Idiot! Choose Greg, Barbs.

861
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:53,931
This man may be a jerk but at least
you're the only one he's hitting.

862
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,685
Fine. If you don't want Michael Angelo,

863
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,272
I will sacrifice myself.
He can have me instead.

864
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,317
And I will have all of him.

865
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:09,572
Barbs, if you're not going to pick Greg,

866
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:13,034
I'll take care of him for you. I'm ready.

867
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,828
Stupid bitches!
You don't need to pick one of them.

868
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:19,707
[in Taglish] Go for fresh blood.
I know this guy. He's got a nice body.

869
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,959
-Who is he?
-Actually, he looks like you.

870
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,170
-[in Taglish] With his looks? No thanks.
-[Flora] Hey!

871
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:28,049
What a ruckus!
Let's all just sleep together!

872
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,093
-What?
-Who wants to go first?

873
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,596
[in Taglish]
Mother, wait.

874
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:39,060
[in Taglish]
Selena, ask me that question from the Q&amp;A.

875
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:44,315
-I don't remember it.
-Kennie, you do it.

876
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,401
Don't ask me.
It was noisy, I didn't hear it.

877
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,444
Arianne?

878
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,655
[in Taglish] I didn't pay attention.
I lost, remember?

879
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,658
[sighs]

880
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,243
[in deep voice]
Ms. Cordero.

881
01:05:56,577 --> 01:06:00,498
[in English] What is
your greatest realization about love?

882
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,212
[uplifting music]

883
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,800
[in normal voice, in English]
Thank you for that wonderful question.

884
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:16,764
[in English] My greatest realization
about love is that love has no limits.

885
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,267
The heart never becomes full.

886
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,479
Love can never be contained.

887
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,565
[in English]
It expands the more you love.

888
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,360
You can never run out of love
even when you give it.

889
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:33,572
[in Taglish] The more love you give,
the more love you'll have.

890
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:37,660
[in Taglish]
I am Barbs Cordero, saying that

891
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:41,747
you shouldn't just love
as deeply as you can,

892
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,126
but also as many as you can.

893
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,586
[in English]
And I thank you!

894
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,715
-[clapping]
-That's a great answer!

895
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,425
-Barbs!
-Barbs!

896
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,552
Excuse me. Does Bobby live here?

897
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,557
There's no one here with that name.

898
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,186
Bobby? There's no Bobby here.

899
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,898
Where is he?

900
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:15,281
Ah, he's gone. I am now Barbs Cordero.

901
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,034
You are Bobby!

902
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,952
It's Barbs! Don't push it, girl.

903
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:28,377
Wait. Are you from
the Way of Light community?

904
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:33,299
Are you here for the full payment
for the retreat?

905
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:38,179
Tell Brother Sonny and Pastor Donald
that I paid when they raped me.

906
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,724
[in Taglish] In fact, they owe me.
But now is not the time for this.

907
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:45,144
-There is so much going on! Fighting--
-Bobby, I'm pregnant.

908
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:50,065
-You're the father.
-[Arianne] Huh?

909
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:58,866
No! I am not the father.

910
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,202
[Greg]
A pastor raped you?

911
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,829
-Talk to me Barbs!
-Bobby.

912
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,039
-One at a time!
-Why'd you come in?

913
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:09,627
-Wait...
-Bobby! Let me through.

914
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:12,463
-What do you want?
-Bobby! I'm telling the truth.

915
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,758
-You're the father.
-Hush!

916
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:18,928
-I'm not Bobby. I'm Barbs.
-You're Bobby.

917
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:22,848
-Barbs!
-Barbs, Bobby, it's the same.

918
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:27,353
Just call her Barbs.
Bobby makes me want to puke.

919
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,272
This is your responsibility.

920
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,691
Don't turn your back on me.

921
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,109
This is your fault.

922
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,488
[in Taglish] Responsibility?
Wow, that's a big word.

923
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:40,324
How is this my fault? You're a hooker.

924
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,493
I bet you were sent by Way of Light.

925
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:44,203
How do I know that's my child?

926
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,913
You're just causing trouble. Leave!

927
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:49,166
Hey, gay, I don't know
what's keeping you busy here,

928
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,294
but because of you, I had to stop working.

929
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,255
So, you have to take responsibility.

930
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,257
You said it yourself, I am gay.

931
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,634
Do you really think
you can give me a hard on?

Don't celebrate yet.

1084
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:26,910
And why not?
I used a condom. You may go now.

1085
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,204
[Yumi laughing]
Condom?

1086
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,876
-Condom!
-[Flora in Taglish] She transforms!

1087
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:49,850
[gasps]

1088
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:59,192
[laughing]

1089
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:02,028
Why don't you leave me alone, Yumi?

1090
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,532
You won't get anything from me.
Can't you see?

1091
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,326
[in Taglish]
Soon, I'm going to become a girl.

1092
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,915
-Don't force yourself on me.
-Wait.

1093
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,544
[in Taglish]
Sister, you're going to become a girl?

1094
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:21,089
-[in English] Yes! I'm so excited!
-[in English] Goodness!

1095
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,925
Why didn't you tell us?
When do you plan to do this?

1096
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:25,552
I'm just saving up.

1097
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:27,596
[Kennie]
That's great!

1098
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,306
-[Barbs laughing]
-[commotion nearby]

1099
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:32,184
-What's that?
-I don't know.

1100
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,144
Let me take care of it.

1101
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:36,354
We're not finished yet.

1102
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:38,982
We're done.

1103
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:48,241
Enough! Would you two stop?

1104
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,161
Hey! Wretch!

1105
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:53,038
-What are you fighting about?
-You!

1106
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:56,124
I know you're fighting over me! Why?

1107
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,504
[in Taglish] Barbs, didn't we agree
that I would spend the night here?

1108
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:04,424
[in Taglish] Barbs, we talked about this.
I was going to spend the night here, too.

1109
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:07,344
[in Taglish] So both of you will spend
the night here! What's the problem?

1110
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,095
What?

1111
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:13,016
Are you going to kill each other
because both of you will stay overnight?

1112
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:21,483
What? Is the world going to end?
I don't understand it.

1113
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,568
You idiot.

1114
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,238
-We can't be with you at the same time.
-Don't come with us then.

1115
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,366
-You wretch!
-That's enough!

1116
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:33,078
-Would you both stop?
-Why are you pushing me?

1117
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,788
Would you please stop!

1118
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:37,874
Barbs, it's like this. Whatever makes
you happy, I'll support you.

1119
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:41,962
Enough! Barbs, you have to choose.
You have to end this.

1120
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,755
It's embarrassing.

1121
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:46,299
-Bobby!
-It's Barbs.

1122
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:50,011
Bobby, Barbs
or whatever you want to call yourself.

1123
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:54,641
Listen, if you don't believe me,
then I give up.

1124
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,311
-Come with me.
-Barbs.

1125
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:02,732
Where? Wait. Where are we going?

1126
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,944
Come with me.
We're going to get an abortion.

1127
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,572
After this, I will not bother you anymore.

1128
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:11,241
You can pay for the abortion, right?

1129
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:13,451
[in Taglish]
It's cheaper than a DNA test.

1130
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,829
Much cheaper! Affordable!

1131
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:19,708
Let's get this over with.
Are you coming or not?

1132
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:35,056
[screams]

1133
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,891
Would you mind staying outside?

1134
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,811
[in Taglish]
Sorry, Doc. Please, continue.

1135
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,318
[Barbs screaming]

1136
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,738
Miss, stay outside if you can't handle it.

1137
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,323
[in English]
Sorry, Doc. Sorry.

1138
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:57,078
-You better shut your trap!
-This is it! My eyes are closed.

1139
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:07,380
[screaming]

1140
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:12,010
Doc! Don't do it.

1141
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,386
What's your problem, Bobby?

1142
01:22:14,137 --> 01:22:17,682
Yumi, let's not do this.
Come on, let's go.

1143
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,309
-Ouch.
-Are you sure about this?

1144
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:23,772
-Yes, I'm sure. Let's go, Yumi. Hurry!
-All right.

1145
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,150
Wait a minute! What about my fee?

1146
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:32,280
[in Taglish] Doc, may we ask
for a discount? Can we just pay half?

1147
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:35,325
[in Taglish] Sorry, that's our policy.
You can't bargain here.

1148
01:22:35,408 --> 01:22:37,744
We didn't finish anyway. Please.
We'll just pay half the fee.

1149
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,162
[in English]
I'm sorry.

1150
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,333
-Let's go, Yumi.
-[in English] Thank you.

1151
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,918
My slippers!

1152
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,920
-Here we go.
-Faster! Come on.

1153
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,343
I can't take care of this baby alone.

1154
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,931
I can't even take care of myself,
let alone a child.

1155
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,394
[in Taglish] I'm sorry, Bobby.
I'm not blackmailing you.

1156
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,981
Don't let your conscience bother you.
You didn't do anything wrong.

1157
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,569
We didn't do this deliberately
and yet here we are. It's done.

1158
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:16,408
Let's just get an abortion.
This will solve all of our problems.

1159
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:20,328
I can go back to work and you can
get back to the life you wanted.

1160
01:23:21,454 --> 01:23:23,498
No. It's wrong.

1161
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,875
It will be worse if we go down this road.

1162
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:34,134
I'm not asking for permission,
just letting you know.

1163
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,846
Remember, I'm carrying the child.

1164
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,644
I shouldn't have done this to you.

1165
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:47,647
I should have gone straight to the clinic
and had the abortion right away.

1166
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,066
But you didn't do that.

1167
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:53,236
That doesn't mean I can't.

1168
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:56,364
Yumi, you're not going to
have an abortion.

1169
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,283
Let's leave it up to fate.

1170
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:02,245
While you're waiting for the baby,
I'm going to help you.

1171
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:08,084
Barbs, you're overreacting.
Maybe it was just gas,

1172
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:11,463
or it was my stomach acting up
because I didn't eat all day.

1173
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,549
You said that you felt pain in your tummy.
What if you're about to give birth?

1174
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,760
What do you think I'm carrying here,
a tadpole?

1175
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:19,929
It's better to be sure.
What if the situation's critical?

1176
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:22,932
-Nurse, can you please attend to us?
-[nurse] OK.

1177
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,435
How are you feeling right now?
Are you OK?

1178
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:28,271
-OK.
-Sure? Are you in pain?

1179
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,231
Nurse, she is in pain.
Her stomach is throbbing.

1180
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,860
-[Nurse] Ma'am, what's your name?
-Dimaculangan, Yumi.

1181
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,826
-He's overreacting. It's just gas.
-How does it feel?

1182
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,911
Like gas.

1183
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:48,041
Hello, Mama Flora.
Are Greg and Michael Angelo still there?

1184
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,418
[Flora] Yes, they're in your room.

1185
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:56,382
I heard them arguing earlier
about who will sleep beside you.

1186
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,760
[Barbs]
Why did you let them in?

1187
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:02,055
You expect me not to?

1188
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,183
I have three boyfriends

1189
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,977
and hordes of admirers.

1190
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:13,858
Barbs, may I remind you,
your bed is no longer sturdy.

1191
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:18,404
[in Taglish]
It may not survive a threesome.

1192
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,532
What time are you coming home?

1193
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,660
[in Taglish] I rushed Yumi to the ER.
She had to undergo lab tests.

1194
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:27,705
-[in Taglish] We might get home late.
-"We"? Why "we"?

1195
01:25:28,122 --> 01:25:30,667
Do you plan to bring that woman here?

1196
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,212
[in Taglish]
Mama Flora, please spare me the lecture.

1197
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,423
I am so confused.
I don't know what to do with my life.

1198
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:42,971
Well, sometimes it's good to pray.

1199
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:47,809
In case you've forgotten,
the last church I went to

1200
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:51,855
did not only force me to be straight,
they also took advantage of me.

1201
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,315
[Flora]
That wasn't a real church.

1202
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:59,112
And you don't need to be
inside a church in order to pray.

1203
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:04,158
If you're sincere, He will listen to you
no matter where you are.

1204
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:08,037
-Really?
-Try it.

1205
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:13,167
[in Taglish] Whatever.
I will try to solve my own problems.

1206
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:17,422
[in Taglish] I have to go now.
I must keep Yumi company in the ER.

1207
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,049
Go then.

1208
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,551
OK.

1209
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,975
Mama Mary?

1210
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:38,735
With so many people praying to you,
maybe you can't hear me.

1211
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:42,405
You probably won't recognize me either.

1212
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,368
[Trisha]
Barbs.

1213
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:55,919
-Hey.
-Goodness!

1214
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,379
[gasping]

1215
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:03,134
[in Taglish] Mother? Mama Mary? I'm sorry!
Sorry, you took me by surprise!

1216
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:05,428
I shouldn't doubt you.

1217
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,099
Since you called me by name,
that means you recognize me.

1218
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:12,977
-[Trisha] Idiot!
-[in English] Yes, Mother.

1219
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:16,105
Mother Mary, I really am an idiot.

1220
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:20,026
[in Taglish] My goodness, I'm sorry.
I'll always pray and go to church.

1221
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,612
[in Taglish]
I will be faithful to you.

1222
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:25,323
[Trisha]
You fool! This is Trisha.

1223
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:32,914
[gasping]

1224
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:36,209
Trisha, you bitch!

1225
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:39,837
I nearly had a heart attack.
What are you wearing?

1226
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,633
[in Taglish] Is Mama Mary now part
of your makeup transformation?

1227
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:46,386
This is just for practice,
I haven't perfected it.

1228
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,931
Are you sure that Mama Mary
is OK with that?

1229
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:52,141
Well, even when I was still alive,

1230
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,936
[in Taglish]
I only impersonated those that I idolized.

1231
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,980
[in Taglish]
I imitate those that I really love.

1232
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:59,732
[in Taglish]
I'm sure Mama Mary is fine with it.

1233
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:04,654
You're lucky, Trish.
You're very happy where you are.

1234
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:08,157
Look at me. I envy you.

1235
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,868
And I really miss you.

1236
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,705
You want me to ask the Lord to take you?
That's easy!

1237
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,915
[in Swardspeak]
I don't want that. I still want to live.

1238
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:19,085
There you go. So you still want to live.

1239
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:23,256
I hope you also realize
it's wonderful to be alive.

1240
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,092
-Do you get it?
-What?

1241
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,094
Enough with the drama.

1242
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,683
You know what? I'm not asking for much.

1243
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:38,187
I want to become a real woman
but there are so many problems

1244
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,273
-and obstacles.
-[Trish] Idiot.

1245
01:28:40,356 --> 01:28:43,693
What you're asking for isn't simple.
You were born a man.

1246
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,987
[in English]
Fine. Let me rephrase.

1247
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:49,032
I just want a quiet life.

1248
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,868
Idiot. There's no such thing
as a quiet life.

1249
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:54,912
[in Taglish] If your life is quiet,
then you are probably dead.

1250
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,457
-[in English] Fine. Let me rephrase again.
-All right.

1251
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:03,546
[in Taglish]
All I want is to be happy.

1252
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:08,176
[in English]
Wow. Big word. Happy.

1253
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:10,428
[in Taglish]
You have two boyfriends.

1254
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,930
You even have a bonus girl.
And you're still not happy?

1255
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,557
Do you want me to punch you?

1256
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,936
You know, Barbs,
it's not becoming a woman,

1257
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,981
it's not a quiet life,

1258
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,067
[in Taglish]
it's not even to be happy.

1259
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:29,447
The thing you want is to be miserable.
That's the truth.

1260
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:34,243
Even if you get
everything you ever wanted,

1261
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:38,539
[in Taglish] you think that you
don't deserve happiness.

1262
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,505
Speechless?

1263
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:50,343
[in Taglish]
We get so mad at those who judge us,

1264
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:55,640
but the truth is,
we always judge ourselves.

1265
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,227
[in Taglish] Even when we're happy,
we judge ourselves.

1266
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:03,314
So please! Stop being so dramatic.

1267
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,567
Trish...

1268
01:30:09,028 --> 01:30:12,573
[in Taglish] Does Mama Mary have
a special message for me?

1269
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:16,410
What's with the impromptu appearances?

1270
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,830
Do you want to stop me
from doing what I want to do?

1271
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,709
Trisha...

1272
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:29,549
Why did you leave me?

1273
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,886
If you were still around,
my life wouldn't be such a mess.

1274
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,430
I would probably be happier.

1275
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:38,432
[gasps]

1276
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,560
[in Taglish]
I told you to stop being dramatic!

1277
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,938
[in English]
Sorry!

1278
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,026
A couple of slaps
to make sure you don't forget.

1279
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:53,614
You can't hit me back. I'm Mama Mary.

1280
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,953
-[equipment beeping]
-[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

1281
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:02,498
[in Taglish] So many lab tests,
and all I have is gas.

1282
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,083
Like I said, you were overreacting!

1283
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,835
Let's go.

1284
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,134
Are you OK?
You look like you just saw a ghost.

1285
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:14,051
Shall we go?

1286
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,057
I saw a virgin.

1287
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:37,408
What are you waiting for? Let's sleep now.

1288
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:41,454
I'm sorry we can't all fit in my bed.
Just bear with this for now.

1289
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,291
The two of them are here every night?

1290
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:48,711
Every night, every day.
And it's not just the two of them.

1291
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:51,839
There's also me and you.
The four of us will all be together.

1292
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:55,009
[chuckles]
Shit! It's as if you have a harem.

1293
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,803
What are you going to do, Barbs?

1294
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,057
We are going to sleep.
That's what we're going to do.

1295
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:05,102
As for what we are going to do afterwards,
I don't have a clue.

1296
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,312
That's it.

1297
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,690
I'm just thankful that you're all here
sleeping beside me.

1298
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,651
And even if you weren't,
I'd still be grateful.

1299
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:15,988
If I wake up with all of you
still beside me, I'm going to rejoice!

1300
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:21,035
[in English]
Good night!

1301
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:43,349
Hey. Move.

1302
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:46,644
[gentle piano music]

1303
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:20,177
Stop fighting. Let's go to sleep.
