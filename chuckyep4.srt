- Charles Lee Ray, the famous
serial killer from Hackensack.

659
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,587
- Who?

660
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:58,460
- Wow. Do you read anything
other than "Teen Vogue"?

661
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:03,334
Well, anyways, Charles Lee Ray
was a serial killer

662
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,770
who died in the '80s.

663
00:36:04,814 --> 00:36:07,512
I mean, He terrorized Chicago
for years. Prolific.

664
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,122
They call him
the Lakeshore Strangler,

665
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,646
but he never really
strangled anyone.

666
00:36:10,689 --> 00:36:12,387
I mean, he was more of, like,
a mangler or a butcher--

legend about Charles Lee Ray.

672
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:27,532
It's crazy, but who knows?
Maybe not.

673
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,708
It's about a Good Guy doll.

674

- Like Chucky.
- Exactly.

675
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,756
You see, Charles Lee Ray
was shot and killed

676
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,410
in a toy store in Chicago,

677
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:38,239
but supposedly,
right before he died,

678
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,284
he transferred his soul
to a Good Guy doll,

679
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:43,374
and that doll is still
out there killing, supposedly.

680
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:48,118
- It's not a legend.

This must be very hard.

What do you know
about Oliver's death?

to just stop bullying you?

I swear.
