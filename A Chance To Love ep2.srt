1
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,060
I don't care If something happens to me

2
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
As long as you're here with me

3
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,320
But you're not here with me now

4
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,680
Dude

5
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,560
I need help

6
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,280
Right now

7
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,570
That's good, everyone!

8
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,530
That's right. Keep running

9
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,470
If you guys keep practicing like this

10
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,730
The victory will be ours this year

11
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,610
Over there! Don't be lazy

12
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,670
Why did you stop practicing?

13
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,750
What are you guys laughing at?

14
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:19,950
Techno

15
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,370
huh?

16
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,150
Behind you

17
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,010
Behind me?

18
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,090
Techno

19
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,390
Are you thirsty?

20
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,970
I'll bring it for you

21
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,950
Little monkey

22
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,530
Let me kick your ass!

23
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,130
Don't run!

24
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,450
Catch me if you can

25
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,190
You'll die if I can catch you, little monkey!

26
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,670
Why our captain is so slow?

27
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
Why are you running like that?

28
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,130
I'm so tired

29
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,470
I've been practicing for a while already

30
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,190
It's raining too!

31
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,450
Stop complaining

32
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,010
If you want to be the first-choice lineup, you have to do this

33
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,630
Are you sure that you're not taking revenge on me?

34
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,850
I'm sure you won't do that

35
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,050
A respectful captain like you

36
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,950
Nahhh

37
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,150
I just...

38
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,790
I just want to help you

39
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,090
One-on-one

40
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,990
But I'm tired

41
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,630
Where's Ae?

42
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,830
He didn't come to practice many times already

43
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,850
I have no clue

44
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,810
Pond told me that he's not doing well

45
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,170
Why don't you go talk to him?

46
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,010
You're close to him, right?

47
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,270
Who would dare to do that?

48
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,530
He's scary

49
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,450
Even Pond wouldn't dare to approach him

50
00:07:59,410 --> 00:07:59,970
Techno

51
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,310
Hm?

52
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,450
Why being in love makes you sad?

53
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,870
Why are you asking me?

54
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,790
Look at Ae

55
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,010
After he broke up with Pete, he started to drink and smoke

56
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,670
He completely changed

57
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,750
Back then he took care of himself so well

58
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,930
Whatever

59
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,390
I won't fall in love

60
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,630
You want to poo?

61
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,070
Huh?

62
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,050
It's nothing

63
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,790
I will go pack up stuff first

64
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,270
Techno!

65
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,850
You said you will buy me food

66
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,770
Nope

67
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,570
I'm hungry

68
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,930
Hungry!

69
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,790
I want to eat!

70
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,650
I'm hungry!

71
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,230
I have no energy!

72
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,760
Right now

73
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,200
I don't want to talk to you, Kla

74
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,110
How can I tell you that on that day...

75
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,390
It felt so good

76
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,890
Why do I feel this way?

77
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,570
Techno

78
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,970
You said that after practice you would treat me to dinner

79
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,350
Where the hell is he now?

80
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,650
I'm so hungry. I don't have any energy left

81
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,110
Am I going to die?

82
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:01,670
That's right!

83
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,170
Yes! I survive!

84
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,890
You're in the way

85
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,710
You again?

86
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,310
I'm just stating the fact

87
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:31,890
No!

88
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,850
I can stand anywhere I want

89
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,270
I can eat what I want

90
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,870
Also

91
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,270
This car

92
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,450
Not yours right?

93
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,250
Oh it's yours

94
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,450
Yes

95
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,810
And you're making it dirty

96
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,450
Why do you have to say that I'm dirty?

97
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,330
I'm not dirty

98
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,610
I might forget to take a shower and brush my teeth sometimes

99
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,440
I might sweat a lot because I was running

100
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,930
But my hair still smell good

101
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,710
Do you want to smell?

102
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,270
Try to smell it

103
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,190
Disgusting

104
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,430
Disgusting

105
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,430
Disgusting right?

106
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,030
Now your car is dirty like me

107
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,230
How's that?

108
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,450
You're also dirty

109
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,710
Same as your car

110
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,970
Ew disgusting!

111
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,290
You're dirty

112
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,930
Why are you smiling?

113
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,010
Throw it away for me

114
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,830
Do it yourself!

115
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,090
I don't want someone who just stood next to my car

116
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,770
To choke to death

117
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,950
You can die somewhere else

118
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,450
Someone like me

119
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,630
Won't die...

120
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,470
I don't want to take it

121
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,850
But my parents teach me not to waste anything

122
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,150
What a weirdo

123
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,570
Dude

124
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,830
Slow down

125
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,750
You'll die

126
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,710
Leave me alone

127
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,690
I'm just worried

128
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,910
Pond!

129
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,600
Right here

130
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,610
Okay

131
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,270
He looks really bad

132
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,390
How did you find him?

133
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,370
I called him so many times but he turned off his phone

134
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,730
I'm here with my high school friends

135
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,410
I was looking around and saw someone who looks familiar

136
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,090
It turned out to be him

137
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:20,850
Dude

138
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,210
I have no idea what's going on between them

139
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,130
But

140
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,110
Pete won't come and check on him?

141
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,130
They used to love each other so much

142
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,230
It's not what you think

143
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,310
Shut up!

144
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,770
The reason that we broke up is not because we didn't love each other

145
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,210
Do you understand that?

146
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,810
Do you?

147
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,710
Do you understand?

148
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,130
He never leaves me

149
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,690
Ae

150
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,250
Calm down

151
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,290
Do you understand that I love him?

152
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,050
I know

153
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,670
Bow didn't blame Pete

154
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,530
She just didn't know what happened between you two

155
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,070
Don't put it on her

156
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,310
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it

157
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,010
I don't understand

158
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,350
Who do you think is the hottest guy this year?

159
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,710
Definitely Pete!

160
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,930
Sadly

161
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,890
He moves to study abroad

162
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,050
I don't agree with you

163
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,150
It must be Tin

164
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,770
Nah, he is so arrogant

165
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,090
But he is perfect

166
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,750
Who is he?

167
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,910
You don't know him?

168
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,230
Oh I see, you didn't study with him and Pete last semester

169
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,550
I'm not surprised that you don't know them

170
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,250
Do I need to know them?

171
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,630
Of course!

172
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,070
Handsome, rich, and smart

173
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,810
Our faculty has a lot of good looking people

174
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,470
But Tin is exceptional

175
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,070
Do you know Methanan?

176
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,550
The powerful real estate company in Thailand

177
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,730
If you don't know him maybe you heard of Tun Methanan before

178
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,940
He is so smart that he was featured in a business magazine

179
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,530
He is handsome

180
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,850
Super rich

181
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,510
Good Family

182
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,730
Sadly

183
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,110
He is not single

184
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,560
That guy is Tin?

185
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,870
That's right

186
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,190
Tin, the youngest son of Medthanan

187
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,930
The perfect one from our faculty

188
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,130
He is handsome, rich, and smart

189
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,130
He comes from a good family

190
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,330
He is single and never has eyes on anyone

191
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,790
You said single right?

192
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,370
Hey girl

193
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,070
He is very arrogant

194
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,730
You never know if you never try

195
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,090
Hello Job, where are you?

196
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,710
I'm in front of the international college building

197
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,610
What are you doing there?

198
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,410
What?

199
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,630
You invited me here for lunch

200
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,390
You said the food is good, lots of cute girls and the price is cheap

201
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,210
How can you say that?

202
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,550
Do you know?

203
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,010
I didn't have class this morning so I woke up late

204
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,970
I woke up late so my mom didn't prepare breakfast for me

205
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,210
Nothing is in my stomach yet

206
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,670
Do you think our faculty is near international college building?

207
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,930
I have no energy to walk

208
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,510
I'm gonna die If I keep walking

209
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,090
Job!

210
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,890
Such a bad friend!

211
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,130
I'm gonna die

212
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,550
Should I eat at international college building?

213
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,130
But I don't wanna see him

214
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,610
What should I do?

215
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,330
Tin

216
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,890
Tin

217
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,090
Tin

218
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,890
Tin

219
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,370
Tin

220
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,710
Why are you in such a hurry?

221
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,170
What do you want?

222
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,970
I need a partner to do the report

223
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,270
You must see that all of our friends already have their partners

224
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,810
So I'm left alone

225
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,910
Could you be my partner?

226
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,190
Find someone else

227
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,310
Hold on, Tin

228
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,190
You don't have partner as well right?

229
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,290
Let's work together

230
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,490
I promise that I will help you with the report

231
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,830
I told you already

232
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,090
Find someone else

233
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,970
I know that you get annoyed easily

234
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,030
But don't you feel sorry for me?

235
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,910
Or do you think that I approach you because other reason?

236
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,750
I'm here just...

237
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,410
to find a partner

238
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,310
What's your name?

239
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,050
I'm Ongfong

240
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,830
You can call me Fong

241
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,750
By the way

242
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,810
You are the brother of Tun Medthanan right?

243
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,610
You don't want my number anymore?

244
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,070
How do you know my brother?

245
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,030
Everyone knows

246
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,430
Let me tell you something

247
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,970
Sure. What is it?

248
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,590
Medthanan sons

249
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,610
Don't like a girl like you

250
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,690
Tin

251
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,710
Here you are

252
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,850
I look for you every where

253
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,850
I'm starving. I'm going to die soon

254
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,890
Are you done?

255
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,330
Let's go. I'm hungry

256
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,970
Hurry!

257
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,650
Almost

258
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,550
Almost what?

259
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,730
Will you let go of my hands?

260
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,770
I don't want to hold your hands

261
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,130
You should thank me

262
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,710
For helping you in time

263
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,310
Wait!

264
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,170
Don't act like my hands are disgusting

265
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,270
My hands are clean

266
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,270
Wait...

267
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,830
Did I wash my hands after I went to the toilet this morning?

268
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,510
What about you?

269
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,890
What were you trying to do just then?

270
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,610
It should be me who ask that question

271
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,280
Why did you interfere?

272
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,370
You were about to insult the girl, right?

273
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,310
I know what you're going to say before you even open your mouth

274
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,250
How could you do that to her?

275
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,650
She is so pretty

276
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,950
Pretty?

277
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,350
She's so pretty and cute

278
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,430
Did you even use your eyes to look?

279
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,650
A girl like that?

280
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,850
You are so...

281
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,790
Do you remember my surname now?

282
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,450
I forgot

283
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:27,850
I cannot remember

284
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,730
My brain's memory is short

285
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,210
Why?

286
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,790
You are going to call me stupid again?

287
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,250
At least you are better than her

288
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,150
What's wrong with you?

289
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,110
Whatever. At least I did some good deed today

290
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,310
I'm off

291
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:47,510
Wait

292
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,090
What now?

293
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,070
You said you're going to have lunch with me

294
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,010
I didn't mean it. I'm not hungry

295
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,900
You can finish all this?

296
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,410
Just wait and see

297
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,350
You're going to pay for me?

298
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,230
I told you that already

299
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,770
You are so...

300
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,410
Every single word you say

301
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,950
Why does it seem so hard to come out?

302
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,350
You can say more than just a few words

303
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,710
You said you helped me

304
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,690
Even though I don't think it's helping much

305
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,210
But I don't want to owe anyone

306
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,410
I did help you

307
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,850
It doesn't matter how rude you are

308
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,390
You have no rights to yell at girls

309
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,150
Other people will say that you are a pussy

310
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,790
I helped you. You should be grateful

311
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,850
A girl like that

312
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,410
Deserves it

313
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

314
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,510
Dirty

315
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,490
You insult me again

316
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,450
But you're cuter than those girls

317
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,280
So dirty

318
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,720
Throw it away for me

319
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,710
Did he just insult me or compliment me?

320
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,790
Dirty but cute

321
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,270
Did he compliment or insult?

322
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,850
What's wrong?

323
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,650
Lemon

324
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,030
Can I ask you something?

325
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,070
Nope

326
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,990
You like to ask nonsense questions

327
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,510
I should spend my time to read something that is more useful

328
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,710
What?

329
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,070
Lemon

330
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,670
If someone says that you're dirty

331
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,270
It's an insult right?

332
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,710
Yes...Maybe...

333
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,210
What about...

334
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,410
Someone says you're cute. It's a compliment, right?

335
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:47,830
Yes

336
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,210
What if a person says

337
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,250
You're dirty but cute. What does that mean?

338
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,990
He probably...

339
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,610
Compliments and insults at the same time

340
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,210
I have a smart sister

341
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,150
But she is useless

342
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,270
Who will be stupid like you?

343
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,430
I don't know anymore

344
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,610
You're so annoying

345
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,850
I won't think about it anymore

346
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,330
What's wrong with him?

347
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,730
I can't figure it out

348
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,350
I don't understand

349
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,330
Can!

350
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,810
I can't figure it out. I've got a headache

351
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,070
You're so annoying

352
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,530
That hurts!

353
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,500
I...

354
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,860
I have a present for you

355
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,500
I told you not to buy me anything

356
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,700
I didn't buy it

357
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,760
I made it by myself

358
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,760
I don't know if you will like it or not

359
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,920
Ae

360
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,160
Thank you

361
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,680
I will take a good care of you

362
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,780
Pete

363
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,150
This flavor is really spicy

364
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,590
I love it

365
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,670
I like this flavor too

366
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,470
Let me have some

367
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,450
Why are you still eating here? You said you're going to see Ae

368
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,430
I did?

369
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,170
You completely forgets about him

370
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,650
Give it to me, I'll finish it

371
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,910
I want to redeem the item in the game

372
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,370
It's mine!

373
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,470
Enough, I'll keep it

374
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,430
Why don't your share it with your friends?

375
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,930
Aren't you in a hurry to go to class?

376
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,090
I'll play the game first

377
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,010
We should go now

378
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,450
It's so spicy

379
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:49,910
See you later

380
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,810
Pond!

381
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,710
The snacks

382
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,830
Nah, I won't give you

383
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,770
Die!

384
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,650
Eh...

385
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,910
What's your name again?

386
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,750
You've been sitting here for a while but you still don't know my name?

387
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,390
It's Mai

388
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,630
I think that I'm about to get hit by Mai

389
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,670
Don't you have class?

390
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,080
Just leave

391
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,410
Actually, I don't but...

392
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,070
Pond!

393
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,350
I think I have a class now

394
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,210
Bye bye Mai

395
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,870
How can you leave me with him?

396
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,670
Techno

397
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,550
This is my friend

398
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,550
He wants to join the team

399
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,870
Hello Champ. Hello Techno

400
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,070
Why do you want to join us?

401
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,850
Do you want a perfect answer or a real answer?

402
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,630
Perfect one first

403
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,030
Because football is the sport that I love since I was young

404
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,390
I think that

405
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,850
Becoming a part of the team

406
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,990
Is an honor

407
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,350
And the real one?

408
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,790
All the girls will like me

409
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,930
Dude

410
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,250
Why did you answer like that?

411
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,050
You want to join the team because you want us to become the champion

412
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,050
How can you answer like that? Techno won't let you in

413
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,630
Okay

414
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,350
You're in

415
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,660
Techno...

416
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,470
Why not?

417
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,530
He's sincere

418
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,550
What the hell?

419
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,190
That's right. My answer is very sincere

420
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,790
Techno, you're kind to everyone

421
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,030
You're only mean to me

422
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,750
You said I'm mean, right?

423
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,030
Go buy water

424
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,130
But for everyone too

425
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,030
And you, new kid

426
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,630
Let me test your skill first

427
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,750
Yes sir

428
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,570
Go buy water

429
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,390
By myself?

430
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,270
That's right

431
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:46,870
Go

432
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,850
Are you going or not?

433
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,390
Fine. I'll go

434
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,080
I will tell everyone that you're so mean

435
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:53,910
How dare you?

436
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,670
Techno

437
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,410
He uses me too much

438
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,910
I will tell Type

439
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,850
What kind of nonsense party that I have to go?

440
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,390
If you want your favorite son to go

441
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,010
Then that person is not me

442
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,290
I won't go

443
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,370
Don't call me

444
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,220
Mom, you're annoying

445
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:23,750
Damn you, Tin!

446
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,410
How can you talk to your mom like that?

447
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,390
I'm talking to you

448
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,970
Stop acting like I'm nothing to you

449
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,650
Good that you know that

450
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,930
Tin

451
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,490
What's wrong with you?

452
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,630
I thought you were good guy

453
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,050
And you behave like this again

454
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,230
I don't know who you are

455
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,930
But yelling at your mom like that is sinful

456
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,570
You must say sorry to her now

457
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,410
Are you done?

458
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,330
No

459
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,870
Until you say sorry

460
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,170
I'm not going to say that to her

461
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,750
And you should stop messing with me

462
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,510
You're annoying

463
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,050
Fine!

464
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:20,910
I forget

465
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,470
That you're the unloved child

466
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,750
What did you just say?

467
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,070
I said..

468
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,310
You are...

469
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,330
The unloved child

470
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,670
Shut your mouth!
