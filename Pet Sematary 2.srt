1
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,541
= cut!

2
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,088
Thank you very much, Renee.

3
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,178
I'm sorry, he grabbed me.

4
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,103
I'm sorry, he keeps missing my arms.

5
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,312
Frank, why don't we give this up?

6
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,476
- Frank!
- We're never gonna get it.

7
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,974
I can't see a damn thing down there.

8
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,100
I'm working blind!

9
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,317
Ok.

10
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,321
Sorry, Renee.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,605
= tell me the truth.

12
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,949
You get off on seeing
me suffer, don't you?

13
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,203
Ok.

14
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,072
Water everywhere.

15
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,166
Can I get a cigarette?

16
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,501
Guys, we've gotta sort this out.

17
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,370
You think you can hit your Mark this time?

18
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,373
Look frank, it's not a
matter of hitting the Mark.

19
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,045
There's not a damn
thing down there to see.

20
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,963
Ok, look, but I need...

21
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,765
= Jeff.

22
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,262
I'm right here, mom.

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,844
Hey!

24
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,391
How long have you been here?

25
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,105
Couple of minutes.

26
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,145
How was your weekend with your father?

27
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,767
Good.

28
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,145
He wants to come down
to the set for dinner,

29
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,156
if it's all right.

30
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,909
Ti mean...

31
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,827
What I'm really tryin'
to say is he misses you.

32
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,447
Dinner would be great.

33
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,043
I just don't want you
gettin' your hopes up, ok?

34
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,162
We're tryin' to work things out, but...

35
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,663
I know, mom.

36
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,040
Ok, people, quiet.

37
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,712
Final touches, now's the time.

38
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,881
= t think it's showtime.

39
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,434
= Jeff?

40
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,936
I love you.

41
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,319
Roll, please.

42
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,530
A camera rolling.

43
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,615
Castle of
terror, scene 13, take 33.

44
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,538
Ok.

45
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,203
Action, Renee.

46
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:43,818
Cut.

47
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,690
For Christ's sake, cut!

48
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,694
= there's a dead short!

49
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,571
We've lost the neutral!

50
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,216
Mom!

51
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,604
Mom!

52
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,066
Mom!

53
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,565
I know this is hard for you,

54
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,938
but I think you made the right decision.

55
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,190
He was a very old dog.

56
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,780
He had a good life.

57
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,120
Dr. Matthews,
your son is on line one.

58
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,408
He says it's an emergency.

59
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,541
Can you take...

60
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,546
Excuse me.

61
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,879
Jeff, what's goin' on?

62
00:05:55,981 --> 00:06:00,395
I am the resurrection and
the life, sayeth the lord.

63
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,275
She who believeth in me,

64
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,405
though she were dead, yet she shall live.

65
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,821
Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die.

66
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,744
I know my redeemer liveth,

67
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:24,714
and that he shall stand until
the latter day upon the earth.

68
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,922
Friends, let us bow our
heads in silent prayer.

69
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,861
Friends, our service is now concluded.

70
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:00,878
Here we go.

71
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,542
Come on, folks, keep it back.

72
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,664
Show a little respect, now.

73
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,540
Show a little respect!

74
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,837
Keep it back here.

75
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,675
Excuse me.

76
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,509
Ti know it's a difficult time...

77
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,253
Obviously you boys didn't hear me.

78
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,388
Show a little respect.

79
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,018
You probably don't remember me, chase.

80
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,478
I'm Gus Gilbert, town sheriff.

81
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,691
I remember you.

82
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,102
I hear you're movin'
into the summer house.

83
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,728
Do you plan on stayin' full time?

84
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,949
Just wanted to get my son Jeff outta la.

85
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,329
Start things over.

86
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,661
Yeah, deepest regrets.

87
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,875
Thank you.

88
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,153
We got six of these
big wardrobe boxes here.

89
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,120
You sure you want them all in the attic?

90
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,871
Jeff, what do you say we
give the clothes to goodwill?

91
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,416
We'll keep the rest, just the clothes.

92
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,164
= you're the one who wanted to move.

93
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,052
= all the Renee boxes in the attic.

94
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,056
All right.

95
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,196
Hi.

96
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,323
I'm Marjorie hargrove,
your new housekeeper.

97
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,326
Hi.

98
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,244
Is something wrong?

99
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,290
No, sorry, you just look different

100
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,413
than you sounded on the phone.

101
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,424
Please, come in.

102
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,503
I'm real excited to be
working for you, Mr. Matthews.

103
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, we're glad to have you, Marjorie.

104
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,016
This is my son, Jeff, and
you can call me chase.

105
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,605
You know, I adored Mrs. hallow.

106
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,069
That one goes
up here in the attic.

107
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,029
Say what John? = look out!

108
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,701
I'll get that.

109
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,746
This is gorgeous.

110
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,413
This is what she wore
at the emmys, isn't it?

111
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,535
Hey!

112
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,161
Don't touch her stuff.

113
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,539
It made her crazy when
people touched her stuff.

114
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,292
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,679
= it's ok.

116
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,596
Hey wait up, I'm comin' with.

117
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,147
That's great.

118
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,482
I could sure use your help.

119
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,066
Let's go, come on.

120
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,678
= this isn't too bad.

121
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,929
It's pretty bad.

122
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,597
God, how long ago did this guy retire?

123
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,848
It's been a few years.

124
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:53,986
A few?

125
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,859
What's down there?

126
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,698
= t think the kennels are in the back.

127
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,529
What happened?

128
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,621
Are you all right?

129
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,706
Yeah.

130
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm all right.

131
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,289
I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.

132
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,668
Oh great.

133
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,916
So, now I've opened up an orphanage, too?

134
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,887
= well...

135
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,216
If it's ok, I'd like to take one.

136
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,970
All right, I'll tell you what.

137
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:18,318
You clean up these old
kennels and she's yours.

138
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,321
All right.

139
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,407
Thanks, dad.

140
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:35,835
Come on, kitties.

141
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
No, zowie!

142
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,935
Zowie, come back.

143
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,897
Zowiel!

144
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

145
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,747
Drew, you
get a handle on that dog!

146
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,911
Sorry, he gets kinda hyper.

147
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,580
That's all right.

148
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,997
Thought it was lunch.

149
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:18,836
How are you, chase?

150
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,670
You met my boy?

151
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,504
= no.

152
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,839
Drew, where are your manners?

153
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,422
He's a cool-lookin' dog.

154
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,670
What's his name?

155
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,921
Zowie.

156
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,297
Zowie?

157
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,516
What happened there, zowie?

158
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,510
Damn dog stuck his
nose in on my rabbits.

159
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,136
They ganged up on him.

160
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,355
I swear that dog is
dumber than lobster bait.

161
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,521
Is he gonna be ok?

162
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,109
I'm not really set up yet,

163
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,729
but I'll take a quick look.

164
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,571
Come on, zowie.

165
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,405
It's ok, boy.

166
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,409
Up on the table.

167
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,235
Good boy.

168
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,203
Let me look at you here.

169
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,037
Let's see,

170
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,703
when I was younger, 1
thought cats were the girls

171
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,575
and dogs were boys.

172
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,248
Yeah, well, there's three more girls

173
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,496
where that one came
from lookin' for homes.

174
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,009
= not our home.

175
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,636
Facial lacerations, they'll
heal up pretty quickly.

176
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,049
I'll give you some
antibiotic ointment for that.

177
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,221
Drew, you listenin'?

178
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,434
It's your dog.

179
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,059
He has corneal abrasions,

180
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,558
scratches on the surface of his right eye.

181
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,979
These eye drops are gonna help,

182
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,477
but it's still gonna take some time,

183
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,322
so try to keep him away
from those rabbits, huh?

184
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,493
= thanks.

185

Can I hold her?

I would, but there
was a little accident.

248
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,514
She was trying to get away,

249
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,311
and her head got caught in the spokes.

250
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,183
Yeah, it was pretty gross.

251
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,149
What's left of her is back there

252
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,360
in the pet sematary.

253
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,692
You heard about the creed murders yet?

254
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,191
You heard about the
place where the dead rise?

255
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,317
Just back there, Jeff.

256
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,371
Just down that path.

257
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,786
Come on, Clyde, just
tell him where the cat is.

258
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,580
= t told him where the cat is.

You gonna sic big bad old Gus on me?

262
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,050
What do you think, Jeff?

263
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,924
Maybe you could go dig up your old lady,

264
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,935
bury her back there.

265
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,395
And maybe if you pray real hard,

266
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,514
maybe she'll come back.
Yeah, right.

267
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,554
- Punk.
- You showed him good.

268
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,892
Asshole.

269
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,519
This way, fat boy.

270
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,246
There you go.

271
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,390
I've never seen anybody
punch Clyde before.

272
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,641
He pissed me off.

273
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,815
Sorry about your mom.

274
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,030
She sure was beautiful.

275
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,531
You never really think
your parents are gonna die.

276
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,532
= sometimes I wish Gus would die.

277
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,249
You shouldn't say
that about your parents,

278
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,459
not even your dad.

279
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,462
Stepdad.

280
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,795
Gus is my stepdad.

281
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,093
So...

282
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,259
What was all that stuff about
people coming back to life?

283
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,722
Nothing.

284
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,341
It's just an old ghost story.

285
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,098
Hey, let's get outta here.

286
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,231
I agree.

287
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,468
There you go.

288
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,858

= it sucked.

293
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,171
The first day of school
is always the hardest.

294
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,666
You're not my mother.

295
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,346
= Jeff.

296
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,558
Jeff!

297
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,469
Live action resumes

civic center this Friday...

299
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:54,232
Drew, I don't remember
invitin' zowie in for dinner.

300
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,983
Just until he heals up?

301
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,360
= don't start with me.

302
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,074
Hi, beautiful.

303
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,807

Hi.

305
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,413
Gus.

306
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,915
Stop it.

307
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,768
= you're breakin' the law.

308
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,688
Turn it off.

309
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,607
Your mother spent the last hour cookin'.

310
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,942
Now you stop being a little jerk

311
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,401
and show her some appreciation.

312
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,191
Really, Gus, it doesn't bother me.

313
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,417
Atta boy.

314
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,005
There you go.

315
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,668
Not that much appreciation.

316
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,551
I thought we were gonna tone
down on your flabby ass.

317
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,673
Hey.

318
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,266
I'm so sorry I'm not the stud you are.

319
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:47,932
Ok.

320
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,940
Knock it off, guys.

321
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,527
You better watch your
mouth there, buddy.

322
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,864
I'll take that hey and shove
it right back down your throat.

323
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,867
You understand?

324

You all right?

329
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,603
Do you think mom and you
would've gotten back together?

330
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,877
= t think so.

331
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,709

What have you done?

343
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,943
Come on Amanda, stop

Then why are we here?

369
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,995
There's a better place.

370
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,918
It's back there somewhere,
through the bog.

371
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,636
Come on.

372
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,697
It's supposed to be up there.

373
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,164
What is?

374
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,954
The old Indian burial ground.

375
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,203
Drew, come on, it's
an old bullshit story.

376
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,170
You said so yourself.

377
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,460
= but what if it's not bullshit?

378
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:13,428
If I bury zowie there, and
it works, he'll come back.

379
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,720
Alive.

380
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,759
Drew, look.

381
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,758
I know your dog died, but get a grip, man!

382
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,975
You're freaking me out!

383
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,892
If there's even one chance
in a million it'd work,

384
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,480
wouldn't you just wanna try?

385
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,967
Look, let's just get this over with, ok?

386
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,398
If this doesn't work,

387
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,269
you can't ever tell anyone I did this, ok?

388
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,316
You've gotta promise.

389
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,616
Well, you need any help?

390
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,618
You have to bury your own.

391
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,363
That's the way the Indians did it.

392
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,824
It's like a rule.

393
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,867
I've never had anyone die before.

394
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,251
But I guess you get over it.

395
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,832
I mean, eventually.

396
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,222
= no.

397
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,922
No, you never get over it.

398
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,482
Look, maybe we should get outta here.

399
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,616
Yeah.

400
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,330
So long, zowie.

401
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,006
Wanna get in?

402
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,546
Your mama's worried sick about you.

403
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,546
Take off in the middle of the night,

404
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,422
you don't show up for school.

405
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,390
What are you tryin' to prove?

406
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,430
I'm not trying to prove anything.

407
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,894
I was burying my dog.

408
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,816
Life is full of lessons, buddy.

409
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,275
No one's above 'em.

410
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,439
Not you, not me.

411
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,983
Now get in the car.

412
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,461
Zowie?

413
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,018
Drew!

414
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,388
Drew, you unlock this door right now.

415
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,437
- Unlock it, drew.
- What did I do now?

416
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,527
Open this door, drew Gilbert.

417
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,816
Where do you come off lyin' like that?

418
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,488
“I'm burying my dog.”

419
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,157
You think a lie like that's
never gonna catch up to you?

420
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,575
Zowie...

421
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,852
You say your goodbyes, mister.

422
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,972
Zowie's goin' outside,
and you are grounded.

423
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,268
That's the new law, buddy.

424
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,437
Drew.

425
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,905
Honey, I'm gonna call the vet.

426
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,033
Hey, drew.

427
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,785
Jeff, why don't you give him a hand, huh?

428
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:25,924
Ok.

429
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,385
Hey, zowie.

430
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,094
Let's go up here, pal.

431
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,213
There you go.

432
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,225
Lie down, lie down.

433
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,134
There you go, boy, there you go.

434
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,138
How'd it happen?

435
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,390
Some psycho got trigger-happy.

436
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,401
All right, I'm gonna
give him a local anesthetic

437
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,615
so I can clean up the wound.

438
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,577
I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.

439
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,242
Can you keep him at your
place until he gets better?

440
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,332
Yeah, sure.

441
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,339
= come on.

442
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,382
= listen.

443
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,097
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.

444
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,807
He was dead.

445
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,096
You know he was.

446
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,175
Jeff...

447
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,014
I'm waiting for you!

448
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,520
= no!

449
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,798
Is he gonna be ok?

450
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,801
= t don't know.

451
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,756
It's been three days.

452
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,005
His immune system
should've responded by now.

453
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,933
Shh, it's ok.

454
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,723
I'm not gettin' a heartbeat.

455
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,311
He must be so weak it's
just not registering.

456
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,653
Jeff, let's take some blood.

457
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,079
Yeah, there you go.

458
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,248
Good boy.

459
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,102
Listen, why doesn't he have a heartbeat?

460
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,558
Maybe it takes a while.

461
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,850
Happy Halloween, Dr. Matthews.

462
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,854
Guys, take it easy.

463
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,356
- Evening, Gus.
- Evening, Ralph.

464
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,729
These your girls? = sure are.

465
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,732
- Trick or treat.
- Happy Halloween!

466
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:17,573
Behave yourself.

467
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,407
Have a good night.

468
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,411
Come on, girls. - Bye.

469
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,289
Ok, wait.

470
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:28,251
No, just hold still.

471
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,119
Hold still, hold still.

472
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,544
Just make sure you're home by 10.

473
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,297
If Gus finds out I let you go...

474
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,388
= t will drink his blood!

475
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,183
Don't worry, mom, I'll be home.

476
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,499
Where is everybody?

477
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,294
Jeff, honey, mommy's here.

478
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,389
= look at this.

479
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,304
Junior here practically shit his pants.

480
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,056
- Check his shorts.
- Oh, no.

481
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,558
Mommy's here, Jeff.

482
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,782
You gonna run home to daddy now?

483
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,120
= fuck off.

484
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,715
- What a blast.
- You see the look his face?

485
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,689
You're home early.

486
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,812
= just ran outta smokes.

487
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,665
Lucky Mel!

488
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,794
Where's the boy?

489
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,829
= in his room.

490
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,762
Drew?

491
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,719
Goddammit, Amanda.

492
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,103
You want me to be father to that boy,

493
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,438
and every time I lay down the law,

494
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,522
you let him break it.

495
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,941
Now, where is he?

496
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,775
=-t don't know...

497
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,779
Where is your son?

498
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,444
- Pet sematary.
- What?

499
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,324
Pet sematary.

500
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,585
Yeah.

501
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,879
That old Louis was one sick puppy.

502
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,172
Diggin' up little Gage.

503
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,881
Maggots pourin' out of
the dead kid's eyes.

504
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,433
Ellie creed was the only one that lived.

505
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,889
Then one night she freaks out.

506
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,601
Hacks up the grandparents with an axe.

507
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,362
Police found her lickin'
the brains off the blade.

508
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,943
Threw her in the psycho ward.

509
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,534
All she could say were two words.

510
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,120
Pet sematary.

511
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,417
Here's the best part.

512
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,080
Two nights ago she escapes.

513
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,251
Man, I hope she doesn't show up here.

514
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,626
Shit, we wouldn't even recognize her.

515
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,298
Not if she was wearin' a costume.

516
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,088
She could be one of us.

517
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,893
Oh, my god!

518
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:14,896
- What?
- What?

519
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,941
= shit.

520
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:21,980
It's drew's dad.

521
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,603
It's Gus.

522
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,065
He's gonna kick my ass.

523
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,863
You boys better not be drinkin'.

524
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:36,491
Drew, get your ass out
here, front and center.

525
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,129
Thanks for screwin" up
our Halloween, dumb shit.

526
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:46,800
= you little shit.

527
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,884
Get outta here, Jeff Matthews,

528
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,344
this is between me and my boy.

529
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,518
I warned you, buddy.

530
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:05,152
You broke the law, now you
have to learn the lesson.

531
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,330
Zowiel

532
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,328
no, zowie, stop!

533
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,790
Drew, call him off!

534
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,798
No, zowie!

535
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,957
Call your dog!

536
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,084
Drew, call him off!

537
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,095
Drew!

538
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,731
Is he dead?

539
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,328
Oh, man, Jeff.

540
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,213
We killed him.

541
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:05,465
Are you sure?

542
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,686
What are we gonna do?

543
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,735
We can bring him back.

544
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,235
We can, can't we?

545
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:34,828
It worked on zowie.

546
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,033
All right.

547
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,366
Oh, god.

548
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,923
Drew, do you know what time it is?

549
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:38,927
Did Gus ever find you?

550
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,014
God, what happened to you?

551
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,937
Nothin' happened, mom.

552
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,772
We just ditched Gus, that's all.

553
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,199
= you been drinkin'?

554
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,663
Drew's mom called hours ago.

555
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,465
The other kids were back by 10.

556
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,960
Where the hell were you boys?

557
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,006
= just out.

558
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,014
= just out?

559
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,060
Hold it!

560
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,393
I've been lettin' you get away with a lot

561
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,477
these past few weeks,

562
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,849
but I will not stand for crap like this.

563
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,693
I don't care if it's
Halloween, it's a school night.

564
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,527
Don't you ever do this again!

565
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,357
Dad, listen...

566
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,954
I'm really tired and I
just wanna go to bed.

567
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,962
Go on.

568
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,875
We'll talk about this in the morning.

569
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,842
All right.

570
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,461
Drew.

571
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,092
Drew, buddy.

572
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,514
Lost my keys.

573
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,618
Gus?

574
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,049
Found "em.

575
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,424
Ti need a shower.

576
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,150
Honey, I'm sorry about tonight.

577
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:30,832
Please come to bed.

578
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,923
Cold as ice!

579
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:50,890
You smell bad.

580
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,304
What did you get yourself into?

581
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,975
Oh, my god, Gus, what happened to the...

582
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:56,983
Gus, stop it.

583
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,024
What are you doing?

584
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,734
Stop it, don't!

585
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,195
Gus, let go of me.

586
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,815
What's wrong with you, Gus?

587
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,032
Stop it.

588
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,491
Let go of me, Gus!

589
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:21,841
Well?

590
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,171
= picture this.

591
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:28,546
Gus comes down to breakfast,
and he doesn't say a word.

592
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,596
He even kinda smiles, like
he forgot he hates me.

593
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,766
And you know what he does?

594
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,390
He serves me an extra helping of pancakes.

595
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,018
I asked him if I was still grounded.

596
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,440
"No."

597
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,530
I asked him if you
could stay over tonight.

598
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,907
And he nods.

599
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,818
It's like we're a family.

600
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,706
A real family.

601
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,635
Chase, this is Elliot rudman.

602
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,175
I've looked over the blood specimen

603
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:11,922
you sent me on canine zowie.

604
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,140
Could you give me a call?

605
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,107
Are you open?

606
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,350
Yeah, come on in.

607
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,364
We saw your sign, do
you have any kitties left?

608
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,858
Yeah, you can take your pick.

609
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,118
They're back in the boarding area.

610
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,908
You can go on back, right through there.

611
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:36,746
Ok.

612
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,580
You ready?

613
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,584
Let's go.

614
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,042
- Hello?
- Rudman, it's Matthews.

615
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,716
Matthews, was it your idea of a joke

616
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,264
to send me blood from a dead animal?

617
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,272
I didn't get that.

618
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,436
I said, next time it
might be a good idea

619
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:06,776
if you take a blood sample
while the animal is still alive.

620
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,146
Rudman, can you just give
me the lymphocyte count?

621
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,363
= it's normal.

622
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,527
There's nothing here to indicate

623
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,821
that the animal died from
an immune deficiency.

624
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:15,910
= died?

625
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,620
There's some kind of mix-up here.

626
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,785
This dog is alive.

627
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,283
Not this dog.

628
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,082
The cells are completely deteriorated.

629
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,795
You took over for yolander, right?

630
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,788
Yeah, why?

631
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,461
'Cause the last person that sent me blood

632
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,210
from a dead animal was yolander.

633
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,258
This is not blood from
a dead animal, rudman.

634
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,606
Oh, my god.

635
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,475
What happened?

636
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,316
What happened?

637
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,321
Jesus.

638
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,078
Oh, no.

639
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,193
Hey!

640
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,894
How's it goin', losers?

641
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,406
Jeff, drew.

642
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:43,074
- Saved by the bell.
- Dad has to bail him out.

643
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,288
Can I spend the night over
at drew's house tonight?

644
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,506
Yeah, that's fine.

645
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,217
Listen, guys, I got the
tests back on zowie,

646
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,256
and he's not well.

647
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,339
Don't ask me how, but he's gotten out.

648
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,468
So if he finds his way
home, I want you to call me.

649
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,514
Whatever hour, ok?

650
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,399
Sure, dad.

651
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:07,977
Yeah.

652
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,441
Ok.

653
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,444
See ya.

654
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:32,461
You would be so much more
interesting with blue eyes.

655
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,480
State your business.

656
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,523
Dr. yolander,
I'm chase Matthews.

657
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,399
I just took over your offices in ludlow.

658
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,652
I sent out a blood sample for analysis

659
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,622
and they told me that the
blood was from a dead animal.

660
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,990
You might as well come in.

661
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,333
Why are you bothering me with this?

662
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,675
Can't you just let it be?

663
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,551
The pathologist, he said that you had

664
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,304
a similar incident with a cat.

665
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,225
Creed cat, that's right.

666
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,395
Bastard's name was...

667
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,491
Church.

668
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,074
Let me guess.

669
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:48,123
Your dog's tissue isn't healing,
uh, pupils aren't dilating.

670
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,747
Maybe you can't find a heartbeat.

671
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,584
Exactly.

672
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,388
I thought it was some
kind of blood condition.

673
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,629
= there's no blood condition.

674
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,930
The dog isn't sick.

675
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,013
It's dead.

676
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,426
And so was creed's cat.

677
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,888
And so was his wife

678
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:14,187
on the night she was
killed for the second time.

679
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,810
Now, you want some advice, my friend?

680
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:20,781
You get in your car and you
get the hell out of that town.

681
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,333

This isn't funny.

700
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,109
Where's your boyfriend?
=I don't know.

701
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,444
Don't lie to me.

702
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,272
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

703
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:08,804
- I don't know.

I can come back, chase.

711
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,479
Do you think everybody that came back

712
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,767
would be like your stepdad?

713
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,068
= t don't know.

714
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,196
Maybe it depends on what you were like.

715
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,199
Before you died.

716
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,005
See you at school Monday?

717
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,750
Yeah, sure.

718
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,761
Hey Jeff.

719
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,545
Do you ever think about running away?

720
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,684
= all the time.

721
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:22,596
See ya, man.

722
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:15,822
Shit.

723
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:27,953
Well, well.

724
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,497
Look who's here.

725
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:34,963
Have fun, junior.

726
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:35,968
Here we go.

727
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,249
Guess your dad's not here
to save you now, is he?

728
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,959
I'm not afraid of you.

729
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,373
Yeah?

730
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,497
You ever see a tire
take off a nose before?

731
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,010
Neither have I.

732
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,710
Might even kill ya.

733
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,338
The wheel might chew
right into your brain.

734
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,555
You could visit your mom.

735
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,526
Jesus Christ, Gus.

736
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:39,823
Go home.

737
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,241
I said go home.

738
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:02,343
I was just fuckin' with him.

739
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,962

I mean, shit, Gus.

741
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:06,767
Come on.

742
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,137
You can't lay a finger on me.

743
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,952
What are you doin', man?

744
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,367

Woo-hoo!

747
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,263
Stop it!

748
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,684
Whoops.

749
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,566
This is the police.

750
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,656
Come out with your hands up.

751
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,743
No, zowie.

752
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:56,752

754
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,476
Forget somethin', drew, buddy?

755
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:39,836
Drew, buddy.

756
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,048
You have the right to remain silent

757
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,384
while I smash your head in.

758
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,423
You have the right to an attorney,

759
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:54,140
but you won't need one
'cause you'll be dead!

You understand these rights, drew, buddy?

765
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,994
Or are you just too fucking stupid?

766
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,552
Mom!

767
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,136
Gus killed Clyde, mom.

768
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,432
He's trying to kill me.

769
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,853
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go!

770
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,861
Oh, shit.

01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,024

- God, what does he want?
- He wants to kill us.

781
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,438
What do you want?

782
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,476

I'm takin' you up the hill, Clyde, buddy.

788
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,434
That's the way the Indians did it.

789
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,787
In local news, tragedy has
struck the town of ludlow.

790
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,455
Friends and neighbors
came to pay their respects

791
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,999
to drew and Amanda Gilbert,

792
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,292
who died in a head-on
collision on Saturday.

793
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,211
They are survived by Gus Gilbert,

794
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,675
who is sheriff of kennebago county.

795
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,010
Those poor people.

796
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,760
Did you see Gus at the funeral?

797
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:04,768
Yeah.

798
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,518
= t feel so bad for Jeff.

799
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,107
How's he taking it?

800
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,101
= t haven't talked to him.

801
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,150
He's been up in the attic all afternoon.

802
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,443
In other news, the disappearance

803
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,407
of a ludlow youth remains a mystery.

804
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,494
Clyde Parker was last seen
on Saturday afternoon.

805
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,910
His motorcycle was found off highway 62.

806
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,728
Hey, what are you doin'?

807
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,267
Getting things ready for mom.

808
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,074
Mom is dead, Jeff.

809
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,162
You know that.

810
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,457
= she doesn't have to be.

811
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,207
What are you talkin' about?

812
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:18,998
I can bring her back,

813
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,546
the same way me and
drew brought zowie back.

814
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,679
What you're sayin' is crazy, Jeff.

815
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,219
Zowie didn't die.

816
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,056
He did.

817
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,470
We buried him.

818
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,718
There's a place in the woods.

819
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,266
If you bury something
there, it comes back to you.

820
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:34,434
Oh, come on.

821
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:36,227
We did it on Gus.

822
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,725
Don't you lie to me.

823
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,977
Fine, don't believe me!

824
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:42,321
Chase, you have a phone call.

825
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,235
It's the caretaker at the cemetery.

826
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,505
= I'll call back.

827
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,295
He says it's an emergency.

828
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,214
Something about your wife's grave.

829
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,686
We're not finished.

830
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,020
What?

831
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,988
No, I'll be right there.

832
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:29,197
What happened?

833
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,240
= t don't know.

834
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:34,160
Can you stay here with Jeff
while I take care of this?

835
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,211
Don't let him leave this house.

836
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,216
Ok.

837
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,090
I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr. Matthews,

838
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,137
but I thought you might wanna come over

839
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,100
and have a look for yourself.

840
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:55,344
It's the damnedest thing.

841
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,389
= Gus did this?

842
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,641
Yes, he stuck around after the funeral,

843
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:04,066
told me that he had an
order to exhume your wife.

844
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,438
Now, I didn't think much about it

845
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,941
until I saw him drag the
body out of the coffin.

846
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,319
He put your wife in his pick-up,

847
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,445
and then he drove off

848
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,947
right through Amanda
and drew's headstones.

849
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,872
I swear, this is the weirdest
thing that's happened

850
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,665
since Louis creed dug up his boy.

851
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:28,789
You bury your own.

852
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,710
= Jeff?

853
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,682
Jeff?

854
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:29,475
Jeff, are you ok?

855
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,728
I hate that dog.

856
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:10,997
I'm sorry.

857
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,245
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

858
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:14,497
or is no longer in service.

859
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:17,545
If you feel you have reached

please check the number and try again,

861

or ask your operator for assistance.

862
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,400
What are you doing, Gus?

863
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,366
Well, I was buildin' a doggy door.

864
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,335
What's goin' on around here, Gus?

865
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,503
Why did you dig up my wife?

866
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,378
"Cause I wanted to fuck her.

867
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,770
Ow!

868
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,721
I hate it when that happens.

869
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:19,861
= no!

870
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,275
Got a permit for this?

871
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:31,331
T didn't think so.

872
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,912
Let me know if this hurts.

873
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,927
No brain, no pain.

874
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,140
Think about it.

875
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,414
Remember, chase, I had Renee first.

876
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:38,043
Marjorie.

877
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,588
= Jeff?

878
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,674
Did you really
think you could be like me?

879
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:24,799
Mom.

880
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,382
I came back for you, Jeff.

881
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,426
We're going to be together again.

882
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,691
We can try again, chase.

883
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:33,242
Oh, my god.

884
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,115
We can make it work this time.

885
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:42,543
= no.

886
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,542
Don't you love me any more, chase?

887
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,133
= you're not Renee.

888
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,052
Renee's dead.

889
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,804
Get away from her, Jeff.

890
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,529
Get away.

891
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,983
Jeff, honey, why
don't you go downstairs?

892
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,328
Your father and I need to talk.

893
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:32,134
Jeff.

894
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,096
I love you.

895
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:39,725
I love you more.

896
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,192

Looks like daddy got a boo-boo.

902
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:13,509
Now, where were we?

903
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,146
Here it comes, buddy.

904
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:15,065
Here it fucking comes.

905
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,408
You're gonna die, junior.

906
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:27,781
You're gonna die!

907
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,080
Eat this, asshole.

908
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,074

909
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:07,492

910
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,285

I'm melting!

914
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:39,018
Jeff, honey, what are you doing?

915
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,616
Nol

916
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,235
you're not gonna leave me, Jeff.

917
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,994
Your father and I are
