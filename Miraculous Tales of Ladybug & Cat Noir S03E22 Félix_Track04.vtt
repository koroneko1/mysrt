‎- Adrien.
‎-Father?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.820
‎There's something important
‎I have to talk to you about.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.660
‎I think about telling you every day, but
‎don't know how to find the right words.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.260
‎-I think I already know, Father.
‎-But how?

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.020
‎I've noticed how close
‎you and Nathalie have become.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.620
‎If she can make you happy again, then,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.900
‎as far as I'm concerned,
‎she's already part of our family.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.020
‎How could you think such a thing?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.460
‎Nobody could ever replace your mother.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.780
‎As long as she's in our hearts,
‎she lives on!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
‎We're expecting guests. Be ready.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.020
‎Wow, your father's like a piece
‎of Tomme cheese, with a rind so thick

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.460
‎it's almost impossible to get inside
‎the center.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.140
‎Don't be so hard on him, Plagg.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.300
‎It's been a year today
‎since Mom went away forever.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.540
‎We can't leave Adrien all alone
‎on a day like this!

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.540
<i>‎True that! But there's no way</i>
<i>‎his old man's gonna let us see him.</i>

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.500
‎Why not make him a video and tell him
‎how much we all care about him?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.180
‎-We can take turns recording our messages.
‎-Then send it to him!

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.820
‎-That would be great!
‎-OK, go, Marinette.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.460
‎Uh... No, no! Someone else go.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
‎I still need to go figure out
‎what I'm gonna say!

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.460
‎OK, girl. So, Nino, ready? Action!

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.220
<i>‎Hey, my dude!</i>

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.820
‎Your father is waiting for you downstairs,
‎Adrien.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300
‎Uh... I'll be right there.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.620
‎Mom?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.140
‎My, my! Look at how much you've grown!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.540
‎Gabriel,
‎isn't he just the absolute cutest?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.140
‎I'm sure Adrien is delighted to have
‎such a timely visit from his aunt,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.340
‎today of all days!

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.620
‎Aunt Amélie?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.580
‎I'm so happy to see you again!

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.740
‎I thought it'd be better if we were
‎all together on a day like this.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.820
‎-Don't you agree, dear?
‎-Uh-huh.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.700
‎Félix?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.260
‎Good to see you again.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.780
‎ Aw! They look just like twins.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.020
‎Don't they, Gabriel?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.660
‎Remember when they used to have
‎so much fun pretending to be each other?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.980
‎Once they had you and Emilie fooled
‎for a whole weekend.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.420
‎We laughed so hard!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.460
‎I won't be fooled a second time.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.060
‎Hello, Uncle.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.780
‎Félix, you know your uncle's
‎never been the physical sort!

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.020
‎Oh! How sweet!
‎You're still wearing your wedding band!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.540
‎You must have Emilie's too, I imagine.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.940
‎You never replied
‎to my message about that.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.580
‎I'd like to get the rings back.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.540
‎These rings are obviously
‎very special to me.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.180
‎And they're very dear to me, too, Gabriel.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.820
‎Those jewels have always been in the
‎Graham de Vanily ‎family, not the Agrestes!

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.660
‎We'll discuss it later.
‎It's been a long journey from London.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.540
‎-You may want to rest a bit. Nathalie?
‎-Follow me, please.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.540
‎-Take Félix to your bedroom.
‎-Yes, Father. Come on, Félix!

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.500
<i>‎Just wanted you to know</i>
<i>‎we're thinking about ya!</i>

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.860
‎And... cut! You're the last one. Ready?

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.700
‎I'd rather record myself.
‎I'll be right back!

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.340
‎What am I going to say to him?
‎Help me, Tikki!

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.300
‎What if a kwami friend had lost their mom?

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.460
‎The thing is,
‎we kwamis live forever, Marinette!

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.540
‎Let your heart do the talking.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.340
‎As long it is filled with love,
‎you can't go wrong.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.260
‎You think?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.140
<i>‎Adrien, I love you.</i>

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.620
<i>‎I'll always be there if you need me.</i>

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.700
‎What was I thinking? This is the worst day
‎I could choose to tell him!

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.980
‎-We've gotta start over.
‎-There'll never be a right day.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.260
‎ You done in there?
‎We're all waiting for you!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.420
‎What if your message could turn
‎his worst day ever into the best day ever?

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.860
‎What's going on, girl?
‎Are you feeling sick?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.780
‎Send the video without looking at it!
‎No one can see my part!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.140
‎No! Don't tell me you...

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.460
‎-Promise!
‎-You have my word.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.580
‎I can't believe it!
‎Wow! We got all the messages, guys!

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.460
‎I'm sending them to Adrien!

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.460
‎Do you remember our shooting contests?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.860
‎I'm really sorry
‎I didn't come to your dad’s funeral.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.740
‎My father thought it would be
‎too hard on me, considering...

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.580
‎everything ‎that's happened this year.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.620
‎You've every right to be mad at me.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.900
‎You always do what your father
‎tells you to do?

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.020
‎He's very... protective of me.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.820
‎Huh?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.420
‎Oh! Do you have that chessboard
‎we used to play all the time?

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.940
‎Of course!
‎Let me go upstairs and get it for us!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.420
‎Well, I challenge you,
‎so let the best man win!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.500
‎-  Found it!
‎-Grab cards, while you're up there!

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.060
‎You still doing magic?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.820
‎Now more than ever. You'll see!

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.740
‎ How about karate?
‎Still practising?

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.660
‎Of course!

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.860
‎-We need to talk, Adrien!
‎-What are you doing here? Hide!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.940
‎-Mind if I take a shower?
‎-No, go ahead. Make yourself at home!

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.700
‎What's up with that cousin of yours?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.220
‎First he searches through your things,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.620
‎and then,
‎the most unforgivable thing of all,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.860
‎he squashes<i>‎ my</i>‎ hunk of goat's cheese
‎under your pillow!

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.580
‎I'd been maturing that baby for two weeks,
‎do you realise? Two whole weeks!

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.060
‎Listen, Plagg. Félix lost his dad
‎not so long ago.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.220
‎He's probably not himself.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.420
‎I'm sorry, but there's just no excuse.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.780
‎You never touch my cheese and yet
‎you lost your mother not so long ago.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.660
‎Please forgive me, Adrien.
‎I didn't mean to.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.820
‎I know. And I'm sorry about your cheese.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.740
‎Tsk! Of course that idiot
‎has a crush on a superhero!

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.300
<i>‎Hey, my dude.</i>
<i>‎I'm not quite sure what to tell you</i>

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.180
<i>‎except that bros are always there</i>
<i>‎for their guys!</i>

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.900
‎"Bros are always there..." Bla, bla, bla!
‎Moron!

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.540
<i>‎Unicorns have a saying. "Even when</i>

<i>‎for a rainbow to appear!"</i>

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.540

<i>‎When my mother left for New York,</i>

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.940
<i>‎and I know how lucky I am.</i>
<i>‎So, you can count on me, my Adrikins.</i>

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.580

‎Adrien, could you lend me some clean
‎clothes? I left my suitcase downstairs!

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.180
‎ Sure! Take whatever you want!

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.100
‎ Thanks! They're perfect.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.740
‎Ahem!

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.820
‎First of all, thanks so much
‎for all your messages, guys.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.140
‎Oh, come here! Adrien has sent
‎a message back on the group chat!

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.620
‎Oh, no! I don't want to know!
‎Yes, I do want to know!

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.180
‎No, I don't!

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.100
‎What if he tells me he loves me?
‎Or doesn't love me?

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.740
‎Or he likes me but not that way? Aaah!

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.140
‎Luka? Please don't tell me you heard me.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.620
‎You know, I'll be really happy
‎for you and Adrien if it works out.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.260
‎And if it doesn't, I'll be here for you.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.460
‎Thanks, Luka.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.580
<i>‎First of all, thanks so much</i>

‎That's not him. Impossible!
‎There's no way that's Adrien!

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.500
‎ Sorry, sir.
‎Lila Rossi just sent this to us.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.940
‎It's a message from Adrien's phone.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.820
<i>‎To remind me how sad</i>
<i>‎I'm meant to be feeling?</i>

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.780
<i>‎-Why that's great! Really! Thanks a lot!</i>
‎-Félix.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.700
‎If Adrien's friends think it's him,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.340
‎they must be feeling very hurt right now.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.340
‎Hmm.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.300
‎All this disappointment might just help us
‎get rid of our unwanted guests.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.140
‎Félix, I told you
‎that you couldn't fool me twice!

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.220
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise these sad souls!

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.300
‎No way that's real. It must be a fake!

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.220
‎I am 100% positive that the video
‎hasn't been altered in any way.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.580
‎-Confirmed.
‎-The truth is, we've only known him

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.020
‎since we came back after the summer!

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.820
‎He<i>‎ was</i>‎ friends with Chloé
‎before he met us.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.860
‎Don't believe this video!
‎It can't be Adrien!

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:40.980
‎Lady Wifi, Reflekta, Princess Fragrance,
‎You are now the punishers trio!

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.380
‎I give you the power to chastise
‎the boy you thought was a friend,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.420
‎who has hurt you so terribly.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.700
‎I'm only asking you one thing in return.
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.620
‎He's going to regret what he said to us!

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.940
‎This isn't good.
‎They'll take it out on Adrien!

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.940
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.300
‎Ha!

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.900
‎Alya, you're not seriously
‎going to attack our buddy, are you?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.940
‎I'm not Alya. I'm Lady Wifi!

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.140
‎Anyone who tries to stand in our way
‎will be harshly punished!

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.140
‎You're not punishing anyone, Wifi!

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.820
‎It's time to log you out!

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.940
‎Not now that I've got
‎satellite connection!

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.380
‎At your service, Princess Fragrance!

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.820
‎-Catch Ladybug!
‎-Yaah!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.460
‎Call you later!

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.100
‎I know where you're going, Punishers!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.940
‎Nathalie, get Adrien to a safe place,
‎far from his cousin.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.140
‎Without his phone!

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.860
‎Come along. You have a photo shoot!

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.100
‎Now?

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.340
‎-Will you come with me, Félix?
‎-Your father insisted you go alone. Hurry!

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.380
‎It's time for your punishment,
‎you naughty... Huh?

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.180
‎-Boys?
‎- It all makes sense now!

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.580
‎-There were two Adriens!
‎-That explains why our super-nice video

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.860
‎was answered with a super-mean one!

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.140
‎Which one of you is a cruel
‎and inferior copy of the original?

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.020
‎-What video is she talking about?
‎-I've no idea what they're going on about!

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.940
‎One of you tried to make Adrien
‎look like a monster!

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.140
‎It was him! He's Félix, my cousin.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.260
‎Only a real meanie would tell on
‎his cousin! You must be Félix!

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.860
‎-What are you doing, Adrien?
‎-Adrien?

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.740
‎-Is that Félix or not?
‎-What do you think? Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.820
‎That's him! He's the real Félix!

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.500
‎Don't touch him!

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.220
‎You're being tricked, you fools!

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.340
‎Adrien has sacrificed himself
‎for his cousin!

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.660
‎Hey, girls, wait! I didn't do anything!

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.060
‎-He's the true culprit.
‎-But...

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.140
‎Oh, well... it's too easy.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.620
‎Where's the fun?
‎You want real? I'll show you real!

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.060
‎It's time for punishment, naughty boy!

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.860
‎Be careful what you wish for,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.180
‎naughty girls!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.820
‎Explain to me why you're trying
‎to save this cheese murderer.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.900
‎Because we're the good guys!

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.140
‎There's no time to lose. Plagg, claws out!

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.260
‎Don't worry, Adrien!
‎I'll deal with them later.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.820
‎I'll put you out of harm's way first!

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.140
‎-You'll be safe here!
‎-Ladybug! Wait!

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.060
‎I... I've always been in love with you,
‎you know.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.700
‎Huh? I... Really?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.700
‎If only you would let me...

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.980
‎...give you some courage before you go.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.460
‎Uh... Wait. What? No!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.900
‎OK, which part of the word "no"
‎did you not understand?

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.540
‎Gross! You're not Adrien!
‎He would never be so pushy!

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.900
‎That's Félix, Adrien's cousin!

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.340
‎I ran into Adrien
‎and he told me everything!

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.900
‎You made a lot of enemies in one day!

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:22.260
‎Bet you don't have many friends,
‎acting the way you do. Am I wrong?

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.020
‎There's no time for bickering.
‎They're coming!

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.500
‎Lucky Charm!

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.620
‎You really think covering us
‎with whipped cream

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.980
‎will save you from being punished,
‎Ladybug?

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.700
‎Want to smell like fish
‎for the rest of your life, kitty?

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.380
‎-Do anything and I'll pause you for good!
‎-You spend too much time on your phone.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.500
‎Felix, smash it in half
‎and this nightmare will be over!

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.260
‎What makes you thinkI want it to be over?

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.620
‎Hawk Moth! Can you hear me, Hawk Moth?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.020
‎You want their Miraculous, don't you?

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.140
‎-And what do you want?
‎-I'm after a piece of jewellery too.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.100
‎How about we make a little exchange?

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.700
‎Get hold of the Miraculous first!

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.220
‎We'll discuss the rest later!

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.740
‎You've got yourself a deal!

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.940
‎Now I think it's high time
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir were punished!

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.860
‎I hope you've learned your lesson!

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.420
‎-Pound it!
‎-Pound it!

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.340
‎ No more evil-doing for you,
‎little akuma.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.780
‎Time to de-evilise.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.020
‎Gotcha!

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.460
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.860
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.940
‎That video you sent to my friends...
‎unforgivable, Félix.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.140
‎Now his father isn't here
‎to stop him from getting into mischief...

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.660
‎I don't deserve to be forgiven.
‎I put my favourite cousin in danger.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.740
‎He's right.
‎No apology can never be enough.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.140
‎I hope I can learn from this and come back
‎to see you as a better person someday.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.940
‎I really am sorry.
‎I'll do my best to make it up to you.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.700
‎And to you too, Uncle.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.060
‎Goodbye, Félix.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.180
‎Mwah!

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.460
‎Félix, wait!

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.900
‎ Adrien, stay here!

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.300
‎If you're feeling upset or out of control,

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.500
‎call before you do
‎anything you might regret.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.100
‎I'm really lucky to have you.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.180
‎ Sorry, Plagg. If Félix didn't
‎destroy your cheese and steal my phone,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.380
‎-none of this would have happened.
‎-He can come back whenever he wants!

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.900
‎Did you know my friends
‎recorded messages for me?

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.220
‎What a nice thing to do. I've got an idea!

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.500
‎Huh?

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.300
<i>‎Hey, guys, I never got your messages,</i>

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.980
<i>‎but I'm touched</i>
<i>‎you were thinking of me today.</i>

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.860
<i>‎You're the best friends anyone could</i>
<i>‎ever dream of. I love you. All of you.</i>

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.420
<i>‎I love you.</i>

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.340
<i>‎I love you.</i>

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.260
<i>‎I love you.</i>

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.620
‎Oh, I love you too, Adrien!

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.100
<i>‎I love you.</i>

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.980
‎I've got a surprise for you, Mom.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.740
‎ But Gabriel refused
‎to hand it over to me,

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.900
‎and after everything that happened...

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.700
‎My little magician!

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.140
‎I can never understand how you always
‎manage to get what you want!

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.420
‎Keep it. It's yours now.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.620
‎But you wanted it so much!

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.660
‎Only to give it to you.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.980
‎You've always been so fascinated by them!

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.780
‎How many times have you asked me to tell
‎you about the Graham de Vanily twin rings?

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.060
‎I'm glad it's back in the family,
‎where it truly belongs.
