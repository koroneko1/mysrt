00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.940
I knew you were going to be here.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440
So, I came here to see you. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660
Actually, I followed you here.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.640
Are you doing alright?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600
It's been a while since we last spoke.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.460
We used to talk to each other,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.680
play together,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
fool around together,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680
and eat with one another.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.120
How long will you keep ignoring me?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.920
If you want to be angry at me...

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.320
punch me,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.740
scold me,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.740
I won't blame you.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740
But may I ask you one thing?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.740
Please, don't hate me.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.060
In this world...

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.280
Only you understand how I feel.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.580
The more you act like this...

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.580
the more you make me worry.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.660
I miss you.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.180
Tan...

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.920
I...

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.160
don't know what's wrong with me.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.460
I don't wanna do anything.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.440
I don't wanna attend class.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.020
I don't wanna study.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.220
I just want to sit here and do nothing.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.480
I really don't know what's in my head.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.060
I'm...

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.960
like a robot.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.820
But why does a robot want to cry? 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.160
Why does a robot have a heart?

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.640
It's okay. 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.240
It's okay.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.000
It's gonna be okay.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.480
Everything's gonna be fine.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.800
I think...

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.560
you should just let me be.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.360
This song is for...

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.540
the person...

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.040
who keeps me awake at night.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.640
I'll post this on Facebook.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.260
I won't tag anyone, let him see it by himself.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.760
[You don’t know that you made someone love you,]

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.240
[just out of the blue.]

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.000
[Late at night, you sleep tight.]

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.320
[But you don’t know, right?]

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.900
[I can’t sleep tonight.]

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.160
[Inside someone’s heart, full of love...]

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.360
[The love, that you’ll never know.]

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.920
[Late at night, you sleep tight.]

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.920
[But you don’t know, right?]

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.880
[I can’t sleep tonight.]

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.700
[Inside someone’s heart, full of love...]

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.700
[The love, that you’ll never know.]

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:32.240
[Someday.. I hope you’ll know…. I’ll be glad.]

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.140
Hello, Sine.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.160
Are you free?

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.820
I'd like to speak with you.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.720
I'm at the bike park.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.680
At Peppermint Bike Park.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.100
See you, then.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.000
Okay, see you.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.080
Hey!

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.960
What's up?

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.960
Well...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.580
May I ask you something?

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.080
Sure.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.280
Well...

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.620
Do you...

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.780
like Tan?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.680
Uhh..

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.860
What do you mean?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.840
It's okay.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.120
Don't worry about me.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.140
I already talked with Tan.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.480
I understand.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.820
Well..

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.080
If we compare this to Trigonometry,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.600
there's sin (sine), cos (cosine) and tan (tangent).

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.980
All values are used to find an answer.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.040
Sin and tan can be perfectly calculated by cos.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.820
I'll be that cos.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.300
The cos that'll help Sine and Tan understand each other.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.940
Th range of Tan...

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.940
is up to the answer that Sine gives.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.420
Sine... Tan's waiting for you.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.820
Mom, what're you watching?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.420
I'm binge-watching many new series.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.920
Can I lie down on your lap?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.140
You're quite odd today.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.740
Do you want something?

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.400
Nothing...

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400
Your lap's comfortable.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.820
Is there something on your mind?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.620
When you were younger,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.760
you must've been very charming.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.600
Do you want me to relive my past?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.600
Mom...

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.460
Is dad your first love?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.460
No!

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.360
Dad is definitely not my first.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.580
Really?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.480
Yes.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.980
If I were dad, I'd have been very jealous.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.000
So, you're on dad's side?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.360
You may think that you dad looks innocent,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.880
but he's a real player.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.600
Thank you mom,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.860
for choosing dad.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been born.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.400
You seem a little off.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.260
Are you in love?

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.860
Or going to fall in love?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.060
Perhaps a break up?

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.340
You can tell me anything.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.080
All those feelings are mixed together.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.420
Was dad ever afraid of love?

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.140
Afraid?

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.260
I think he's afraid to not fall in love.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.200
How about you?

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.200
Are you afraid of love?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.760
Or afraid to not be loved?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.960
You call tell me.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.500
It's like solving a complex Mathematical equation.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.920
So many variables.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.240
If you want love, then just love.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.060
It's not easy for me.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.260
If you think that some of those variables 

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.320
are your parents.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
You can eliminate such variables.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.580
When you're in a relationship with someone,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.800
we won't be a part of it.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.500
It's your love, do you understand?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.500
Love is not Mathematics.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.760
You shouldn't calculate love.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.880
The correct answer...

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.320
comes from your true feelings.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.300
You needn't worry about anything apart from your own feelings.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.580
Try to find the right answer.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.660
Do you understand?

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.880
Dad and I are okay.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.000
We'll always be here for you.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.000
Thanks, mom.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.640
I love you, son.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.120
Love you too, mom.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.440
You have nothing to worry about.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.280
Is it that difficult to find an answer together?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.220
If you want love, then just love.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.780
You're my sin(90)

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.520
You're my number one.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.840
The range of Tan is up to the answer that Sine gives.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.880
Tan's waiting for you.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:21.072
The correct answer comes from your true feelings.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.620
Tonight's quite cold.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.130
So, I bought a cup of warm milk.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.180
However, this time...

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.640
I didn't write any formulas.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.580
I want you to do it instead.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.320
How did you know I was gonna come?

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.940
I'm just glad that you came.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.160
Take a sip.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.420
How was it?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.330
Start to feel anything?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.740
Like feelings for me.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:41.800
Well...

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.040
Maybe a little.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.840
What kind of feelings?

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840
Is is good or bad?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.100
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080
Before this,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.760
there's only people that I liked.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.540
Never a person that I loved.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.420
But now...

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.260
I do.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.360
Will you...

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.000
be my love?

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.140
You didn't even flirt with me.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.020
You can't just skip it like that.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.020
This class...

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.020
there's no fast track.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.720
You...

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.880
always find the right answers.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.360
It's like a kiss...

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.360
after a kick.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.480
You really are something!

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.480
I understand.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.060
It's not you...

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.520
who just discover that you liked me.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.540
But it's because you are certain.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.160
That's why you can confess your true feelings for me.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.880
Instead it's me who is...

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.300
confused...

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.140
and afraid.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.440
It's all because of me.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.680
For sure.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.280
However...

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.420
I know that...

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.220
I should give you some time.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.280
Before this...

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.280
I was being selfish.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.140
That's why I forgot to take your feelings into account.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.140
But from now on...

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.520
I'll be clearer with you.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.840
Cuz...

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.840
I already gave you my heart.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.800
When I found you...

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.640
it's like I'm solving a complex Mathematical equation.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.500
Systematically solving it.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.780
Piece by piece.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.240
Can you reassure me...

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.960
that the answer I'll find...

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.840
is the right one.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.710
From now on...

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.460
I'll always have you by my side.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.440
Laughing.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.700
Crying.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.220
We'll overcome everything together.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.480
From today onwards...

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.860
You'll be my side.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.920
I won't promise...

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.000
that I'll be with you infinitely.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.710
But I promise...

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:11.180
I will be with you...

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.630
Till death do us part.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.060
As for the future...

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.320
Don't worry about it.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.280
You'll always have me.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.440
Best boy...
