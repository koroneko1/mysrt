1
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,958
Mom! Mom!

2
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,166
Don't fall asleep!

3
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,833
Wake up! Wake up!

4
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,250
Mom! Mom!

5
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,625
Mom, wake up!

6
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,291
Sak!

7
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,875
It's a curve!

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,791
No curve is too curvy
because I am that gutsy.

9
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,166
Sak!

10
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,791
Truck!

11
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,291
RAILWAY

12
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,583
A train's coming!

13
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,416
So what?

14
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,000
-Let's gamble with our lives.
-Gamble?

15
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,791
Not my life. No more of this shit!

16
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,083
The word "no" is not in my dictionary.

17
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,833
Is this the right time to act cool?

18
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,958
It's not an act. It's in my DNA.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,666
Damn you!

20
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,541
Sak, stop!

21
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,416
I said stop!

22
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,000
ONE MONTH EARLIER

23
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,333
ALARM RINGING

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,000
MR. SAKRIN PAEWONG

25
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,166
Though your butt is saggy,

26
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,458
I still love you dearly.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,125
Hi! My name is Sakrin.

28
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,125
I was born and raised in Ayutthaya.

29
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,458
Other people's kids give their mom a kiss.

30
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,916
My damn son slapped my butt.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,666
This is Suree, my mother,
a former pub singer in Suphan Buri.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,916
Now she provides laundry services
in Ayutthaya.

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,541
See you, Mom. See you, Grandma.

34
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,750
This is my beloved grandmother.

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,875
She's very ill, but that doesn't stop her
from being a pain.

36
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,375
Hey, Sak.

37
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:41,791
BILLS

38
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,375
The bills came early this month.

39
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,708
Take care of them for me.

40
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,750
No problem.

41
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,000
Hello, everyone!

42
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,416
This guy is Uncle Preecha.

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,833
My Father's friend, an ex-cop.

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,958
-Hello, Aunty!
-Who the hell are you?

45
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,708
Suree, your mother-in-law has Alzheimer's?

46
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,583
Sak, I forgot to tell you.

47
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,208
Uncle Preecha and his son are moving back
to the neighborhood.

48
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,541
You're still around?

49
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,666
Of course, I'm still around.

50
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,291
I'm super strong.

51
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,291
When I was border police,
I was the strongest in the unit.

52
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,583
I had to swim every day
to use up my extra energy.

53
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,208
-Really?
-Yes.

54
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,166
I thought you were dead.

55
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,250
You have a foul mouth just like your dad.

56
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,791
You still have buck teeth
just like before.

57
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,500
Why don't you just smack my head?

58
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,458
-Okay.
-I'm joking.

59
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,416
You haven't heard this.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,708
My son will be an assistant manager
in a bank soon.

61
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,958
He's working in a bank?

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,875
Yes.

63
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,958
Watch out for scammers.

64
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,125
Have you heard the news

65
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,333
about someone getting scammed
and losing money?

66
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,166
If you knew, why didn't you warn them?

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,333
It's me who got scammed!

68
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,125
Working as a banker is lame.

69
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,208
Look at my son. See? No shame at all.

70
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,125
Your son?

71
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,708
Whenever he visits,
I always worry he might steal something.

72
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,208
Calm down, Norasingh! She's my friend.

73
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,041
So, what does he do?
Is he an entrepreneur?

74
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,541
He's unemployed.

75
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,333
-Dad!
-Asshole! I am your father.

76
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,625
Ungrateful boy!
No respect even for your own father.

77
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,208
Where's Sak?

78
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,041
He left for work. Why waste time?

79
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,125
I see.

80
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,291
Norasingh, greet the grandmother.

81
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,250
-Who the hell are you?
-You talking to me?

82
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
Singh! Motherfucker!

83
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,666
You're going to punch such an old woman?

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,375
-I don't discriminate.
-Damn you.

85
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,000
Look at her age!

86
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,083
No need to punch. Just blow and she dies.

87
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,500
And this is how I commute
to Bangkok everyday.

88
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:00,958
PAY BILLS

89
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:09,916
MEN'S RESTROOM

90
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,250
BIKEMEN - OLD MARKET

91
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,750
Right, I told my family I was a banker.

92
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,500
But I'm just a bikeman.

93
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,083
To the Skytrain.

94
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,833
Please hurry. I'm already late.

95
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,875
It's never too late
if your death isn't due.

96
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,333
Honda Wave.

97
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,083
Thirty-four grand.

98
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,625
Scoopy I 2016, also 34 grand.

99
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,083
Scoopy I,

100
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,625
but 2018.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,208
Thirty-nine grand.

102
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,625
Wow!

103
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,083
Honda Wave...

104
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,083
but not an ordinary model.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,208
Dual exhaust.

106
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,208
With sidecar selling fruit and coffee.

107
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,333
Dang!

108
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,916
The whole thing, I'd say almost 50 grand.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,583
Amazing!

110
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,833
Unbelievable! You can't even see.

111
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,125
You are out of this world!

112
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,666
You are so good,

113
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,375
we need to give you a trophy.

114
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,041
No.

115
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,958
The trophy will say,

116
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,083
"Sakrin...

117
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,916
works at this bike station."

118
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,625
Your mom would be proud.

119
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,166
Shit. I just hurt his feelings.

120
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,208
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,583
We have a client.

122
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,666
This is Jai.

123
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,791
Gold medal runner at my school,
who I had a crush on.

124
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,583
The thing is,
I don't want her to recognize me

125
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,833
because I'm a lowly bikeman.

126
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,333
Number five.

127
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,083
Sak! What's wrong with you?

128
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,833
Your turn. If you don't go, I will.

129
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,458
Mister.

130
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,250
-Where do you want to go?
-To NCB Bank.

131
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,916
-I see.
-Please get on the bike.

132
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,083
Here.

133
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,500
Please sit.

134
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,333
Aren't you Sakrin?

135
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,916
Wow! It's really you.

136
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,291
Remember me?

137
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,125
Jai.

138
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,250
It's me, Jarunee.

139
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,666
The orange team's drum major, also 
a gold medal runner during Grade seven.

140
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,250
It's been ages, but I still remember you.

141
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,791
-Good memory, right?
-Right.

142
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,541
It's nice to see an old friend.

143
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,916
Yeah.

144
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,625
Well, I have to pay you.

145
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,333
Twenty, right?

146
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,125
Twenty-five.

147
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,708
Did you just raise the price?

148
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,541
It's been a while now.

149
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,083
Give me a discount, please.

150
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,791
How stingy.

151
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,791
Please.

152
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,958
Please...

153
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,958
Aren't you prettier than before?

154
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,291
Is that a compliment?

155
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,500
It's a compliment...

156
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,250
said with great confidence.

157
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,166
Twenty, okay?

158
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,583
Okay, I'll take it.

159
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,666
Yes!

160
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,041
So...

161
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,541
You're working here?
Why have I never seen you around?

162
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,208
I used to be a trainee at headquarters.

163
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,000
Then they sent me here.

164
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,958
You are late.

165
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,583
Because you didn't pick me up.

166
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,458
The skytrain also--

167
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:53,916
If I had picked you up,

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,958
we both would have been late.

169
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,125
I'm the respectable...

170
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,958
-assistant manager.
-Assistant manager... You can't be late.

171
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,833
This is Ae, my boyfriend.

172
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,833
This is Sak, my old friend.
We accidentally met.

173
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,458
Well...

174
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,666
Let's meet again, so we can catch up.

175
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,208
In case you want to call me.

176
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,708
See you.

177
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,041
The reason
that Sak pretends to be a banker...

178
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,250
You know why?

179
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,791
Why?

180
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,083
He's afraid.

181
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:55,916
Afraid of what?

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,541
Afraid that if his grandmother

183
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,750
knows the truth,
she might be shocked to death.

184
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,750
He's still googling for a job in a bank
till this day.

185
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,375
JOB POSITIONS IN A BANK

186
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,708
NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT

187
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,125
When he comes to Bangkok,

188
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,791
do you know who he's afraid
to run into the most?

189
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,958
Who?

190
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,875
Mr. Preecha, his dad's friend.

191
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,541
Why's it so crowded? No empty seats.

192
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,791
Hi!

193
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,875
Why are you running away? It's me.

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,041
Sak!

195
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,500
Why did you run?

196
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,416
You are acting really weird.

197
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,125
Don't cry!

198
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,958
Just keep shitting.

199
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,083
In this scenario,

200
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,416
you think I can't find you?

201
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,291
Oh, I'm wrong.

202
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,125
This is different from a movie.

203
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,750
Window.

204
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,666
I farted, sir.

205
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,916
No need to report. You can fart.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,708
You are really something.

207
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,916
For such a small boy,

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,083
you store so much shit. I'm leaving.

209
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,958
Shit.

210
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,500
Hi, Sak.

211
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,666
Hi, Uncle.

212
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,708
You said you worked in a bank in Bangkok.

213
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,416
How come you have a motorcycle key?

214
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,083
It's my friend's.

215
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
I see.

216
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,375
What are you doing in Bangkok?

217
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,291
I'm going to open a doll shop.

218
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,166
I came to buy dolls in Bangkok.

219
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,375
Your mom is coming, too.

220
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,250
She's catching up later.

221
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,791
My son, Norasingh, is sick,

222
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,833
so I paid your mom
to help me bring back the dolls.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,166
Let me ask you.

224
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,041
Why did you run from me?

225
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,583
Who said I ran?

226
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,791
I saw you run just now.

227
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,666
Attention, next station is Bang Sue.

228
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,375
It's my station. See you later.

229
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,541
Thank you for this.

230
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,666
Damn the announcement!
I was getting the answer.

231
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,625
Sak is acting really weird.

232
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,333
Next person, please.

233
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,375
I have eight checks, two water bills,

234
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,291
four electricity bills. Deposit 200,000.
Withdraw 60,000. Transfer 35,000.

235
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,625
Come again, please.

236
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,666
You are a newbie, right?

237
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,208
Yes.

238
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,208
Well, I...

239
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,916
can't remember all of that.

240
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,625
Okay, let's deposit this check first.

241
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,666
Yes, sir.

242
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,250
Mr. Ae, this is our new trainee.

243
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,541
I want you to be her mentor.

244
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,791
-Hi, Mr. Ae.
-Hi.

245
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,916
-What's your name?
-I'm Noi-Nae.

246
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,708
Noi-Nae?

247
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,083
Cute name.

248
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,875
If you get to know me better,
I'm more than just cute.

249
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,625
Good to know.

250
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,083
We have a client.

251
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,416
This girl again.

252
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,458
Whoever gets this one,

253
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,083
prepare to change the tires.

254
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,875
I'm not going.

255
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,166
You can't do that.

256
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,958
Don't forget.

257
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,416
We never refuse service to a customer.

258
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,541
Our motto is to give the best service.

259
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,458
Do you understand?

260
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,416
Yes, sir.

261
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you okay?

262
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:04,958
Yes.

263
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,375
The path is never too narrow.

264
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,541
Slow down.

265
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,333
Goodness!

266
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,958
See? We got through.

267
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,875
No.

268
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,291
No? We clearly got through.

269
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
My knees are ruined.

270
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,416
You suck as a biker.

271
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,583
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,916
Hello.

273
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,041
Preecha.

274
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:11,166
Where is that alley again?

275
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,750
I forgot.

276
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,000
Hello.

277
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,791
Hello, Preecha.

278
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,708
Hello!

279
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,250
Bad reception.

280
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,875
Boy!

281
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,958
Boy!

282
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,708
You.

283
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,708
The lady is calling you.

284
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,625
-Really?
-Really!

285
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,958
Do you know the alley
behind The Grand Postal building?

286
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,208
You are a bikeman.
How come you don't know it?

287
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,916
Now what, Suree?

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,208
She didn't answer the phone.
Will she be able to get here?

289
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,416
Who are you talking to?

290
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,916
No one. I'm just muttering.

291
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,750
You mutter very loudly.

292
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,041
So what?

293
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,833
Go straight.
Turn left at the next traffic light.

294
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,708
Go straight.

295
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,708
Turn left at the next traffic light.

296
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,375
But...

297
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,625
You sound very familiar.

298
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,666
Have we met?

299
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,208
Are you from Ayutthaya?

300
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,958
You look familiar, too.

301
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,666
Why don't you answer her question?

302
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,250
What?

303
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,708
I only said he was acting weird.

304
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,083
Why did he take off?

305
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,166
-Why did you run a red light?
-So we'll get there quickly.

306
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,541
I'm not in a hurry.

307
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,625
Are you fake monks?

308
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,791
What?

309
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,333
Are you working together?

310
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,291
-No, we--
-Where's your alms bowl?

311
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,833
Where's your temple boy?

312
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,541
-We--
-Someone will pick you up, right?

313
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't lie to me. I'm an ex-cop.

314
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,291
Shit!

315
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,375
-Accident ahead!
-I know.

316
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,250
Stop the bike!

317
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Your eyes give it away.

318
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,833
Keep it cool, man.

319
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,625
Watch out!

320
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,708
Bikers always ride on the sidewalk.
How dangerous!

321
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:03,791
Luckily,

322
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,833
I helped you just in time.

323
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,500
I wish I could've used my hands,

324
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,375
but my hands are not available. So I--

325
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,166
-Kicked me.
-Yes.

326
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,208
You don't mind, right?

327
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,541
I don't.

328
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,416
Father, watch out!

329
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,791
Thank you very much.

330
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,666
I owe him my life.

331
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,500
I'm glad that you saved him
from a fatal accident.

332
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,666
You don't mind, right?

333
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,333
-I don't.
-He doesn't mind.

334
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,166
What are you doing?

335
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:52,000
Honey, have I told you
that Sak got promoted?

336
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,333
He follows in your footsteps.

337
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,666
Same position.

338
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,083
Are you happy? I am really happy.

339
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,375
Hey, Sak!

340
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,708
You're back already?

341
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,583
Suree,

342
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:11,416
I took your fridge to the repair shop.

343
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,041
-Really?
-It's really broken.

344
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,833
Nothing works.

345
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,375
I want to ask you something.

346
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,291
The story you told me.

347
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,208
Who was he?

348
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,041
If I knew,
would I ask you in the first place?

349
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,500
He sounded and looked familiar.

350
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,458
But I've never known any bikemen.

351
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,166
Well, hear me out.

352
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:36,208
Next time I go selling dolls in Bangkok,
take me to the spot where you met him.

353
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,125
I will find out who he is.

354
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,500
Trust me,

355
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:43,041
he won't get away from an ex-cop like me.

356
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,500
Why are you sweating like pig?

357
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,750
-I sweat easily.
-Really?

358
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,916
Let me see.

359
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,708
What are you doing?

360
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:01,375
Checking your pulse.

361
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,666
Your pulse is dancing like a go-go girl.

362
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,208
-Suree.
-Yeah?

363
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:18,875
-Do you think he's weird?
-Who?

364
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,958
Your son.

365
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,208
I don't think so.

366
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,333
You are the weirdest one in this house.

367
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,166
I'm not.

368
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,000
Your mom is the weirdest.

369
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,083
Have you changed her battery?

370
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,833
She's still like a statue.

371
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,833
You are really rude. Just go away.

372
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:38,833
When you have time,
play a fun song so she can dance.

373
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,125
I FIXED YOUR BUTTON

374
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,416
Long!

375
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,625
-Long!
-What's up?

376
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,583
What can I do for you?

377
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,208
Can someone deposit this check for me?

378
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:31,416
The bank will be closed in ten minutes.

379
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,416
Yeah, I know.

380
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,625
No problem.

381
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,416
I'll ask Sak to run this errand.

382
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,666
-Sak.
-Yes?

383
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,875
Go to the bank
and deposit this check for our client.

384
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,791
Don't you see
I have to deliver these pork rinds?

385
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,583
I know, but it's the same way.

386
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,083
You can drop by the bank
and deposit the check.

387
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,166
Go! Go! Go!

388
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,833
This moron.

389
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,375
I must tell him everything.

390
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,083
This guy is fast.

391
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,583
You're dead meat!

392
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,833
Naa, ain't you pretty?

393
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,416
Thank you very much.

394
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,000
You are glowing.

395
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,708
Have you been working out or something?

396
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,041
I jog.

397
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,291
You jog.

398
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,458
You have to watch out for accidents.

399
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,750
I have a new interesting insurance plan.

400
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,291
-Yes, I'm looking for one.
-I'll choose the best plan for you.

401
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,083
If you die soon,

402
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,375
your kids won't get much money,
but the funeral will be grand.

403
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,166
But if you live for a long time,

404
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,250
your kids will be very rich.

405
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,875
Are you interested?

406
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,625
Hold on!

407
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,083
The bank is closed.

408
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,375
You can't close now.

409
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:04,750
We still have three minutes.

410
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,541
Is your watch running slow?

411
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,041
No way! See this?
I still have three minutes.

412
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,083
The time on my watch matches Big Ben.

413
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,166
What is Big Ben?

414
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,958
It's a place we use to set the time.

415
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,833
Next time, explain it that way.

416
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,541
Don't use big words. I don't understand.

417
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,208
I'm tired and confused. You understand?

418
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,875
I bought a new phone.

419
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,958
I'm not boasting.
This one can do FaceTime.

420
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,416
What is FaceTime?

421
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,166
You are such a hillbilly.

422
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,500
If you use FaceTime,
you can see their face, too.

423
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,708
Big face on the screen.

424
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,208
-Wait!
-What, bro?

425
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:41,458
Why all the hurry?

426
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,583
What's the big deal?
I just want to deposit a check.

427
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,791
It's a big deal.

428
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,000
It's a big deal.

429
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,416
My life is like this.

430
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,875
So unfortunate
that I have to meet a dude like you.

431
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,791
Can you give my position some respect?

432
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,583
Give me some respect as a guard!

433
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,166
Thailand is always like this.

434
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,125
If it's ten people, then it's ten checks.

435
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,750
Rules are not respected.

436
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,541
If I could choose,

437
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,291
I'd have fled to Italy.

438
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,458
-I'm annoyed. I'm fed up.
-Just a sec.

439
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,583
What?

440
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:13,625
What's going on, Mom?

441
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,333
It's FaceTime.

442
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,083
I know what FaceTime is.

443
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,291
I want to see how you're doing at work.
My dear boy.

444
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,750
-See? I'm working.
-Wait. Wait.

445
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,916
Your bank is closed now.
Did you finish your job?

446
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,166
It will be closed soon.
Why do you want to know?

447
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,666
Close the door, Wichien.

448
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,916
-I have to go.
-Who is Wichien?

449
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,166
-We don't have time, Wichien.
-Stop! Stop!

450
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,541
What's going on?

451
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,291
I have a check to deposit.

452
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,291
You want to deposit a check?
Let me see.

453
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,041
The bank is now closed.

454
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,875
Can you come back tomorrow?

455
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,458
I told you.

456
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,958
Please leave.

457
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:11,166
Hello, teacher. The bank is closed.

458
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,750
Can you tell the client that I'm sorry.

459
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,250
Okay.

460
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,375
What are you doing?

461
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,958
Where are you going?

462
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,125
We are going to battle.
Mind your own business.

463
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,125
-Wait.
-What?

464
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,250
What does "battle" mean?

465
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,666
Scum like you--

466
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,000
That motherfucker!

467
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,166
Scumbag, I'm exhausted from chasing you.

468
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,666
I'm fucked.

469
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,208
Let me see your stupid face.

470
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,583
You wanna fight me?

471
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,958
Damn it!

472
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,291
My old wound. Fuck!

473
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,541
Shit!

474
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,583
Shit!

475
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,666
I'm leaving. My dad is here.

476
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,000
I have to get the hell out.

477
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,791
Stop.

478
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,291
I told you to stop.

479
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,791
I told you to stop.

480
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,750
It's you guys, right?

481
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,500
I didn't do anything.

482
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,000
I have petty crimes on a daily basis,

483
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,208
instead of working on big cases.

484
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,000
I have to find the guy
who punched the security guard.

485
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,125
I didn't punch him.
The other guy punched him.

486
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,500
The fine for an assault case is ten grand.

487
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,416
What?

488
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,041
Can I pay 500?

489
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,583
The fine is between 500 and 10,000.

490
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,625
So you won't do it again.

491
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:47,041
If you don't pay, you can go to prison.

492
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,208
What's wrong?

493
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,625
I lost my wallet.

494
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,625
They always have an excuse.

495
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,708
Then call your family to bail you out.

496
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,041
MY FAVORITE CONTACTS

497
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,333
MOM

498
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,333
-Why can't you call your mother?
-Sir,

499
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,500
my mom thinks I'm a badass.

500
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,916
I don't want her to know I'm a jackass.

501
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,583
So what?

502
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,833
Hello.

503
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,500
Cherry, is that you?

504
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,833
The line is busy.

505
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,291
Now what?

506
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,041
Hello.

507
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,083
I need a receipt.

508
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,833
Thank you.

509
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,416
I called all my friends,
but nobody answered.

510
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,750
Don't worry.

511
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,166
I will pay you back the ten grand.

512
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,333
No hurry.

513
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,750
Is the day after tomorrow okay?

514
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,333
Day or night?

515
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,291
Is the daytime too late?

516
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,416
Before lunch, right?

517
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:10,458
I'm joking. You can pay me back any time.

518
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,208
-Why are you laughing?
-Nothing.

519
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,833
You loaned me the money.
Can you be my honey?

520
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,958
Of course not. You have a boyfriend.

521
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,833
-Where's Mom?
-She's delivering some laundry.

522
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,250
-Somsak, same time tomorrow okay?
-Sure.

523
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,291
What are you looking at?

524
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,625
You look like
someone punched you in the face.

525
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,083
No one punched me.

526
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,250
I just tripped and fell.

527
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,541
I see.

528
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,833
You look like you got punched.

529
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:18,750
Holy shit!

530
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,125
What?

531
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,375
It can't be fixed?

532
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:28,541
How much is a new one?

533
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:30,833
Really?

534
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:35,375
Okay. Hold on. Let me ask my son.

535
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,750
Josh, the repairman,
said it's too old to fix.

536
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,916
Not worth it. It's bound to break again.

537
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,083
We should buy a new one.

538
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:53,541
A used one is 8,000.
With the repair service fee,

539
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:54,666
we have to pay 12,000.

540
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,916
What?

541
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:05,375
If you don't have money,
I'll ask Josh to fix the old one.

542
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:11,583
Who am I? I'm soon to be...

543
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,125
an assistant manager at the bank.

544
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,041
By the way,

545
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,125
the cut looks pretty deep.

546
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,708
Does it hurt?

547
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,208
Yes, it hurts.

548
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,541
You have to be more careful.

549
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,416
I can't sit.

550
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:36,333
My family needs the money.

551
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:40,041
-Can I pay you back 1,000 baht a week?
-Sure, but with interest.

552
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,583
But I don't mean money.
You have to give me free rides.

553
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,416
Twice a week.

554
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,625
Thank you. You are very kind.

555
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,458
Yes, I am beautiful and kind.

556
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,750
If you ever break up with your boyfriend,
I'm right here waiting.

557
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,666
How sweet!

558
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,000
I am so sweet that you can eat me up.

559
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,291
Now you are pervy.

560
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:17,208
Well, I'm not a funny guy.
I am a pervy guy.

561
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,416
Gosh!

562
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:27,125
You're free on Sunday, right?

563
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,083
Yes, what's up?

564
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,416
I'm cooking some curry.
Ask your friends from the bank to join us.

565
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,458
And this time,

566
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,791
don't bail on me.

567
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,375
It happened too many times.
What a waste of food!

568
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,208
Do you understand?

569
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:43,791
Yes.

570
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:05,041
This is Pakorn

571
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,291
from the credit department.

572
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,583
This is Ong-Art

573
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,916
from the foreign currency...

574
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,083
department.

575
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,583
Hi, ma'am.

576
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,333
Very nice to meet you.

577
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,125
Because at the bank,

578
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:26,333
Sakrin always tells us about you.

579
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,000
So, we...

580
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,833
really wanted to visit you.

581
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,208
But...

582
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,708
in our department,

583
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,458
we've been busy all the time.

584
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,791
Taking care of...

585
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,416
foreign currency,

586
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,958
we really don't have free time.

587
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,750
Foreign currency,

588
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,291
American dollars or English pounds?

589
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,791
Our bank doesn't mess
with those currencies,

590
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,458
because...

591
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,791
they fluctuate constantly.

592
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,500
Rise and fall all the time.

593
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,833
So we focus

594
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,708
on the Myanmar kyats

595
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,000
and Vietnamese dongs.

596
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,833
For this quarter,

597
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,333
our bank came up with a policy

598
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:23,500
to sell all the kyats and dongs.

599
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:29,166
Then we will focus on the Indian rupee.

600
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:30,791
It is clear now.

601
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,375
Sak,

602
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,291
come with me.

603
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,875
Yes, Mom.

604
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,041
You guys giggle a lot.

605
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,916
-Right, sir.
-Did you smoke some weed?

606
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,250
The weather is very nice today.

607
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,666
-Indian Rupee?
-Yes, sir.

608
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:05,791
Are you sure?

609
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,833
About what?

610
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,458
That they work at the same place as you.

611
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,166
Why did you say that?

612
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,750
He asked, so I answered.

613
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,500
You really fucked up.

614
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,625
What did you expect?

615
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,833
Want some drugs?

616
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,583
-I quit a long time ago.
-Not for you.

617
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:30,500
I mean, we give him a drug.

618
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,875
What drug?

619
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,458
Here, speed.

620
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,416
Why?

621
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:43,791
Ong-Art and Pakorn
don't look like bankers to you?

622
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:48,791
Not even a little,
especially that Ong-Art guy.

623
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:52,708
Sak told me this old man loves
to find faults in other people.

624
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:55,000
So what?

625
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:57,291
If he takes this drug,

626
00:42:57,375 --> 00:43:00,833
he'll be busy with something else.
He'll stop scrutinizing us.

627
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:04,208
Suree, you don't buy this either?

628
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,000
You don't have to answer.

629
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:12,958
You just question your boy.
I will interrogate those two.

630
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,041
Why am I here?

631
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,541
Just in time.

632
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:37,291
Wow!

633
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,041
-What a beautiful watch you have!
-It's Rado's.

634
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,208
Gold case, same model as George Clooney's.

635
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,791
The weather like this, I think...

636
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,500
we should have a drink.

637
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,083
It would be...

638
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,916
an honor for us.

639
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,708
Wait!

640
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,291
Did you put a drug in here?

641
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,041
I'm an ex-cop, you know?

642
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:11,583
The smell can't trick my nose.

643
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:16,916
Mr. Ex-Cop,

644
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,833
if you are skeptical,

645
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:20,958
I will...

646
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,000
drink first.

647
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,000
Your turn.

648
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,791
-You once told me.
-What?

649
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,666
Don't judge a book by its cover.

650
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,625
Though Ong-Art looks like that,

651
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,708
he's one of the best we have.

652
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:04,916
Really?

653
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,416
Yeah.

654
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,625
Okay.

655
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,125
I believe you.

656
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,500
What's happening to me?

657
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,833
Why do I want to work this much?

658
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,750
The house looks very messy.

659
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,291
It's dusty everywhere. God damn it!

660
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,500
I can't stand it.
This is no place to live.

661
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,916
I have to do something.

662
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,375
-The pill is too strong.
-Hold on.

663
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,291
I can't.

664
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,250
You have to throw up.

665
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:51,000
This is like a country house.
All the dust from the road.

666
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:54,166
Drivers just don't care.
Young man, are you cold?

667
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,500
It's windy here.

668
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,125
You probably ate too much. I forgot.

669
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,375
When you iron,

670
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,500
you have to drench the clothes
like when you fry grasshopper.

671
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,541
So the clothes will be fragrant
and good for wearing.

672
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,083
Young man, you want me to iron your suit?

673
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,083
Take it off and I will take care of it.

674
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,000
I'll get you some water.

675
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,375
Sewing machines

676
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,000
are not only for women,
men can use them, too.

677
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,541
Whether patching, mending,

678
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,000
or stitching, it's as easy as pie.

679
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,541
I grew up
in the Thai Toray Tetoron factory.

680
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,708
Rinse your mouth.

681
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,333
My hand!

682
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,041
God damn it!

683
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:32,208
It's okay. I shed very little blood.

684
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,583
What a big mess! I have to mop the floor.

685
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:37,708
Rinse some more.

686
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:40,166
When you mop the floor,
no need to change the water.

687
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,208
One bucket is enough. Don't waste water.

688
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,541
More. More.

689
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:49,750
Feeling better?

690
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,583
I told you not to drink it.

691
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:53,833
This is not helping.

692
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,916
Maybe I have to go swimming.
I have too much energy.

693
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:05,666
What is going on?

694
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,666
Nothing. The heat got to him.

695
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:31,916
Sakrin.

696
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:06,958
Sakrin!

697
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,791
Hi!

698
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,875
What are you doing here?

699
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,333
Why did you call me?

700
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,916
I saw a guy.

701
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,333
He looked just like you,

702
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:18,208
but he was wearing an office uniform.

703
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:19,708
Yeah?

704
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,833
I took my eyes off him for one second,
and he's gone.

705
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,083
What are you doing here?

706
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,541
I dropped off my regular customer.

707
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,916
Then I picked up some stuff.

708
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,583
Why do you look exhausted?

709
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,125
The stuff is heavy.

710
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,416
-You're sweating a lot, too.
-It's hot today.

711
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,500
Hello, baby!

712
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,666
I don't understand.

713
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,625
I told you to deliver all these papers.

714
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,458
How many times
will you make the same mistake?

715
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:11,208
I didn't mean it, baby.

716
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:16,291
How many times have I told you
not to call me baby at work?

717
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,708
Four times.

718
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:18,666
Wow!

719
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,041
You asked me to note it down.

720
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,875
The first time,

721
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,500
I wanted it sent to Salaya branch.
Where did it go?

722
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,166
Pattaya.

723
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:34,208
The second time,

724
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:36,583
I wanted it sent to Horkanka.
Where did it go?

725
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,833
Saochingcha.

726
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:43,041
Well noted. Just how I taught you.

727
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,208
They sound similar.

728
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,625
Don't.

729
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:47,541
But I--

730
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,750
No, no.

731
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,458
Especially when--

732
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:54,208
Hush...

733
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:58,041
If you can't do simple tasks,

734
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:00,250
you'll be a teller forever, won't you?

735
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,541
Use your brain.

736
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,083
Are you okay?

737
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,916
Not okay.

738
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:41,416
Eat up.

739
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:48,250
It's strange
when your boss is your boyfriend.

740
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,500
When he scolds me,
I don't know how to feel,

741
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,833
scared for being scolded by a boss,

742
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,375
or hurt for being scolded by a boyfriend.

743
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,208
Have you been together long?

744
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:05,166
Quite long, since college years.

745
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,041
He was my senior.

746
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,791
He led the college's cheer squad.

747
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,666
He was a runner, also.

748
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,708
A runner?

749
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,916
Yeah.

750
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,208
-You don't believe it, right?
-Wow!

751
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,416
Let me see.

752
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:29,750
Sorry.

753
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:32,625
That's okay.
Everyone has the same reaction.

754
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,000
He's very different now, right? 

755
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:36,791
-Just a little.
-Liar!

756
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:41,833
Why do you always say things
like words on bumper stickers?

757
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,291
When I say them out loud...

758
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,041
they give me courage.

759
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,041
And more importantly...

760
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:54,916
I can text them as pickup lines.

761
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,750
What did you send?

762
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:13,458
YOU HAVE RECEIVED A PAYMENT

763
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,541
Nice!

764
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,583
I thought you sent me a cheesy line.

765
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:24,791
What if I really had
sent you a cheesy line?

766
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:39,458
Hello?

767
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,875
Now?

768
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,333
Okay.

769
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,416
I have to go to work now.

770
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
What job?

771
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,041
-Delivering some stuff at a carnival.
-Take me with you.

772
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,000
Check, please.

773
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,666
No, let me treat you.

774
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,625
Eight hundred and twenty baht.

775
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,416
It's okay.

776
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:16,958
We can split it.

777
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,500
The gesture makes me happy enough.

778
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:29,166
How about you pay 420,

779
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,458
and I pay 400? You treat me 20 baht, okay?

780
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,083
Okay.

781
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:47,208
How nice!

782
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,416
What's nice?

783
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,333
Usually, I order pork barbeque.

784
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,833
I've never delivered it before. It's fun.

785
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,958
Next time can you deliver it to my house?

786
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,416
Give me one free set.

787
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,750
I will ask the owner for you.

788
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,250
HAUNTED HOUSE

789
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,208
Sakrin.

790
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:35,500
You know what? I love your job.

791
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,416
Why?

792
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,708
You can go anywhere you want.

793
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:42,375
Not like me.
I have to sit in the bank all day.

794
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,875
But I'm the kind of person
who's scared of everything.

795
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,500
I only stay in my safe zone.

796
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:54,625
I thought of quitting the job often.

797
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,375
Several times a day.

798
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,166
I never have the guts to do it.

799
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,666
But when it's time,

800
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,708
I will quit.

801
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,083
What will you do?

802
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,833
What's that?

803
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:13,583
CAPTAIN JAI

804
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,875
Am I crazy?

805
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:22,416
I'm so fed up with uneducated people.

806
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,416
You don't even know how to use a toy gun,
how can you make a living?

807
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,291
It's really easy.

808
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:30,958
Here!

809
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,083
Keep it down.

810
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,333
I said keep the gun down, not your head.

811
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:39,750
I guess you want me to

812
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,458
-beat you up.
-Norasingh!

813
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:44,750
She's our customer.
Can't you spare a child?

814
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,291
Go get some wet dolls.
These dolls are already dry.

815
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,333
Go!

816
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:51,333
Little miss, you shouldn't play with guns.

817
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:54,208
You better go
to the lucky draw booth over there.

818
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,416
Shooting game!

819
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:00,291
Wow!

820
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,666
-Let's go.
-I don't think it's a good idea.

821
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,458
Why not? Let's go.

822
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,833
No.

823
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,416
Let's go.

824
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,666
My dearest fair goers!

825
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,208
Please visit my shooting booth.

826
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,833
The prize is a big doll.

827
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:19,458
Three sets for 100.

828
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,791
Why are you wearing a helmet?

829
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,166
I will tell you later.

830
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,250
I want to know now.

831
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,208
Do you want to play?

832
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,875
-Yes.
-Then, let's go.

833
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,416
Mister.

834
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,791
Mr. Baldy!

835
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,208
Miss,

836
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,125
don't call me baldy.
You are lucky my son is not here.

837
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:51,208
Otherwise, he would kill you.

838
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,125
I'm partly bald.

839
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,583
How much is a round?

840
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,958
Three sets for 100.

841
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,416
I'll give you 200.

842
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,500
With that many bullets,
you can shoot until dawn.

843
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,458
One tray is enough, I think.

844
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,458
How much is one tray?

845
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:10,708
Thirty-five baht.

846
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:12,791
Here it is.

847
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:16,958
Young man!

848
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:18,416
Are you crazy?

849
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,583
Wearing a helmet to a fair.

850
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:24,458
Don't tell me that you are a baldy, too.

851
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:29,208
You don't need to hide it.
Just show your head.

852
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:32,083
Nothing's wrong with a bald head.
Enjoy the game!

853
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,208
How can I get a big doll?

854
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,833
If you can shoot five small ones,
you can get a big one.

855
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:39,208
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the game.

856
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,250
Can you shoot the dolls for me?

857
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:43,291
Okay.

858
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,958
I want that one
next to the red one with the yellow heart.

859
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:53,375
No, not that one.

860
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:55,041
PREECHA

861
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,333
Yes?

862
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,541
Hello, Suree.

863
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,250
I'm working my booth at the temple.

864
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,791
There are many things to see here.

865
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,166
Would you like to come? Shit!

866
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,333
Why did you shoot him?

867
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:19,291
Young man, aim at the dolls.

868
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,958
I'm sorry, sir.

869
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,500
Suree.

870
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,291
The temple at the intersection.

871
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,916
The name of the temple-- Fuck!

872
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,208
That's the name of the temple?

873
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:32,916
Are you fucking crazy?

874
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,375
Which side are you shooting at?

875
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,625
If you shoot at this side,
I'll move to the other side.

876
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,041
You said you wouldn't do that.

877
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,625
It was an accident.

878
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:42,916
Focus.

879
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,416
Suree, are you still there?

880
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,750
It's clear now. Go away!

881
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,666
You aimed at me.
Why don't you shoot my eye? Motherfucker!

882
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,208
Asshole!

883
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:08,500
Where did he go? How fast! What the fuck?

884
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:11,958
Is he gone?

885
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,916
Probably.

886
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,625
Why did you shoot him?

887
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,541
It was an accident.

888
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,375
What about the helmet?
Why are you wearing it?

889
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,916
I forgot to take it off.

890
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,583
-You forgot?
-Yeah.

891
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,541
Why are you smiling?

892
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,125
It's nice to be like this.

893
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,416
What are you talking about?
Let's play something else.

894
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,333
Let's go.

895
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,583
Don't you want to know
about the helmet anymore?

896
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:02,333
No!

897
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,083
JAI

898
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,750
Hello! Are you still awake?

899
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,458
Yes.

900
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,083
Are you free tomorrow night?

901
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,458
I'm not sure.

902
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,125
Never mind, then.

903
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:43,708
I'm free.

904
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:47,333
Can you come with me tomorrow?

905
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:05,375
-How do you know he's cheating on you?
-I just know.

906
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:08,416
Are you sure he's in his room?

907
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,833
Absolutely.

908
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,291
Why did you bring us?

909
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,416
Noi-Nae.

910
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,583
Yes?

911
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,375
Why are you wearing my shirt?

912
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,125
I wanted to try it.

913
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,416
No, no. Don't touch my things.

914
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,625
You know I don't like it.

915
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:41,666
Give my shirt back.

916
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:44,291
Okay.

917
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,750
Which room is it?

918
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:58,291
One...

919
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:03,583
Three...

920
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,791
Your man boobs are very cute.

921
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,083
When I'm excited,

922
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,791
I can't control my boobs.

923
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:20,875
Two...

924
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,333
Five.

925
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:47,208
Jesus!

926
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:48,833
Wow!

927
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,291
This is why you don't read my messages,
right?

928
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,750
Noi-Nae! You bitch!

929
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,166
You sit down! What?

930
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,583
-Calm down, baby!
-Why should I calm down?

931
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,208
Babe, calm down. It's nothing.

932
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,000
Nothing? She's naked.

933
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:04,708
-I'm sure this isn't some game. Don't beg!
-Just don't move.

934
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,041
It's really nothing.

935
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,416
Nothing? Then what is this?

936
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:10,500
-Baby, just stay there.
-I'm the baby, she's the bitch.

937
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,041
You are the baby. I am sorry.

938
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,625
Please help me.

939
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,583
Do you like fake boobs?

940
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,333
They are real.

941
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:18,458
How can they be real?

942
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,083
I can tell they are 350 cc.

943
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,333
Who do you think you are?
You think you are that good?

944
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,833
A lady-killer?
Look at yourself in a mirror, fatty!

945
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:27,208
-Can I leave?
-You want to leave?

946
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,541
-Come here.
-Wait!

947
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,750
-Baby!
-My shirt!

948
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,333
Open the door! Give me some clothes!

949
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,250
Shut up!

950
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,333
Nervous? Why didn't you think
before you acted? Nervous now?

951
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,125
-Open the door!
-Wait.

952
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,250
You...

953
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,625
please help me.

954
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:57,708
Please.

955
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,166
-I think we need to help.
-No, don't.

956
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:03,125
Let's just watch the situation.

957
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,083
Mr. Ae!

958
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,916
-Open the door!
-Just a second.

959
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,166
What is going on here?

960
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,583
-Please help me.
-Don't.

961
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,958
People are fighting. Don't get involved.

962
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:14,291
It's dangerous.

963
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,458
Give me some clothes!

964
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,125
Shit!

965
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,458
You meatball!
I told you to bring me the clothes.

966
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,375
I'm so fed up.

967
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:25,708
All these times,

968
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:28,333
no matter how much you sucked,
or got fat, or changed,

969
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,000
I've never minded.

970
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:31,958
You've never cared, never listened to me.

971
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,833
Whenever I needed help,
you were never there.

972
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,958
Always said you were busy.
You didn't have time.

973
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:38,291
Open the door!

974
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,000
We split the bill at restaurants.
You never treated me.

975
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:43,708
It's okay that you don't treat me.
But sometimes I have to treat you.

976
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,250
Baby, calm down.

977
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,375
I know you are angry, but...

978
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,666
The girl is naked out there.
And this apartment,

979
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:51,958
everyone knows it's my room.

980
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,333
It won't look good for me.

981
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,166
Please help me.

982
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:12,166
Don't worry. Calm down. Chill out!

983
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:42,416
Are you all right?

984
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,833
I guess it's a good thing.

985
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,166
At least, I am out
of one of my safe zones.

986
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:55,250
Thank you for coming with me.

987
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,458
You can go now.

988
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,333
Sak.

989
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:26,750
Do you remember Mr. Wittaya,
your dad's friend who works in a bank?

990
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,166
I think so.

991
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,916
He texted me the other day,

992
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,291
said he had good news.

993
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:35,458
What news?

994
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:38,666
He's going to start working at your bank.

995
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,500
He's throwing a party at the bank,

996
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,375
so he asked me to sing there.

997
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,583
I will introduce you to him.

998
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,208
Shit!

999
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,333
Sakrin.

1000
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,666
-What?
-Are you okay?

1001
01:07:57,083 --> 01:07:58,458
I'm okay.

1002
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,125
Thank you. You can request any song.

1003
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:16,083
Please tell me the songs you like.

1004
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:22,291
It was a disaster at your house.

1005
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:26,083
This place is even worse, too many people.

1006
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,458
You are worried over nothing.

1007
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,250
Are you sure about this?

1008
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,500
Hi!

1009
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:36,500
What did you greet him for?

1010
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:39,541
We have to blend in.

1011
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:43,916
I thought you would bail on this one,
Chatchai.

1012
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,875
Who is Chatchai? I'm Pakorn.

1013
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,500
Pakorn. Really?

1014
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,250
Why did you change your name?

1015
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,583
Too bad.

1016
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:57,166
Pakorn is better.

1017
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,458
Never mind.

1018
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:05,458
Let's drink together tonight.

1019
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:08,291
I will get us some drinks.

1020
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,833
Wait here, Sumet.

1021
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:12,833
I'll be back. Let's go.

1022
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,458
Baby, I need to talk to you.

1023
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,458
I have nothing to talk to you about.

1024
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:09,750
I saw your friend around here.

1025
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:12,208
Who?

1026
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,666
Your bikeman friend.

1027
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,125
But I saw him in a bank uniform.

1028
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:42,333
-Do you see anything?
-He's here. Oh, no.

1029
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:51,750
Uncle!

1030
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:53,625
You are here, too?

1031
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,791
How could I miss such a big event?
Where are you going?

1032
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,958
-I'm hungry. I'm gonna grab something.
-No need.

1033
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:01,625
There's plenty of food here.

1034
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,666
Here. Have some bruschetta.

1035
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,916
Open your mouth.
No, I already bit this one.

1036
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,083
Okay, I'll go grab something.

1037
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,000
Don't go!

1038
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,500
Here, sticky rice and mango. Want some?

1039
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,125
Don't take it. There's only one cup left.
Let me have it.

1040
01:11:14,208 --> 01:11:15,375
I'll get something else for you.

1041
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:17,875
It's okay. I'm full.
I'm going to the toilet.

1042
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,333
What the heck?

1043
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:24,625
He said he wanted to eat something.
Now he's going to the toilet.

1044
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,250
His behavior is really suspicious.

1045
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:42,166
You left us there.

1046
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,041
I didn't leave you guys.

1047
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:45,416
What are these?

1048
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,333
I grabbed the whole tray.

1049
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,208
Only foreign brands.

1050
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:58,583
Let's leave. The longer we stay,
the more problems we'll have.

1051
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,541
Mr. Ae...

1052
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:05,500
I have an urgent matter
that needs your attention.

1053
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,583
Why leave so soon?
There's still plenty of food.

1054
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,000
Preecha.

1055
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:13,958
Have you seen Sak?

1056
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,250
I saw him just now. He went to the toilet.

1057
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,375
Speaking of toilets,

1058
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,708
I've been singing for hours,
I want to pee, too.

1059
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:23,291
I can't hold it anymore. I have to go.

1060
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,708
Is she crazy? 
What's the point of telling me that.

1061
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,833
Let's leave, Sak.

1062
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,500
Are you Sakrin?

1063
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,875
I'm Uncle Wittaya,

1064
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,541
your dad's friend.

1065
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,541
Hello, sir.

1066
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:49,875
-Hi.
-Hi.

1067
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,041
Your mom sent me some photos.

1068
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,666
You are even more handsome in person.

1069
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:57,666
Let's go talk outside.

1070
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,916
Wait! Sorry, sir.

1071
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,125
-Mr. Wittaya?
-Yes.

1072
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:10,333
Since we have the honor of meeting
one of the bank executives,

1073
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,041
how about...

1074
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,875
you have a drink with us,

1075
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,250
the lowly employees?

1076
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,166
Really?

1077
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,458
In the restroom?

1078
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,583
No problem, sir.

1079
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,000
This way, if we get drunk,

1080
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,291
we can vomit here.

1081
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,625
Good idea.

1082
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:31,208
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1083
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,625
Sir, have you seen Sak?

1084
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,500
No.

1085
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,750
What's going on?

1086
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,041
Look at the time.

1087
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,833
Even though the customer's rushing us now,
we still have to work tomorrow.

1088
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,208
They can't hold their liquor.

1089
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,500
Let's go see you mother.

1090
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:02,000
My nephew's name is Suchart.

1091
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,916
He also works here.

1092
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,916
Do you know him?

1093
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,625
-The guy in the glasses?
-He doesn't wear glasses.

1094
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,916
That's him, my nephew.

1095
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,458
Ae, come here.

1096
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,416
That's Suree.

1097
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,125
Wonderful! Now we all can meet.

1098
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,833
Sak.

1099
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,291
-Hello, Director.
-Hi.

1100
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:15,416
Where is Mrs. Pranee's paper?

1101
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,875
Is it in the car?

1102
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,625
Remember? Mrs. Pranee.

1103
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:23,916
Which Pranee?

1104
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,375
That Pranee.

1105
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:28,750
Pranee, Pranee.

1106
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,666
Pranee!

1107
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,375
Please excuse us.

1108
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,416
Uncle, you know that guy?

1109
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,041
He's my friend's son.

1110
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:50,041
Wittaya,

1111
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,583
where did Sak go?

1112
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,750
He said he had some work to do.

1113
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:10,666
Sakrin. What the hell is going on?
You have to explain everything.

1114
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:20,625
I graduated almost a year ago.

1115
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:25,250
I applied for a job at several places.

1116
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,208
They all rejected me.

1117
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,875
That's why I work as a bikeman.

1118
01:16:32,583 --> 01:16:34,416
I'm the only son in the house.

1119
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,208
I can't make any of them proud.

1120
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:40,416
Why do you want to work in a bank?

1121
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,791
It's not a cool job.

1122
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,583
People these days don't think that way.

1123
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,125
I don't care about others.

1124
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:50,750
It's not important
how other people think these days.

1125
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,791
My dad used to be a banker.

1126
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,666
He used to work in a bank.

1127
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:00,250
He was everything for us.

1128
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,083
He provided for us.
Mom and Grandma used to live well.

1129
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:10,083
When my mom looked at him,

1130
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:13,000
it was obvious how she felt.

1131
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:14,791
Now that he's gone,

1132
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,208
everything's changed.

1133
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:21,666
I want my mom to be proud of me
the way she was proud of my dad.

1134
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,166
How long are you going to keep lying?

1135
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:26,541
I don't know.

1136
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:27,958
But...

1137
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,666
I don't know what to do either.

1138
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,083
Don't lie, then. Tell them the truth.

1139
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,875
I'd rather die.

1140
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,458
You are overreacting.

1141
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,416
The truth will never die.
It's okay to tell the truth.

1142
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:44,208
You are not my family,
you don't understand.

1143
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:48,291
So what now?

1144
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,208
Are you going to be a biker
who pretends to be a banker forever?

1145
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:57,083
-That's a stupid idea.
-Yes, it's stupid.

1146
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,125
You don't know what I've been through.

1147
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,958
I sent my resume to dozens of places.

1148
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:04,541
Three times to TMB, four times to SCB,
twice to Kasikorn Bank,

1149
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,791
five times to Bangkok Bank,
six times to GSB, once to Krungsri Bank.

1150
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,750
They all rejected me.

1151
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:12,416
I partnered up with a friend.
He took the money and left.

1152
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,250
It's not like I want to be
a poor bikeman for the rest of my life.

1153
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:23,208
Whatever.

1154
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,416
You wouldn't understand.

1155
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:29,250
Right, I don't understand.

1156
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:33,458
I don't understand
why I care for a loser like you.

1157
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,250
Now I know your secret.

1158
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,208
I will tell everyone.

1159
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:48,833
I'm really drunk.
Let's go home before anybody catches us.

1160
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:50,708
Where did that bastard go?

1161
01:18:58,291 --> 01:18:59,708
You bumped into him.

1162
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,208
Is he dead?

1163
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,416
I don't know if he's dead,

1164
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,541
but he peed his pants.

1165
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,541
Shit. He should have pissed
in the toilet first.

1166
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

1167
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:23,666
I know I'm at fault.

SAKRIN

1169
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,291
If you don't forgive me,
I will keep apologizing.

1170
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,500
Doctor, will he survive?

1171
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,250
He is safe now.

1172
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:50,166
Then why is his tongue like that?

1173
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,958
It's a side effect.

1174
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,583
You agreed to see me.
You're not angry anymore?

1175
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:12,333
Wrong.

1176
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:16,791
But I have something important
to say to you.

1177
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,291
Listen.

1178
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,333
If you are afraid to tell the truth,

1179
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,541
why don't you make it a reality?

1180
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,083
Try again.

1181

NORTH CHINA BANK
AVAILABLE POSITIONS

1182
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,291
I've tried 21 times.

1183
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:38,083
How do you know
you won't succeed the next time?

1184
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,583
Listen.

1185
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:45,166
A lie is like a bandage.

1186
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,791
It can cover up the wound,
but it will never heal it.

1187
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:50,291
Do you want to keep that wound
for the rest of your life?

1188
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:52,625
You can say cheesy things, too?

1189
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:55,833
Don't change the subject.

1190
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:00,500
I will tutor you. Okay?

1191
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,208
Fight!

1192
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:06,916
Fight!

1193
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:09,458
We're starting now?

1194
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,166
You can use this conversation
with Chinese customers.

1195
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,750
Our bank has Chinese customers.

1196
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:27,541
Have you left the house?

1197
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:30,916
Soon. Almost ready.
Let's meet at the station.

1198
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,250
Don't forget your book.

1199
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,916
I won't forget it.

1203

Want to try again?

1204
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,208
YOU DID NOT GET THIS POSITION

1205
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:56,625
The page might not be working properly.
I will check at the bank again tomorrow.

1206
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,791
It's okay.

1207
01:22:58,875 --> 01:23:00,541
You don't need to check it.

1208
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,583
I didn't get the job.

1209
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:45,250
Hello! What's up?

1210
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,541
Ae is going to your house.

1211
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:48,875
What?

1212
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:57,791
Mom.

1213
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:01,875
You are blocking the TV, you know?

1214
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:04,500
I know.

1215
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,833
She just doesn't care.

1216
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,916
Ma'am,

1217
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,333
do you know your son...

1218
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:02,583
is a liar,

1219
01:25:02,666 --> 01:25:03,916
a fraud.

1220
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:08,416
Who? Who is a fraud?

1221
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,000
Your son.

1222
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:42,458
The reason I'm here today
is that I want you to know the truth.

1223
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:45,500
Your son is a liar.

1224
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,500
He did many bad things.

1225
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,166
What did you say? Come again.

1226
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,000
From the beginning?

1227
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,083
Yes.

1228
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Ma'am.

1229
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:00,833
I'm here to tell you...

1230
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:04,166
your son lies about everything.

1231
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,000
He lies to his salami.

1232
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:07,625
What salami?

1233
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:09,791
I'm not talking about salami.

1234
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,666
I meant his family.

1235
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,375
He lies about everything to everyone.

1236
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:18,500
He just keeps lying
and making a big mess, ma'am.

1237
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:19,500
All right.

1238
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,500
Write it down.

1239
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:25,166
Thank you.

1240
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,333
-Ma'am.
-I said write it down.

1241
01:26:29,416 --> 01:26:30,541
Right.

1242
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,833
Serves you right!

1243
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:03,583
A liar like you!

1244
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:07,125
The truth is you are just a lowly bikeman.

1245
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,416
Asshole.

1246
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,625
Stop pretending.

1247
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:19,416
Mom!

1248
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,708
Grandma!

1249
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:23,208
Grandma is dead.

1250
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:31,708
Going through the market
takes seven minutes.

1251
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,000
What are you talking about?

1252
01:27:33,083 --> 01:27:35,500
I am calculating the best route.

1253
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,333
Crossing the railway will take...

1254
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,791
-five minutes.
-What?

1255
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:41,958
Sak! It's a curve!

1256
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,166
Sak!

1257
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,333
Truck!

1258
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,416
A train's coming!

1259
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:29,958
Sak!

1260
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:32,708
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

1261
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,250
HOSPITAL

1262
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:47,541
ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY

1263
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,833
ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY

1264
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:07,250
I'm sorry.

1265
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:12,625
I don't want you to feel embarrassed...

1266
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:14,916
that your son is just a bikeman.

1267
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:20,791
I'm not embarrassed.

1268
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:24,583
But I'm angry that you lied to me
for a long time.

1269
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,166
Why didn't you tell me
before that jerk did?

1270
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,166
Though it was bad, your grandmother and I
would've still felt better than this

1271
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,875
if you had told us yourself.

1272
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,083
We all...

1273
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,166
have lied to others at some point.

1274
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:45,958
I also lied to you.

1275
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:50,291
The day after the party at the bank,

1276
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:54,375
I bought a train ticket and followed you.

1277
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:55,500
FOR MOM

1278
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,208
You might be embarrassed
that you are a bikeman,

1279
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:10,666
but I'm not.

1280
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,583
The way you are not picky about jobs...

1281
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,291
you're doing your best
to support the family.

1282
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:23,708
I think it's too cool and admirable
to be embarrassed about it.

1283
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,166
Honey,

1284
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,125
I am proud of you. You know that?

1285
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:52,583
Believe me. If your dad were here...

1286
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:56,541
he'd have said the same.

1287
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,208
As for your grandmother,

1288
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:25,000
you can apologize to her later.

1289
01:32:48,291 --> 01:32:50,500
These are the medical expenses
up to today.

1290
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,958
BALANCE: 7,423 BAHT

1291
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,875
I heard your grandma's in the hospital
and you don't have any money.

1292
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:57,416
So I want to help out.

1293
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,750
-How would you help me?
-What a question!

1294
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,416
I'll help you pay the bill.

1295
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,875
That's okay.

1296
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,666
You don't need to.

1297
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,958
But I want to help.

1298
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:10,375
I'm already here.

1299
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,041
Hi!

1300
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,000
How did you get here?

1301
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:20,625
The same way you commute.

1302
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:23,125
I'll hang up now.
It's wasting phone credit.

1303
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:31,291
How did you know
my grandmother was in the hospital?

1304
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,291
Everybody knows.

1305
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:39,583
Thank you, but you don't need to help.
The bill is...

1306
01:34:39,666 --> 01:34:40,625
too expensive.

1307
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:50,458
Told you it's expensive.

1308
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,333
There must be a way.

1309
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,250
Look over there.

1310
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,083
There!

1311
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:29,208
Hey, bro!

1312
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:32,875
I heard you don't have enough money.

1313
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,333
So, we...

1314
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:36,041
brought you some.

1315
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:38,916
Give you.

1316
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,583
I and my friends.

1317
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:47,291
Open.

1318
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,458
Where did you get the money from?

1319
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:57,791
How dare you ask that?

1320
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,166
Do I look poor to you?

1321
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,000
You look penniless.

1322
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,083
Listen to him.

1323
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:07,791
I shouldn't have asked.

1324
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,041
So where did you get the money from?

1325
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,375
Fast cash

1326
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:16,625
and a new bike to ride here.

1327
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:19,625
FAST CASH

1328
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:22,708
APPROVED

1329
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:25,958
Take it.

1330
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:28,458
You can pay us back when you can.

1331
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,083
But...

1332
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,000
No "but" between true friends.

1333
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:38,291
Though we are lowly bikemen,

1334
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:42,291
you can trust
we are as good a friend as any.

1335
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:53,833
-How's that?
-You are very cool.

1336
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:17,791
Hello.

1337
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:20,875
Hello. I'm calling from SCB.
May I speak to Mr. Sakrin?

1338
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:21,916
Speaking.

1339
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,166
Our bank has a position available.

1340
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:27,500
We would like to invite you
to work with us.

1341
01:37:27,583 --> 01:37:28,791
What did you say?

1342
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:32,416
You are the first on our waiting list,
so we chose you.

1343
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,541
-Really?
-Yes.

1344
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:37,458
Can you start working next week?

1345
01:37:39,166 --> 01:37:40,958
Next week?

1346
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:45,250
Yes, definitely.

1347
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:48,125
Okay. See you. Bye.

1348
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:49,541
Bye.

1349
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:59,041
What are you grinning about, Sak?

1350
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,208
The bank has a position available.

1351
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,041
You mean...?

1352
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:07,333
Mom!

1353
01:38:07,416 --> 01:38:09,125
Sak got a job at the bank!

1354
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:12,625
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1355
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,833
Great job, my son!

1356
01:38:18,916 --> 01:38:20,208
What are you doing?

1357
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,416
I'm going to bed.

1358
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:25,125
What time do you go to work on Monday?

1359
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:26,958
Why do you ask?

1360
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,583
I have something to tell you.

1361
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,166
About what?

1362
01:38:31,916 --> 01:38:35,208
I will tell you when we meet. Good night!

1363
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:36,125
What?

1364
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,583
Initially,

1365
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:19,041
I want you to work at the front.

1366
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:21,708
-Yes, ma'am.
-If the customers have any problems,

1367
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:23,958
or need some advice,
you can ask your senior colleagues.

1368
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,125
Okay.

1369
01:39:33,916 --> 01:39:37,666
He was fired
because he messed around with a trainee.

1370
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:40,708
It's against our rules.
Don't make the same mistake.

1371
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:41,666
Yes, ma'am.

1372
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,208
Let's continue.

1373
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:46,541
As for this spot,

1374
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:49,333
it's only opened
when we have too many customers.

1375
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:50,625
MISS JARUNEE KITMANGMEE

1376
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,875
Here's your desk.

1377
01:39:56,250 --> 01:40:00,000
She was our employee.

1378
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,375
She just resigned.

1379
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:04,583
But some of her stuff is still here.

1380
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,958
-She quit?
-Yes.

1381
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:11,625
Well, that's it.

1382
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:13,833
I'll see you tomorrow.

1383
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:15,208
Yes, ma'am.

1384
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:20,666
Uye, can you check
if Mr. Ong-Art is coming?

1385
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,916
Where are you?

1386
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,333
What did you do?

1387
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:03,083
What did I do?

1388
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:05,708
You quit the job,
so there's an open position for me.

1389
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,625
If you wanted to help me,
you didn't have to do it this way.

1390
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:12,208
Who said I helped you?

1391
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:14,875
So why did you quit?

1392
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:17,625
I want to get out of my safe zone.

1393
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:20,791
You mean...

1394
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:23,958
you are a pilot now?

1395
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:26,916
No.

1396
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,083
What?

1397
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:31,958
Then why are you wearing this uniform?

1398
01:41:32,041 --> 01:41:36,416
You also wore a bank uniform
when you were not an employee.

1399
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:39,625
I want to try it, too.

1400
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,791
But soon,

1401
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:44,958
I will make it a reality...

1402
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,708
like you did.

1403
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,666
Are you done trying on the uniform?

1404
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:05,916
I'm done.

1405
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,958
Do you want to have dinner? My treat.

1406
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:15,000
Sure.

1407
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:16,833
Did you answer too quickly?

1408
01:42:16,916 --> 01:42:19,583
You don't have to treat me. We can share.

1409
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:22,666
I'll treat you. Don't worry.

1410
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,833
What a sugar daddy!

1411
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,166
It's nice to eat out with a lady.

1412
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:30,958
Can you please be my baby?

1413
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:41,250
-I want to have pork barbeque.
-What?

1414
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,833
No answer for me?

1415
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,041
Let's eat first.

1416
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,291
Okay?

1417
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:17,250
