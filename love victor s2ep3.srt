00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,003
VICTOR:
Dear Simon,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,922
when I came out in
front of the whole school,

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,299
I said I didn't care
what people think...

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,510
‐ Yes, queen!

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,012
VICTOR: But people sure don't mind
telling me what they think.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,473
‐ I want you to know that I see you.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,975
‐ Thanks.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,602
‐ Love is love.

9
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,730
VICTOR:
It's like coming out gave everyone
an excuse to share their opinion.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,900
Or to get my opinion about things
I know nothing about.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,485
‐ Hey, girl!

12
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,736
‐ Me?

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,321
‐ What do you moisturize with?

14
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:31,740
‐ Water.
‐ Water?

15
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,451
[laughs]

16
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,788
Fine, don't share with us
your flawless skin secrets, bitch!

17
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,082
‐ Okay. [chuckles]

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,545
I never thought coming out would be

19
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,297
an invitation for strangers to talk to me.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,260
Or that the people I used to talk to
would suddenly feel like strangers.

21
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,345
COACH FORD:
Hey, Salazar!

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,681
Do you mind if we chat?

23
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,891
‐ Um, yeah, sure.

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,312
COACH FORD:
First day of practice.

25
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,231
How's my star player?

26
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,816
‐ Uh, excited.

27
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,818
I've been practicing
my jump shot all summer.

28
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,902
‐ Great.

29
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:18,412
So, um, I heard about
your recent announcement.

30
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,624
‐ [chuckles] Yeah. It's okay.
We, we really don't have to talk about it.

31
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,295
‐ Listen, I think it's awesome.
I really do. Um...

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,380
I mean, I'm basically gay, myself.

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,341
I've been living with my best friend
Mike for twenty years,

34
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,636
and we share a SodaStream, so...

35
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,890
Okay, um...

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,059
The point I'm trying to make
is that I want you

37
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,478
to feel comfortable and safe

38
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,523
both on the court,
and in the locker room.

39
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,442
And also, uh, in fact,

40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,362
if‐if you would now like to maybe change
away from the other guys,

41
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,072
I mean, we could figure that out.

42
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,202
I actually have an empty coach's office
that nobody's using.

43
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,494
It's got its own shower.

44
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,288
I mean,
you'd have your own changing area!

45
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,373
I mean, Steph Curry
doesn't even have that.

46
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,459
‐ Uh, thanks, but I'll just keep

47
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,586
showering and changing
with the rest of the team.

48
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,339
‐ Victor, um...
[chuckles nervously]

49
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,674
It's, it's not a big deal, but, uh,

50
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,843
there have been some complaints.

51
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,263
‐ Complaints about me changing
with the team?

52
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,767
‐ I'm just trying to keep
everybody happy, okay?

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,894
So would you think about it?

54
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,104
You're a good kid, Victor.

55
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,273
And I'm very proud of you.

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,859
I'll see you at practice. Go, Grizzlies.

57
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,032
‐ ♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be all right ♪

58
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,952
♪ Somebody to tell me
it'll be just fine ♪

59
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,413

TYLER [over phone]:
I still don't get what you're going for.

63
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,595
‐ Um, if I say it's a, a, a
physical manifestation

64
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,807
of the metaphysical
human experience,

65
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,060
does that make me pretentious?

66
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,314
‐ Very. But it also makes you pretty cool.

67
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,192
Where are you, anyway?

68
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,820
Why are you working there
instead of the campus studio?

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,615
‐ Um, so I'm in a, a warehouse off‐campus.

70
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,951
That's a really nice sketch.

71
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,497
‐ Thanks. It's a surrealist take
on my parents' backyard.

72
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,499
‐ How much longer are you gonna
hide out in here during lunch

73
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,293
because you're avoiding Victor‐‐

74
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,379
[scribbling]
TYLER [over phone]:
And that's the totally non‐obnoxious way

75
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,464
I'll fail to be the next Kehinde Wiley.

76
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,092
‐ That is so, uh, thought‐provoking.

77
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,760
Uh, what are you up to tonight?

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,387
‐ I need to finish this piece,

79
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,725
but, uh, there's a party on Buck Row
I was maybe gonna hit up. Why?

80
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,144
‐ Um, no reason. I, um,

81
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,272
I'm mean, I'm probably gonna
just be working, too,

82
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,608
but, uh, maybe send me the deets,

83
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,860
and if I finish early, I'll stop by.

84
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,279
‐ Sounds like a plan.

85
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,656
Bye, Mia.

86
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,992
‐ Bye.
[phone beeps]

87
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,786
[Lake squeals, laughs]
Was that cool?

88
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,915
‐ Um, making art while
seducing older men?

89
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,166
You are literally Beyoncé.

90
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,294
‐ I just got invited to a college party.

91
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,463
Wait. Okay, if I'm a cool college kid,

92
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,381
I need some cool college friends,

93
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,800
so are you and Felix down to come?

94
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,636
‐ Yes. We need a fun night out.

95
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,845
Now come have lunch with us

96
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,764
so we can plan our college party looks.

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,892
‐ Oh, no...

98
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,144
This was for my grandma.

99
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,524
‐ Oops.

100
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,194
[indistinct chatter]

101
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,412
‐ Rainbow sprinkles.

102
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,581
A little on the nose, right?
[chuckles]

103
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,333
‐ Okay, let's get started.

104
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,627
Welcome to PFLAG.

105
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,381
For our first timers,
this is a support group

106
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,552
for parents, families,
and allies of LGBTQ people.

107
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,555
My name is Jack. My son Simon
came out a few years back,

108
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,016
and we're here to talk about
how great, and weird,

109
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,434
and complicated coming out can be.

110
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,478
Not just for the people doing it...

111
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,230
but for all of us.

112
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,065
Uh, sir.

113
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,903
Why don't you start us off?
What's your story?

114
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,573
‐ Sure. Uh, okay, uh,

115
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,993
I'm Armando, and my son just came out.

116
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,952
Yeah.

117
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,913
That's pretty much my story.

118
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,333
Who in your family's gay?

119
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,131
‐ Here she is.

120
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,009
Five‐hundred words, ready to go.

121
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,011
‐ There's nothing
too smart in here, right?

122
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,762
Like any words I wouldn't know
or anything?

123
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,097
‐ It's a solid C plus. Yeah.

124
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,309
We want your improvement to be
miraculous, but believable.

125
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,476
‐ Thanks.

126
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,689
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

127
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,566
How it's going with your mom?

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,860
‐ Still not great,

129
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,362
but I have a new side hustle
to make rent,

130
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,240
and I can pay you back this week.

131
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,576
‐ Cool. No rush.
‐ Cool.

132
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,873
‐ Hey. If you ever wanna, like,

133
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,625
hang out to vent or whatever...

134
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,084
I'm around.

135
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,046
‐ Yeah. Yeah, that would
actually be great.

136
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,672
Thanks.

137
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,549
LAKE:
Hey, bae. Exciting news.

138
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,637
So, we are going with Mia
to a college party tonight.

139
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,475
‐ Uh, tonight?
Uh, I kind of have a lot of homework.

140
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,644
‐ Again? I mean, you're like, crazy smart,

141
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,604
and this school isn't even that good.
What's going on?

142
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,274
‐ I may have started a little business

143
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,527
writing essays for kids.

144
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,696
‐ What? Felix, cheating is serious.

145
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,990
I mean, look what happened
to Olivia Jade's mom.

146
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,743
And more importantly,
Olivia Jade's brand.

147
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,496
I mean, what do you even
need the money for?

148
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,873
‐ DJ equipment.

149
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,877
Yeah, I'm saving up for the new
Pioneer DDJ‐1000SRT‐‐

150
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,505
‐ Okay, I need you to stop
saying letters at me.

151
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:06,301
Felix, I mean, DJ equipment
is not a good reason to cheat.

152
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,013
Or to totally blow off
your girlfriend all week.

153
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,515
I miss you.

154
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,517
‐ I miss you, too.

155
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,728
Okay. All right, I'll,
I'll go to the party.

156
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,105
‐ Yay! Thank you.

157
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,358
So, uh, do you wanna come over
after school so we can hang out before?

158
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,609
‐ Sounds great.

159
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,445
‐ I'm really sorry, Vic.
