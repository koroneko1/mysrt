My mornings usually start around 11.

I don't know. I guess the sun
rises earlier in England or something.

We're not partners.

92
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,957
You can teach me how to be a knight,

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,668
and I can teach you kung fu.

94

You start as a knight's page.

If you're lucky,
you're promoted to squire.

And then, maybe,
if you've managed a heroic deed,

to the Queen for knighthood.

For hundreds of years,

they've used their dark powers
to manipulate their way into society.

Only recently
did the knights discover their plans

157

and banish them from England.

158
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,205

infiltrated the Queen's inner circle,

159

they will tear through England's defenses,

right to the palace doors.

00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,560
[sighs] It's Luthera of Landreth,
the Wandering Blade,

00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,479
Daughter of the Saxon Guard,
Knight of England.

179
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,815
[scoffs] Yeah,
that's like half a day saying that.

180
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,943
If I'm gonna be your page,
can I just call you Wandering Blade?

181
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,529
Or WB? Ooh, that's pretty good.

182
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,032
WB. W, W, W… Debby! Yeah.

183
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,034
No?

184
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,414
Okay, Wandering Blade. Okay, yes.
That's the coolest part anyway.

185
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,958
If you were going to be my page,

186
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,004
you would have to scrub my boots,
carry my gear, make camp.

187
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,882
If necessary, a page
will give their life for their knight.

188
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,343
[chuckles] I can totally do some of that.

189
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928

No.

Oh, I'm so gonna impress you.

197

messing around with silly shortcuts

198
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,742

201

You didn't think it was worth mentioning
that this river is made of lava?

202
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
[laughs] I know, right?

203
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,930
It's pretty intense.
Don't worry, there's a bridge right over--

[whooshing]

205
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,394
Okay, the bridge is gone.

206
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,022
But hey, at least
we know for a fact they came this way!

207
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,858
[Po] It's one of them gauntlet craters!

217
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,592
You stopped me in Wankun,

218
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,679
as far as I know you took us the long way
so you could go vegetable picking,

219
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,432
and now I'm stuck on
the wrong side of a lava river

220
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,310
because your secret way across
was to take the bridge!

We're stuck on
the wrong side of a lava river.

222

You kinda gotta get used to saying "we."

[sighs] Go home, Po.

224
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,113
[Blade] There is no "we."

225
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,452
I never said the bridge
was my secret way across!

some inner peace here,
