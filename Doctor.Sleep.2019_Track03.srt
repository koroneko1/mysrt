it was always
just pictures to me.

138
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:42,873
But I didn't shine like you.

walked through the door.

145

Can't do nothing about that,
I'm sorry to tell you,

but you're not a child.

You're older now.

are the hungriest,
and they'll eat what shines.

or leeches.

153

Can't do nothing about that.

154

What you can do...

155
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:31,822
is turn what they come for
against 'em.

Dark inside.

159
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,937
Same type of dark as your dad.

160
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,439
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma, too,

161
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:52,142
and when he died, I danced.

162
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,912
But he kept on coming back.

163
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:58,248
Standing in my room.

164

165
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:03,788
from whatever mold was
growin' on him in that box.

166
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:09,527
One day, he grabbed me,
and he was real.

167
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,896
His nails were long

168
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,298
from growing in the grave,

169
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:17,100
and they cut me, Doc.

170
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,903

-That is interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,710
Excuse me, miss?

336
00:26:13,743 --> 00:26:16,212
Miss. Miss, you left something
in the theater.

337
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:17,581
You wanna leave me alone.

338
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,290
Well, hi there.

339
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:29,993
You wanna let me go.

340
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:33,997
Oh, no, sweetie.

341
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:36,866
No, I don't.

How far can I get for this?

347
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,955
[man] Four of spades.
What color is this?

348
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,925
Mommy, I made this for you.
It's a secret card.

349
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,793
[Lucy gasps] Mm,
thank you, Abba-doo.

350
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:13,496
Does anyone know a magic word?

351
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,266
-[kids] Ooh, ooh.
-Uh... You.

352
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,935
Abracadabra.

353
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:20,336
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

354
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,706
Okay, you hold the magic wand.

355
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:25,842
Now, everyone,

356
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,811
on the count of three, okay?

357
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:31,748
-One, two, three.
-[kids] Two, three.

358

Abracadabra.

359
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,253
I know magic, too.

360
00:28:37,286 --> 00:28:41,424
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

361
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:44,861
-There you go. You got him?
-[David] Oh.

362
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,530
For my next trick...
Oh, my goodness. Sorry.

Has anyone seen my spoons?

366
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,773
I can do that.

367
00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:58,341
That's nice, sweetie.

368

-[magician] Oh, they're on me?

369

[sighs heavily]

374
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:23,866
Say it with me.
"Just a few more hours."

375
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,468
Just a few more hours.

Well, hi there, sleepyhead.

385
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,912
Sorry.

386
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:45,281
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

387
00:30:45,314 --> 00:30:47,283
You're a tough one.

388
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:48,918
Willful.

389
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:50,553
You know, I checked.

390
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:53,089
Six men in three months

391
00:30:53,122 --> 00:30:56,492
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

392
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:58,361
Why, you've been busy.

393
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,634
[Rose gasps]

394
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:08,938
Snakebite Andi,
that's who you are.

395
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:11,274
So, who am I?

396
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,479
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

397
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:18,214
Just the truth from now on.

398
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:20,350
You will only speak the truth.

399
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:26,188
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

400
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:30,226
[laughs] My God. Works a little
too well, don't it?

401
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:33,229
Here's the deal,
Snakebite Andi.

402
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:36,966
You're a pusher, hmm?
You can push people.

403
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:39,302
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

404
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:44,140
so I'm gonna offer you
a deal I haven't offered anyone
in almost 40 years.

405
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,911
How old are you, darlin'?

406
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:50,713
Fifteen.

407
00:31:50,746 --> 00:31:52,515
Fifteen?

408
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:55,718
Oh, God, what an age.

409
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,988
Springtime of your womanhood,
isn't it?

410
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,991
Mm. You're not a girl anymore,

411
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:05,695
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

412
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,264
Gravity hasn't even
noticed you.

413
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,433
Not at 15.

414
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:13,269
Men, though...

415
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,205
No, no, no. No shame.

416
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,244
You paid that back, didn't you?

417
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:25,715
That's what I'm offering you.
Springtime forever.

418
00:32:25,748 --> 00:32:28,150
Ten years from now,
you're still 15.

419
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,453
A hundred, maybe 17.

420
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:33,556
Eat well,

421
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:37,393
stay young, live long.

422
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:42,465
So, you and your friend...

423
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:45,601
Mm, not my friend.
That's my family.

424
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:48,071
We're the True Knot, dear.

425
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,341
The True Knot.

426
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:56,512
What's tied
can never be untied.

427
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,387
[man] You like it?

428
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,689
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

429
00:34:13,722 --> 00:34:17,093
That's okay.
People love to look at it.

430
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,095
We used to set this up
in the library.

just taking a life all its own.

See, we started with
the clock tower there.

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,103
-[Dan] Oh, yeah.
-[man] Just keeps growing.

434
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,537
Kids call it Teenytown.

435
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,839
The kids build this?

436
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,607
With some help, oh, yeah.

437
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,377
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

438
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:40,483
Are you off the bus
or riding your thumb?

439
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:41,817
Yeah, the bus.

440
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,453
Oh. Not many ride the bus
this far north.

441
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:47,390
Unless they're looking
for work. [sniffs]

442
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,427
Yeah.

443
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:54,396
Change of scenery,

444
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,100
or you running away
from something?

445
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,402
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

446
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:01,604
New face is all.

447
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:03,239
Yeah.

448
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,808
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

449
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:08,911
Oh, yeah.

450
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:14,383
I know that look.
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

451
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:18,254
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

452
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,856
[sighs] You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

453
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:24,827
-Ain't that the bitch?
-[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

Billy paid your first two,
rest's on you.

457
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,904
No pets, no parties, no noise.

Last guy said the same.
Math student.

460
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,612
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

461
00:35:43,645 --> 00:35:46,649
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

462
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:49,552
Wasn't quiet. No, sir.

463
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:52,821
Didn't even paint over this
when he left,
but I'm glad he didn't,

464
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:55,424
'cause I can make this
easy for ya,

so you see it every morning
when you wake.

466
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,698
You sure you wanna
vouch for this pup?

467
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,233
Pretty sure.

468
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:05,501
It's your ass, Billy.

469
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:08,538
Bleedin' heart, this one.

470
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:14,476
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

471
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:17,246
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

472
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,783
Why are you doing this?

473
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,351
You don't know me.

474
00:36:22,384 --> 00:36:24,353
No, I don't.

475
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:27,256
But I know the look,
like I said.

476
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,693
And sometimes
I get this feeling
about people.

477
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:33,629
-Hard to understand, I guess.
-Mm.

478
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:35,498
Easier than you think.

479
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:38,634
-Thanks.
-All right.

That over there
is Grampa Flick...

and he'll lead us. Lie down.

There.

No fear. You understand?

825
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:50,685
We'll all take a nice long
road trip once I'm sure
I've found him.

826
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,756
Until I do, we...

827
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:58,325
You gotta open a canister,
Rosie.

828
01:00:58,358 --> 01:01:02,329
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

829
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:06,434
That kid in Delaware
wasn't so steamy
and it's already showing.

830
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,235
You see Grampa Flick's hair,
yeah?

831
01:01:08,268 --> 01:01:09,704
[Rose] Yeah.

832
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:11,272
-I don't think he's well.
-[chuckles]

833
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:14,008
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

834
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,277
I know.

835
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,213
But we need to eat.
All of us.

836
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:22,717
Are the canisters low?

837
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,285
'Course not.

838
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:27,388
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

839
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,758
-Rosie.
-Mm-hmm?

840
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,227
I might need it
just to find him.

841
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,799
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

842
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,334
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

843
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,069
That's like when rubes say,

844
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:44,405
"50 years ago, people used
to be more neighborly."

845
01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:46,140
But it's true, Rosie.

846
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:48,275
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker, too.

847
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:50,077
I don't know if
it's their cell phones or diets

848
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,779
or their Netflix or what,

849
01:01:51,812 --> 01:01:53,881
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

850
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:55,416
and the ones that I do, Rosie,
are just not that--

851
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:57,852
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

852
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,120
Thank you.

853
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,862
-You know it, Rosie.
-I know what?

854
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,897
It's why you're up here
every day.

855
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,833
It's why you're always up here
no matter what you
tell the others.

856
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:14,235
The world's not as steamy

857
01:02:14,268 --> 01:02:16,370
and you are looking
for a whale.

01:13:16,996 --> 01:13:19,099
Abs, are you okay?

991
01:13:19,132 --> 01:13:20,567
Last night, I...

992
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,602
I'm okay.

993
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:24,137
Sorry about that.

994
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:27,441
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

995
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:31,478
And you pick up
some weird stations.

996
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:32,546
Nothing weird like that.

997
01:13:33,613 --> 01:13:35,015
Not anymore.

998
01:13:39,652 --> 01:13:41,422
[music playing on headphones]

999
01:13:44,524 --> 01:13:45,992
[boy]  My God.

1000
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:48,595
I've gotta study.
If I don't study...

1001
01:13:48,628 --> 01:13:52,132
[boy 2]  Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...

1002
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:54,168
Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.

1003
01:13:55,668 --> 01:13:57,671
[girl]  Why doesn't he like me?

1004
01:13:57,704 --> 01:13:59,606
My hair?
I should change my hair.

1005
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:01,174
[girl 2]  The freak
is staring at me again.

1006
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:03,043
What is she staring at?

1007
01:14:03,076 --> 01:14:04,011
Freak.

1008
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,018
[David] Hey, Abba-doo.

1009
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:46,219
Hey, Dad.

1010
01:14:46,252 --> 01:14:47,855
School okay?

1011
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:50,190
How's the book?

1012
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:52,158
Good. Yeah, going good.

1013
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:54,227
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

1014
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,129
Yeah, it's...

1015
01:14:56,162 --> 01:14:58,798
-It's feeling like--
-I'm going to
start my homework.

1016
01:14:58,831 --> 01:15:02,569
Okay. Good.
That's good, sweetie.

1017
01:15:02,602 --> 01:15:04,704
Think Harvard in three years.

1018
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:05,939
[Abra] We'll see.

1019
01:15:05,972 --> 01:15:07,774
Yeah. We will see.

1020

-[woman on PA]  Thanks so much

1031
01:18:09,789 --> 01:18:11,391
for shopping with us today.

1032
01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:14,094
And remember, we're always
fresh, just for you.

1033
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,759
Well, hi there.

1034
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,201
[gasps] Get out!

1035
01:18:56,269 --> 01:18:58,138
Get out! Get out of my head!

-Ma'am, are you okay?
-No! No.

1040
01:19:13,386 --> 01:19:15,122
Yeah, I'm fine.

1041
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:17,824
I'm fine.

[Billy] Danno?

-Dan? Dan?
-[moans]

1047
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:32,906
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

1048
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:34,141
Come on, Danno.

1049
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:38,111
-What happened?
-Well, you just dropped.

1050
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:40,881
Thought you was
having a stroke.
Who's Tony?

1051
01:19:42,348 --> 01:19:43,917
What?

1052
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:45,018
You kept saying,
"Please help me, Tony."

1053
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:48,454
Oh.

1054
01:19:48,487 --> 01:19:51,291
Well, I'm sorry about that.

Rosie?

[Rose sighs]

1058
01:20:24,023 --> 01:20:25,191
We've got a problem.

1059
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:27,427
-Talk to me.
-The looker?

1060
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,562
Yeah, she found me again.

1061
01:20:29,595 --> 01:20:31,097
-How?
-I don't know.

1062
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,498
I don't care.

1063
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:36,102
We have to have her, Crow.
We have to.

1064
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:38,271
Does she know who you are?
Where we are?

1065
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:42,442
No, I don't know.
I don't think... That's not
the important... Look.

1066
01:20:42,475 --> 01:20:45,011
-I said she's huge steam,
right?
-Mm-hmm.

1067
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:47,313
Yeah, it's even bigger
than that.

1068
01:20:47,346 --> 01:20:49,015
I tried to turn around in her

1069
01:20:49,048 --> 01:20:52,118
and she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

1070
01:20:52,151 --> 01:20:55,021
-Bullshit.
-No. Never happened
to me, ever.

1071
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,857
I would have said
that was impossible.

1072
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,627
Is she food
or do we turn her?

1073
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:03,296
We don't turn her.

1074
01:21:03,329 --> 01:21:04,898
Rosie, are you sure?

1075
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:06,399
If she's what you say she is,
then--

1076
01:21:06,432 --> 01:21:09,435
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

1077
01:21:09,468 --> 01:21:11,438
Jeez. Think about it.

1078
01:21:18,511 --> 01:21:19,980
What if she's neither?

1079
01:21:20,646 --> 01:21:21,948
What do you mean?

1080
01:21:21,981 --> 01:21:24,450
I mean, we don't kill her.

1081
01:21:24,483 --> 01:21:26,253
And we don't turn her.

1082
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,289
Think of a cow.

1083
01:21:29,322 --> 01:21:32,025
You butcher one, that gives you
meat for a month.

1084
01:21:33,392 --> 01:21:35,195
Keep it alive,

1085
01:21:36,128 --> 01:21:38,331
take care of it,

1086
01:21:38,364 --> 01:21:41,200
it gives you milk for years.

1087
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:43,303
-Rosie, we've never tried that.
-I know.

1088
01:21:43,336 --> 01:21:45,305
Because a steam head is
dangerous.

1089
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,006
You keep it alive,
it could be dangerous.

1090
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:49,575
I know. The point... [chuckles]

1091
01:21:49,608 --> 01:21:52,178
The point, Crow,

1092
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:54,381
is she's the great white whale.

1093
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:56,983
And I want her.

1094
01:21:58,684 --> 01:22:00,253
I want her.

1095
01:22:01,654 --> 01:22:03,657
I fucking want her.

1096
01:22:14,567 --> 01:22:16,102
[Lucy] Have a great day.

1097
01:22:16,135 --> 01:22:17,304
You, too.

1098

[kids chattering excitedly]

1101
01:23:44,523 --> 01:23:46,226
[Abra]  Hi.

1102
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:57,670
[Dan] Billy.

1103
01:24:15,888 --> 01:24:17,657
[Abra]  You can hear me.

1104
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:20,226
Let's use our outside voices,
all right?

1105
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,229
You tracked me down?

1106
01:24:23,262 --> 01:24:27,834
It was easier than I thought.
Like GPS, but in my head.

1107
01:24:27,867 --> 01:24:33,139
Look, I don't mean any offense,
but this day and age,
a grown man

1108
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:35,108
sitting with a teenage girl
on a park bench...

1109
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:37,810
I'm Abra Stone. And if anyone
asks, you're my uncle.

1110
01:24:37,843 --> 01:24:39,379
Uncle Dan.

1111
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:45,318
And that's not even a lie.
Not totally.

1112
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:47,453
We're related in other ways.

1113
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,322
You're magic, like me.

1114
01:24:50,856 --> 01:24:52,725
I don't know about magic.

1115
01:24:53,759 --> 01:24:55,328
I...

1116
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:56,863
I always called it the shining.

1117
01:24:56,896 --> 01:24:58,765
And, yeah, we both shine.

1118
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,400
Do your parents know?

1119
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:03,136
About my shine?

1120
01:25:04,603 --> 01:25:05,905
They're scared of it,

1121
01:25:05,938 --> 01:25:08,508
but they think it's gone
except for a few things.

1122
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:11,911
Like, my mom sometimes asks me
to help her find
something she's lost.

1123
01:25:11,944 --> 01:25:13,813
Last month,
it was her car keys.

1124
01:25:13,846 --> 01:25:16,649
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

1125
01:25:16,682 --> 01:25:19,418
But they don't talk about it.

1126
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:22,588
Or if I use it,
they look at me different.

1127
01:25:22,621 --> 01:25:24,323
Or not at all.

1128
01:25:24,356 --> 01:25:26,792
Not for a whole day once.

1129
01:25:26,825 --> 01:25:28,695
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

1130
01:25:30,863 --> 01:25:33,166
So, I try not to use it.

1131
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,301
Because if people find out,

1132
01:25:35,334 --> 01:25:36,769
"Eek, a freak." You know?

1133
01:25:38,704 --> 01:25:40,473
Sure you know.

1134
01:25:40,506 --> 01:25:42,442
You try not to use it, too.

1135
01:25:44,543 --> 01:25:47,547
You've been trying a long time,

1136
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,817
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

1137
01:25:54,954 --> 01:25:56,556
When I was a kid, I didn't

1138
01:25:56,589 --> 01:25:59,425
understand the shining.
I called it "Tony."

1139
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:01,761
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

1140
01:26:01,794 --> 01:26:04,830
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

1141
01:26:04,863 --> 01:26:06,933
for a long time.

1142
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,737
How many of us are out there?

1143
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,739
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

1144
01:26:13,772 --> 01:26:15,374
they don't even know it.

1145
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:16,709
They always seem to come home

1146
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:18,544
with flowers
when their wives are sad,

1147
01:26:18,577 --> 01:26:20,846
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

1148
01:26:20,879 --> 01:26:22,715
But I only met
two or three people

1149
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:24,951
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

1150
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:29,655
The baseball boy shined.

1151
01:26:29,688 --> 01:26:31,591
His name was Bradley Trevor.

1152
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,896
These people...

1153
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:39,732
they look like people anyway,
they took him.

1154
01:26:40,799 --> 01:26:42,802
And they ate him.

1155
01:26:43,936 --> 01:26:45,805
They ate his shine.

1156
01:26:46,705 --> 01:26:49,275
You could feel it?

1157
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:51,711
And they could feel me,
I think.

1158
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:54,280
At least one of them did.
A lady.

1159
01:26:55,714 --> 01:26:57,383
The lady with the hat.

1160
01:26:58,717 --> 01:27:01,887
I wanna find them, stop them,

1161
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,925
because I think
they've done this to
a lot of other kids, too.

1162
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,394
So, I have to do something,
right?

1163
01:27:09,361 --> 01:27:11,530
Why did you come here?

1164
01:27:11,563 --> 01:27:12,965
Why me?

1165
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:14,700
Because you can hear me.

1166
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:17,470
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1167
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:19,305
And they hurt people like us.

1168
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,976
I mean, what would you do?

1169
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:27,647
If you could get
something of his,

1170
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,981
if you could go to Iowa...

1171
01:27:29,014 --> 01:27:30,783
-Whoa, hang on.
-I can help you find him.

1172
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,618
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1173
01:27:32,651 --> 01:27:34,620
They could bury him right,
at least.

1174
01:27:34,653 --> 01:27:36,756
We could also get his glove.

1175
01:27:36,789 --> 01:27:38,524
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1176
01:27:38,557 --> 01:27:39,959
Easy. Easy.

1177
01:27:39,992 --> 01:27:42,628
Because Barry the Chunk,
I think that was his name,

1178
01:27:42,661 --> 01:27:44,797
for a while,
before they killed him,

1179
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,599
he was wearing it.

1180
01:27:58,043 --> 01:28:00,846
Abra, go home.

1181
01:28:00,879 --> 01:28:03,783
Think about your school.
Think about your parents.

1182
01:28:03,816 --> 01:28:05,785
Think about
the rest of your life.

1183
01:28:05,818 --> 01:28:07,887
Don't chase these people.

1184
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,822
Don't aggravate them.

1185
01:28:09,855 --> 01:28:12,892
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1186
01:28:12,925 --> 01:28:14,727
Don't shine.

1187
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,462
Find something, anything...

1188
01:28:16,495 --> 01:28:20,399
Well, almost anything,
to stop that shine of yours.

1189
01:28:20,432 --> 01:28:23,069
Keep your head down, keep your
shine down and hope to God

1190
01:28:23,102 --> 01:28:25,738
that these people
or anything like them,

1191
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:28,674
that they don't see you.

1192
01:28:28,707 --> 01:28:31,377
If they see you,
they come back.

1193
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,912
Abra, do you hear me?

1194
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:35,715
They come back.

1195
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,620
Keep your head down. Stay safe.

1196

Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

It's nothing.

You are. And you don't want to.

Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

What happens to them

I missed you.

Has it been a long time?

Can't tell.

Eight years. Little more.

I'm here because
it all comes 'round.

Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1244

You listen, son.

1245
01:31:58,984 --> 01:32:02,054
It hurts to be here,
so I'll only say it once.

1246
01:32:02,087 --> 01:32:05,558
These empty devils
ever found you

1247
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:07,192
when you was a tyke,

1248
01:32:07,225 --> 01:32:09,695
if they'd even sniffed you,

1249
01:32:09,728 --> 01:32:11,664
you'd be long dead.

1250
01:32:11,697 --> 01:32:16,635
They're on the land
like a cancer on the skin.

1251
01:32:16,668 --> 01:32:19,204
Once, they rode camels
in the desert.

1252
01:32:19,237 --> 01:32:22,842
Once, they drove caravans
across Eastern Europe.

1253
01:32:23,775 --> 01:32:26,011
They eat screams,

1254
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:28,647
and drink pain,

1255
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,317
and they've noticed
that little girl.

1256
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:33,986
They might kill her,

1257
01:32:35,687 --> 01:32:36,923
might turn her,

1258
01:32:38,824 --> 01:32:41,694
or might keep her
till she's all used up,

1259
01:32:41,727 --> 01:32:43,128
and that'd be worst of all.

Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

1264

You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

and I'm still on the hook.

am I supposed to do?

It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

1271
01:33:23,201 --> 01:33:24,971

several residents of the street
reported a tremor

1287

that rattled windows,
shook floors,

1288
01:34:30,102 --> 01:34:33,839
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves.

1289

Although the Geological Survey
Center in Wrentham

in New England last Tuesday."

I think, maybe.

I'm not a hundred percent,
but I'll take fifty-fifty.

She did that, shook a whole
street in New Hampshire--

1297
01:34:54,426 --> 01:34:57,196
Having a place to actually
focus on, not just a town,
but a street,

1298
01:34:57,229 --> 01:35:00,232

Hey, Mom.

We missed you at dinner.

I'm okay. Just had a rough day.

I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

I'll be back as soon as I can.

Abs, is she...

Is she gonna
pull through this time?

I don't know.

I really hurt her.

I hurt her and she deserved it

Did someone promise you that,
Andi?

1405

Did someone say
you're immortal?

1406

I said, "Live long, eat well."

We can live long, very long.

1408

while you fed on kings,
and princes, and popes.

01:44:48,019 --> 01:44:50,689
They wrote myths of you,

1423

and made statues,

1424
01:44:53,057 --> 01:44:57,862
and they trembled
in their villages, and beds,

1425

You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

Yeah, what--

You think I'm an honest man?
A good man?

I do, I do. Dan, I--

I need your help.

1445
01:46:20,545 --> 01:46:22,080
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1446
01:46:22,113 --> 01:46:24,816
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

Oh, hey.

Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1450
01:46:46,971 --> 01:46:49,774
Yeah, but I wanted
to tag along.

1451
01:46:49,807 --> 01:46:51,042
How long have you been driving?

1452
01:46:51,075 --> 01:46:52,811
A few hours or so.

1453
01:46:52,844 --> 01:46:54,579
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1454
01:46:57,014 --> 01:46:58,750
Who's that?

1455
01:46:58,783 --> 01:47:00,118
He's my friend.

1456
01:47:01,085 --> 01:47:02,721
Maybe my best friend.

1457
01:47:04,088 --> 01:47:06,057
You should've seen her face.

1458
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:08,126
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1459
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,028
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1460

All those kids she's killed.

1461
01:47:11,863 --> 01:47:14,933
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1462
01:47:14,966 --> 01:47:16,534
That was a new trick.

1463
01:47:16,567 --> 01:47:18,069
I've never done that before.

1464
01:47:18,102 --> 01:47:20,038
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1465
01:47:20,905 --> 01:47:22,474
Like a library.

1466
01:47:22,507 --> 01:47:24,743
I guess
we're all libraries inside.

1467
01:47:25,676 --> 01:47:27,111
How'd you do it?

1468
01:47:27,144 --> 01:47:29,514
Like this. Just a little push.

-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
-It's okay.

1473
01:47:46,097 --> 01:47:48,032
What were all those boxes?

1474
01:47:48,065 --> 01:47:49,167
Nothing.

1475
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,569
Liar.

1476
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:55,940
When I was a kid,

1477
01:47:55,973 --> 01:47:59,043
younger than you,
I bumped into something
like these things

1478
01:47:59,076 --> 01:48:01,913
that ate like they do.

1479
01:48:01,946 --> 01:48:04,149
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1480
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:10,588
They closed it down after
and let it rot.

1481
01:48:10,621 --> 01:48:12,824
But the things
that lived there, they...

1482
01:48:14,892 --> 01:48:16,928
Don't go poking around in there
again.

1483
01:48:16,961 --> 01:48:19,631
Okay, I won't. I promise.

1484
01:48:25,202 --> 01:48:27,005
[exhales heavily]

1485
01:48:32,944 --> 01:48:35,213
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1486
01:48:35,246 --> 01:48:36,681
Good.

1487
01:48:36,714 --> 01:48:37,982
Get the caravan on the road

1488
01:48:38,015 --> 01:48:39,584
and we'll have her
in a day or two.

1489
01:48:39,617 --> 01:48:42,053
I don't think
you should come, Rosie.

1490
01:48:42,086 --> 01:48:45,023
[scoffs] The fuck
did you just say?

1491
01:48:45,056 --> 01:48:46,224
She tagged you.

1492
01:48:46,257 --> 01:48:47,725
She got in your head.

1493
01:48:47,758 --> 01:48:49,627
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1494
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,563
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1495
01:48:51,596 --> 01:48:52,897
She's mine, Crow.

1496
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,232
Right now, as far as we know,

1497
01:48:54,265 --> 01:48:56,768
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1498
01:48:56,801 --> 01:48:58,803
Now, if she sees you coming,

1499
01:48:58,836 --> 01:49:00,104
she could run

1500
01:49:00,137 --> 01:49:02,073
or set another trap.

1501
01:49:03,674 --> 01:49:06,010
I will knock her out cold.

1502
01:49:06,043 --> 01:49:09,113
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1503
01:49:09,146 --> 01:49:12,317
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1504
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:15,119
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1505
01:49:15,152 --> 01:49:17,055
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1506
01:49:17,088 --> 01:49:18,289
I should be there.

1507
01:49:18,322 --> 01:49:20,258
You know I'm right about this.

1508
01:49:24,729 --> 01:49:25,897
Okay.

1509
01:49:27,765 --> 01:49:29,834
I'll leave Andi here with you,
if you want.

1510
01:49:29,867 --> 01:49:32,604
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1511
01:49:32,637 --> 01:49:34,606
If she pulls a trick on you,

1512
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,674
stay together.

1513
01:49:36,707 --> 01:49:37,642
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

1514
01:49:37,675 --> 01:49:39,010
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

1515
01:49:39,043 --> 01:49:41,112
But I got some tricks
of my own.

1516
01:49:47,051 --> 01:49:48,853
[Billy] Hey,
I think we're here.

1517
01:49:51,288 --> 01:49:52,257
[Dan] Okay.

1518
01:49:53,958 --> 01:49:55,594
I'll see if I can get her.

1519
01:49:56,827 --> 01:49:57,729
Abra?

1520
01:49:59,697 --> 01:50:02,400
[Abra] That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1521
01:50:02,433 --> 01:50:04,002
She says to pull around back.

1522
01:50:04,035 --> 01:50:05,136
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1523
01:50:05,169 --> 01:50:06,938
She'll tell us when to stop.

1524
01:50:13,277 --> 01:50:15,279
[Billy] I gotta tell you,
Danno,

1525
01:50:15,312 --> 01:50:17,949
I don't know whether
I hope you're right
or wrong about this.

1526
01:50:17,982 --> 01:50:21,653
I mean, if you're wrong,
my friend is crazy.

1527
01:50:21,686 --> 01:50:25,423
I mean, full-blown,
mental breakdown,

1528
01:50:25,456 --> 01:50:29,193
imaginary-monsters-
killing-imaginary-kids

1529
01:50:29,226 --> 01:50:30,928
bonkers.

1530
01:50:30,961 --> 01:50:33,331
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1531
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:35,967
If you're right, though...

1532
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,702
[Dan] I know.

1533
01:50:37,735 --> 01:50:39,137
It's much worse.

1534
01:50:53,317 --> 01:50:54,886
You should go home.

1535
01:50:54,919 --> 01:50:56,721
What?

1536
01:50:56,754 --> 01:50:58,056
No, not you.

1537
01:50:59,123 --> 01:51:00,358
I can handle it.

1538
01:51:00,391 --> 01:51:03,061
No. We'll take it from here.

1539
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,966
Okay, it's just us.

1540
01:51:24,949 --> 01:51:26,184
You smell that?

1541
01:51:29,153 --> 01:51:31,456
Used to hunt.
I ever tell you that?

1542
01:51:31,489 --> 01:51:32,890
[Dan] No.

1543
01:51:32,923 --> 01:51:33,758
Deer.

1544
01:51:34,425 --> 01:51:35,894
This one summer,

1545
01:51:37,027 --> 01:51:38,930
I clipped this buck.

1546
01:51:38,963 --> 01:51:41,299
I was tracking it for two days.

1547
01:51:41,332 --> 01:51:44,736
I got the shot, clipped him.

1548
01:51:44,769 --> 01:51:47,004
He ran off, I went after.

1549
01:51:47,037 --> 01:51:50,408
Figured he wasn't
gonna last long.

1550
01:51:50,441 --> 01:51:52,243
[panting]

1551
01:51:52,276 --> 01:51:53,911
Then he vanished.

1552
01:51:53,944 --> 01:51:56,981
Just up and evaporated.

1553
01:51:57,014 --> 01:51:59,451
Not a trace. Truly baffling.

1554
01:52:02,419 --> 01:52:03,921
Five days later,

1555
01:52:03,954 --> 01:52:06,891
I'm trying a different spot,
miles away.

1556
01:52:06,924 --> 01:52:10,028
I come around looking
for a spot
for a blind...

1557
01:52:11,962 --> 01:52:13,231
then I smelled him.

1558
01:52:14,832 --> 01:52:16,134
Smelled him.

1559
01:52:17,234 --> 01:52:19,103
Found that buck

1560
01:52:19,136 --> 01:52:21,372
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1561
01:52:22,206 --> 01:52:23,908
dead for days.

1562
01:52:25,242 --> 01:52:26,811
The smell...

1563
01:52:28,078 --> 01:52:29,948
Never hunted a day since.

1564
01:52:33,417 --> 01:52:35,386
This is the same smell.

1565
01:52:40,524 --> 01:52:41,793
[Dan grunts]

1566
01:52:51,302 --> 01:52:52,804
Billy.

1567
01:53:07,184 --> 01:53:09,487
[both grunting]

1568
01:53:12,289 --> 01:53:13,491
Oh, my God!

1569
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:18,429
[gagging]

1570
01:53:22,433 --> 01:53:24,335
[both exclaim]

1571
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:27,405
[retching]

1572
01:53:31,508 --> 01:53:32,811
[gagging]

1573
01:53:34,545 --> 01:53:36,414
[Billy continues retching]

1574
01:53:38,249 --> 01:53:39,350
[coughing]

1575
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:41,586
[groaning]

1576
01:53:46,523 --> 01:53:47,558
[Billy] Fuck.

1577
01:53:47,591 --> 01:53:50,127
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1578
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:52,897
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1579
01:53:52,930 --> 01:53:53,932
I'm sorry, Billy.

1580
01:53:55,566 --> 01:53:57,235
[Billy] What did you
get us into?

1581
01:54:05,643 --> 01:54:07,211
[Billy] The people
who did that...

1582
01:54:07,244 --> 01:54:08,379
[Dan] They're not people.

1583
01:54:09,647 --> 01:54:12,483
No. No, they ain't.

1584
01:54:12,516 --> 01:54:14,252
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1585
01:54:15,586 --> 01:54:17,922
they ain't people.

1586
01:54:17,955 --> 01:54:19,156
[Abra] Did you get it?

1587
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:20,291
Yeah, we got it.

1588
01:54:20,324 --> 01:54:22,159
Is she back?

1589
01:54:22,192 --> 01:54:24,095
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1590
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,230
We got a stop to make.

1591
01:54:27,631 --> 01:54:30,101
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1592
01:54:30,601 --> 01:54:32,303
No.

1593
01:54:32,336 --> 01:54:34,639
-Yeah.
-No. They almost think
I'm normal.

1594
01:54:34,672 --> 01:54:36,274
If I tell them, they'll...

1595
01:54:36,307 --> 01:54:37,975
[Dan] Rose'll go through them
to get to you.

1596
01:54:38,008 --> 01:54:39,410
You know that, don't you?

1597
01:54:39,443 --> 01:54:41,245
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1598
01:54:41,278 --> 01:54:43,081
And she's coming, Abra.

1599
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,450
They need to know.

1600
01:54:47,084 --> 01:54:48,386
[Abra sighs]

1601
01:54:50,187 --> 01:54:52,423
So, what's this stop
we gotta make?

1602
01:54:52,456 --> 01:54:54,592
You still got
those old deer rifles?

1603
01:55:12,209 --> 01:55:14,011
You're Uncle Dan?

1604
01:55:14,044 --> 01:55:15,379
-The fuck you think you are?
-Sir...

1605
01:55:15,412 --> 01:55:17,381
Hmm? Hmm? She is 13 years old!

1606
01:55:17,414 --> 01:55:18,716
Abra, I told you to show him.

1607
01:55:18,749 --> 01:55:20,518
-I told him.
-Well, that's not the same.

1608
01:55:20,551 --> 01:55:21,953
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police, huh?

1609
01:55:21,986 --> 01:55:23,120
-Hey, hey, hey!
-No, no, no. Abra.

1610
01:55:23,153 --> 01:55:24,288
Now, don't you say her name.

1611
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:25,356
Abra...

1612
01:55:26,423 --> 01:55:28,960
[David screaming]

1613
01:55:33,163 --> 01:55:34,365
[screaming stops]

1614
01:55:40,237 --> 01:55:43,507
[Dan] I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.
I am a friend.

1615
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:46,010
Everything she told you
is true.

1616
01:55:47,544 --> 01:55:48,746
[bottle rattles]

1617
01:55:48,779 --> 01:55:50,514
What the hell is happening?

1618
01:55:50,547 --> 01:55:52,316
I'm sorry.

1619
01:55:52,349 --> 01:55:54,685
Abra needs to
show you something.

1620
01:55:54,718 --> 01:55:56,120
[Billy]  I saw the boy.

1621
01:55:56,153 --> 01:55:57,155
I saw his body.

1622
01:55:57,788 --> 01:55:59,323
It's all true.

1623
01:55:59,356 --> 01:56:00,692
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1624
01:56:02,059 --> 01:56:03,728
You think about that?

1625
01:56:03,761 --> 01:56:05,196
Not for long, I didn't.

1626
01:56:05,229 --> 01:56:07,531
Mr. Stone,
your daughter is special.

1627
01:56:07,564 --> 01:56:08,766
Don't talk about her.

1628
01:56:08,799 --> 01:56:11,102
I think you know that.
Deep down.

1629
01:56:12,669 --> 01:56:15,406
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1630
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:17,241
and she knows who did it.

1631
01:56:18,242 --> 01:56:19,310
Show him.

1632
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,182
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1633
01:56:25,215 --> 01:56:27,451
I really didn't want to.

1634
01:56:27,484 --> 01:56:28,586
Didn't want to what?

1637
01:56:47,237 --> 01:56:48,239
No, thanks.

1638
01:56:48,272 --> 01:56:49,607
No.

1639
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:50,775
[bottle rattles]

1640
01:56:58,549 --> 01:56:59,784
Those people...

1641
01:57:01,585 --> 01:57:03,454
they know about my daughter?

1642
01:57:03,487 --> 01:57:05,189
They do.

1643
01:57:05,222 --> 01:57:07,658
And sooner or later,
they're coming.

1644
01:57:07,691 --> 01:57:09,293
We gotta do something.

1645
01:57:09,326 --> 01:57:11,362
All right, we're calling
the police, the FBI...

1646
01:57:11,395 --> 01:57:14,098
[Dan] These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1647
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:15,633
They're rich, connected.

1648
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:18,202
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1649
01:57:18,235 --> 01:57:19,670
But where are they?

1650
01:57:19,703 --> 01:57:22,139
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1651
01:57:22,172 --> 01:57:24,175
Abra can answer that...

1652
01:57:24,208 --> 01:57:25,510
if she's ready.

1653
01:57:26,677 --> 01:57:27,745
I'm ready.

1654
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:39,723
You sure you wanna do this?

1655
01:57:39,756 --> 01:57:41,225
I have to.

1656
01:57:48,765 --> 01:57:50,201

Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1659
01:58:27,671 --> 01:58:29,540
The trees haven't
changed that much,

1660
01:58:29,573 --> 01:58:31,909
so maybe Massachusetts,

1661
01:58:31,942 --> 01:58:33,844
-but they're close.
-Rose?

1662
01:58:33,877 --> 01:58:35,746
Didn't see her.

1663
01:58:35,779 --> 01:58:37,315
But they're coming.

1664
01:58:41,218 --> 01:58:43,587
This is the only room she saw?

1665
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:44,922
That's right.

1666
01:58:44,955 --> 01:58:48,325
And I made a few changes.
Hid a few things.

1667
01:58:48,358 --> 01:58:50,361
All right.

1668
01:58:50,394 --> 01:58:52,630
Well, they'll be trying
to track you,

1669
01:58:52,663 --> 01:58:54,465
trying to catch on.

1670
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:57,635
And you're gonna let them.

1671
01:58:59,203 --> 01:59:00,504
Are you crazy?

1672
01:59:00,537 --> 01:59:02,773
Possibly, but you're
gonna let them.

1673
01:59:02,806 --> 01:59:05,309
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1674
01:59:06,343 --> 01:59:07,645
A magic trick?

1675
01:59:15,519 --> 01:59:17,555
They're following us.

1676
01:59:17,588 --> 01:59:20,424
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1677
01:59:20,457 --> 01:59:21,425
I know.

1678
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:54,692
This should work.

1679
01:59:54,725 --> 01:59:57,261
Good blinds over there,
and there.

1680
02:00:00,564 --> 02:00:01,665
They still close?

1681
02:00:01,698 --> 02:00:02,800
Getting closer, I think.

1682
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:04,835
This is tough.

1683
02:00:04,868 --> 02:00:07,371
I know. I know.
Not much longer.

1684
02:00:10,974 --> 02:00:12,577
Okay, Crow Daddy,

1685
02:00:13,577 --> 02:00:14,879
go get her.

1686
02:01:01,825 --> 02:01:04,495
You look relaxed.

1687
02:01:04,528 --> 02:01:06,931
You feel relaxed,
don't you, Abra?

1688
02:01:08,332 --> 02:01:09,400
I guess.

1689
02:01:09,433 --> 02:01:10,568
[Andi] You should.

1690
02:01:11,368 --> 02:01:13,003
Just relax.

1691
02:01:13,036 --> 02:01:14,672
We're friends.

1692
02:01:14,705 --> 02:01:16,440
You're friends.

1693
02:01:16,473 --> 02:01:17,608
[Andi] That's right.

1694
02:01:18,642 --> 02:01:20,744
Just friends.

1695
02:01:20,777 --> 02:01:23,814
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1696
02:01:25,582 --> 02:01:26,717
Good friends.

1697
02:01:31,054 --> 02:01:32,556
Well, shit.

1698
02:01:32,589 --> 02:01:34,058
The way they talked you up,

1699
02:01:34,091 --> 02:01:36,093
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

down on the sad events today,

02:08:02,145 --> 02:08:04,414
Like I said,

1800
02:08:04,447 --> 02:08:06,717
outcome hasn't changed.

1801
02:08:07,917 --> 02:08:09,753
[footsteps approach]

1802
02:08:13,523 --> 02:08:15,459
[breathes heavily]

1803
02:08:27,003 --> 02:08:28,205
[Dan] No.

1804
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:31,374
Please.

1805
02:08:31,407 --> 02:08:33,477
Oh, please, please, please.

1806
02:08:35,044 --> 02:08:36,080
Please.

1807
02:08:39,783 --> 02:08:41,051
Abra!

1808
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,723
Abra.

1809
02:08:46,556 --> 02:08:47,891
[grunts]

1810
02:08:47,924 --> 02:08:49,927
[breathing heavily]

1811
02:08:52,796 --> 02:08:54,064
Tony?

1812
02:08:56,099 --> 02:08:57,968
Help me, please, Tony.

1813
02:09:03,573 --> 02:09:04,875
God.

1814
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:12,216
[sobs]

1815
02:09:15,218 --> 02:09:17,420
Okay. Okay.

1816
02:09:17,453 --> 02:09:18,989
Okay, okay.

1817
02:09:19,022 --> 02:09:21,424
Okay, you always said...
[sniffs]

1818
02:09:21,457 --> 02:09:23,226
your brain was like a radio.

1819
02:09:23,259 --> 02:09:26,062
No one's answering when you
call, so stop calling.

1820
02:09:26,095 --> 02:09:27,498
And just listen.

1821
02:09:29,966 --> 02:09:31,235
[grunting]

1822
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:35,539
[voices speaking indistinctly]

1823
02:09:45,248 --> 02:09:47,584
[Abra]  Dan. Dan.

1824
02:09:47,617 --> 02:09:49,019
Help.

1825
02:10:03,099 --> 02:10:04,201
Hi.

1826
02:10:04,234 --> 02:10:05,302
[whispers] Dan.

1827
02:10:08,504 --> 02:10:09,873
Did he drug you?

1828
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:12,409
I'm so sorry.

1829
02:10:14,177 --> 02:10:16,112
I'm gonna try something, okay?

1830
02:10:16,145 --> 02:10:17,113
But you're weak.

1831
02:10:17,146 --> 02:10:18,982
He's blocking you.

1832
02:10:19,015 --> 02:10:21,151
I could barely hear you.

1833
02:10:21,184 --> 02:10:22,853
You gotta trust me, okay?

1834
02:10:24,487 --> 02:10:25,956
Okay?

1835
02:10:39,903 --> 02:10:42,305
Awake again, huh?

1836
02:10:42,338 --> 02:10:45,509
[clicks tongue]
Might have to dose you
at the next rest stop.

1837
02:10:47,577 --> 02:10:49,079
Where are we going?

1838
02:10:50,046 --> 02:10:51,281
Mm, you know where.

1839
02:10:52,348 --> 02:10:54,418
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1840
02:10:57,287 --> 02:10:59,956
I told you it's good shit.

1841
02:10:59,989 --> 02:11:03,093
Haven't felt hungover in years.
And, you know, I don't miss it.

1842
02:11:03,126 --> 02:11:04,328
Not even a little.

1843
02:11:06,462 --> 02:11:08,265
West, huh?

1844
02:11:08,298 --> 02:11:11,201
Stayin' off the major roads.
Smart.

1845
02:11:13,269 --> 02:11:16,006
Crownville. New York.

1846
02:11:19,175 --> 02:11:21,411
Who are you?

1847
02:11:21,444 --> 02:11:23,247
I'm the guy
that killed your friends.

1848
02:11:29,218 --> 02:11:30,587
It's nice to meet you.

1849
02:11:32,455 --> 02:11:34,090
Neat trick.

1850
02:11:34,123 --> 02:11:36,059
Haven't seen this one before.

1851
02:11:36,092 --> 02:11:37,661
Wanna see one more?

1852
02:11:41,097 --> 02:11:44,568
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1853
02:11:47,303 --> 02:11:50,707
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1854
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:53,476
And when that woman gets mad...

1855
02:11:53,509 --> 02:11:56,112
Well, it seems to me
you know enough

1856
02:11:56,145 --> 02:11:59,015
to know you might wanna
sit this one out.

1857
02:11:59,048 --> 02:12:00,483
Count your blessings.

1858
02:12:00,516 --> 02:12:02,352
Go on your way.

1859
02:12:02,385 --> 02:12:04,487
[chuckles]

1860
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,189
What's so funny, friend?

1861
02:12:06,222 --> 02:12:10,193
Well, it's just arrogance.
It's arrogance, really.

1862
02:12:10,226 --> 02:12:13,596
But it makes sense,
if you think
you're gonna live forever.

1863
02:12:13,629 --> 02:12:18,001
Stands to reason, of course
you wouldn't wear
your seatbelt.

1864
02:12:22,071 --> 02:12:23,407
[tires screeching]

[gasps] No!

1867
02:12:41,224 --> 02:12:42,392
Dan?

1868
02:12:44,027 --> 02:12:45,295
Dan?

1869
02:12:45,328 --> 02:12:47,030
[soft snarling]

1870
02:12:54,103 --> 02:12:56,173
[gasping and snarling]

1871
02:13:16,592 --> 02:13:18,161
I hope that hurts.

1872
02:13:18,728 --> 02:13:20,063
Rosie...

1873
02:13:21,097 --> 02:13:22,132
A lot.

1874
02:13:22,165 --> 02:13:24,267
[pained screaming]

1875
02:14:10,146 --> 02:14:12,182
You little bitch.

1876
02:14:14,283 --> 02:14:16,353
What have you done?

1877
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:29,499
All right, bitch child.

1878
02:14:30,533 --> 02:14:31,435
All right.

1881
02:15:39,835 --> 02:15:41,271
Sorry.

1882
02:15:41,304 --> 02:15:42,438
Dozed off.

1883
02:15:42,471 --> 02:15:44,174
No, you earned it.

1884
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:48,711
Where are we?

1885
02:15:48,744 --> 02:15:50,213
Ohio.

1886
02:15:50,746 --> 02:15:51,848
Where are we going?

1887
02:15:51,881 --> 02:15:52,883
Colorado.

1888
02:15:54,584 --> 02:15:56,153
Why Colorado?

1889
02:15:58,654 --> 02:16:00,423
She's gonna keep coming.

1890
02:16:01,557 --> 02:16:03,160
-I know.
-Always.

1891
02:16:04,527 --> 02:16:05,895
This only ends if we end it,

1892
02:16:05,928 --> 02:16:08,364
and I don't think
we can beat her.

1893
02:16:08,397 --> 02:16:09,833
Not by ourselves.

1894
02:16:12,001 --> 02:16:13,636
There's a place.

1895
02:16:13,669 --> 02:16:16,472
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1896
02:16:16,505 --> 02:16:19,642
The place you told me about?
The hungry place?

1897
02:16:19,675 --> 02:16:21,311
Yeah, that's right.

1898
02:16:21,344 --> 02:16:24,214
If it's so dangerous,
why would we go there?

1899
02:16:24,247 --> 02:16:26,616
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1900
02:16:26,649 --> 02:16:29,552
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1901
02:16:29,585 --> 02:16:31,321
Maybe even more so.

1902
02:16:32,388 --> 02:16:33,356
Good.

1903
02:16:34,457 --> 02:16:36,226
She's following us, you know.

1904
02:16:37,326 --> 02:16:39,229
Yeah, good. Let her.

1905
02:16:46,836 --> 02:16:48,538
I'm sorry about your father.

1906
02:16:51,307 --> 02:16:52,776
Sorry about your friend.

[cell phone vibrating]

1908
02:17:15,598 --> 02:17:18,001

1909
02:17:18,034 --> 02:17:19,369
What do I say to her?

02:17:20,303 --> 02:17:21,338
[mutters]

1911
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:24,974
Hi, Mom.

1912
02:17:25,007 --> 02:17:26,342
Oh, thank God!

1913
02:17:26,375 --> 02:17:27,510
Abra... [sniffling]

1914
02:17:27,543 --> 02:17:29,246
Are you okay? Where are you?

1915
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:31,481
I love you.

1916
02:17:32,448 --> 02:17:34,484
[cell phone clicks]

1917
02:17:34,517 --> 02:17:36,853
When we're safe,
you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1918
02:17:36,886 --> 02:17:38,021
I will.

1919
02:17:38,054 --> 02:17:39,456
Okay.

1920
02:17:45,594 --> 02:17:46,730
[cell phone clatters]

1921
02:18:13,089 --> 02:18:15,492
Not too much further.
Up the mountain.

[wind whistling]

1923
02:19:51,053 --> 02:19:52,822
Here's what we're gonna do.

1924
02:19:52,855 --> 02:19:55,691
You're gonna stay in the car,
keep the heater running.

1925
02:19:55,724 --> 02:19:58,895
I don't want you spending
a minute inside there
if you don't have to.

1926
02:19:58,928 --> 02:20:00,663
She can only come from here.

1927
02:20:00,696 --> 02:20:02,198
You can see her a mile out,
easy.

1928
02:20:02,231 --> 02:20:04,567
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1929
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,135
you blast me, okay?

1930
02:20:06,168 --> 02:20:09,605
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1931
02:20:09,638 --> 02:20:12,108
You aren't waiting with me?

1932
02:20:12,141 --> 02:20:13,075
I can't.

1933
02:20:13,108 --> 02:20:14,110
Why not?

1934
02:20:15,077 --> 02:20:16,679
I have to wake it up.

Not for long, I imagine.

1951
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:07,062
[man] You're a whiskey man,
are you not?

1952
02:26:07,095 --> 02:26:09,198
I was, most of the time.

1953
02:26:16,872 --> 02:26:18,274
[man] On the house.

1954
02:26:22,044 --> 02:26:24,180
This was your brand.

1955
02:26:24,213 --> 02:26:26,015
Jack Daniel's.

1956
02:26:26,048 --> 02:26:28,417
I used to see the bottles
in our home.

1957
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:31,954
Our real home, before all this.

1958
02:26:31,987 --> 02:26:35,158
I smelled one once. It smelled
like something on fire,

1959
02:26:36,325 --> 02:26:38,994
which I suppose it was.

1960

[man] I'm afraid
you've confused me
with someone else.

1961
02:26:41,563 --> 02:26:43,099
It's Lloyd.

1962
02:26:43,599 --> 02:26:45,001
Lloyd.

1963
02:26:46,335 --> 02:26:48,470
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1964
02:26:48,503 --> 02:26:52,408
I don't know where everyone is,
but it'll pick up.

02:26:52,441 --> 02:26:54,310
Oh, I know where they are.

1966
02:26:54,343 --> 02:26:55,444
And you're right...

1967
02:26:56,311 --> 02:26:57,480
it'll pick up.

1968
02:26:59,648 --> 02:27:02,451
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1969
02:27:04,086 --> 02:27:05,221
put upon.

1970
02:27:06,221 --> 02:27:08,057
Put upon?

1971
02:27:08,090 --> 02:27:09,358
Ain't that the way.

1972
02:27:10,359 --> 02:27:12,294
Man just living his life,

1973
02:27:12,327 --> 02:27:14,396
trying to do his work.

1974
02:27:14,429 --> 02:27:16,498
He gets put upon.

1975
02:27:16,531 --> 02:27:18,267
Pulled into
other people's problems.

1976
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:21,137
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1977
02:27:24,106 --> 02:27:26,108
So we lived in Florida.

1978
02:27:27,142 --> 02:27:28,143
I'm sorry?

1979
02:27:28,176 --> 02:27:30,212
Mom and I.

1980
02:27:30,245 --> 02:27:32,515
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1981
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:38,020
We never wanted
to see snow again,

1982
02:27:38,053 --> 02:27:40,222
so we lived in Florida.

1983
02:27:40,255 --> 02:27:43,492
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1984
02:27:43,525 --> 02:27:45,428
I mean, we were grieving.

1985
02:27:48,196 --> 02:27:50,132
We were traumatized,

1986
02:27:50,165 --> 02:27:51,934
but there was happiness too.

1987
02:27:55,137 --> 02:27:56,105
She...

1988
02:27:57,639 --> 02:27:59,909
She would look away.

1989
02:27:59,942 --> 02:28:03,346
She'd look at me,
but she'd always look away
after a second or two.

1990
02:28:04,613 --> 02:28:06,448
It took me a while
to notice it.

1991
02:28:06,481 --> 02:28:08,918
But after the Overlook, she
wouldn't look me in the eyes,

1992
02:28:08,951 --> 02:28:10,653
not for long.

1993
02:28:10,686 --> 02:28:12,288
Couldn't figure it out.

1994
02:28:14,723 --> 02:28:15,724
But it...

1995
02:28:19,594 --> 02:28:20,963
It was you.

1996
02:28:23,298 --> 02:28:26,969
She saw your eyes in me,
and she'd have to look away.

1997
02:28:28,337 --> 02:28:30,172
It tortured her
to have to do that.

1998
02:28:30,205 --> 02:28:32,074
So, I fixed it.

1999
02:28:32,107 --> 02:28:35,110
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

2000
02:28:35,143 --> 02:28:38,180
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

2001
02:28:41,249 --> 02:28:43,519
I was 20 when she died.

2002
02:28:43,552 --> 02:28:47,389
And back then, I saw
when someone was gonna die.

2003
02:28:47,422 --> 02:28:49,591
I saw flies. Black flies.

2004
02:28:49,624 --> 02:28:53,462
"Death flies," I called them,
circling people's faces.

2005
02:28:53,495 --> 02:28:56,332
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

2006
02:28:56,365 --> 02:28:58,200
Her whole face.

2007
02:28:58,233 --> 02:29:01,337
I could barely see her eyes.

2008
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:06,275
And I...
I tried to comfort her,
but I could hardly look at her.

2009
02:29:06,308 --> 02:29:08,210
And she saw that.

2010
02:29:10,545 --> 02:29:12,614
She just lay there dying,

2011
02:29:12,647 --> 02:29:14,550
with her son
who couldn't look at her.

2012
02:29:20,589 --> 02:29:24,259
Maybe something warm to
push away such unpleasantries.

2013
02:29:24,292 --> 02:29:27,329
Don't you wanna hear about it?
She was your wife.

2014
02:29:27,362 --> 02:29:30,466
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

2015
02:29:30,499 --> 02:29:33,769
-I'm just a bartender.
-Oh, yeah?

2016
02:29:33,802 --> 02:29:37,039
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at
the Overlook Hotel.

2017
02:29:37,072 --> 02:29:39,642
I'll pour whatever you like,
Mr. Torrance.

2018
02:29:41,243 --> 02:29:42,378
Oh, Dad.

2019
02:29:44,312 --> 02:29:46,515
This drink will cost
an awful lot.

2020
02:29:46,548 --> 02:29:48,550
Your money is no good here.

2021
02:29:48,583 --> 02:29:50,419
Orders from the house.

2022
02:29:50,452 --> 02:29:52,388
It'll cost more than money.

2023
02:29:52,421 --> 02:29:54,757
It'll cost me eight years.

2024
02:29:54,790 --> 02:29:57,292
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

2025
02:29:57,325 --> 02:29:59,762
Your credit is fine,
Mr. Torrance.

2026
02:30:07,235 --> 02:30:09,105
Man takes a drink,

2027
02:30:10,205 --> 02:30:11,507
the drink takes a drink,

2028
02:30:12,674 --> 02:30:14,510
and then the drink takes a man.

2029
02:30:15,577 --> 02:30:17,279
Ain't it so, Dad?

2030
02:30:21,416 --> 02:30:22,718
Medicine.

2031
02:30:24,419 --> 02:30:26,288
Medicine is what it is.

2032
02:30:27,289 --> 02:30:29,525
Bona fide cure-all.

2033
02:30:29,558 --> 02:30:34,397
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

2034
02:30:36,164 --> 02:30:38,234
The mind is a blackboard.

2035
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:40,036
And this

2036
02:30:40,735 --> 02:30:42,238
is the eraser.

2037
02:30:47,509 --> 02:30:49,611
A man tries.

2038
02:30:49,644 --> 02:30:50,780
He provides.

2039
02:30:52,180 --> 02:30:54,349
But he's surrounded by mouths.

2040
02:30:54,382 --> 02:30:57,486
that eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

2041
02:30:57,519 --> 02:31:01,123
So, he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

2042
02:31:01,156 --> 02:31:02,658
To warm him up...

2043
02:31:02,691 --> 02:31:05,727
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

2044
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:08,497
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

2045
02:31:08,530 --> 02:31:11,100
everything he has.

2046
02:31:11,133 --> 02:31:12,668
And a family.

2047
02:31:12,701 --> 02:31:14,804
A wife, a kid.

2048
02:31:16,338 --> 02:31:18,674
Those mouths eat time.

2049
02:31:18,707 --> 02:31:20,309
They eat your days on Earth.

2050
02:31:21,710 --> 02:31:23,312
They just gobble them up.

2051
02:31:24,779 --> 02:31:27,183
It's enough to make a man sick.

2052
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:29,218
And this...

2053
02:31:30,552 --> 02:31:32,455
is the medicine.

2054
02:31:34,589 --> 02:31:37,526
So, tell me, pup,

2055
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:40,196
are you gonna
take your medicine?

2056
02:31:43,231 --> 02:31:44,800
I'm not.

2057
02:31:44,833 --> 02:31:45,835
[glass shatters]

2058
02:31:46,835 --> 02:31:48,170
Oh.

2059
02:31:48,203 --> 02:31:49,538
Look at that. I'm sorry.

2060
02:31:49,571 --> 02:31:52,541
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.
Forgive me.

2061
02:31:54,176 --> 02:31:55,544
Let's get you cleaned up.

2062
02:32:13,862 --> 02:32:15,831
Management is concerned.

2063
02:32:15,864 --> 02:32:17,233
Concerned?

2064
02:32:19,601 --> 02:32:22,171
It's horrible
what she's done to you.

2065
02:32:22,204 --> 02:32:23,873
Pulled you into her mess.

2066
02:32:26,374 --> 02:32:27,743
A smart man?

2067
02:32:28,777 --> 02:32:31,780
He'd let her handle it.

2068
02:32:31,813 --> 02:32:35,317
Let things unfold
as they're meant to.

2069
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:37,720
Why should you
pay her tab, Doc?

2070
02:32:39,454 --> 02:32:41,490
And for what?

2071
02:32:41,523 --> 02:32:45,360
For this little girl
who started all this trouble?

2072
02:32:45,393 --> 02:32:47,930
What would management
have me do about that?

2073
02:32:48,597 --> 02:32:50,732
Nothing.

2074
02:32:50,765 --> 02:32:53,669
Easiest thing in the world
to do, son.

2075
02:32:53,702 --> 02:32:55,871
Just bring her inside.

2076
02:32:55,904 --> 02:32:58,373
And then, well,

2077
02:32:58,406 --> 02:33:01,510
you accept the things
you cannot change.

2078
02:33:02,677 --> 02:33:03,812
[Abra]  Dan!

2079
02:33:03,845 --> 02:33:04,880
She's here.

2080
02:33:22,897 --> 02:33:24,366
[Dan] Okay.

2081
02:33:38,813 --> 02:33:41,516
This place is sick.

2082
02:33:41,549 --> 02:33:43,885
Sick like my momo was sick.

2083
02:33:43,918 --> 02:33:45,520
It's cancer,

2084
02:33:45,553 --> 02:33:47,823
only worse.

2085
02:33:47,856 --> 02:33:49,425
[electricity humming]

2086
02:33:55,063 --> 02:33:56,632
What do we do now?

2087
02:33:56,665 --> 02:33:58,701
We head inside. She'll find us.

2088

[gasps softly]

2090
02:35:48,676 --> 02:35:51,380
[Rose] Well, well, well.

2091
02:35:52,881 --> 02:35:54,583
Hi there.

2092
02:35:54,616 --> 02:35:57,819
[Dan]  When this starts, run.

2093
02:35:57,852 --> 02:36:00,689
[Rose] Yes, you run, dear.

2094
02:36:00,722 --> 02:36:03,058
And then I will find you

2095
02:36:03,091 --> 02:36:06,962
and you will scream for years
until you die.

2096
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:11,666
We'll see
who does the screaming.

2097
02:36:11,699 --> 02:36:13,468
Oh, we'll see indeed.

2098
02:36:13,501 --> 02:36:15,470
[Dan] She's right, you know.

2099
02:36:15,503 --> 02:36:16,972
You should be afraid.

2100
02:36:18,139 --> 02:36:20,542
Why is that?

2101
02:36:20,575 --> 02:36:23,145
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

2102
02:36:23,178 --> 02:36:25,414
I'm sorry, who are you,
handsome?

2103
02:36:29,717 --> 02:36:32,921
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

2104
02:36:34,556 --> 02:36:35,557
Go.

2105

[Rose] Clever.

2109
02:37:39,053 --> 02:37:40,889
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

2110
02:37:42,557 --> 02:37:45,060
Since the last time
I was in your mind.

2111
02:37:45,093 --> 02:37:46,895
[Abra]  How do you know
we're not in yours?

2112
02:38:01,676 --> 02:38:02,811
Where are you, pup?

[gasps]

02:38:23,698 --> 02:38:25,167
You're gonna die here.

2115

Mm. Brave words, dear.

2116
02:38:29,337 --> 02:38:31,006
Is that what you really think?

2117
02:38:31,773 --> 02:38:34,543
You're gonna hurt me?

02:38:34,576 --> 02:38:35,810

You know,
you remind me of myself.

2122
02:38:46,988 --> 02:38:49,558
I can really see it now.

You've got a darkness in you,
dear.

between you and me is time.

and alone.

But I met someone
who gave me the gift of
purpose, of community.

2141
02:39:57,825 --> 02:39:59,828
And I might have given you
such a gift

if things would
have gone differently.

Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

2162

It gets polluted.

You know that.

I see the grease all over you.

2166

You don't shine quite the same.

2167
02:41:13,234 --> 02:41:15,771
Growing up spoils that,
I guess.

2168

Seriously, handsome,

2169

where have you been hiding?

I can make you an offer.

2171

You could live a long, long
time. Live well, too.

You must be lonely,
being the last one.

[Abra] Come on, Uncle Dan.

Get out of there.

destroying the hotel.

2306
02:51:22,076 --> 02:51:23,645
Purifying it.

2307
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:27,081
I could almost hear it...

2308
02:51:27,114 --> 02:51:28,016
screaming.

2309
02:51:29,616 --> 02:51:32,353
I could hear it dying.

2310
02:51:32,386 --> 02:51:34,922
And deep inside, I knew...

2311
02:51:37,791 --> 02:51:39,427
I knew you were okay.

2312
02:51:40,994 --> 02:51:42,864
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

2313
02:51:44,031 --> 02:51:45,433
It was the only way.

2314
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:47,735
I know.

2315
02:51:48,836 --> 02:51:51,972
Do you think she was right

2316
02:51:52,005 --> 02:51:54,042
when she said
she wasn't the last one?

2317
02:51:55,409 --> 02:51:56,811
The world's a hungry place.

2318
02:51:57,678 --> 02:52:00,348
A dark place.

2319
02:52:00,381 --> 02:52:03,951
Maybe there's more of them
or things like them or worse,

2320
02:52:03,984 --> 02:52:05,820
but there are more people
like you, too.

2321

People who stand.

2322
02:52:11,859 --> 02:52:13,728
I told you
when I first met you,

2323
02:52:13,761 --> 02:52:16,397
I told you that
you should hide.

2324
02:52:17,798 --> 02:52:19,801
That you should
keep your head down.

2325
02:52:20,901 --> 02:52:22,837
Keep your shine out of sight.

2326
02:52:24,905 --> 02:52:26,341
But I was wrong.

2327
02:52:29,576 --> 02:52:31,346
Shine on, Abra Stone.

2328
02:52:34,448 --> 02:52:36,684
You shine on.

No one.

Hmm.

2334
02:52:56,737 --> 02:52:57,972
That's not true.

2335
02:53:02,109 --> 02:53:03,611
I was talking to Dan.

2336
02:53:11,485 --> 02:53:13,621
We go on after.

2337
02:53:14,521 --> 02:53:16,190
We go on.

2338
02:53:16,223 --> 02:53:17,625
And he's okay.

2339
02:53:18,725 --> 02:53:19,927
So is Daddy.

2340
02:53:21,128 --> 02:53:22,597
He really is.

2341
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:27,869
Good.
