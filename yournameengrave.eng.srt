1
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,875
Why did you get into a fight for love?

2
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,500
I don't know what to say.

3
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,666
You've changed a bit.

4
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,250
So how do you plan to counsel me?

5
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,041
Let's start.

6
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,166
Which class is she in?

7
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:45,416
The Presidential Order of July 14th, 1987

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,458
issued parliament document No. 1641

9
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,875
announce that effective on midnight
of July 15th, 1987,

10
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,041
martial law will be lifted in Taiwan.

11
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,541
President Chiang Ching-kuo,

12
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,458
Premier Yu Kuo-hwa,

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,375
Defense Minister Cheng Wei-yuan.

14
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,291
Did you just transfer here?

15
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,791
Class H, Liberal Arts studies.

16
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,666
Class A, 11th Grade,

17
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,541
Science studies.

18
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,500
Lastly, let's train your lung capacity.

19
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,750
Take a deep breath
and immerse your head in the water.

20
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,625
Let's see who can hold
their breath the longest.

21
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,708
Begin.

22
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,833
Later on, I found out

23
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,041
that his name is "Birdy," not "Idiot."

24
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,208
He says that "Birdy"
is the title of a movie.

25
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,083
It's about two good friends.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
One is normal

27
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,791
and the other is crazy.

28
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,208
The crazy one's name is Birdy.

29
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,125
Two minutes and four seconds.

30
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,208
I broke my record.

31
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,666
Are you stupid?

32
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,375
What was the craziest thing you did
when you were young?

33
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,583
Dormitory check is a must before bedtime.

34
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,250
Listen, don't you dare hide
any prohibited items.

35
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,666
Hey, haven't I mentioned
that duvets need to be folded neatly?

36
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,708
Mind your personal hygiene, okay?

37
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,125
Don't be too proud of yourself.

38
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,041
Someone hid adult comics
under the mattress once.

39
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,041
When I saw it… Hey!

40
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,250
That's not mine.

41
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,500
Good, there's nothing here.

42
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,416
It's all good.

43
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,541
Don't put your underpants here, okay?

44
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,500
This one's yellowish.
Throw it away, it stinks.

45
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,208
Listen, I'm doing this for your physical
and mental development.

46
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,666
You shouldn't listen
to this superstar concert tape.

47
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,041
I'll keep it for you.

48
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,125
Why are you being sneaky?

49
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,666
Don't think I can't discipline you
since martial law is lifted.

50
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,958
This school's martial law
hasn't been lifted yet.

51
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,791
Tidy up this cabinet later.

52
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,458
A wrongdoer achieves salvation
as soon as he gives up evil.

53
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,458
I'm doing this because I love you.
I'm always watching you.

54
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm watching you.

55
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,125
What are you doing?

56
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,583
-What are you doing?
-Go.

57
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,166
Why did you sneak into our dorm?

58
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,958
-Let's get changed.
-Let's go.

59
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,291
What are you doing here?
Do you have a death wish?

60
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,500
I need to borrow soap.

61
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,583
Here you go.

62
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,708
Go.

63
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,833
Fuck.

64
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,041
Fuck.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fuck.

66
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,291
Are you stupid?

67
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,791
What are you doing?

68
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:22,958
Where did you go?

69
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,041
He scared the shit out of me.

70
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,541
Goddamn it, let's go.

71
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,625
Hi, everyone. We are…

72
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,791
-The Horn Band.
-The Horn Band.

73
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,416
-I'm Horn.
-I'm Rocky.

74
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,625
I'm Phil.

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,875
I'm Jia-han.

76
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,541
Don't let me catch you, naughty girl.

77
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,708
Come on.

78
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,125
You have no idea how hard it is
in a boys' school.

79
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,958
You're like monks who were let out
from a mountain. So horny!

80
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,958
Do you hate straightforward people?

81
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,458
Don't you play musical instruments?

82
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,500
You can treat my body
like a musical instrument.

83
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,458
How do you feel?

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,958
It's soft.

85
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,291
Then are you…

86
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,791
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,666
Treat your musical instrument
as your lover.

88
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,708
Embrace it with love

89
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,500
or it would be like holding a rock
and painful for the audience.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,250
You have to remember,

91
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,791
"Profiter du moment."

92
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,250
"Live in the moment."

93
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,000
It's beautiful to fall in love
at your age.

94
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,666
It will come if it's meant to be.

95
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,250
No one can stop it.

96
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,500
Empty words. How would you know
if you've never been in love, Father?

97
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,875
How do you know I haven't?

98
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,333
-Holy shit, Father. You've been in love?
-Right.

99
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,666
-Tell us.
-Tell us, Father.

100
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,791
Father, one simple question, did you…

101
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,291
Kiss?

102
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,708
That's right, Father.
What did it feel like?

103
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,208
Hey, you guys.

104
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,125
Love is not just physical intimacy.

105
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,291
Was she from Montreal as well?

106
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,500
Yes, Montreal.

107
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,833
I met her at a dance party.

108
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,166
When I looked at her,
she was looking at me too.

109
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,666
Do I need to continue?

110
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,500
Prepare for the flag-raising ceremony.

111
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,125
Father, you haven't finished.

112
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,625
I'll tell you next time, okay?

113
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,625
But my "flag" is already raised.

114
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,500
Supper?

115
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,333
You went out to buy supper?

116
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,916
And drinks too?

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,833
You…

118
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you looking at?

119
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,041
Do you want to join him?

120
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,083
Those at the back, put your hands up!

121
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,708
Some of you snuck out
in the middle of the night.

122
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't think that I don't know.

123
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,208
This is a Christian school.

124
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,666
God is watching all of you.

125
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,375
So you'd better behave yourselves.

126
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,250
Birdy.

127
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,916
Birdy.

128
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,375
This is for you.

129
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,500
It's for the bruises on your butt.

130
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,833
Thank you.

131
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,583
I'll be done in a minute. Wait up.

132
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,458
Aren't you cold having cold showers?

133
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,250
Doesn't it hurt?

134
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,416
Put some newspapers
inside your back pocket next time.

135
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,583
I'm done.

136
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,625
Drag him inside.

137
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,625
Give him a "happy corner."

138
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,208
-Let go of me!
-Phil, pull him farther away.

139
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,333
Are you getting tired?

140
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,250
-Let's have a go again.
-Fucking queer.

141
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,083
-Come on.
-Motherfucker.

142
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,791
Tell me, did you snitch
to the housemaster?

143
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,958
-No.
-You'd better not.

144
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,166
-You didn't?
-I didn't.

145
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,125
Then why is he checking up on us daily?

146
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,333
-If you did, your dick would rot.
-How dare you peek at me in the shower?

147
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,000
Motherfucker, drag him over here!

148
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,708
Fuck, you're still arguing?

149
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,875
Watch it, don't randomly look around.

150
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,333
You're a virus.

151
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
Look at yourself. Don't look at me!

152
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,666
I heard that homosexuals
have hairless bodies.

153
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,208
-Take off his pants.
-Take his pants off!

154
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,208
Come here.

155
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,208
No!

156
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,583
Here we come.

157
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,583
Don't move around!

158
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,875
Stop moving!

159
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,041
-You dare to move again?
-Stop!

160
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,416
Dick burning time.

161
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,041
Don't you dare move again. Drag him here.

162
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,000
Who's there?

163
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,916
Whoever you are, come out now.

164
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,416
Come out.

165
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,708
It's me.

166
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,958
Fuck, you scared the shit out of me.

167
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,791
-I just had diarrhea, so I took a shower.
-Come here.

168
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,166
You're pulling up your pants?

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,208
Drag him over here.

170
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,625
Beat him up.

171
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,583
-Where are you going?
-No.

172
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,958
-Trying to run?
-What if he tells the housemaster?

173
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,875
-You piece of shit.
-Don't you dare!

174
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,416
Jia-han, hit him.

175
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,958
He peeks at Horn's cock every night.

176
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Isn't that disgusting?

177
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
Beat him up.

178
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:15,916
Come on.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,333
Get him to kneel.

180
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,541
Kneel!

181
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,875
Jia-han.

182
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,083
He'll only do something worse.

183
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,791
He'll force us to be gay too.

184
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,875
Beat him up.

185
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,833
Do it.

186
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,125
Do it.

187
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,250
You'd better beat me until I bleed,

188
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,041
so the poison in me
would spurt all over you.

189
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,208
Each one of you.

190
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,166
Do it.

191
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,750
How long was he in there?

192
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,166
He must have seen it all.

193
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,250
Chang Jia-han.

194
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,875
Weren't you in the same cubicle?

195
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,000
No, I was in the second one.

196
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,125
What are you doing?

197
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,041
Horn and the others are around us.

198
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,583
Why are you still awake?

199
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,541
You're screwed if you wake them up.

200
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,875
When you came out of the shower,

201
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,916
weren't you scared
they'd give you trouble?

202
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,750
Check this out.

203
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,791
Where did you get these?

204
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,291
From Dirty Head's office.

205
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,083
Dirty Head's office?

206
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes.

207
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,125
Have some.

208
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,708
Those sounds

209
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,583
on such a quiet night

210
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,833
sounded like heartbeats.

211
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,416
Heartbeats?

212
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,041
What are you doing?

213
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,750
Hey!

214
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,166
-What are you doing?
-Move.

215
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,583
This is Dirty Head's car.

216
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:27,916
Wang Po-te.

217
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,208
Fuck.

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,958
Shit!

219
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,625
You're fucking nuts.

220
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,750
Are you done yet?

221
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,750
Hurry up, you're taking forever.

222
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,166
Just a few more seconds.

223
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,291
-Would you like to contribute some?
-No!

224
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,125
It's done.

225
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,000
It will definitely stink
when the sun comes up.

226
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,416
With his grades, he can only
be transferred to Liberal Arts.

227
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,666
Don't worry.

228
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,375
We're not giving up on him.

229
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,375
His dad is going to be terribly upset.

230
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,041
He can still make a lot of money

231
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,458
as a lawyer or an accountant.

232
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,333
In compliance with
the Ministry of Education's policy,

233
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,833
our school will start accepting girls
next semester.

234
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,833
With girls joining us, I'm afraid…

235
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,000
Just concentrate on your studies.

236
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,875
Relationships are strictly prohibited
in this school.

237
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,083
Do you understand?

238
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,375
Stop raising it, leave it at half-mast.

239
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,416
Those who watched the news yesterday
are aware

240
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,666
that our most revered President Chiang

241
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,416
passed away yesterday,

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,416
on January 13th,

243
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,166
at 3:50 p.m.

244
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,625
So for one month starting from today,

245
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,500
the flag will be at half-mast.

246
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,708
After the final exam,
before winter vacation,

247
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,083
if you want to pay homage in Taipei,
you can take an official leave.

248
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,291
Now, let's observe one minute of silence.

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,916
Let's go.

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,583
Let's go.

251
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,333
Your attention, please.

252
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
We're arriving at Taipei Station.

253
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,875
If this is your stop,
please prepare to disembark.

254
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:52,250
The next stop is Qidu Station.

255
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,583
We're arriving in Taipei.

256
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,333
OCCUPIED

257
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,333
Thank you.

258
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,500
The left side is for groups.

259
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,500
The right side is for ordinary people.

260
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,666
Queue up properly.

261
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
Our beloved

262
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,375
-Mr. Ching-kuo…
-Queue up properly! Maintain order.

263
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,750
-…served his country and his party…
-Move back.

264
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,958
You there!

265
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:52,250
…with utter devotion throughout his life.

266
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,666
What he did

267
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:02,041
was a gift to his countrymen.

268
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:09,875
Your passing is a loss to the whole world…

269
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,083
WITT HIGH SCHOOL'S
MOURNING REPRESENTATIVES

270
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,833
…and we feel deep sorrow in our hearts.

271
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,583
We all love you.

272
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,666
We will follow your example.

273
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,208
You shall remain in our hearts forever.

274
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
Almighty Father.

275
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,541
Please take care of President Chiang
just as you take care of us.

276
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,541
-Thank you, President.
-He was a great man.

277
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,750
-May you soon attain Nirvana.
-I may not know the great things he did,

278
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,125
-May you become a god.
-but I think he was great.

279
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,250
-Because everyone liked him a lot.
-Thank you.

280
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,375
May he be free from worry
and sickness in heaven.

281
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,041
Please keep him close to you. Amen.

282
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,000
Check out the clothes here.

283
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,041
Ma'am, I haven't seen you in ages.

284
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,666
Birdy, hurry up!

285
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,750
Look, they sell cassette tapes there.

286
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,083
Open this jar for me.

287
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,416
Would you like to buy it?

288
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,375
Thank you.

289
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,000
-How about a tip?
-Ma'am.

290
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,583
Come and buy some clothes.
They're 50 dollars each.

291
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,625
Why are there so many protest banners?

292
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,125
-No, thank you.
-Thank you. It's fine.

293
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,833
Why are they so angry?

294
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,750
MARRIAGE IS A HUMAN RIGHT!

295
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,333
HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT A DISEASE!

296
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,291
Look over there.

297
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,041
What is he doing?

298
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,541
I have no idea.

299
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,958
-That's so weird.
-He's over there.

300
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,500
I see him now.

301
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,375
Wang Po-te, it's the Juvenile Police.

302
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,916
Chi Chia-wei, it's you again.

303
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,333
-Are they coming for us?
-No.

304
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,875
You can't protest here.

305
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,208
Chi Chia-wei, are you trying
to revolt here?

306
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,208
-What are they doing?
-Take him!

307
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,041
-Arrest him!
-No.

308
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,250
Wang Po-te.

309
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,333
What are you doing?

310
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,666
Hey, I'll call the police
if you don't stop.

311
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,625
You hooligans! How can you take him away?

312
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,791
-Take him to the station.
-Let him go!

313
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,458
They're plainclothes cops.
The uniformed ones are there.

314
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,000
Will they hurt him?

315
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,708
I don't know.

316
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,916
What would you do if I died?

317
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,708
What do you mean by that?

318
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,916
Stop thinking about those things.

319
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,500
Welcome to Solar System. How many people?

320
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,666
No. Where did they go?

321
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,750
Excuse me, let me clean the table for you.

322
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,958
Okay.

323
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:48,875
Yes.

324
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:52,916
Okay.

325
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,916
Wait for me.

326
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,375
I'll go to the restroom.

327
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,000
Welcome to Solar System.

328
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,375
What were you doing earlier?

329
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,625
Nothing, we were just playing around.

330
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,958
You can't fool around here.

331
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,083
Okay.

332
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,791
Be careful.

333
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,500
Have you read any of Sanmao's books?

334
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,166
Yes.

335
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,500
I like Gone with the Rainy Season

336
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,125
and Stories of the Sahara.

337
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,041
There's a line in one of her books,

338
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:52,458
"If what you give me is the same
as what you give to others,

339
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,541
then I don't want it."

340
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,833
So you know what love is?

341
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,833
Nobody understands me in this world.

342
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,875
Here.

343
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,208
Let me play a song for you.

344
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,375
Sure.

345
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,875
Who sang this song?

346
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,791
Did he win the College Town
singing contest?

347
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,000
Tsai Lan-chin.

348
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,625
He's dead.

349
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,583
He's dead?

350
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,958
Why was he so hard on himself?

351
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,458
Did you know that by the end of 1987,

352
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,750
the earth's population
had exceeded five billion?

353
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,333
From two people to that many.

354
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,333
God probably didn't expect

355
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,541
such a huge population.

356
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Besides,

357
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,583
the world doesn't need that many people.

358
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,333
Gosh, I can't get up.

359
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,125
Sometimes I feel like
I'm one of those unneeded people.

360
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,250
It's like what my dad says,

361
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,125
"It's useless to raise you.

362
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,500
I should've strangled you
when you were born."

363
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll strangle you.

364
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:29,125
Let's not have any babies in the future,
there are too many people already.

365
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,250
Okay.

366
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,041
You and I can't have babies anyway.

367
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,250
Idiot.

368
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,000
Our Father in heaven.

369
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,708
Thank you for giving us food.

370
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,750
May our food be clean

371
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,583
and keep us healthy.

372
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,041
Jia-han is going into 12th grade soon.

373
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:15,416
Please help him improve academically
and get into a good university.

374
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,875
As for Chia-ming and Hsiao-ling,

375
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,583
please bestow your blessings on them too.

376
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,250
We thank you before our meal

377
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,000
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

378
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,041
-Amen.
-Amen.

379
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,500
Let's eat.

380
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,458
How long have you been dating?

381
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,791
It's none of your business.

382
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:36,250
That's your brother's business.
Mind your own.

383
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,083
Once you're in college,
you can date as many girls as you want.

384
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,166
Mr. Chang only made simple dishes,
I hope you don't mind.

385
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,125
They're not simple at all.

386
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,875
Chia-ming, lend me your scooter.

387
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,000
It's about the scooter again.

388
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,208
You talked about it in the kitchen too.

389
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,875
Then buy me one,
so I can have more time to study.

390
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,083
I have no money.

391
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:02,250
You brought gold back to Chinese mainland,
but you can't afford to get me a scooter.

392
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,291
Damn it. Have I ever starved you?

393
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,541
How much money have you brought back?

394
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,208
How is that your business?

395
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,583
That's my own money.

396
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:10,875
This is your home too.

397
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,166
-Enough.
-That's right, so I'm in charge!

398
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,000
-Cut it out. We have a guest here.
-Watch your attitude.

399
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,333
It's humiliating
that you're taking Liberal Arts.

400
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:19,750
You'd better study harder.

401
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,958
Take both Liberal Arts and Science exams,

402
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,708
and see which one you score higher.

403
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,000
Learn from your brother.

404
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,333
Get into a good college
and get a good girlfriend.

405
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,458
Jia-han.

406
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:36,708
Come inside, your dad wants me
to lock the door.

407
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,208
Are you still upset?

408
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,916
Won't you send money home
when you're working?

409
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,875
Your dad is just trying to prove
that he's doing fine

410
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,125
by bringing money to his hometown.

411
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,041
He wants his family to be proud of him.

412
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,875
Why did you marry him?

413
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,916
If I didn't,
how would I give birth to you?

414
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,958
So you don't love him.

415
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,875
Love? At our age?

416
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,416
We just met each other.

417
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,458
So it was merely procreation.

418
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,083
What do you mean by procreation?

419
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:26,791
It means having babies.

420
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,625
It shouldn't be like that
if you're in love.

421
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,625
What do you know about love?

422
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,125
It turns to love over time.

423
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,125
Don't think too much.
Just focus on your studies.

424
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,625
Come inside.

425
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,208
Check out some scooters tomorrow.
I'll buy one for you.

426
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,875
I have some savings.

427
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,625
Don't forget to wear a helmet.

428
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,375
Be careful, okay?

429
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,625
Come inside quickly.

430
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,125
Now, we're listening

431
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,625
to the third place
in this week's hits chart,

432
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:25,875
also last week's fifth place,
"The Crowded Paradise" by Bobby Chen.

433
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,458
Hello, guess who this is.

434
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,166
Mom!

435
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,833
It's Mrs. Chang.

436
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,791
Hello, guess who this is.

437
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,458
What are you up to?

438
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,000
Do you like the color of my scooter?

439
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,583
If you like it, that's all that matters.

440
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,333
Birdy, what are you doing?

441
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,041
I'm collecting posters.

442
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,208
Be careful.

443
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,041
Hurry up.

444
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,708
Are there more posters here?

445
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,000
Are you sure about this?

446
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,458
What if someone comes in?

447
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,541
Until now,

448
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,625
I still remember
what you looked like then.

449
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,541
Stop playing hide and seek with me.

450
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:27,583
You are…

451
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,916
You are torturing me.

452
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,541
What do you mean?

453
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,458
Only a fool wouldn't understand
what I mean.

454
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,416
I want to be a filmmaker someday.

455
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,041
You really watch a lot of weird movies.

456
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,375
No wonder

457
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,416
you're so weird.

458
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,250
Don't you think things are more fun
in the movies than in real life?

459
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:07,375
I've never thought about making movies.

460
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,083
It's too difficult.

461
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:12,791
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

462
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,958
Then…

463
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,000
When you make a movie one day,

464
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,000
I'll write the theme song for you.

465
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,583
Deal.

466
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,333
What are you doing here?

467
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,333
Who let you in?

468
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,791
I'll call the police!

469
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,833
Stop!

470
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,875
Will you go to film school with me?

471
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,750
But I don't watch many movies.

472
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:44,916
Don't worry, I can recommend some.

473
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,750
Let's go to film school in Taipei
and make movies together.

474
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:48,916
Stop!

475
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,958
Let's make a movie!

476
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,833
Don't you have any desires?

477
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,500
God listed the seven sins
we shouldn't commit.

478
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:10,166
Pride, greed, envy, lust,

479
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,250
gluttony, wrath, and sloth.

480
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,416
God wants everyone to avoid
the sources of sin,

481
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,208
especially lust.

482
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,416
But I was talking about love, not lust.

483
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,375
Lust is only physical intimacy.

484
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,666
I want him to truly accept me
in his heart.

485
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,666
I still believe in God.

486
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,375
Didn't He say, "Whoever believes
in Him shall have eternal life"?

487
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,000
You should go.
You're misunderstanding God!

488
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,875
Didn't He say,
"Ask and it shall be given to you.

489
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,166
Seek and you shall find.
Knock and the door shall be opened"?

490
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,666
I've been knocking so hard.
Why doesn't He hear it?

491
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,208
Father, you've never
loved anyone like I do,

492
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,833
so you'll never understand!

493
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,125
Good morning, everyone.

494
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,000
It's the beginning of a new semester.

495
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,541
In compliance with
the Ministry of Education's policy,

496
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:41,583
our school will be accepting girls
and lifting restrictions on hairstyles,

497
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:45,958
but that doesn't mean you can fool around.

498
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:50,250
Boys, stay away
from the girls' classrooms.

499
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:54,916
Tenth grade girls,
if any boy is harassing you,

500
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,708
please report it to the Instructor
at the Student Affairs Office at once.

501
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,625
Is it necessary to have this wire fencing?

502
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:05,791
Jia-han.

503
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,416
Hello.

504
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,875
-Cool.
-Very impressive.

505
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:13,958
Did you spend a lot of time on it
to get the girls' attention?

506
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,166
Hey, girls.

507
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,541
Come here, I want to tell you something.

508
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:21,291
Your face is very pretty.

509
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,416
-Hey, girls. Don't go.
-Girls.

510
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,833
-Girls, talk to us.
-Girls.

511
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,791
How about a scooter ride?

512
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,333
-Hey, girls.
-Girls, come here.

513
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,166
-Do you play musical instruments?
-Which club are you in?

514
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,833
Why does everybody grow their hair longer,

515
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,875
but you cut yours shorter?

516
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,916
Fuck, it's that weirdo again.

517
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,958
Jia-han.

518
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,708
Watch out for that weirdo
when you join Class H.

519
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,958
Hey, everyone with the name "Birdy"
are weirdos.

520
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:57,333
There was one in my friend's class.

521
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,791
Fuck, there was one
in my class in middle school too.

522
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,833
Watch out in Class H.

523
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,208
If he dares to do anything,

524
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,833
just give us a shout
and we'll be there right away.

525
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,458
What are you looking at?

526
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,041
-Come on.
-Come on.

527
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,083
Let's go.

528
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,125
Jia-han.

529
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,791
-Jia-han, what are you doing?
-Where are you going?

530
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:20,791
Chang Jia-han!

531
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,333
I'm in the same class as him.

532
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,458
If I don't go with him,
should I go to Class A with you?

533
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:47,625
Attention.

534
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,833
Take a break.

535
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:51,083
Boys and girls should practice separately.

536
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,375
Don't think I can't discipline you
in the club.

537
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,208
Instructor, what's going on?

538
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:57,666
Why do you say that?

539
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,666
Father.

540
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,750
Boys in puberty are very horny.

541
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,791
What if they fail
the college entrance exam?

542
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:08,250
Dating and studying are different matters.

543
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,291
You can ask them to study hard,

544
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,750
but you shouldn't separate them
like prisoners.

545
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,791
Father, please stay out of this.

546
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,750
God wants you to teach love,
not love between boys and girls.

547
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,416
This is a school rule,
don't make it difficult for me.

548
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,583
I told you to move.
Why are you still sitting together?

549
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,041
-Separate!
-Instructor.

550
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,416
I'm in charge of the band.

551
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,791
I have my way of dealing with this.

552
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,375
Your way of dealing with it

553
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,625
is gathering the students here
and letting them mess around.

554
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,958
Sir, do you have to make it
sound so nasty?

555
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:42,041
Do you see me talking nastily?

556
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:45,083
I only heard you.
I didn't want to look at you.

557
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,166
Which class are you in?

558
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,041
How dare you talk to me that way?

559
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:53,250
-What kind of school do you think this is?
-Instructor, you don't have to be so mean.

560
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,500
I'm just trying to have a discussion.

561
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,291
Why do you make us sound so dirty?

562
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,250
If I weren't mean,
would you take my words seriously?

563
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,208
Would you?

564
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,833
Will separating us prevent us
from messing around?

565
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:05,791
Wang Po-te.

566
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,333
So after we graduate,

567
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,500
please split the world into two

568
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,583
and return to the era
of concentration camps.

569
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:14,250
Watch your attitude.

570
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:17,625
You're in school,
a place that helps you get into college.

571
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,416
So as long as we get into college,

572
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,125
we don't need to learn
about normal social activities?

573
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:23,291
You're a student.

574
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,125
Students should obey the school rules.

575
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,500
So which rule says

576
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,875
that the seniors can't teach
the juniors in a band?

577
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,958
So what's the point of joining the band?

578
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,250
Fine, I'll remember you two.

579
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,791
You two had better watch out.

580
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:37,291
Sure, sir.

581
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,166
Class H, 12th Grade, Wang Po-te.

582
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,458
Class A, 10th Grade, Wu Juo-fei.

583
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,708
Instructor, you may leave.
You don't seem to be welcome here.

584
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,000
If anything happens,
you'll be responsible.

585
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,541
Just go.

586
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,583
Goodbye, sir.

587
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:51,958
-Back to practice.
-Goodbye.

588
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,208
Let's continue.

589
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,541
You should stay away from the girls.

590
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,000
You never know

591
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,583
what the school would do about it.

592
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,875
You sound just like
that annoying instructor.

593
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,166
Finish your food.

594
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,833
We'll rehearse the military song.

595
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,708
Hey.

596
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,916
Hey.

597
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,500
What's the matter?

598
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,208
How did you get all those wounds?

599
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,708
Did Horn and his friends--

600
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,166
No.

601
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,708
Another class did this.

602
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,833
One of my classmates
hit me here with a brick.

603
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,375
-And this is--
-Hold on.

604
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,750
I actually want to ask you,

605
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,625
when did you start liking boys?

606
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,833
Have you thought of seeing a doctor?

607
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,416
Or have you thought of

608
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,416
getting a girlfriend?

609
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,416
I've known that I like guys
since I was little.

610
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:42,625
It has never changed

611
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,625
and it never will.

612
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,625
Thank you.

613
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,416
Look at those beside you

614
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:04,583
and be in unison.

615
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,125
Left, left,

616
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,375
-left, right, left, right, left, right.
-Stop, you motherfucker!

617
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:11,291
Kill him!

618
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,916
-Where are you going?
-Try to hide!

619
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,583
-Motherfucker.
-Bring that birdman here.

620
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,583
You motherfucker.

621
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,500
-I'll break your wings.
-Get over here!

622
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,041
Let's see if you can still fly.

623
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,833
-Stay away from Jia-han.
-Fuck off!

624
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,958
What are you doing?

625
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,125
-Jia-han, stay out of this.
-Come on!

626
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What are you doing?

627
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,541
-Come down!
-Come here!

628
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,125
Why are you climbing so high?
Come down right now.

629
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,666
Shut up!

630
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,208
-Come down!
-Come down!

631
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,958
You fucking queer, stop running.

632
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,708
-Beat him up!
-Get him!

633
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,166
Kill him!

634
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,250
Hurry.

635
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:45,750
Birdy!

636
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,166
-Let me go!
-Birdy, what are you doing?

637
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,416
-Don't come near me!
-What are you doing?

638
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,458
Birdy!

639
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,041
I'm sorry. We were just joking.

640
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,250
Birdy, don't jump.

641
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,416
Horn!

642
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,000
We were just kidding, Birdy.

643
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,125
I'm sorry.

644
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,666
Birdy!

645
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,750
-What the hell?
-That scared the hell out of me.

646
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,416
Hey, boys can't be here.

647
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,250
What the fuck were you doing?

648
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,458
Chang Jia-han,

649
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,125
don't hang out with that queer

650
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:21,166
or people would think that you're gay too!

651
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,375
Birdy, where are you going?

652
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,625
Come on.

653
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:38,000
-Magnificent, mighty, serious, upright,
-Magnificent, mighty, serious, upright,

654
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:43,625
-quiet, strong, precise, agile,
-quiet, strong, precise, agile,

655
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,083
-alert, brave.
-alert, brave.

656
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,333
Halt.

657
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,500
March in place.

658
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,000
Foggy night

659
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,750
Ready, sing.

660
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:04,458
-Foggy night, stars and moon are dim
-Foggy night, stars and moon are dim

661
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,083
-Only the sound of guns echoes all round
-Only the sound of guns echoes all round

662
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:11,375
-Only shots are flying everywhere
-Only shots are flying everywhere

663
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:14,958
-Toes on the ground, hold your weapons
-Toes on the ground, hold your weapons

664
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,500
-Heroic warriors
-Heroic warriors

665
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:20,541
-Advance into the dark wilderness
-Advance into the dark wilderness

666
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,583
-In this world
-In this world

667
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:27,791
-Sometimes there's hope
-Sometimes there's hope

668
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,625
-And disappointment
-And disappointment

669
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,416
-That's how I feel
-That's how I feel

670
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,541
-How I feel
-How I feel

671
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:37,666
In this world

672
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,083
There's some joy

673
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:44,500
-There's some sadness, no one can escape
-Hey, he's so handsome.

674
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,208
-No.
-No one can escape it

675
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,416
-I think Birdy is more handsome.
-Our world

676
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,541
-Is not as bad as you think
-Is not as bad as you think

677
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,958
-Why let it get you down?
-Why let it get you down?

678
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,666
-Use your concern…
-Stop!

679
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,375
What are you singing?
This is a military song competition.

680
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,291
What kind of wimpy song are you singing?

681
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,750
Which school are you from?

682
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,958
Who is your advisor?

683
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:08,083
This is ridiculous!

684
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,083
You're disqualified! Leave!

685
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:14,708
Come on, let's go.

686
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,458
Next, Taichung First Senior High.
Please get ready.

687
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,375
Wang Po-te.

688
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,875
Go away!

689
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,708
That's enough.

690
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:28,958
Birdy.

691
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:30,500
Come on.

692
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,541
You were performing for everyone.

693
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,291
Don't be upset because of him.

694
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,750
They don't understand you, but I do.

695
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,916
Come on.

696
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,708
Don't be mad.

697
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,125
I was going to give this
to you this morning.

698
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,166
It's a throat lozenge.

699
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,416
Fuck!

700
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:21,625
Hey.

701
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,375
Are you eating the noodles
like they were the judges?

702
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,291
That's right.

703
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,750
Why don't you eat the plate too?

704
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm kidding.

705
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,583
Losing isn't a big deal.

706
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,041
Cheers.

707
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,666
I'm not afraid of losing.

708
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,125
We didn't even get to finish the song.

709
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
We practiced for over two months.

710
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,625
What's wrong with them?

711
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:47,500
I thought martial law was lifted.

712
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,958
Do you think the world has changed?

713
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:53,041
Actually, it hasn't changed a bit.

714
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,791
In my opinion, you've already
won the competition.

715
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:58,333
Didn't you see the audience's reaction?

716
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,125
I don't know what they were thinking.

717
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,208
It was a lot of fun.

718
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,125
Chang Jia-han, what's wrong?

719
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,000
It was a risky move anyway.

720
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,625
The judges would
either love it or hate it.

721
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,541
Hey, Banban.

722
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:20,208
Whose songs are you listening to recently?

723
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,541
-Bobby Chen's. Have you heard of him?
-I have.

724
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,333
I like his "The Crowded Paradise."

725
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,708
I like that one too.

726
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,541
Let me play it for you.

727
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:34,791
Don't move.

728
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,166
Are you two dating?

729
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,916
I thought the world revolved around us.

730
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:06,916
How did I become an outsider
all of a sudden?

731
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,375
Jealousy is like a snake.

732
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,958
It will eat your heart.

733
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,625
Heavenly Father,

734
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,250
why is it a sin

735
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:37,666
to love someone?

736
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,083
What are you doing?

737
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,208
Praying.

738
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,666
Heavenly Father,

739
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,750
Chang Jia-han's heart is heavily laden.

740
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:03,875
He's in 12th grade now.

741
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,458
He doesn't focus on his studies.

742
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:07,833
He's probably too lonely.

743
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,750
Please use your mighty power

744
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,750
to help him find a girl
whom he truly likes.

745
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:16,833
Amen.

746
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:24,791
Do I look funny to you?

747
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,166
You're so lame.

748
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,375
You shouldn't act this way.

749
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:37,833
What way?

750
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,791
Can you stop hanging out with me alone?

751
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,166
We can be very good friends.

752
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,958
How about I introduce you to a girl?

753
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,125
A girl from Banban's class.

754
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,708
I'm going out with her tonight.

755
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,958
Lend me your scooter.

756
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:06,583
Come on, give me the key.

757
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,458
The key.

758
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,583
I didn't expect you to call me.

759
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,666
I'm sorry about last time,
I must have scared you.

760
00:50:55,541 --> 00:50:58,166
I was reading Non-no magazine recently.

761
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,041
Do you know how to romanize
the Mandarin word for "good night"?

762
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,791
W-A-N A-N.

763
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,166
Each letter has a meaning.

764
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:14,333
W means "I."

765
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:19,166
A means "love."

766
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,000
N means "you."

767
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,166
A-N

768
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:33,375
means "love you."

769
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,083
You know that if you dial codes
into a pager,

770
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,666
they'll appear in English, right?

771
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:44,958
This is our secret code now.

772
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,000
Chang Jia-han.

773
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,083
Chang Jia-han.

774
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,000
Chang Jia-han.

775
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,583
Why did you call me yesterday?

776
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,208
Did you need the scooter?

777
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:08,208
I went out with Banban last night,
I didn't bring the pager with me.

778
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,875
It was pretty late when I got back.

779
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,500
I was afraid you had gone to bed.

780
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,833
-So I--
-I have something to tell you.

781
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,208
Okay, let's talk tonight.

782
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,125
Listen.

783
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,333
Let's go somewhere at midnight.

784
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:27,958
I need your assistance.

785
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,958
Shit.

786
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,166
Why are you stealing that?

787
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,666
I'm going to do something big,
don't ask about it yet.

788
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,500
Birdy!

789
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,125
What?

790
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,041
Actually,

791
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,750
I was going to tell you yesterday--

792
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,083
Look at this gigantic balloon!

793
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:16,541
Teamwork!

794
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:19,708
Our world

795
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:25,083
Is not as bad as you think

796
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:27,833
Why let it get you down?

797
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,333
March, line up properly.

798
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,625
Don't be so lethargic in the morning.

799
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,291
The next class, follow closely.

800
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,208
Boys, what are you looking at?

801
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,625
Don't peep at the girls.

802
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,916
Keep walking.

803
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,791
You're still peeping?
I'm talking about you!

804
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,958
Those at the back, follow closely!

805
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:53,666
Didn't you eat breakfast?

806
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,125
What's going on?

807
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,708
-"Good night, my love"?
-It's so pretty.

808
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:15,666
A balloon!

809
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,250
GOOD NIGHT, MY LOVE

810
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,625
That's so nice.

811
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:21,375
What's going on?

812
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,916
Hey, that's enough.

813
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,916
Is this the big thing
you were talking about?

814
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,625
-Hush, it's a surprise.
-Quiet! Stop it, keep quiet!

815
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,916
So you knew what "good night"
meant when I asked?

816
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,833
Keep quiet!

817
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:35,875
I'd look it up even if you didn't tell me.

818
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:41,583
Be quiet!

819
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,791
No more talking!

820
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,250
Try talking one more time!

821
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,958
Who did this?

822
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,416
How dare you!

823
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,833
Does nobody want to admit it?

824
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,333
The school will still find out.

825
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,666
You'd better turn yourself in now.

826
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,708
You'll get worse punishment
if I catch you.

827
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,208
Don't press your luck.

828
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:06,083
Hello, this is the call center.

829
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,166
Which number are you sending a message to?

830
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,625
Hello?

831
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:12,916
Hello?

832
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:14,708
Hi.

833
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,208
Please leave a message for

834
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:20,208
070

835
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,750
158

836
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,166
178.

837
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,791
Tell him that Jia-han is looking for him

838
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,750
and asking him where he is.

839
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,041
Please ask him

840
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,541
to get back to me.

841
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,541
I often come here.

842
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,500
I spend the whole day here.

843
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,333
I can't help it,

844
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,833
I'm getting old.

845
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:49,166
What the fuck?

846
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,875
Why do you have to do this?

847
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,708
We're different.

848
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,375
I'm not fucking like you!

849
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:56,416
Goddamn it!

850
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Fuck off!

851
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:19,083
You were the one who told me
to live in the moment.

852
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,666
I didn't know you liked boys at that time.

853
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,375
So you can like girls,

854
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,625
but I can't like boys?

855
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,875
Is your love bigger than the love I give?

856
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,541
Tell me.

857
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,875
What's the difference
between your love and mine?

858
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:39,125
Tell me the difference!

859
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,666
If he doesn't love you,

860
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,208
don't force him to.

861
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,541
That is also living in the moment.

862
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,541
That's impossible!

863
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,791
I can feel that he cares about me too.

864
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,625
"Care" doesn't necessarily mean love.

865
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,541
The bible tells us to control our desires.

866
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,625
Don't cause others to go to hell.

867
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,166
Help me go to hell then.

868
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,458
I'd rather go to hell now.

869
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,500
Don't all homosexuals
deserve to go to hell?

870
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:19,208
Maybe more people
would understand me in hell.

871
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:22,791
Make it easy for me
and help me go to hell.

872
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,458
Jia-han.

873
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:33,708
Jia-han.

874
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:35,666
No! Go back to your heaven!

875
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:57,791
Thank you.

876
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,416
I'm sorry.

877
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:08,666
I crashed your scooter.

878
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,875
What are you talking about?

879
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:13,166
What are you apologizing for?

880
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,375
I'll pay for the scooter.

881
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,500
You don't need to pay for it, okay?

882
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,250
What are you saying?

883
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,000
Let me know how much and I'll pay!

884
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,625
I said you don't need to, okay?

885
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,166
Which part don't you understand?

886
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,166
Did you call an ambulance?

887
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:35,291
I did!

888
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,958
That betelnut stand lady up ahead
called them.

889
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,666
Fuck, she's so nosy.

890
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,458
If you didn't want to call one,
then why did you?

891
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:08,166
MAINTAIN CLEANLINESS

892
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:25,166
I'm sorry.

893
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,416
I've called a workshop
to get your scooter.

894
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,375
I'll take care of it.

895
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,375
Don't worry.

896
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,166
I never said that I was worried.

897
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:41,000
Is that the only thing you care about?

898
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,708
Go away, I can do it myself.

899
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,666
Can you stop being so annoying?

900
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:06,791
What are you doing?

901
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:14,750
It hurts!

902
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,875
So how are you going
to do it yourself then?

903
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,083
Spread your legs wider.

904
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Turn around.

905
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,208
Chang Jia-han.

906
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,166
That's enough.

907
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,583
I'm sorry.

908
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,083
I'm sorry.

909
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

910
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,916
Hey, pass the ball here.

911
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,083
-Watch out.
-Thank you.

912
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,208
Hurry up.

913
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,291
I can do it by myself.

914
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,666
Hey.

915
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,958
-Lately--
-I'm done.

916
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,083
Enjoy your lunch.

917
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,541
-He's so cool.
-You can do it, Birdy!

918
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,083
Go!

919
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,833
Dodge him.

920
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:26,958
Nice one.

921
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,625
-What was it for?
-Disorderly conduct.

922
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,416
They were given major demerits.

923
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,791
-The balloon love confession.
-How can this happen?

924
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:39,583
-So Wang Po-te did the balloon. So cool.
-Right.

925
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,041
Dating isn't bad.

926
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,333
Why did the boy only get detention
and the girl get expelled?

927
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:53,166
WANG PO-TE: FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT,

928
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,625
TWO MAJOR AND TWO MINOR
DEMERITS AND DETENTION.

929
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:02,125
WU JUO-FEI: FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT,

930
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:06,500
THREE MAJOR DEMERITS AND EXPULSION.

931
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,791
-Park the car for me.
-Sir, it's good to see you here.

932
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:21,916
Where is he?

933
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,000
-Mr. Wang.
-Don't run away!

934
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:26,541
-Don't beat the kid.
-Come back!

935
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,833
Come back here!

936
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:29,375
Fuck!

937
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,416
Mr. Wang.

938
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,666
You're the president
of the Parents Association.

939
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,791
It's not good to hit your kid at school.

940
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,000
Mr. Wang, we're at school.

941
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:39,416
Stop this.
We don't approve of corporal punishment.

942
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,541
-Fuck you.
-Why are you acting this way?

943
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,833
-Please stop.
-I'm teaching my son a lesson.

944
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,416
This is none of your business.

945
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,000
My son is useless.

946
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:48,583
Don't you dare run away!

947
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,125
Your three older sisters
are nothing like you!

948
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:54,583
If I had known, I wouldn't have had you.

949
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:56,125
Then you shouldn't have!

950
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,458
I shouldn't have?

951
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,750
What the fuck are you talking about?

952
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,208
Chang Jia-han, what are you doing here?

953
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:08,875
Chang Jia-han, why are you here?

954
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:11,583
-You want to get beaten up?
-Go to class.

955
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:13,166
What the hell are you doing here?

956
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,583
What?

957
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,166
What are you doing?

958
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,583
If I don't teach you a lesson,
you'll never learn.

959
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,458
Stop beating him up!

960
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:24,875
Get out of my way, it's not your business!

961
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:25,875
Don't you dare run.

962
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,291
-You're tough?
-Sir, stop it!

963
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,291
You bastard.

964
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,541
Sir, please stop!

965
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,291
Who are you?

966
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,791
How is he related to you?

967
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:40,416
I'm disciplining my son,
get out of my way!

968
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,541
Go away!

969
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,625
It's none of your business.

970
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,125
Why is it none of my business?

971
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,125
It's my love affair, not yours.

972
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:50,708
Instructor.

973
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,041
It's my love affair.

974
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,333
It was me!

975
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:54,708
What nonsense is this?

976
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,875
When did you have a love affair?

977
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,625
What would you know about my love affair?

978
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,416
Instructor, it was my love affair.

979
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,541
I set up the balloon.

980
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:05,500
It was me!

981
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,041
What are you two doing?

982
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,208
Why are you treating me this way?

983
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:20,333
-All right, stop fighting!
-That's enough!

984
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,333
Stop fighting!

985
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,416
Stop fighting!

986
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,083
-Stop! That's enough.
-Stop!

987
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,666
-Enough!
-Stop!

988
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,625
Jia-han!

989
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,875
Enough!

990
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:30,875
Leave me alone!

991
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,291
Why?

992
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,541
-That's enough!
-What are you doing?

993
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,666
Wang Po-te.

994
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,375
This is a school, not your home.

995
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,166
Father.

996
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,291
These two are in the band.

997
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:45,958
I told you,

998
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,916
you must separate the boys and girls.

999
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,958
Look at this.

1000
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,458
They're messing around.

1001
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,541
-Wang Po-te, what are you doing?
-Don't mind him!

1002
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,041
Just let him go to hell!

1003
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:14,291
When I was 18,
I was a rebel just like you.

1004
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,333
I was beaten up
by our church's priest every day.

1005
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,416
The last time he did it,
he beat the crap out of me,

1006
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,583
like you are now.

1007
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,833
That's why I decided to leave Montreal.

1008
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,666
I wanted to get as far away as possible.

1009
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:35,125
I didn't think my hometown
would change after I left.

1010
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,333
When was that?

1011
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,625
Almost 30 years ago.

1012
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:54,916
In 1960,
the Quiet Revolution happened in Montreal.

1013
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,458
Society broke free from the church.

1014
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:00,333
People could finally follow their hearts

1015
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,291
and choose for themselves.

1016
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,250
I missed the revolution in Montreal,

1017
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,166
but I encountered your revolution here.

1018
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,375
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1019
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,333
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

1020
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,458
Give us this day our daily bread.

1021
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,583
Jia-han!

1022
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:31,166
-And forgive our trespasses as we--
-Jia-han!

1023
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,333
Father Oliver.

1024
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:35,541
Jia-han's mom called the school

1025
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,708
and asked him to go home.

1026
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,625
I don't want to go home.

1027
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:47,833
But

1028
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:50,291
your mom said,

1029
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,125
Birdy is at your house.

1030
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:23,541
What did you do at school?

1031
01:15:23,625 --> 01:15:24,541
What?

1032
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,458
Did you try to steal his girlfriend?

1033
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:32,416
What do you want?

1034
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,125
Why did you come here?

1035
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,041
The college entrance exam is coming up,

1036
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,958
I should really concentrate on studying.

1037
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,416
And your dad and mom

1038
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,458
should know what's going on
with you at school.

1039
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,916
I'm the one who has a girlfriend.

1040
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,458
Why did you interfere?

1041
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:56,916
Why are you covered in cuts and bruises?
Did you get into a fight?

1042
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,333
No.

1043
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:00,375
You're such a loser.

1044
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,291
You stole his girl and fought with him.

1045
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,958
I didn't steal his girlfriend!

1046
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,833
Why is he here then?

1047
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,875
Jia-han.

1048
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:10,625
Both of you are best friends.

1049
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,250
Don't fight over a love affair.

1050
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:16,458
-You are still young.
-Mr. and Mrs. Chang.

1051
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:19,250
-Don't worry about it. I'll get going.
-Okay.

1052
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:22,625
Tell me,

1053
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:24,625
what do you want from me?

1054
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,750
You're best friends, so don't fight.

1055
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,208
So are we only best friends?

1056
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,625
What do you want then?

1057
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,208
I'm doing this for you.

1058
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,875
You can have a girlfriend
when you go to college.

1059
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:44,875
What if he doesn't find one in college?

1060
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,875
That's okay, he's still young.

1061
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,541
What if he never has a girlfriend?

1062
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:51,666
Wang Po-te.

1063
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,291
Stop being an asshole.

1064
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,375
How is it your business
if I get a girlfriend or not?

1065
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:01,791
So who doesn't have the balls now?

1066
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,583
Can you stop bothering me?

1067
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:20,083
Okay.

1068
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,416
Dad.

1069
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,291
Mom.

1070
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,750
I don't like the girl.

1071
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,000
-Actually, I like--
-Chang Jia-han!

1072
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:37,500
Can you stop bothering me?

1073
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,416
I dare to say who I like.

1074
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,208
Do you dare?

1075
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,541
Have you lost your mind?

1076
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,041
Have you gone crazy?

1077
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:54,875
Chang Jia-han.

1078
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,708
Can you stop acting like a queer?

1079
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,041
What's wrong with being a queer?

1080
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,958
Does it disgust you?

1081
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:09,208
If you find it so disgusting,
say it right to my face.

1082
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,333
Say it right to my face!

1083
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,500
-Jia-han!
-Where are you going?

1084
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:16,958
Jia-han!

1085
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,000
Chang Jia-han, where are you going?

1086
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,416
Chang Jia-han!

1087
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:32,458
Let's go back!

1088
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:01,333
Chang Jia-han, where are you going?

1089
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,083
-Thank you.
-Attention, passengers.

1090
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:10,041
The ship is ready for boarding now.

1091
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,083
One ticket, please.

1092
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,250
What time?

1093
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,833
Just give me whatever he got.

1094
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:24,708
What are you looking at?

1095
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:32,583
Dear passengers.

1096
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:35,083
We'll be arriving at Magong Harbor
on Penghu Island.

1097
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:36,791
Please follow the instructions

1098
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,333
-to proceed to disembark.
-Stupid bird.

1099
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:43,250
-Why do you keep following them?
-Don't forget your belongings.

1100
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,625
Chang Jia-han!

1101
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:48,250
Let's go back!

1102
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,625
Do you know you're crazier than me?

1103
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,625
I won't give a damn anymore
if you don't stop!

1104
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:07,833
I'm serious!

1105
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,291
When did you ever give a damn about me?

1106
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,458
Tell me, when have you ever
cared about me?

1107
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,166
I just want to go
to a place without you, okay?

1108
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:37,583
Go then.

1109
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:39,583
Keep going then.

1110
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,958
Let's see how far you can go.

1111
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,250
Where exactly do you want to go?

1112
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,916
I'll go wherever I want to go.

1113
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,708
You can't run away.

1114
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,916
You're not going anywhere.

1115
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,625
I'll show you how far I can go.

1116
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,166
-Fuck!
-Fuck!

1117
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,333
The tide kept rising.

1118
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:09,125
I really hoped

1119
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:12,250
this would be the end of the world.

1120
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:17,791
After that day,

1121
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,958
he said he'd prepare
for the college entrance exam.

1122
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:22,750
And we never

1123
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:24,750
saw each other again.

1124
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:36,958
THE 17TH WITT HIGH SCHOOL

1125
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:41,291
MARCHING BAND REUNION

1126
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,500
I remember I once said,

1127
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,000
"Live in the moment."

1128
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:30,000
-Live in the moment.
-Live in the moment.

1129
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,458
-Cheers!
-To our good health.

1130
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,375
How is that possible?

1131
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:38,291
-People become more cowardly as they age.
-That's true.

1132
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:39,583
It's Chang Jia-han.

1133
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,041
Horn, go talk to him.

1134
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,166
Gosh, look who it is.

1135
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,666
-Chang Jia-han.
-Chang Jia-han.

1136
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:51,958
Where have you been hiding?

1137
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:55,125
Everybody, it's Chang Jia-han's
first time at our reunion.

1138
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,875
He's from the Liberal Arts studies.

1139
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:58,583
Let's give it up for him.

1140
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:02,000
Wow, you're still so handsome.

1141
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,916
Come on, bottoms up.

1142
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,833
Now, I'm giving you a copy
of the contacts first.

1143
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:11,291
I've also sent an electronic copy
to our LINE group.

1144
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:14,750
When you have time,

1145
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:19,500
please update it
since these are very out of date.

1146
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:20,875
Pass them around, thank you.

1147
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,166
Is this Birdy?

1148
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:15,541
Birdy.

1149
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:19,500
Birdy.

1150
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,875
Long time no see.

1151
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:30,291
How have you been?

1152
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,875
I'm fine.

1153
01:28:39,208 --> 01:28:40,750
I didn't expect you to page me.

1154
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,541
Are you confident
to retake the exam this year?

1155
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,375
I don't know.

1156
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,791
What do you mean by that?

1157
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:52,583
All the best, you can do it.

1158
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,041
Did you change your phone number?

1159
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,458
My dad said someone kept calling
and not talking.

1160
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,083
It wasn't me.

1161
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:04,125
I know.

1162
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:08,041
You didn't tell me that you moved.

1163
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,291
Is everything okay

1164
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,250
with you and Banban?

1165
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:26,625
She said

1166
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,958
that being with me

1167
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,958
is like being in a Chiung Yao movie.

1168
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,958
It's not realistic.

1169
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:39,958
Isn't that good?

1170
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:45,333
Everyone's first love

1171
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,541
is as great as an epic movie.

1172
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,208
Don't you think so?

1173
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,625
There's a new song recently.

1174
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,291
I…

1175
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,000
No, one of my seniors wrote it.

1176
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,291
Is it okay

1177
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:07,708
if I play it for you?

1178
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:26,000
Searching for you

1179
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:32,291
Out of everyone, you came into my mind

1180
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:39,166
I've been trying so hard
Not to think of you

1181
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:46,208
But the memories brought me back again

1182
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:52,500
Your name engraved herein

1183
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:55,958
Making time go by without a trace

1184
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:58,708
I've decided to love

1185
01:30:58,791 --> 01:31:03,250
Only one for the rest of my life

1186
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:06,875
I hope that the world would stand still

1187
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:11,458
So missing you wouldn't be a luxury

1188
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,375
If I have another chance

1189
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:17,875
I'd surely love again

1190
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:21,583
Your name engraved herein

1191
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:25,250
You're buried deep down in the dust

1192
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,875
If I didn't do so

1193
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:32,375
I wouldn't be able to live my life

1194
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:36,125
Living in a city
That only reminds me of you

1195
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:40,750
Holding the key to fly into the sky

1196
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:42,625
Continue to fly

1197
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:49,291
I'm always here for you

1198
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,875
I didn't expect you to pick up the phone.

1199
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,041
How has he been doing recently?

1200
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:15,208
I don't know.

1201
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:19,000
When I'm busy,
I ask him to take care of our child.

1202
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,541
I don't bother to ask about other things.

1203
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:24,791
Birdy and I are divorced.

1204
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:31,166
I only understood later on.

1205
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:37,375
Liking boys

1206
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,916
is innate.

1207
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:54,000
If I had known,
I wouldn't have tried so hard.

1208
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:58,500
It has ruined my life,

1209
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:01,625
and his.

1210
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,041
Fuck this.

1211
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:20,291
This waterfall
separates Canada and America.

1212
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:21,833
America is right across there.

1213
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:26,000
It's said that an ancient Indian tribe
once lived behind it.

1214
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:31,083
The girls there
couldn't choose their own lover.

1215
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,291
They had to follow
their parents' arrangements.

1216
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:36,250
Thousands of years ago,
there was a girl just as pretty as me.

1217
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:40,208
She didn't want to marry the old ugly man
her parents had chosen,

1218
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:44,083
so she cried for a day and a night
on top of the waterfall, then jumped off.

1219
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:46,083
She disappeared into the water.

1220
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:49,375
Since then, people noticed a mermaid
in the water.

1221
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:55,458
I heard that the mermaid
looks exactly like that girl.

1222
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,208
Hey.

1223
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:45,875
Didn't you leave already?

1224
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,458
I was going inside,
but I saw you walking out.

1225
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:55,208
How did you know that I'd be here?

1226
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:58,875
I just came to try my luck.

1227
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:03,000
I saw you sitting there
in the afternoon the other day.

1228
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:05,333
You saw me?

1229
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:09,958
Why didn't you say hello?

1230
01:41:13,958 --> 01:41:17,750
Perhaps I didn't expect to bump into you
in such a place.

1231
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:26,000
Did you come to visit Father Oliver too?

1232
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:29,083
Yes, I wanted to thank him.

1233
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:35,208
Because I'd go to him
whenever I was confused.

1234
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:44,500
Back then, Father probably didn't want me
to suffer the pain he'd experienced,

1235
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,291
so he kept stopping me from liking you.

1236
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:53,708
But I would've preferred
to experience those things.

1237
01:41:58,125 --> 01:42:00,375
We both did a lot of stupid things before.

1238
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:05,125
I thought that by doing so,

1239
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:07,458
you would give up your…

1240
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:08,625
My feelings

1241
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,250
for you.

1242
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,541
You thought I'd give up
my feelings for you.

1243
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:17,708
How can it be that easy?

1244
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:21,583
Who knew?

1245
01:42:22,625 --> 01:42:25,208
Who knew what the world would be like
after 30 years?

1246
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:29,916
If we admitted that we were gay back then,
it would've been the end of us.

1247
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
How about now?

1248
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:33,333
You can say it out loud.

1249
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:35,333
Can you?

1250
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:41,000
Actually, I really loved you at that time.

1251
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,708
The more we hung out,

1252
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:58,583
the more I realized
that it would end badly.

1253
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,416
So I asked Banban a favor

1254
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:05,708
to find you a girl to hang out with.

1255
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,250
To seduce you.

1256
01:43:08,958 --> 01:43:12,083
And to see if you could be corrected.

1257
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:18,000
Did you think I have scoliosis
or crooked teeth

1258
01:43:18,083 --> 01:43:19,541
that I needed to be corrected?

1259
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:29,333
But later on,
Banban herself came to seduce me.

1260
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,125
I know.

1261
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:36,416
She told me.

1262
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:38,708
I was in stitches.

1263
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:45,666
How is your mom?

1264
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:49,541
She keeps asking how you were doing
and if you were married.

1265
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:51,125
What did you say?

1266
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:53,250
I said, "Who cares?"

1267
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:57,708
-I should go visit her sometimes.
-You should.

1268
01:43:59,958 --> 01:44:02,416
I remember you once took
a naked picture of me.

1269
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,958
Wasn't it the other way around?

1270
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,500
Is that so?

1271
01:44:07,458 --> 01:44:09,958
This world

1272
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:12,875
Sometimes there's hope

1273
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:15,333
And disappointment

1274
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,541
That's how I feel

1275
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:21,333
That's how I feel

1276
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:30,083
Do you really have a naked picture of me?

1277
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:32,250
Take a guess.

1278
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:35,208
Hey! Don't.

1279
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:36,625
My gosh.

1280
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:38,750
-Don't move.
-Hey!

1281
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,625
What are you doing?

1282
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,125
It's almost dawn
and you're still so hyper.

1283
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:45,250
Give it back.

1284
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:47,500
Give it back to me.

1285
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:49,708
You're so annoying.

1286
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,166
Where are you staying tonight?

1287
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:03,666
The Grand Hotel. What about you?

1288
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:07,375
Here?

1289
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:08,500
Yes.

1290
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:12,583
Okay.

1291
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:14,250
Go and get some rest.

1292
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:17,000
The hotel is just ten minutes away
on foot.

1293
01:45:22,208 --> 01:45:23,083
Hey.

1294
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:26,166
Would you like to come up
and have a drink?

1295
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:28,708
No.

1296
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:30,583
Maybe next time.

1297
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,791
Good night.

1298
01:45:40,833 --> 01:45:41,708
Good night.

1299
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:44,041
Good night.

1300
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:50,458
Good night.

1301
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:54,875
Good night.

1302
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:19,708
What's the matter?

1303
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:26,916
I'll walk with you for a bit.

1304
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:32,833
Let's go.

1305
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:36,875
Birdy, catch.

1306
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:39,458
-You suck.
-Did you screw up in the exam?

1307
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:41,666
Yes, I did terribly. Okay?

1308
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:43,416
Pass me the ball.

1309
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:45,375
The other side.

1310
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:47,875
You're not in a good mood.

1311
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,666
Why would I feel bad about my grades?

1312
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,291
You're right.

1313
01:46:56,625 --> 01:47:00,541
I don't need to know Physics or Chemistry
to make a living in the future anyway.

1314
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:06,625
