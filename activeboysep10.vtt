00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.460

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.560
Mr: Tam: I have something to say, meet you on the terrace, I won't leave if I don't meet you.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.980
Why do you evade me?

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.530
You knew about me that... ?
- I...

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.430
I can't understand, but...

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.430

But, the fact is...

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.250
You are very same with that one

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.070
The one who left me because of his responsibility with family

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.230
