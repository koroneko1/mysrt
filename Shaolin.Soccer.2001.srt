1
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,278
What is the meaning of this check?
Do you want me to cheat?

2
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,405
No. I'm just the middleman.

3
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,616
Are you playing a joke on me,
or trying to cause trouble?

4
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,286
Do you think you can
replace me if I fail?

5
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,622
Look at this!

6
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,708
I'm the only Golden Leg!

7
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,503
- Make sure you remember that.
- It's not that.

8
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,006
I just want a kickback.
Please don't tell anybody.

9
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,300
You're trash!

10
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,761
I'm sorry. Catch you later.

11
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,579
Golden Leg! Golden Leg!

12
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,233
You've been number one ever since
Fung got his golden leg broken.

13
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,236
First as a player, then as a coach.

14
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,197
I'm better than Fung ever was.

15
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,074
Team Evil has won the Supercup
the last five years.

16
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,577
- What's your secret?
- Secret?

17
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,412
They just have the best coach.

18
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,372
So you're confident
that your team will win again?

19
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,167
Are you new?
Don't ask stupid questions.

20
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,921
Good morning.

21
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,548
Good morning.

22
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,344
Golden Leg.

23
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,639
Hung! Good morning.

24
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,102
Hung, your shoe's dirty.
Let me clean it for you.

25
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,396
It's okay. I'll do it.

26
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,822
Hung, I'll get the car.

27
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,909
Hung, you said if I worked hard
I could coach my own team.

28
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm ready!

29
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,914
I think I can train a team
to be as good as Team Evil.

30
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,793
Do you really think
I'd let you coach?

31
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,336
But you said…

32
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,088
Get real.

33
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,465
You're a joke.

34
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,218
Take a look at yourself.

35
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,721
This tattoo is all that's left
of your fame.

36
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,431
Hung…

37
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,476
I've served you for 20 years.
How can you say that?

38
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,980
Let's be honest.
Things have changed.

39
00:05:55,105 --> 00:06:00,110
You used to be a great player,
but now you're nothing.

40
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,861
I've had enough.

41
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,030
I've kept you around for 20 years…

42
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,700
but it's time for you
to take care of yourself.

43
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,410
Hung!

44
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,412
You've got a lot of nerve.

45
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,998
If you hadn't tricked me
with a bad check 20 years ago…

46
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,166
you'd be working for me right now.

47
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,377
It was your idea to throw the game.

48
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,045
Are you throwing a tantrum?

49
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,631
Say it a bit louder.
Did you guys hear that?

50
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,759
Make sure the reporters can hear it.

51
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,347
Say what you want.
Take a look at yourself.

52
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,517
Do you think anyone would believe
a crippled has-been like you?

53
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,561
- You…
- Don't be angry.

54
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,480
If you want to blame anyone,
blame yourself.

55
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,566
Blame your own greediness.

56
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,359
Get lost.

57
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,281
One more thing…

58
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,576
I hired that mob to break your leg.

59
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,653
Yuppies.

60
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,753
They're not very skilled
at playing soccer.

61
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,894
What was that?

62
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,274
I said…

63
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,402
they're not very skilled
at playing soccer.

64
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,491
You think you can do better?

65
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:15,745
There must be a fusion
of mind and foot.

66
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,041
What kind of fusion?

67
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,393
My late idol, Master Bruce Lee…

68
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,439
invented the ultimate kick.

69
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,484
If you want to learn about it,
I'll give you kung fu lessons.

70
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,905
Kung fu lessons?
You look like a janitor.

71
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,492
My job as janitor is only temporary.

72
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm a postgraduate student.

73
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,122
Postgraduate student?

74
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,333
I'm trying to develop
an effective method…

75
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,919
of promoting Shaolin kung fu.

76
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,047
Here's my card.

77
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,386
Authentic Shaolin school.
Mighty Steel Leg.

78
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,430
Look! I know what I'm talking about.

79
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,017
I don't need kung fu.

80
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,103
I'm more of an intellectual.

81
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,813
It doesn't matter.

82
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,693
Look at this woman.

83
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,324
Yeah, she's sexy. So what?

84
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,575
No.

85
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,494
Watch this!

86
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,676
If she knew Shaolin kung fu…

87
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,805
<i>she wouldn't have fallen.
Get me?</i>

88
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,190
Shaolin kung fu
can work for everyone!

89
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,902
Excuse me!
Do you want to learn kung fu?

90
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,862
Are you crazy?

91
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,075
Look over there.

92
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,204
If she had studied Shaolin Iron Hand
parking would be much easier.

93
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,503
Kung fu is wonderful.

94
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,507
- Excuse me, do you want to learn…
- Here. Get lost.

95
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,094
Hey, you should share that with me.

96
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,556
Let's not fight. See that guy?

97
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,351
What are you doing?
You're way too slow.

98
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,978
That's it! You're fired!

99
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,105
- I'm sorry.
- Get lost!

100
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,899
If he knew Shaolin Flying Sword…

101
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,193
<i>he'd still have a job!</i>

102
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:57,115
You think Shaolin
is the answer to everything.

103
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,076
There is nothing more powerful.
All kung fu derives from it.

104
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,433
People have the wrong idea
about kung fu.

105
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,227
It isn't really about fighting.

106
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,189
Kung fu is a complete way of life.

107
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,068
I'm looking for a good way
to show people…

108
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,364
how it can make their lives better.

109
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,159
- Enough already!
- But…

110
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:45,580
I have important things to do.
I've heard enough.

111
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,375
Please seize this opportunity!
Cripples can still learn kung fu.

112
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,628
Who are you calling a cripple!

113
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,839
This leg has kicked hundreds of goals.

114
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,924
I'm sorry!

115
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,009
Do you know who you're talking to?

116
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,094
I'm the famous Golden Leg.

117
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,679
You're…

118
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,474
just a bum!

119
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,073
- You think I'm impressed?
- Get these cans out of here.

120
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,325
- Okay.
- Right away.

121
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
Cheap trick.

122
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,402
Get lost.

123
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,760
Excuse me!
Can you help me move this?

124
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,220
No problem!

125
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,395
Your leg's amazing!

126
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,026
Twenty cents!

127
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,945
Only twenty cents?
How about an advance?

128
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,239
No way! Get lost.

129
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,284
SWEET BUNS

130
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,952
Mui, ten steamed buns please!

131
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:48,990
<i>Using Tai Chi kung fu to make
steamed buns is a brilliant idea</i>

132
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:54,453
<i>They look so sweet and tasty</i>

133
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,040
<i>Your mastery is astonishing</i>

134
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:02,962
<i>It shows in your every movement</i>

135
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,134
What are you doing?

136
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,848
Singing is the best way for me
to express my greatest esteem.

137
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,560
Wow, what a beauty!

138
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,356
I'm not beautiful.
Don't laugh at me!

139
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,817
I bet the steamed buns are wonderful.

140
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,823
Delicious!

141
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,743
Was that Shifting Bodies
and Transposing Shadows?

142
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,663
No, it's Shove A Thousand Cattle
with Four Tails.

143
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,582
Right!

144
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,877
That's why the buns
are so tender, yet firm.

145
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,756
Sixty cents each.
Two for a dollar.

146
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,218
That much?

147
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,678
They're worth every penny.

148
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,014
This is all I have.

149
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,517
- Can I pay tomorrow?
- No!

150
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:01,145
Spoken with the grace and economy
of a true kung fu master.

151
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,855
I'm a Shaolin master too.

152
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,149
- Can I pay tomorrow?
- No!

153
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,526
Okay!

154
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,323
Here are some fine sneakers.

155
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,910
I'll give them to you,
if you let me have one more bun.

156
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
- I'll call the cops.
- Fine.

157
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,040
Come on, give me a break.

158
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,793
You're so beautiful.

159
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,088
Shut up!

160
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,298
Please stop singing.

161
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,342
Just pay and get out of here.

162
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,553
If you want to sing,
do it on the mountain.

163
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,680
Only crazy people sing here.

164
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,808
I disagree with the young lady.

165
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,563
Just because you sing out loud here
doesn't make you a lunatic.

166
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,275
My name is Dynamite.

167
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,779
My dream is to become
a great composer one day.

168
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:58,119
This gentleman's song
is very creative and sincere.

169
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,705
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

170
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,125
I also love to sing.

171
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,421
When I'm inspired
I feel so passionate…

172
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,548
I could explode.

173
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,319
<i>My dream is to become
a great choreographer</i>

174
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,342
Let's go!

175
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,963
Have you lost your mind?

176
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:39,011
Stand straight! Put your hands down!
Get to work!

177
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,471
Lunatics!

178
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,432
What's going on here?

179
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,729
I never should have gone
for a facial…

180
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,857
and left the place in your hands!

181
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,943
What do you want?

182
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,445
Relax. We were just having fun.

183
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,115
I'm here for the buns.

184
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,619
What about my buns?

185
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,123
Okay! Okay! Just a minute!
Did that bum pay?

186
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,503
He did.

187
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,298
These are disgusting.
Get rid of them!

188
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,521
First Brother!

189
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,821
First Brother!

190
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,076
Okay, okay. Keep working!
Clean everything!

191
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,789
Are you sick, First Brother?

192
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,710
I've got a bit of a hangover.
What do you want?

193
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,547
- I've had a revelation.
- A revelation?

194
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:02,344
How to promote kung fu
in a brand new way.

195
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,471
Not again.

196
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,016
Singing!

197
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,353
You know we're great singers.
You can't deny it.

198
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:16,358
- Leave me alone.
- We owe it to our teacher.

199
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,276
He's dead.

200
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,403
- It's worth a try.
- Forget it.

201
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,156
I told you to be down-to-earth.

202
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,075
There's an opening here.
You can clean toilets.

203
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,119
Don't waste your life
chasing dreams.

204
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,372
Without dreams,
we're no different than anchovies.

205
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,501
You are an anchovy,
you shoeless small fry.

206
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,629
- Why chase your dream?
- Why not.

207
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,757
The fire in my heart
can't be easily extinguished.

208
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,801
Why not? Just blow it out.

209
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,930
- But I can light it up again.
- Enough already!

210
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,265
We both have our own lives.

211
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,019
Please don't bother me.
I have to work to support my family.

212
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,650
You're just going to forget about
your Iron Head after all that work?

213
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,360
Never!

214
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,613
I still practice my Iron Head…

215
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,032
every single day!

216
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,492
Fei!

217
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,910
Boss.

218
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,453
You idiot!

219
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,957
You forgot to book
a band for tonight.

220
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,502
- Don't worry, I have an idea.
- Tell me.

221
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,964
Let's combine Shaolin kung fu
with singing and dancing.

222
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,550
- What kind of Shaolin kung fu?
- Observe.

223
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,472
Is he good enough
to perform on stage?

224
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,684
- He's good enough.
- How about you?

225
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,310
Me?

226
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,813
Shit.

227
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,815
How about your Iron Head?

228
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,652
If you don't perform well,
I'll kill you tomorrow.

229
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,572
- Sure.
- First Big Brother, thank you.

230
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,547
<i>- Shaolin kung fu is great
- Really great</i>

231
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:06,135
- Shaolin kung fu is wonderful
- Wonderful

232
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,514
<i>- I'm Iron Head
- Iron Head</i>

233
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,436
<i>- He's Mighty Steel Leg
- Mighty Steel Leg</i>

234
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,525
Be serious!

235
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,488
<i>- Shaolin kung fu is great
- Really great</i>

236
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,748
<i>- Shaolin kung fu is great
- Really great</i>

237
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:40,419
<i>- Shaolin kung fu is wonderful
- Wonderful</i>

238
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,381
<i>- I'm Mighty Steel Leg
- Mighty Steel Leg</i>

239
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,926
<i>He's Iron Head</i>

240
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,847
I'm choking.

241
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,049
It sounds like you're
strangling a cat.

242
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,550
This song sucks.

243
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,219
You sounded like a dying animal.

244
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,887
Who wrote that garbage?

245
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,014
- Yeah, who?
- Who?

246
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:43,315
Creative work is highly subjective,
so I'll accept your criticism.

247
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,026
But it's only
the beginning of the show.

248
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,780
Wait until we show you why we're called
Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head.

249
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,698
Iron Head?

250
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,950
I told you the lyrics
were too intellectual.

251
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,537
- I'm not Iron Head. He's…
- Iron Head?

252
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,750
- Mighty Steel Leg!
- He's Mighty Steel Leg!

253
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,711
That's your Mighty Steel Leg?

254
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,214
- I'll kill you.
- Mighty Steel Leg.

255
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,718
I'm the real Mighty Steel Leg.

256
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,138
- Iron Head.
- Don't you understand?

257
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,056
- He's the real…
- Iron Head.

258
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,725
You're so stubborn.

259
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,603
Do you want to fight
with a customer?

260
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:28,402
Thank you so much.
Happy hour went by fast.

261
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,238
It's time for us to say
good night right now.

262
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,158
Let's listen to some music.

263
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,535
You crazy guy.

264
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:43,417
- Let's see how much you can take.
- Thank you.

265
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,854
You're a bum.

266
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,420
Come on. Nothing to see.

267
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,091
You want some more?
Sure you want to fight us all?

268
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,471
I promised my master
I'd never fight.

269
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,766
I told you he'd wimp out!

270
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,394
But I expect an apology!

271
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,398
An apology?
You should apologize to us!

272
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,170
You said you wouldn't use
kung fu to fight.

273
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,016
I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to play soccer.

274
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,609
So much for your kung fu…

275
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,617
Don't be such a baby. What?

276
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,738
I give up. I apologize!

277
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,049
Do you have any change?

278
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,510
Yes.

279
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,723
Thirty cents.

280
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,559
- Are you stealing my money?
- Yes.

281
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,853
- Was that Praying Mantis Style?
- Yes.

282
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,188
You should learn Shaolin instead.

283
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,679
Can I see your leg?

284
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,183
I don't care.
Do what you want.

285
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,696
It's the real deal.

286
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,955
It looks like an ordinary leg.

287
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,250
It's Shaolin Mighty Steel Leg.
It's patented.

288
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,963
You could use your kung fu
to play soccer.

289
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,759
You think so?

290
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,260
Yes, why not.

291
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,679
Of course.

292
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,141
That's a great idea. Kung fu soccer.

293
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,937
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I go about it?

294
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,689
You'll need my help.

295
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,109
I'm Golden Leg, the soccer star.

296
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,277
Now I'm a coach.

297
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,030
- Great! You can teach me soccer.
- I don't know.

298
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,074
It's a great idea.

299
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,536
I'll think about it!

300
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,873
There's nothing to think about.
We should start right now!

301
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,335
We've got nothing to lose.

302
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,925
It takes a lot of training.

303
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,511
Let's do it! What do I need?

304
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,472
A pair of shoes.

305
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,522
Do you have the money for the buns?

306
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,150
- No, but…
- 1 threw them out.

307
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,568
Oh, my God!

308
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:28,196
Those sneakers were a mess.
They were all worn out.

309
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,739
I know, I know.

310
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:34,411
If my boss sees you,
she'll start yelling.

311
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,548
I couldn't bring myself to toss them.
I fixed them instead.

312
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,243
First Brother, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

313
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm fine.

314
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,292
What do you want?

315
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,754
I finally found a great way
to promote Shaolin kung fu.

316
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,257
Soccer!

317
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,136
Please leave me alone!

318
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,097
You got me into a lot of trouble.
They demoted me.

319
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,683
Now I have to clean the toilets.

320
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,896
- But we'd be great.
- No! Absolutely not!

321
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,691
If you humiliate me again, my family
will commit suicide in front of you.

322
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,361
Committing suicide
is not the answer.

323
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,821
Be brave.
Believe in yourself.

324
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,283
I'm a complete loser. Please!
Please don't ever come here again.

325
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,912
If you want to form a soccer team,
just ask the other brothers.

326
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,832
Please, no more!

327
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,793
Hopeless.

328
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,342
Good morning, Fourth Brother.

329
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,011
Good morning, Sing.
How are you?

330
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,472
Let me introduce you
to a great guy. He's…

331
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,188
Nice to meet you!

332
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,565
I'm Fung.

333
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,317
It's an honor to meet
such a great businessman.

334
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,778
- He's got a lot of style.
- Fung is a soccer coach.

335
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,196
Soccer coach!

336
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,491
The world famous soccer coach.

337
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,410
You play soccer with your legs, right?

338
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,954
So, do you have a job for me?

339
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,873
- I want you to join my soccer team.
- Soccer team?

340
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,001
I haven't had a job in six months.

341
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,087
You can use your Empty Hand
to be the goalkeeper.

342
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,257
What's Empty Hand?
It's been so long.

343
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,342
You know, I even forgot
when our master died.

344
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,971
Listen. We're going to sign up
for the Supercup Tournament.

345
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,307
The prize is one million dollars.

346
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,143
Really? You must be the smart one.

347
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,603
You see? You're dressed up.

348
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,982
Our master taught us
that kung fu was sacred.

349
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,235
Now, you have this crazy idea
to use Shaolin for soccer.

350
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,528
Look.

351
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,405
This is the group picture
of our master and brothers.

352
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,741
I keep it under my pillow.

353
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,701
Great! Let's sit down
to talk about the picture.

354
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,914
I'll call you.
Keep a spot open for me.

355
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,421
Get lost! I really can't talk now.
My clients are waiting for me.

356
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,882
I'm doing a million dollar deal.
Can you hear me?

357
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,259
My driver's off today.

358
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:40,555
I lent my car to a friend
and left my wallet in my office.

359
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,391
I can't have lunch.
I never do.

360
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,518
I'm late! Please leave me alone.

361
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:50,273
Third Brother, you could use your
Iron Shirt technique as a fullback…

362
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,026
What's Iron Shirt?

363
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,779
Look. There are planes in the sky.

364
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,739
There are computers everywhere.

365
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,033
It's the 21st century.
Please don't daydream.

366
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,244
I think we should combine
kung fu with soccer.

367
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,623
- We could win a lot of money.
- Are you crazy?

368
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,585
There's no way I'm taking time off
to play soccer.

369
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,921
Sorry, your odds are terrible.

370
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,299
We don't know anything about soccer.

371
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,176
And let's be honest.

372
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,096
We wouldn't stand a chance.

373
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,473
In fact, the probability
of winning is 0%.

374
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,850
- Proba…
- Probability.

375
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,268
Watch.

376
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:32,357
If I toss a coin it will be heads
or it will be tails.

377
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:37,320
The probability that we'd win is the
same as a coin landing on its edge.

378
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,989
- Let me try!
- Get lost!

379
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,243
I'm having lunch with a client!

380
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,912
You said you never eat lunch.

381
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:51,584
Time is money.
I've lost a lot just talking to you!

382
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,230
He's Sixth Small Brother,
Weight Vest.

383
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,441
This is the famous soccer coach, Fung.

384
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,444
Fung, how are you?

385
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,864
- Lead Weight?
- Shaolin Lightweight.

386
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,699
Nice to meet you, Mr. Weight.

387
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,618
Fifth Brother,
you want to play soccer?

388
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,622
Yes. If you use your
Light Weight skills as a winger…

389
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,042
- our offense would be perfect.
- Are you sure?

390
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,502
- Of course.
- Great.

391
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,504
Do they sell diet pills here?

392
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,132
It's useless.

393
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,052
Ever since the virus got into my brain,
I just can't lose any weight.

394
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:46,848
I'm no longer able to use
Shaolin kung fu Weight Vest…

395
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,976
and I can't run anymore.

396
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,730
Okay, you're a little overweight,
but it's not that important.

397
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,857
Forget it.

398
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,526
This was me.

399
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,199
I can't even get a date
looking like this.

400
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,284
You don't know what it's like.

401
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,370
- I do. I can't get a date either.
- Really?

402
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,748
I've read stories about your dates
in newspapers and magazines.

403
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,667
- What kind of papers and magazines?
- I'm sorry.

404
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,879
I can no longer control myself.

405
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,925
Please leave me alone.

406
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,886
Small Brother!

407
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,389
Believe in yourself.
I know you can do it.

408
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,142
Everyone calls me Lazy Pig now.

409
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,686
You're the only one
who still calls me Small Brother.

410
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,857
Thank you.

411
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,944
Lazy Pig, get me that roll
of toilet paper.

412
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,366
The red one.

413
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,432
- Soccer?
- Yes, Second Brother!

414
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,478
If you use Hooking Leg
as a fullback, I think…

415
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,730
- We'd be perfect!
- Right!

416
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,733
You think I can still do Hooking Leg?

417
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,987
You just need practice.

418
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,614
Believe in yourself,
and you'll get it back fast.

419
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,491
I doubt it.

420
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,327
Why are you washing dishes?

421
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,413
I thought you were a waiter.

422
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,708
Why? There are so many whys.

423
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,959
I don't know.

424
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,253
Why isn't my dad the rich?

425
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,549
Why am I going bald
even though I'm so handsome?

426
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,135
Why aren't you going bald
since you're so ugly?

427
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,681
Everyone else enjoyed their youth,
but I had to study Shaolin?

428
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,351
Just to become a dishwasher?
To clean up after people?

429
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,563
Calm down, Second Brother.

430
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,899
You should try to enjoy life.

431
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:05,528
Enjoy life? Stay here,
and I'll enjoy killing you!

432
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,698
Enjoy life?

433
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,453
You call that toilet clean?
It smells awful.

434
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,332
If it ever smells this bad again,
you'll clean it with your tongue.

435
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:01,084
Your apartment looks great!
It's well furnished.

436
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,586
I can't believe you work
as a janitor…

437
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,882
but live in the penthouse
on the 59th floor.

438
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,051
You've got good taste.

439
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:16,057
This kind of apartment is so popular,
I can't even get one.

440
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:21,562
The ventilation is okay.
It's just a bit noisy.

441
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,524
Can I move in with you?

442
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:42,417
Forget it.
Your brothers aren't coming.

443
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,003
We can find other players.

444
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,755
It's my fault.
I'm not persuasive enough.

445
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:54,220
Not true.
You persuaded me, didn't you?

446
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,868
We don't have much time…

447
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,037
and you guys have a lot to learn.

448
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,540
So listen up and work as a team.

449
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,876
All right! Let's go!

450
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:18,805
Sell all my shares.
Yes, all five of them!

451
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,890
Don't laugh.

452
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,934
Hold on, I have another call.

453
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,228
It's coming down!

454
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,320
You finally decided
to come back down, huh?

455
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,280
We waited over an hour for you.

456
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,577
- What are you doing?
- Playing soccer!

457
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,538
The ball is over there!

458
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,088
You! Come here!

459
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,258
Let me see you kick the ball.

460
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,261
- The ball is over there.
- Yes. It's over there.

461
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:01,556
How can you kick it
if you can't even find it?

462
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,894
Now, there are four basic soccer drills:
pass, dribble, hold and shoot.

463
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,896
- Coach!
- Shut up!

464
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,190
Let's get started.

465
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,901
Here.

466
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,864
Hold it.

467
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,033
Watch it. Concentrate.

468
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,540
Don't lose it.
You can do better than that.

469
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,084
Have you never seen a ball before?

470
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,087
You play like an old woman.

471
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,674
Fung, why can't I practice with them?

472
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,761
Your leg is strong,
but you have no control.

473
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,639
What if you kick the ball up
and hit a plane?

474
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,517
- Ever thought of that?
- No.

475
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,603
Small Brother.
I borrowed your eggs.

476
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,812
What?

477
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,733
If you can kick an egg without
breaking it, you can play with us.

478
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,401
No problem.

479
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,113
See. It's not easy.

480
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,583
Small Brother, stop it.

481
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,674
Oh, my God! My egg.

482
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,509
I'll get you another one.

483
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,888
I'll get you!
How could you do that!

484
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,474
Concentrate.

485
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,480
My egg!

486
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,914
Yes! Yes!

487
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,544
Go!

488
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,759
Yes. Go!

489
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:07,366
What are you doing?
How could you miss that one?

490
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,369
Get it! Come on!

491
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:56,457
- He's great.
- He could win a game by himself.

492
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,629
No. It takes teamwork to win.

493
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:15,518
The game is 30 minutes,
with no breaks.

494
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,145
We'll follow the standard rules.
I'll referee.

495
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,189
- Anyone object?
- Of course not.

496
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:24,693
We're honored
to have Golden Leg referee.

497
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,321
All of us are big fans.

498
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,740
- This is Fung!
- Fung!

499
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,492
Okay.

500
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:36,705
Sing has already had
one run-in with your gang.

501
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:41,544
Let's be civilized,
and just play a clean game.

502
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,338
Their tidy uniform
and friendly faces…

503
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,676
- indicate that they are sincere.
- Thank you.

504
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:55,182
Relax. I'm a mechanic.

505
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,060
I carry this with me
so I won't lose it.

506
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,646
- I'm always on call.
- Yes, of course.

507
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,944
As I said, I'm a mechanic…

508
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,321
and that's why I carry a hammer.

509
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,117
I'm familiar with
your team's unusual reputation.

510
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,535
Don't worry.

511
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,248
Oh, good. I'm glad
we understand each other.

512
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,043
You better watch out.
Shake hands.

513
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,947
I'm open!

514
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,317
Third Brother!

515
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:22,431
We're under attack.
Send reinforcements.

516
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,391
We need reinforcements!

517
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,738
Stand up.

518
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,201
Get up! Stand up now!

519
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:44,870
I said now!

520
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,750
- What are you doing?
- They're killing us.

521
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,877
What did you expect?

522
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,714
You're going to let them
get away with this?

523
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,841
You're ejected!

524
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,719
Are you nuts?

525
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,182
This is a test.

526
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,686
If you guys can't pass it,
you shouldn't even bother playing!

527
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,272
We just want to play soccer,
not fight a war.

528
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:15,442
Soccer is war.
You must learn that.

529
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,453
I surrender!

530
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,581
I surrender!

531
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,678
I surrender.

532
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,682
You can't surrender.
We're still at war.

533
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,684
We're not letting you go home.

534
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,647
I can't take it anymore.

535
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,776
We're not good enough
to play with you.

536
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,321
Let me go to a doctor.

537
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,496
Put this on your head.

538
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,791
Look at you,
you look like a stray dog.

539
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,379
Where's your dignity?
I don't ever want to see you again.

540
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,965
Put it on your head
then you can go see a doctor.

541
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:35,063
Yes, I'm a dog. I have no dignity.

542
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,524
Give it to me.

543
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,727
Now it's our turn.

544
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,355
What?

545
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,525
Their powers are back.
I can feel it.

546
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,368
- Get your shoes ready!
- All right!

547
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,494
The final attack!

548
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,945
I can't believe I missed.

549
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,406
Help!

550
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,576
Thank you for helping us
get our kung fu back.

551
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,414
I'm honored to have you back.

552
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,207
It's our honor.

553
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,837
Just a second.

554
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,381
I'm the one who is honored.

555
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,635
You're going to make me rich!
Thank you!

556
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:36,930
We're sorry.

557
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,516
Can we join your team?
Please give us a chance!

558
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,976
Please!

559
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,762
Not a bad kick.

560
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:01,932
A bit more work
and Team Evil will be unbeatable.

561
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,689
Who is this?

562
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,317
The cripple?

563
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,402
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry!

564
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:18,532
If it's an open tournament,
why won't you let me sign up?

565
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,493
Golden Leg!
What are you doing?

566
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,953
- Hung!
- He…

567
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:23,703
It's okay.

568
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:26,248
Hung, my team wants to sign up.

569
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,000
Anyone can sign up
for an open tournament.

570
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,585
That's not how it works.

571
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,295
I'm the chairman.

572
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,506
I decide who signs up.

573
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,591
- You get me?
- Yes.

574
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,468
What's the name of your team?

575
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,637
Come here.

576
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,389
This is Hung.

577
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,182
Hung!

578
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,866
This is quite a team.

579
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,784
I've gotta see them play.

580
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,619
What's the name again?

581
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,996
This is Shaolin…

582
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,914
Okay.

583
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,208
Go ahead and sign them up.

584
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,794
I'll even pay your application fee.

585
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,796
- Thank you!
- Don't mention it.

586
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,091
Cripple, you are my brother.

587
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,970
My shoe is dirty again.

588
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,098
White shoes get dirty a lot.

589
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,266
So…

590
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,393
I'll clean it for you!

591
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,770
I'm good at cleaning. Let me try.

592
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,231
It's my duty.

593
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,025
Let me try!

594
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,383
Hi.

595
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,807
What's going on?

596
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,190
Where are we going?

597
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,359
Why are you so quiet?

598
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,362
I need to go home.

599
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,664
- You're late.
- I won't be long.

600
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,030
Try it on.

601
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,574
No, I just want to see
the quality of it.

602
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,993
Touch it.

603
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,619
I'll get it dirty.

604
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,371
- Don't worry. Go ahead!
- No!

605
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,915
- Touch it!
- No.

606
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,629
- Like it?
- So smooth.

607
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:23,425
- Want one?
- 1 touched it. That's enough.

608
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,804
Tomorrow, I'm going to play
in a professional soccer game.

609
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,305
Really?

610
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,933
I'll be famous.

611
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,687
But if you hadn't fixed my shoes…

612
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,897
none of this would've happened.

613
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,942
You're very important to me.

614
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,529
I'll get you anything you want.

615
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,740
I'll have money soon.

616
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,913
If you become rich and famous,
please buy me sneakers.

617
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,042
You deserve more!

618
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,961
You should have more
confidence in yourself.

619
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,339
You're such a beautiful girl,
and you're a kung fu master.

620
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,091
You've got it all.

621
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,345
You shouldn't let your hair
cover your face.

622
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,805
Come on!

623
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,891
- Come on. Look at me!
- No.

624
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,934
Look at me!

625
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,938
You're beautiful!

626
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,441
Really?

627
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,276
Sure.

628
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,409
- Is that a fly?
- Yes, but I missed it.

629
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,454
- Did you get it?
- I did.

630
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,414
Sorry. I made your hand dirty.

631
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,916
It's okay.

632
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,126
You're such a beautiful girl.

633
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,172
Do you know that?

634
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,382
I guess.

635
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,802
Thank you! Thanks so much!
You sure you know?

636
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,680
Where were you?

637
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,892
I let you bring a girl here because
you promised to clean the floor.

638
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:58,478
I will get punished
if you don't clean it.

639
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,106
Go home. I'll call you later.

640
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:11,199
Remember: be confident.
You're the best.

641
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,581
- I like your shirt.
- I like your socks.

642
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,999
- Let's trade.
- Good.

643
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,795
Guys, don't be nervous.
Just try to have fun.

644
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,047
There'll be tons of reporters
and a big crowd.

645
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,675
Try to smile for the photographers.

646
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,928
Be sure to thank the fans.

647
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,888
Thank you!

648
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,854
Thanks for your support!
Thank you!

649
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:43,565
- They're just janitors.
- They're still our audience.

650
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,233
Thank you!

651
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,193
Shut up!

652
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:50,905
Where is everyone. You said…

653
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,449
It's just the first round.

654
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:55,201
We have to make it to the finals.

655
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:58,746
- Great! Let's get to the finals!
- Shut up!

656
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,715
Team Shaolin?

657
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,262
Look at this guy.

658
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,893
Look at that guy.

659
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,106
What's wrong?

660
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,900
No smoking?

661
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,749
What happened?

662
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,753
It's impossible. Just a trick.

663
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,138
What's going on?

664
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,476
Okay, it's a trick.

665
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,686
Let's show them what we can do.

666
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:04,812
All right!

667
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,651
Oh, come on!

668
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:21,329
Please play fair.
Give us a chance.

669
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,960
Hung, it's for you.

670
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:34,175
Your tricks don't scare me!

671
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:11,713
What? Forty to zip?

672
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,016
Yeah!

673
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:42,201
Iron Head scores!

674
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,364
We bring the power of Shaolin
to soccer.

675
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,283
Kung fu is great. It's wonderful!

676
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,163
I want to say hi to my parents and
my Shaolin master, but they're all dead.

677
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,040
I also want to say hi
to my friend, Mui.

678
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,958
Mui, how are you?

679
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,336
I'll see you soon.

680
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,140
Hi. Can I help you?

681
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,351
- I want…
- I understand.

682
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,478
I'll take care of you.

683
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:00,905
Show us something.

684
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,865
Sure. Small Brother!

685
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,619
Great!

686
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,038
Can you show us more?

687
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,498
Sure!

688
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,058
Take it easy.

689
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:38,568
My brothers, today we say good-bye
to our old lives and old shoes.

690
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,783
- Hey, don't throw those around.
- Sorry.

691
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:54,876
Mui?

692
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:56,878
What's up?

693
01:10:58,129 --> 01:11:00,089
You look great tonight.

694
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,509
Just a little.

695
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,387
It's a big difference.
You're so heavily made up.

696
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,056
So you think I look nice?

697
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,602
I have big news for you.
We won the soccer match.

698
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,105
I know. I saw you guys on TV.

699
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,231
Congratulations.

700
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,276
This is for you.

701
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,117
Thank you.

702
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,203
Let me introduce you to my friends.

703
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,538
Nice outfit.

704
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,416
Hey, let me introduce you guys
to a new friend.

705
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,001
Is she a ghost?

706
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,504
This is my friend.

707
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,506
- Girlfriend?
- No.

708
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,509
This is Mui, the Tai Chi Master
I told you guys about.

709
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,220
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Your girlfriend is quite unique.

710
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,764
- Yes.
- That's great.

711
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,100
I've never seen
shoulder pads so big.

712
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,937
I've decided to start a new trend.

713
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,980
See? It's fashionable.

714
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:02,235
Don't walk around at night.

715
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,986
It's quite scary.

716
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:08,199
It's okay.
People will get used to it soon.

717
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,327
It will work pretty well in football.

718
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,412
You want to borrow them?

719
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,582
Stop it. It's not proper to talk
to a lady like this.

720
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,168
It's okay, I can take it.

721
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,630
Although she's a girl,
she has a great sense of humor.

722
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,801
Mui, show us a sexy pose.

723
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,934
Give us a kiss.

724
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,944
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

725
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,449
Are you mad?

726
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:55,830
- No, I'm not mad.
- Then…

727
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,088
I'm sorry.

728
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:06,924
We were just joking.

729
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,385
I know you were just joking.

730
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,555
I'm sorry,
I didn't mind at all…

731
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,181
Don't be like this.

732
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,392
Then why are you like this?

733
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,737
Take your hand off me…

734
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:29,196
Boss!

735
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,073
What the hell are you doing?

736
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,867
I was just out playing mah-jongg.

737
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,746
Look at what you did to yourself?
You look like a ghost.

738
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,040
Have you no shame?
You are such a disgrace.

739
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,374
Hey, enough!

740
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,754
Mui has the right
to dress how she wants.

741
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,173
Can't you respect that?

742
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,925
- I think she looks very nice today.
- Yes.

743
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,219
- She looks great.
- Don't be mean to her.

744
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,600
I'll yell at her if I want to.
Who the hell are you guys?

745
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,894
They are my friends.

746
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:05,941
I agree with them completely.

747
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,905
I think I look beautiful now.

748
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,325
And I like the way I am.

749
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,245
If you don't like it…

750
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,748
you can simply go away.

751
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,752
Who do you think
you're talking to?

752
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,880
I'm talking to you.

753
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,050
You are a mean
and coldhearted boss.

754
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,760
You're asking for it!

755
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,264
How dare you hit me?

756
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:49,110
I can't believe this.
Who do you think you are?

757
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:55,199
I am who I am.
I am Mui.

758
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,285
I'm gonna tell
your mother about this.

759
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,418
Mui, well done!

760
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:08,421
We were just joking earlier.
Please forgive us.

761
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:12,508
We weren't laughing at you,
your sexy pose really was sexy.

762
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,638
Really?

763
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,857
Do you…

764
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,234
like the way I look?

765
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:31,444
Well…

766
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:34,947
You certainly have more confidence.

767
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,914
I want to tell you something.

768
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,708
What?

769
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,252
I like you.

770
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,296
I like you too.

771
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,676
Is this love?

772
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:01,056
You…

773
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:02,683
You're joking.

774
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:07,313
No. I'm serious.

775
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,357
Absolutely not. This is not love.

776
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,198
We're friends forever.

777
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:20,743
Don't you think we should be friends?

778
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,661
It's fine.

779
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:34,548
So you'll still come see me?

780
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:38,219
I can still fix your shoes.

781
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:42,056
No, thanks. I can buy new ones.

782
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,434
Things have changed.

783
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,187
I have to think about the future.

784
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,781
Don't be like this.

785
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,909
You're crying.

786
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,412
Don't be that way.

787
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,301
I understand.

788
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,054
Sorry.

789
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,894
- Congratulations!
- Sit with us.

790
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,479
Cheers!

791
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,531
If we win this, we'll go to the finals.

792
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,740
To the finals!

793
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,285
- But don't underestimate our opponent.
- Underestimate our opponent!

794
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:51,166
You don't have a chance.

795
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,294
We haven't lost all year.

796
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,263
How'd they do that?

797
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,098
It must be special effects.

798
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,180
- Good morning, Hung.
- Good morning.

799
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,765
Come here.

800
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,184
You're a lucky guy.

801
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,270
You're lucky to coach
such a great team.

802
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,312
Thank you.

803
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,899
Iron Head and Iron Shirt is practiced
as performance art on the street.

804
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,068
It's amusing to see your team
use kung fu to play soccer…

805
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,903
and make it to the finals.

806
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,947
You did a good job.

807
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,991
Don't waste our time.

808
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,245
If you forfeit the game
you can join my Evil Team.

809
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:56,125
It's not a bad check this time.

810
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,919
You can get the money
before you sign the deal.

811
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,380
That's a lot of money.

812
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,465
Enough to retire.

813
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,552
Of course. We're like brothers.

814
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:09,805
Thank you.
But I don't think I can accept it.

815
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,726
What? Do you think
I'm trying to trick you?

816
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:16,645
I think you've
put a great team together.

817
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,689
I'd like you to come work for me.

818
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,607
Don't get upset.

819
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:23,402
Think about your future.
Forget about our past, okay?

820
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,323
Hung, I'm not mad at you anymore.

821
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,119
I know it was all my faults.
I can't blame anyone else.

822
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,497
You're lying.

823
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,459
I know you too well.
You're too greedy to pass this up.

824
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,838
You're right.

825
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:46,508
I am greedy.
My team is greedy too.

826
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,136
But we don't care about the money.

827
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,180
We care about the championship.

828
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:53,807
See you on the soccer field.

829
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,511
Pull over.

830
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,519
- Mui!
- She's dead!

831
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,854
How?

832
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,899
- I killed her!
- Impossible!

833
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:47,653
Mui is a kung fu master.
You could never hurt her.

834
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,822
What do you want?

835
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,116
Revenge!

836
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,993
Come on. It was only a joke.

837
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:57,704
She's still alive.
She just doesn't work here anymore.

838
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,582
Why not?

839
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,460
Well, we're famous for our
sweet steamed buns…

840
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,547
and Mui made
the sweetest ones of all.

841
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,592
But now they're salty and bitter.
She was ruining my business.

842
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,010
There was salt in them?

843
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,762
Yes.

844
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:16,181
Now is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

845
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,020
No thanks.

846
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,836
Hey!

847
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,297
We've got a game to play!

848
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,107
Will Team Evil
score a lot of goals today?

849
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,776
Scoring goals is not
the only way to win.

850
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,071
But make no mistake, we will win.

851
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,439
No way!

852
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:04,571
Those American drugs
work better than I expected.

853
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,345
Actually, the referee, linesman…

854
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,265
soccer association, soccer federation
and soccer committee…

855
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:35,811
all stand on my side.
How can they possibly beat me?

856
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,013
No problem!

857
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,642
- You rule!
- Good job!

858
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,352
You the man!

859
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:20,540
Throw-in? Are you crazy?

860
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,585
How can you call that a throw-in?

861
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:26,212
Hung, are you here to fight
or play soccer?

862
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,382
I should break their legs
like I broke yours!

863
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,177
Then you'd have
a whole team of cripples!

864
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:35,889
Cripples! Cripples!
At least you'd have company.

865
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,019
I'm sorry. I should take a break.

866
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,813
It's okay.
Your body may leave the field…

867
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,441
but your spirit will stay behind.

868
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,919
Get ready! It's my turn.

869
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:26,231
Small Brother!

870
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,812
Wake up! The clock already ran out.

871
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:15,363
It's only halftime.
Their team is already badly injured.

872
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,449
They won't be able to play
the second half. Go home!

873
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,534
You won't be able
to finish the game.

874
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:21,077
Boring.

875
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,496
I'll dance to provide
some entertainment.

876
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,624
No, you're not going to dance.
I am!

877
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,173
I've had enough.

878
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,191
Break it up!

879
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,236
You want me to eject someone?

880
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,114
Who did that?

881
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,783
Did anyone see?

882
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,911
I'd like to see you do that
to my face!

883
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:05,079
Gently.

884
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:07,916
What kind of kung fu was that?

885
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:11,461
I can't take much more!

886
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,548
I knew they would play dirty.

887
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,592
I just didn't think
they would play this dirty.

888
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,469
They've never been this good.

889
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,763
They must be cheating.

890
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:23,431
Call the police.

891
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:26,100
We just have to play harder.

892
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,644
We can still win this!

893
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:29,729
I forgot. I left the oven on!

894
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,774
My wife needs me.
She's about to have a baby.

895
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,194
Can't she wait until the game's over?

896
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,154
But they're killing us!

897
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,073
Please. I'm begging you.

898
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:43,701
- I'm begging you too.
- Wait. Wait!

899
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:48,414
Calm down.

900
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,999
Calm down!

901
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,379
He's right!

902
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:58,174
We must pull together.

903
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,635
We only have eight players left.

904
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,681
If one more is injured,
we have to forfeit.

905
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:07,767
We'll have to show these guys
that we can block their killer kicks!

906
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:10,645
That's easy for you to say.
You try blocking one of them.

907
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,772
What are you talking about?

908
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:15,149
Calm down.

909
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:18,069
Calm down!

910
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,946
Shut up.

911
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,329
I wonder if I can block them.

912
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,347
Shaolin Barricade Shield!

913
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:50,852
Barricade?

914
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,316
They can't even block one kick!

915
01:34:58,318 --> 01:34:59,944
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

916
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:41,653
Chun, it's Tin.

917
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:48,034
I've kept this secret for 20 years.

918
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,995
I love you.

919
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,793
Are we playing too dirty?

920
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,838
- I don't think so.
- Really?

921
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:43,756
Play even dirtier!

922
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,291
Brothers! Go!

923
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:20,335
What?

924
01:37:24,047 --> 01:37:26,090
Look out!

925
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:53,659
Get it!

926
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:57,997
I don't believe it.

927
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,983
Get up! If you're injured,
you forfeit!

928
01:38:27,068 --> 01:38:29,570
You're right. I'm fine.

929
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,161
The game's almost over!
Use the special attack!

930
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:39,038
Special attack?

931
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:15,783
That's it. They're out of players.
We won!

932
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,460
Team Shaolin,
I only see seven players.

933
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:29,297
If you don't have a substitute
you'll forfeit the game.

934
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:31,424
Those are the rules.

935
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:38,931
Any substitutes?

936
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,643
Congratulations!

937
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,064
I'm here.

938
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,400
I'm their substitute.

939
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:51,527
I'm a goalie.

940
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,452
Why do you look like E.T.?

941
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:03,122
You said I should
get rid of the hair in my eyes.

942
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:04,415
What are you doing here?

943
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,292
I want to help.

944
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:08,169
How can you help?

945
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,588
Phone home.
You don't belong on Earth.

946
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,965
I really want to help.
Trust me.

947
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,510
- Let me try.
- No way!

948
01:40:15,635 --> 01:40:18,846
Look. You can't play in those.

949
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:22,642
Put these on.

950
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,814
The other side.

951
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:23,119
Go!

952
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:24,704
All right!

953
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,387
Watch out!

954
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:52,351
What happened?

955
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:54,395
What happened?

956
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,398
- Boss, watch out!
- Don't touch me!

957
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,069
Boss!

958
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:06,031
Boss!

959
01:45:31,617 --> 01:45:36,121
Shaolin Team wins the championship.

960
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,793
Evil Team's drug use leads to
permanent suspension.

961
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:43,254
Coach Hung sentenced
to five years in jail.

962
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:00,372
Wait.

963
01:47:00,497 --> 01:47:02,833
Stop the bus.

964
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:30,736
Phone home.
You don't belong on Earth.

965
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:34,031
I'm talking about thousands of dollars.

966
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,951
You're a bunch of losers…

967
01:47:37,076 --> 01:47:38,953
Don't laugh.

968
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:41,205
The grand prize is a lot of money.

969
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:46,835
I can't get it out.

970
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:49,964
I'm a postgraduate student.

971
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:52,007
Postgraduate student?

972
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:53,217
Let's start over.

973
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:56,595
I'm a postgraduate student.

974
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:00,265
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

975
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:01,976
Are you mad?

976
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:04,603
No, I'm not mad.

977
01:48:10,776 --> 01:48:12,945
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me.

978
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:14,947
Are you mad?

979
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:17,074
- I'm not mad.
- Then…

980
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,836
I am begging you.

981
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,630
Don't do this.

982
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,883
You have to help me.

983
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:37,010
Please, don't!

984
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:41,473
<i>It's great</i>

985
01:48:41,598 --> 01:48:43,767
I don't know the lyrics. Sorry.

986
01:48:46,311 --> 01:48:47,980
Don't you dare!

987
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:56,613
- They're just janitors.
- They're still our…

988
01:48:58,907 --> 01:49:01,869
I heard you have amazing legs.

989
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:04,955
Cut!

990
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,877
This is a crescent wrench.
It's for screwing…

991
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,879
- Are you sure?
- You're so sick.

992
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:14,673
My team is greedy too.

993
01:49:14,798 --> 01:49:17,384
But we don't care
about this plane ticket…

994
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,219
Plane ticket?
Are you going somewhere?

995
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,663
Chun, it's Tin.

996
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:51,376
I've kept this secret for 20 years.

997
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,087
I love you.

998
01:49:54,213 --> 01:49:56,673
<i>This is not Chun.
This is Kung.</i>

999
01:49:56,799 --> 01:49:58,842
Sorry, Kung.

1000
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,970
Please tell your wife
what I just told you.

1001
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:03,347
Thanks.
