[Nick] Wait, stop!

You're going too fast!

Slow down!

[Nick] I'm dying!

334

It's 'cause you're old.

335
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,119
Whoa!

336
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,319
-[Nick] Yeah.
-How did Harry hire this entire place?

337
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,359
Oh, he's, like, extremely rich.

338
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,799
He should have gone on My Super Sweet 16.

339
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,599
So he could cry when his parents got him
the wrong color Lamborghini.

340
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
[chuckles] Exactly.

Was Harry being serious?

Do you like Tara?

What? No! No, definitely not.

346

Uh…

347
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,240
So you don't have
a crush on anyone at the moment?

348
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,119
Well…

349
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,880
I didn't say that.

Oh.

351

What's she like then?

352
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,480
You're just going to assume
they're a "she"?

353

Are they…

354

Are they not a girl?

Um…

Would you go out with someone
who wasn't a girl?

I don't know.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,160
Maybe.

359
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,799
Would you kiss someone who wasn't a girl?

Yeah.
