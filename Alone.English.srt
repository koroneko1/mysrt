SEOUL, KOREA

2
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:58,958
Happy birthday!

3
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,500
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

4
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,166
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

5
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,541
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

6
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,500
-Happy birthday, dear Pim
-Happy birthday, dear Pim

7
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,416
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

8
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,583
That wasn't funny.
You scared the daylights out of me.

9
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,875
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

10
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,708
Wee, have some cake.

11
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you.

12
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,541
Wee.

13
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,916
He's not fat yet.

14
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,583
No, he's not, but he's diabetic.

15
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm sure a bite won't hurt.

16
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,958
Just a bite?

17
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,583
Lucky!

18
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,750
So cute!

19
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,250
-Lucky.
-Is that your name?

20
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,666
Wee calls you Lucky, doesn't he?

21
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:41,500
You like to solve problems on your own.

22
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,458
You have to learn to confide in others.

23
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,583
So let's turn over the last card,
shall we?

24
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,291
This card tells me

25
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,333
that something you lost
is about to return.

26
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,083
Did you lose something?

27
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
The cards say that you may get it back.

28
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,291
No, nothing.

29
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,875
In that case,

30
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,541
it might not be an object.

31
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,791
Have you ever broken a promise to someone?

32
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,500
Maybe that person will come to you

33
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,958
to argue about it.

34
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,666
Yeah.

35
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,416
Don't believe what Jiho says.

36
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,291
She predicted that I'd find my soulmate.

37
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,000
But I'm still single.

38
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,458
Don't be so picky then.

39
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,333
Well, if I were pretty like you,
I'd have a handsome boyfriend like Wee.

40
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,833
It'll sting a little.

41
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,458
Aren't you used to needles by now?

42
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,708
Just a little.

43
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,583
There, all done.

44
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,791
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

45
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,208
Hello?

46
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:33,958
Just a second.

47
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,166
Pim, telephone.

48
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,500
Pim!

49
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,166
Is there something urgent?

50
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,375
Pim isn't available right now.

51
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,833
What?

52
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,708
What is it?

53
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,208
Pim,

54
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,083
that was a hospital in Thailand.

55
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,291
Your mother had a stroke.

56
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,875
Should you fly back right away?

57
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,125
If I didn’t move here,

58
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,458
everything would've been fine.

59
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,875
Pim, are you feeling okay?

60
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,791
Here.

61
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,041
I don't want to go back home.

62
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,708
Ever since Ploy died,

63
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,208
it hasn't felt the same.

64
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,500
Do you think it was selfish of me
to drop everything and move here?

65
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,250
Of course not.

66
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,666
But if I didn't insist
on us being separated,

67
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,166
Ploy would still be alive.

68
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,916
Pim,

69
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,208
I already told you.

70
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,708
Her death wasn't your fault.

71
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,958
Nobody expected that to happen.

72
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,791
Your mother is paralyzed

73
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,166
and unable to speak.

74
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,625
The hemorraging

75
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,875
is putting pressure on her brain stem.

76
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,625
We'll have to wait
for her condition to improve

77
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,000
before we can perform surgery.

78
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,708
Mom.

79
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,208
-Mom.
-Excuse me, Pim.

80
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,250
I think we should
let your mother get some rest.

81
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,375
You can wait outside.

82
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,958
Go inside.

83
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,083
Pim.

84
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,208
That was Ploy's favorite song.

85
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,208
Ploy.

86
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,291
Excuse me, ma'am.

87
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,666
If you don't need anything,
I'd like to go home for the day.

88
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,750
Don't you stay here?

89
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,458
No, ma'am.

90
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,750
You're welcome to stay here if you'd like.

91
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,541
So you don't have to commute.

92
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,208
No thank you, ma'am.

93
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,083
It's best I go home.

94
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,625
Wee!

95
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,666
Wee!

96
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,083
-Wee!
-What is it?

97
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,375
What's wrong?

98
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,375
Wee.

99
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,625
What's wrong?

100
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,791
What's wrong?

101
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,083
Mom.

102
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,208
What's wrong, Mom?

103
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,083
What's the matter?

104
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,166
-What is it?
-Excuse me, ma'am.

105
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,208
I need to give her some shots.

106
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,958
Noi.

107
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,750
What happened that day?

108
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,250
Why did Mom pass out?

109
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,541
I don't know, ma'am.

110
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,208
Have you noticed anything strange

111
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,708
about her behavior?

112
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,041
Noi.

113
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,208
Well,

114
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,458
I don't know what was wrong with her.

115
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,500
She liked to stay in her room

116
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,708
and cry all day.

117
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,666
Sometimes

118
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,875
I had the feeling

119
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,500
that she was afraid of something.

120
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,958
Afraid of what?

121
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,375
Doctor, how is her condition?

122
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,541
It's rapidly deteriorating.

123
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,833
I think we should operate tonight.

124
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,708
Oh, shit.

125
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,708
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am?

126
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,250
Are you okay?

127
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,750
Pim,

128
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,291
are you tired?

129
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,250
Why don’t you go home and get some rest?

130
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,416
I'll stay and wait for the results.

131
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm fine, Wee.

132
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
She's no longer in critical condition.

133
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,541
But she's still in a coma.

134
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,958
When will she regain consciousness?

135
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,250
I can't say at this time.

136
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,000
It also depends on her spirit.

137
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,791
Lucky!

138
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,583
Lucky!

139
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,083
Lucky.

140
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,750
Lucky!

141
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,708
Lucky.

142
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,416
Lucky!

143
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:41,583
Lucky.

144
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,083
Lucky!

145
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,666
Lucky.

146
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,166
What is it?

147
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,208
Pim?

148
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,958
Pim! Open the door, Pim!

149
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,208
Pim!

150
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,708
Pim!

151
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,875
Pim, what happened?

152
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,333
What happened to you?

153
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,458
You're all set.

154
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,125
Pim,

155
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,541
what's going on?

156
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,166
Why did you hurt yourself?

157
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,083
Pim.

158
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,458
Why don’t you tell me what's wrong?

159
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,500
I saw my twin.

160
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,458
What do you mean?

161
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,500
I feel like she's still here with me.

162
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,708
I don't understand.

163
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,666
How could you see her?

164
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,791
Ploy's dead.

165
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:35,583
Forget it.

166
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,208
It must be the stress.

167
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,083
Pim.

168
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:47,208
I think you should see a specialist.

169
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,375
Wee.

170
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,916
There's nothing wrong with me.

171
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,125
-How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

172
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,458
I haven't seen you in ages.

173
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,208
You've changed a lot.

174
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,291
Really?

175
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,291
-Have some coffee.
-Thank you.

176
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,250
Pim.

177
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,625
This is Danai. We went to school together.

178
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

179
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,916
We were really tight
before I moved to Korea.

180
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,458
We haven't seen each other
in what? Ten years?

181
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,625
Yeah, about ten years.

182
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,666
It's been a long time.

183
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,250
How did you end up meeting again?

184
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,666
Wee called me up

185
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,916
and invited me over.

186
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,458
How is your workload these days?

187
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,375
It's a bit hectic. I still teach.

188
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,583
And I've got too many patients.

189
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,500
Which medical field do you practice?

190
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm a psychiatrist.

191
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,541
Excuse me.

192
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,250
Pim.

193
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,208
Pim.

194
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,833
Do you think that I'm crazy?

195
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:03,875
Pim.

196
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,083
Hear me out.

197
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,375
Pim.

198
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,958
Pim.

199
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,333
Open the door. Pim, listen to me.

200
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,583
Pim!

201
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:23,833
Lucky!

202
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,125
-Lucky.
-Pim!

203
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,041
From the brain scans,

204
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,583
everything appears normal.

205
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,666
I'm going to ask you

206
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,458
to look at some pictures,

207
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,125
and then I'd like you to tell me

208
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,708
what picture it is that you see.

209
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,291
Shall we start?

210
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,041
Batman.

211
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,708
My answer means that I'm crazy, right?

212
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,916
If I said "butterfly,"
then you'd consider me normal.

213
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,125
Pim,

214
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,333
seeing a psychiatrist

215
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,666
doesn't mean that you're crazy.

216
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,625
Anyone could experience
the same condition you have.

217
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,625
And with time, it can be treated.

218
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,666
Wee is really concerned about you.

219
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,750
He can't stand seeing you like this.

220
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:57,041
Can you tell me about Ploy?

221
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,375
We promised each other that
we would stay together forever.

222
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,916
Blow them out.

223
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,791
Hey, look at them!

224
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,083
Why did you decide to get separated?

225
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:50,000
That's enough for today.

226
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,916
I'm going to prescribe some medicine.

227
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,375
It's no use, Doctor.

228
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,750
You can't help me.

229
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,458
From what I can see,

230
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,208
she's suffering from a mild psychosis.

231
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,333
People with this condition

232
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,916
can't distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

233
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,916
Compounded by her feelings of guilt,

234
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,916
and you have a delusional state.

235
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,458
Can it be treated?

236
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,708
Of course. It's not hard to treat at all.

237
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:26,625
All you have to do
is take her back to Korea.

238
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,333
But it looks like
we'll have to stay here awhile.

239
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,583
We don't know
when her mother will recover.

240
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:38,958
In that case, why don't you
try a change of scenery?

241
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,458
It might help.

242
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,458
Have some. I've bought plenty.

243
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,250
It's all your favorites.

244
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,875
Try to eat a lot.

245
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,625
I'll help feed you.

246
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,416
There, isn't that tasty?

247
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,166
Everything looks tasty.

248
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,416
Pim, have a bite.

249
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:02,791
Pim!

250
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:04,833
Pim!

251
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,250
Pim.

252
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,166
Pim.

253
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,041
What's wrong, Pim?

254
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,500
Pim!

255
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:12,916
Pim.

256
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,333
Pim!

257
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,833
What should we do?

258
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,750
She followed me.

259
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,666
Pim didn't get better.

260
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,958
I'm going to have to take
her back quickly.

261
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,500
That's probably the best solution.

262
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,541
Hey.

263
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,416
Don't call me a fool.

264
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,541
But do you believe

265
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,458
what they say about twins?

266
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,541
That if one twin dies,

267
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,916
the other one will die soon after.

268
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,083
Pim told me that

269
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,875
Ploy is coming to take her life.

270
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,125
Wee, it's a matter of belief.

271
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,250
It's possible

272
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,125
that twins share a subconscious bond.

273
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,333
But personally speaking,

274
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,958
I attribute it to the attachment

275
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:45,208
that the living twin has for the dead one.

276
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,666
Wee.

277
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,916
Is something wrong?

278
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,958
No.

279
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,208
I thought you were at the hospital.

280
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,166
I went out to buy you some food.

281
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,833
Come down and eat.

282
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,416
Judging from the patient's condition,

283
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,750
I wouldn't recommend

284
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:09,958
moving her to Korea.

285
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,666
It would be risky.

286
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,208
I think we should monitor
her condition for a while longer.

287
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,916
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Yes.

288
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,041
You'll have to excuse me.

289
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,333
Yes, Doctor.

290
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,166
VEJ BAMRUNG HOSPITAL

291
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:31,958
Thank you.

292
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,958
Ma'am.

293
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,208
Ma'am, what's wrong?

294
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,083
Pim.

295
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,125
Wee. I saw her again.

296
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,041
I saw her again.

297
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,291
How can I get rid of her?

298
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,625
How can I get rid of her?

299
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:34,500
Pim.

300
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:39,958
What you are seeing
is a figment of your imagination.

301
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,166
Take Mickey Mouse for instance.

302
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,250
We can picture him,

303
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,791
but we can't really see him.

304
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,416
If our brain is confused,

305
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,458
what we imagine in our heads

306
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,791
can be transformed

307
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,666
into a perceived reality.

308
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,791
The reason you keep seeing your twin

309
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,416
is because you can't let go of her.

310
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:12,458
You told me that you see her
in mirrors, right?

311
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,583
Take a look.

312
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,666
Now,

313
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,541
tell me what you see.

314
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:47,291
Look at Wee.

315
00:47:39,916 --> 00:47:40,833
Pim.

316
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:50,125
Wrap it, so it won't get infected.

317
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:56,833
Pim.

318
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:01,750
Pim!

319
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,125
Ploy.

320
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,916
Please take this.

321
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,583
So that was why you decided to separate.

322
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:57,958
Pim,

323
00:49:58,041 --> 00:49:59,833
even Chang and Eng

324
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:02,000
wanted to separate at one time.

325
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,000
Two people conjoined for life,

326
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,416
it's normal to argue

327
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,333
every now and then.

328
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,166
But our fights got increasingly violent.

329
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,833
And Ploy didn't want us to be separated.

330
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:21,041
Did you ever feel like Ploy
was a burden to you?

331
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:25,583
No, I never felt that way.

332
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:26,875
Pim,

333
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,125
there's nothing wrong

334
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:33,000
with wanting to live your own life.

335
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,208
But I...

336
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,500
I caused her death.

337
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,916
Once you stop blaming yourself,

338
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,916
you'll stop seeing the image

339
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,083
of your twin.

340
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:40,541
Pim.

341
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,291
Are you okay?

342
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,000
Let's go.

343
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,333
Which finger is it?

344
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:21,875
-Forefinger.
-Yes! Rock-paper-scissors.

345
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,250
Rock-paper-scissors.

346
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,541
No, it's not true.

347
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:46,125
It's not true.

348
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,625
Did you buy it?

349
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:23,833
Yeah.

350
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:27,125
Lucky.

351
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,958
Lucky, come here, boy.

352
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,041
-Lucky.
-Pim, that's not Lucky.

353
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,708
I'll talk to them

354
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,208
and see if they can do anything.

355
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:53,041
Hold on a second.

356
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:55,791
Noi.

357
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:57,958
Take the dog away.

358
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,958
Yes.

359
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:08,166
I'll get back to you later.

360
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,416
Pim.

361
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,000
The hospital in Korea
has approved the transfer.

362
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,083
We can go home now.

363
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:29,291
Hey!

364
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:03,875
Pim.

365
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,583
Do you remember the picture
I drew for you?

366
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,958
Did Ploy destroy it?

367
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,250
Ploy...

368
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,416
Ploy! Don't!

369
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,125
Don't, please.

370
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,041
You two got separated

371
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:29,958
because of me, right?

372
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,000
I hate you!

373
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:36,125
I want to be separated.

374
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:40,833
How come you never told me?

375
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,000
What did you want me to say?

376
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,666
That I chose you over Ploy
and allowed her to die?

377
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,166
Ploy! Don't!

378
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,166
Mom!

379
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh, no.

380
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:29,250
Split them out.

381
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,791
Pim was fine.

382
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,666
Wee, do you know...

383
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,458
that Ploy loved you all along?

384
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,958
Pim,

385
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,500
I believe

386
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,166
that you actually saw her.

387
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,000
But without scientific proof,
I can't say if what you saw

388
01:01:58,083 --> 01:01:59,416
was real or not.

389
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,458
Our brain is a complex
and mysterious organ.

390
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,541
What you've been seeing

391
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:07,958
is merely an illusion.

392
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:10,125
-An illusion in your mind--
-Stop it, Doctor!

393
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,958
Just shut up! How many times
must I tell you she's here?

394
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,125
She's still here!

395
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:15,125
Pim.

396
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,583
-10 o'clock then.
- Okay.

397
01:02:19,666 --> 01:02:21,500
-Thank you.
-Hey, where's Pim?

398
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:24,000
Oh, I thought she was with you.

399
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:32,833
Pim.

400
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:36,875
Wee, help me, please!

401
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,625
Help me.

402
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:15,958
Pim!

403
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:18,958
Pim.

404
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:27,916
Pim.

405
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:29,833
Pim!

406
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,208
Pim!

407
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,166
What's wrong, Pim? It's just me.

408
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:39,166
Wee.

409
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,166
Pim,

410
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,916
it's okay. We're going back to Korea.

411
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,333
Let's go to the hospital.

412
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,625
Wee.

413
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,291
Pim, don't worry

414
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,333
I'll have your mother transferred tonight.

415
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,750
Wee!

416
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,458
Where's the doctor?

417
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:22,375
Is something wrong?

418
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:25,666
I need to transfer this patient tonight.

419
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,458
Please remain calm.

420
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,708
Please page the doctor for me.

421
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,583
I'll page him right now.

422
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,083
What is it, ma'am?

423
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,500
Take a look.

424
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,416
Now,

425
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,041
tell me what you see.

426
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,500
In the mirror,

427
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,166
I see Ploy.

428
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,250
PIM WATTANAKUL
21 JUNE 1975 - 12 SEPTEMBER 1990

429
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,583
Wee, did you know

430
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:51,375
that Ploy loved you all along?

431
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:29,583
Wee.

432
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,541
Mom is dead.

433
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,500
Wee, where have you been?

434
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:48,833
How come you're soaked?

435
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,333
How did she die?

436
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,458
Her condition has improved dramatically.

437
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,416
You can have the hospital in Korea

438
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,958
contact us about the transfer.

439
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:05,541
I don't know either.

440
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,791
I didn't think her condition
would worsen so quickly.

441
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:23,833
It's a good thing

442
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,416
she talked to me before she died.

443
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,583
What?

444
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,208
Afraid of what she might have told me?

445
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:38,708
This belongs to you, right?

446
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:43,541
Are you surprised?

447
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:45,500
Ploy.

448
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:48,416
What are you talking about?

449
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,250
Please stop lying to me.

450
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,083
I went to the temple.

451
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,583
What happened to Pim?

452
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:55,750
Tell me how she died, Ploy.

453
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:56,750
Let go!

454
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,666
Ploy is dead, Wee.

455
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,208
Ploy,

456
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:05,583
why did you do this?

457
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,375
No.

458
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:09,750
My name is Pim.

459
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,541
My name is Pim. My name is Pim!

460
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:17,750
What happened to Pim?

461
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,291
Or did you...

462
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,083
Did you do something to her?

463
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,458
We can't keep living like this.

464
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:32,708
Let's get separated.

465
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,708
No. I want us to be together

466
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:38,000
until we die.

467
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,041
Why are you doing this?

468
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:47,000
Do you know?

469
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,583
You're a burden in my life.

470
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,875
No, I'm not a burden!

471
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,333
I'm not.

472
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:58,958
I'm not.

473
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,291
Ploy, let me go.

474
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,125
Let go of me.

475
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,000
Pim.

476
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,458
Pim.

477
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:33,750
Pim!

478
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,541
Pim!

479
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,458
Mom!

480
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,375
Mom!

481
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:41,625
Pim!

482
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:43,958
Mom!

483
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,916
Mom, help!

484
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,208
Mom!

485
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:55,250
-Mom...
-Pim.

486
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,458
I didn't mean to.

487
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:05,625
How could you?

488
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,083
She was your sister.

489
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:12,958
You've lied to me all along.

490
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,708
Tell me why, Wee.

491
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,125
I'm exactly like Pim.

492
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,708
Why couldn't you love me?

493
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,416
You're pathetic.

494
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,250
Think about the time
we've been living together.

495
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,208
Doesn't it mean anything?

496
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,250
Aren't I the person you said you loved?

497
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,208
This isn't yours.

498
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,083
Wee!

499
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,458
I never thought

500
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:04,375
it would end this way.

501
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,750
Everyone loved Pim.

502
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,625
When she died,

503
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:28,000
Mom refused to speak to me.

504
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:35,250
She treated me

505
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,708
like I was a repugnant person.

506
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,791
I loved you just as much as Pim did.

507
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,458
But you only had eyes for her.

508
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,041
The letters you wrote to her,

509
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:17,625
I pretended were written to me.

510
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,958
The only way I could make you love me

511
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:28,875
was to transform myself into Pim.

512
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,458
All the letters you received

513
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,666
were written by me.

514
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,458
So how can you say that you love Pim?

515
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,916
The person you love is me!

516
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,000
I feel bad for Pim

517
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:00,166
because I'm the one

518
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,333
who received all of your love.

519
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,583
Are you in much pain?

520
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,625
Just hold on.

521
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:03,666
You hated it so much, didn't you?

522
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,041
Why couldn't it replace your old dog?

523
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:08,750
Why not?

524
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,166
When they're both exactly alike!

525
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,375
Excuse me, ma'am.

526
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:52,583
I forgot my cell phone.

527
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:58,000
Where is it?

528
01:17:58,541 --> 01:17:59,708
I'll get it for you.

529
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:02,500
I'm not sure.

530
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:03,666
It might be

531
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,208
in the kitchen.

532
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,250
Wee!

533
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:50,708
Where are you?

534
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,750
Come out right now.

535
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:01,250
Or else I'll burn the house down.

536
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,791
Come out!

537
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,208
Shit!

538
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,541
