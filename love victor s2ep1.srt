00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:02,920
ANNOUNCER:
Last season, on Love, Victor...

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,255
ARMANDO: This is it, Salazars.
Our beautiful new home.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,340
VICTOR:
Dear Simon,

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,510
you don't know me, but today
was my first day at Creekwood High.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,262
[bell rings]
I thought I'd finally get the chance
to be myself.

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,764
To figure out who I really am.

7
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,391
‐ Today, you paint the brush strokes
that define who you want to be.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,352
‐ Hey, new kid.
‐ Easy, Lake.

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,270
‐ Is there a girl back home, or...?

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,982
VICTOR: But my first day
didn't go exactly as planned.

11
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,652
‐ Nope. No girl back in Texas.

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,279
‐ Got it.
‐ You just made Mia Brooks blush.

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,989
VICTOR: I ended up
connecting with this girl Mia,

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,825
and she's great.
Sexuality's a spectrum. Right?

15
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,953
FELIX: You think you can put in
a good word with Lake?

16
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,995
I kind of have a thing for her.

17
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,082
You deserve a guy
who would sacrifice everything.

18
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,543
VICTOR: While my friend Felix
started a romance of his own...

19
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,920
LAKE: You're my sexy little secret.
‐ A forbidden romance.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,172
ANDREW: How come we never talked about
what happened between us?

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,174
‐ 'Cause there's nothing to talk about.
It was a mistake.

22
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,926
VICTOR:
Things with my family were messy.

23
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,969
PILAR:
This is why we moved?

24
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,638
Because you did whatever
the hell you did with Dad's boss?

25
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,057
VICTOR: Which made it harder
for me to deal with my own stuff.

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,308
‐ Everything okay?

27
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,687
‐ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Benji.

28
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,188
I like guys.

29
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,940
FELIX:
This doesn't change anything between us,

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,191
but telling Mia's gonna suck.

31
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,277
VICTOR: I just want to give Mia
an amazing night at the dance,

32
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,319
and then I'll tell her the truth tomorrow.

33
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,573
‐ The truth is, Felix Weston
makes me happy.

34
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,991
[crowd cheering, clapping]

35
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,993
BENJI: I want to be with someone
who makes me feel like

36
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,494
I can just be myself.

37
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,787
That's how you make me feel.

38
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,332
VICTOR: And then the most
amazing thing happened with Benji.

39
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,126
But it broke Mia's heart.

40
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,961
‐ All this time, was any of it real?

41
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,713
PILAR: She found out, didn't she?

42
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,465
‐ I've been going through something,
and I want to explain it to you.

43
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,134
I have something I need
to tell you guys.

44
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,093
ISABEL:
We're separating.

45
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,553
After what we've been through this year,

46
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,513
we just needed to take a breather.

47
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,806
‐ I'm gonna change.

48
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,100
‐ Wait. Victor,
what were you gonna tell us?

49
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,813
‐ Nothing.

50
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,616
No.

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,743
Not nothing.

52
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,705
Mom... Dad...

53
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,335
I'm gay.

54
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,523
‐ I love you.

55
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,113
‐ Um...

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,659
I'm sorry. I, I don't, um...

57
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,537
But what about Mia?

58
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,791
‐ Well, I, I, uh...
[clears throat]

59
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,294
thought that if I could make it work
with any girl, um...

60
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,462
it'd be Mia.

61
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,715
But I was wrong.

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,760
‐ And how do you...

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,179
I mean...

64
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,267
[exhales] When did you decide this?

65
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,979
‐ I didn't decide it. I just... am it.

66
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,528
Mom, could you please say something?

67
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,949
‐ I think, um,
that we should get some rest.

68
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,953
And we can talk about it tomorrow.

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,794
‐ Um...

70
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,296
[sighs]

71
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,767
‐ I'm sorry.

72
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,228
Are you okay?

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,357
‐ Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Uh...

74
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,945
I'm sure they just need some time.

75

VICTOR: Hey Simon,
happy last week of summer.

84
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,236
I'd thought I'd give you
an end of summer update.

85
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,030
Things are still pretty weird with my mom.

86
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,949
I mean, she knows I'm gay.

87
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,951
I even told her that Benji
is my boyfriend...

88
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,912
Hey. Uh...

89
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,039
Benji and I are hanging out with
Lake and Felix after work,

90
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,958
so I, I won't be home till late.

91
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,628
‐ Okay. Have fun with your friends.

92
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,297
VICTOR: But we never actually
talk about any of it.

93
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,054
Things are a little bit better
with my dad. But still awkward.

94
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,931
ARMANDO :
So, I know it's not huge, but, uh, hey,

95
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,141
the place, it gets great light.

96
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,688
Huh? I mean, unless it's trash day,

97
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,982
'cause then, well,
a dumpster blocks the window.

98
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,900
VICTOR: He's been all fake cheery
about the separation,

99
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,735
even though I know
he's totally bummed about it.

100
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,071
‐ Oh, you, uh... you headed to work?

101
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,824
Hey. Tell the Benji‐meister I said, "Sup!"

102
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,576
VICTOR:
He's channeling his discomfort

103
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,494
with me having a boyfriend
into nicknames.

104
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,705
‐ Benjamin Button. Right?

105
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,999
Ben‐venido!
[chuckling]

106
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,667
‐ Yeah. I'll, I'll tell him.

107
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,960
[chuckles]

108
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,049

We aren't Instagram official or anything.

113
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,191
No one from school even knows
we're a thing except our best friends.

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
It's kind of been great that way.

115
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,529
Like we're in our own
little summer bubble,

116
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,532
and we have this totally perfect secret.

117
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,368
And I gotta say, the bubble is hot.

118
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,414
‐ Whoops! Yeah, no, don't, don't mind me.

119
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm just, uh, looking for
the caramel syrup.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,879
Hey, do you guys call it car‐mel,
or care‐a‐mel?

121
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,548
[knocking]
LAKE: Hi. Hi. Sorry.

122
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,008
Uh, yeah, I know you guys are horny,

123
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,552
but anyone gonna make
my sugar‐free iced mocha?

124
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,970
‐ On it.
‐ Yeah, right away.

125
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,556
As for Mia,

126
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,142
we haven't actually
talked since the dance.

127
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,186
She took off the second school ended

128
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,897
to be a camp counselor
in North Carolina.

129
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,942
‐ Caroline! Hey, put your top back on!

130
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,027
This is not that kind of camp!

131
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,405
VICTOR: I just really hope
she doesn't hate me forever.

132
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,825
But the weird thing is,
despite everything,

133
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,828
this has kind of been
the best summer of my life.

134
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,624
‐ What?

135
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,834
‐ Nothing.

136
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:58,752
‐ Weirdo.

137
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,257
Hey, so school starts Monday.

138
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,677
We should probably talk about
what we're gonna tell everyone.

139
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,095
‐ Yeah. I know.

140
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,516
I want to tell people. I'm ready.

141
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,436
No more hiding who I am.
Or who I'm into.

142
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,277
FELIX: So, last weekend
before school starts.

143
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,653
What are we thinking?

144
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,864
There's a ten part docuseries

145
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,782
about human trafficking,

146
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,411
and Atlanta Weekly
said it was grueling...

147
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,954
but important.

148
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,665
‐ Or we could go to Lake Lanier.

149
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,667
Finally have that bonfire
we've been talking about all summer.

150
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,544
‐ Hmm. I pick Victor's thing.

151
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,962
‐ Yes.
VICTOR: Great.

152
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,964
‐ But, can we do it on Saturday?

153
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,048
Mia comes home on Sunday,

154
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,384
and I love you guys,
but Mia's my best friend

155
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,887
and if she's still mad at you, so am I.

156
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,597
Hos before homos.

157
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,391
‐ Understood. Oh, and also,
can we do after dinner?

158
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,643
Adrian's going to my dad's,
and Mom's making pollo guisado.
