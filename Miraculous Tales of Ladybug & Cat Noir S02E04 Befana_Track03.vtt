&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>

&lrm;-This fencing gear really suits you.
&lrm;-Thank you, Tikki!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.340
&lrm;Let's hope wielding a sabre is easier
&lrm;than finding a helmet that fits!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.500
&lrm;[laughs]

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.940
&lrm;I gotta ace these tryouts!

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.260
&lrm;D'Argencourt is the most prestigious
&lrm;fencing academy in Paris.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.340
&lrm;I only have this one shot
&lrm;to get onto the team!

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.420
&lrm;You've been reviewing the rules
&lrm;all weekend. It'll be great!

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.820
&lrm;You're right. I'm gonna make
&lrm;quite an impression on Adrien!

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.500
&lrm;Ah, here we go!
&lrm;This one should fit perfectly!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.380
&lrm;I am the fencing master, Mr. D'Argencourt.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.060
&lrm;As I'm sure you're aware, we have
&lrm;only one open spot on the team this year.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.300
&lrm;So, to select the best candidate,
&lrm;I will observe the beginners

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260
&lrm;performing attacks
&lrm;on the experienced students.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.860
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;-Get into position.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.660
&lrm;-Seems you're looking for someone?
&lrm;-I thought Adrien was here.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.500
&lrm;A boy this tall, blond,
&lrm;nice, super handsome.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.460
&lrm;Thanks for the compliments!

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.420
&lrm;I didn't know you were into fencing.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.100
&lrm;Adrien! Nice to fencing! I'm totally
&lrm;into you! Er... I mean, nice to see you!

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.140
&lrm;Yeah, I'm totally into fencing!

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.540
&lrm;[Adrien chuckles]
&lrm;[Marinette giggles]

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.900
&lrm;Get into position!

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.980
&lrm;Bend your knees then stretch
&lrm;your left foot back, turned outwards.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.540
&lrm;Perfect.
&lrm;Now put your sabre forward, like this.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.180
&lrm;[giggles]

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.700
&lrm;Greet each other!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.620
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ? Allez !</i>

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.260
&lrm;Go on, Marinette!
&lrm;You're supposed to touch me!

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.660
&lrm;Touch you? Yeah.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.460
&lrm;<i>Attaque. Touche. Point ! </i>&lrm;Continue!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.180
&lrm;-Thanks!
&lrm;-All I did was lunge.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.940
&lrm;You've got good reflexes! &lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.660
&lrm;<i>Prêt ? Allez !</i>

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.900
&lrm;Attack, &lrm;<i>paré</i>&lrm;, riposte, counter-attack.
&lrm;It's your point.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.300
&lrm;-I don't get it. You hit me first.
&lrm;-With sabre fencing,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.740
&lrm;the attacker doesn't necessarily win
&lrm;the point. You took the initiative,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.100
&lrm;so you had priority.
&lrm;I could only parry or riposte, so I lose.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.220
&lrm;But everything's happening so fast,
&lrm;how can you know who won?

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.700
&lrm;We don't always know for sure. That's why
&lrm;you can also abstain. Shall we continue?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.180
&lrm;Hey, you! Are you Mr. D'Argencourt,
&lrm;the fencing master?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.540
&lrm;-I want to join your team.
&lrm;-Only the best are admitted, you knave!

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.860
&lrm;-And I was, everywhere I went.
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>Par le fer !</i>

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.660
&lrm;This whippersnapper has nerve!
&lrm;All right! I may consider your admission,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.180
&lrm;shall you defeat one of my students!

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.740
&lrm;Which one of you is the best combatant?

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.820
&lrm;Adrien, please give our visitor
&lrm;a lesson in chivalry!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.540
&lrm;I shall, Master.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.820
&lrm;[boy] Cool.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.060
&lrm;Ha!

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.420
&lrm;Great! There goes any chance
&lrm;of making the team!

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.300
&lrm;-He's obviously better than everyone.
&lrm;-It's not over.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.100
&lrm;He still has to beat Adrien!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.180
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ?</i>

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.300
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.380
&lrm;<i>Simultané. Pas de touche.</i>

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.940
&lrm;I could have sworn
&lrm;Adrien touched him first.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.860
&lrm;Not sure. Anyway,
&lrm;you never question the decision.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.820
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ?</i>

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.980
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.900
&lrm;-Uh... &lrm;<i>Abstention.</i>
&lrm;-What's happening?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.340
&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt isn't sure who won
&lrm;so he'd chosen to abstain.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.700
&lrm;-This is a tight bout!
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>En garde...</i>

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.620
&lrm;Wait! I request that we do it
&lrm;the old-fashioned way.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.780
&lrm;We'll be more at ease without the machine.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.740
&lrm;-Adrien?
&lrm;-Fine with me!

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.860
&lrm;But how will we know
&lrm;who touched the other one first?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.740
&lrm;-By watching very closely.
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.740
&lrm;<i>Prêts ? Allez !</i>

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.660
&lrm;Is this what fencing's all about?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.540
&lrm;<i>Par le fer !</i>
&lrm;This is what fencing's all about!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.660
&lrm;Is that all you can do?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.340
&lrm;The fateful moment has arrived!

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.260
&lrm;[moan]

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.380
&lrm;Let me through! Move!

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
&lrm;[groan]

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.860
&lrm;Let's finish this off.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.980
&lrm;Who got the first hit? Who?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.700
&lrm;-Uh... I...
&lrm;-Who touched first? Tell us now!

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.660
&lrm;I don't know. I think... it was... Adrien?

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.700
&lrm;Ha, ha! Wonderful! This victory is
&lrm;an honour to D'Argencourt Academy!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.740
&lrm;[sigh]

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.580
&lrm;-Are you sure, Marinette?
&lrm;-Uh... Well, I'm not entirely sure.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.420
&lrm;I mean, it looked like it was you,
&lrm;but it went so fast.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.500
&lrm;-I think he touched me first.
&lrm;-The referee has the last word.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.420
&lrm;A champion whose victory has been stolen.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.180
&lrm;Crushing defeat is the ideal steel
&lrm;with which to forge a blade of revenge.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.460
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;towards this spite and petulance

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.020
&lrm;and evilise that fencer!

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.220
&lrm;I'm going to offer him a decisive match!

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.660
&lrm;Hey, wait! Your sabre!

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.420
&lrm;Let's do a... decisive... match?

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.060
&lrm;What's the point? You won.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.980
&lrm;There's no such thing as a second chance
&lrm;in my family. Goodbye.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.660
&lrm;Hey! What's your name?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.220
&lrm;You might get on the fencing team
&lrm;after all.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.700
&lrm;Follow that car!

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.540
&lrm;An akuma!

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.500
&lrm;Better capture it
&lrm;before it turns someone into a villain!

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.820
&lrm;-At your service, Marinette!
&lrm;-Quick! Adrien is in danger!

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.340
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.100
&lrm;Ha!

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.860
&lrm;<i>I'm not available. Leave a message.</i>

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.780
&lrm;Mother, you thought I was good enough,
&lrm;but... I lost.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.220
&lrm;I won't be joining
&lrm;the D'Argencourt Academy.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.860
&lrm;Riposte, I am Hawk Moth.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.180
&lrm;I'm giving you a second chance to prove

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.300
&lrm;that&lrm;<i> you</i>&lrm; are the best fencer of all!

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.620
&lrm;But in return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.220
&lrm;On my honour, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;I shall be victorious!

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.300
&lrm;She's the only daughter
&lrm;of a family of prestigious fencers.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.020
&lrm;Her mother and grandfather were champions.
&lrm;I've read about them before!

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.180
&lrm;She and her mother just moved to Paris!
&lrm;How incredible!

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.740
&lrm;I'm taking you up on your offer
&lrm;of a decisive match!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.140
&lrm;I can't fight you like this.
&lrm;You're not... yourself!

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.500
&lrm;-Fight!
&lrm;-Halte, Riposte!

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.140
&lrm;You may seek your revenge,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.300
&lrm;but only after you take hold of Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculous first.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.220
&lrm;Understood, Hawk Moth.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.540
&lrm;Where do you think you’re going?
&lrm;Stay there, nice and patiently.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.260
&lrm;How'd you like to start a duel with me?

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.420
&lrm;It's merged with her hand!

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.700
&lrm;Give me a moment, Adrien.
&lrm;I must finish her off first!

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.980
&lrm;But don't worry. I haven't
&lrm;forgotten about you! I won't be long!

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.780
&lrm;Don't let her close in on you!
&lrm;Fight back!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.860
&lrm;Thank you! But now, get out of here!
&lrm;She doesn't deserve you!

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.540
&lrm;Watch out, Ladybug!

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.780
&lrm;-Ouch!
&lrm;-Are you hurt?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.860
&lrm;-I'm fine.
&lrm;-I've gotta get you

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.300
&lrm;-as far away from that girl as possible!
&lrm;-Sounds like a plan!

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.180
&lrm;-What kind of fencing was that?
&lrm;-Nothing like I've seen.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.140
&lrm;It'll be hard for me
&lrm;to protect you and fight.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.140
&lrm;-Where are you Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Maybe he's... busy?

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.740
&lrm;Allow me to explain the rules to you.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.460
&lrm;You're not allowed to call it quits
&lrm;at any time. Adrien is mine!

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.500
&lrm;I will defeat you, both of you.
&lrm;I am the best fencer!

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.980
&lrm;Nobody's denying that. My friend Marinette
&lrm;made a bad call earlier.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.700
&lrm;He's right.
&lrm;Referee errors can happen in fencing!

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.660
&lrm;You don't have to get
&lrm;so bent out of shape about it!

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.060
&lrm;I'm sure she wasn't trying
&lrm;to humiliate you.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.820
&lrm;Of course not! Uh...
&lrm;I mean... I'm sure that was the case.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.940
&lrm;It's too late! The damage has been done.
&lrm;This time, I shall be the referee!

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.420
&lrm;Stay back, Adrien!

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.980
&lrm;[groans]

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.220
&lrm;-You're sure taking some risks today!
&lrm;-Don't have a choice.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.860
&lrm;Ladybug needs me. Plagg...

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.100
&lrm;Adrien! You OK?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.660
&lrm;Uh... yeah. You too?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.220
&lrm;I'll feel better once I know you're safe,
&lrm;far from that girl. Come on!

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.140
&lrm;Akuma alert! You must leave now!
&lrm;Evacuate the premises calmly!

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.340
&lrm;This way, ladies and gentlemen!

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.700
&lrm;<i>Akuma alert. Ladybug and Cat Noir are</i>
&lrm;<i>expected to handle this emergency swiftly.</i>

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:19.100
&lrm;<i>All visitors, kindly vacate the premises</i>
&lrm;<i>very calmly. Thank you.</i>

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.380
&lrm;A safe place... A safe place... There!

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.980
&lrm;I'm sorry,
&lrm;but at least you'll be safe in here.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.140
&lrm;-Please be careful, Ladybug!
&lrm;-Uh... I'll be fine, thank you.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.780
&lrm;And you stay out of harm's way, OK?

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.180
&lrm;-Where did you hide Adrien?
&lrm;-You actually think I'd tell you?

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.180
&lrm;This is just between you and me, Riposte!

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.500
&lrm;You can't cut it? Fine.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.460
&lrm;I'm going to defeat you and take your
&lrm;Miraculous, then I'll go and find him!

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.780
&lrm;I won't let you lay a hand on him! Ha!

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.900
&lrm;-It's time we went and joined Ladybug!
&lrm;-Didn't you hear? She said to wait here.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.100
&lrm;-You can't disobey her!
&lrm;-I've got to help her! Plagg, claws out!

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.460
&lrm;[groans]

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.380
&lrm;-Cat Noir!
&lrm;-A fencing tournament at the Louvre?

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.660
&lrm;-How come I wasn't invited?
&lrm;-Let me guess.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.020
&lrm;-You were at the groomer's again?
&lrm;-I was preening myself, milady.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.300
&lrm;You know how long
&lrm;it takes cats to get ready.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.180
&lrm;Ah!

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.100
&lrm;-Check mate, Riposte!
&lrm;-You've got the wrong sport, Ladybug!

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.700
&lrm;I think you mean... &lrm;<i>Attaque et point !</i>

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.060
&lrm;Argh!

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.540
&lrm;You OK, Cat Noir?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.420
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.140
&lrm;[alarm]

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.380
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Ready to lose, Ladybug?

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.140
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.180
&lrm;Of course!

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.100
&lrm;The hour of revenge has struck!

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.540
&lrm;No!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.020
&lrm;-He's gone!
&lrm;-Uh... Who?

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.740
&lrm;Riposte is trying
&lrm;to get revenge on Adrien Agreste.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.020
&lrm;-I hid him inside this sarcophagus!
&lrm;-Maybe he was feeling claws-trophobic?

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.060
&lrm;Let's look for him together, Ladybug,
&lrm;and finish this match!

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.020
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.700
&lrm;-A radiator!
&lrm;-Great!

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.340
&lrm;-That should really heat things up!
&lrm;-Hmm.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.780
&lrm;-The akuma has to be in her sword!
&lrm;-Then why don't we get to the point?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.860
&lrm;-Ha!
&lrm;-Ah!

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.580
&lrm;She's too quick!

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.980
&lrm;-I need your belt, Cat Noir!
&lrm;-Get ready!

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.980
&lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.020
&lrm;<i>Prêt ?</i>

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.940
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.620
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.980
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.700
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.500
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.060
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.940
&lrm;-What happened?
&lrm;-Pound it!

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.620
&lrm;Gotta go. Have a vet's appointment!
&lrm;Take care of the young lady, will ya?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.300
&lrm;Everything's OK!

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.460
&lrm;Claws in.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.500
&lrm;Oh! All this sport has made me hungry!

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.100
&lrm;Later! Shh!

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.740
&lrm;-You go ahead. I have to find someone.
&lrm;-Thanks.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.940
&lrm;-Where could he have gone?
&lrm;-Ladybug!

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.900
&lrm;-There you are!
&lrm;-Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.580
&lrm;I thought it'd be better to go
&lrm;before Riposte came.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.980
&lrm;Besides, I hate to be locked up.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.300
&lrm;I'm so sorry! You did the right thing.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.420
&lrm;So, uh, so Cat Noir
&lrm;finally turned up, huh?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.820
&lrm;Yes, thankfully! Between you and me,
&lrm;he's much better than me at fencing!

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.860
&lrm;-And... Riposte?
&lrm;-The girl is safe.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.660
&lrm;Oh, no! I'm about to change back!

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.980
&lrm;You should be the one to return that.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.740
&lrm;Bug out!

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.820
&lrm;<i>The Akuma Alert has been called off.</i>

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.860
&lrm;<i>The Louvre will soon be reopening.</i>
&lrm;<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.780
&lrm;I'm at the Louvre. Come when you can.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.300
&lrm;Excuse me.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.300
&lrm;Listen, I...

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.140
&lrm;-I'm sorry.
&lrm;-I'm sorry.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.540
&lrm;Perhaps you'll agree
&lrm;to take this back now?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.780
&lrm;No. I lost. You keep it.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.380
&lrm;-I think the point was yours.
&lrm;-That's not what your friend saw.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.220
&lrm;Marinette can get flustered easily.
&lrm;She's kind and means well.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.220
&lrm;She'd never cheat. Today was
&lrm;her first ever experience with fencing.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.740
&lrm;-You like her a lot, huh?
&lrm;-Marinette? Yeah, of course.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.220
&lrm;She's a very good friend.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.580
&lrm;And you'll really like her too,
&lrm;once you get to know her.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.660
&lrm;Very good friend, huh?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.820
&lrm;That sounds like a good start to me!

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.660
&lrm;Please, take it!

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.940
&lrm;I'll be happy to get to know
&lrm;your friend Marinette.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.300
&lrm;My name's Adrien. What's yours?

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.340
&lrm;Kagami.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.820
&lrm;Get ready for that decisive match!

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.060
&lrm;I can't wait, Kagami!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.300
&lrm;At least now you know how much
&lrm;Adrien values your friendship.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.500
&lrm;I know. Great. So he likes me.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.620
&lrm;But I don't want him to just like me.
&lrm;I mean, I do. But, you know,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.140
&lrm;I want him to&lrm;<i> like</i>&lrm; me!

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.020
&lrm;In that case, you might have to
&lrm;work on your fencing!

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.460
&lrm;[laughs] On your guard, Tikki!

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.860
&lrm;[laughter]
