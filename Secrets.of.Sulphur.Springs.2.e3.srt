of Sulphur Springs"...

I'm your great‐granddaughter
and you traveled through time.

You need to be me,

I step in, pretend I'm her,

Grace wants us back here.

in time travel, Harry?

This is the perfect
opportunity

My family's radio

Yeah, I mean,
at least it was.

looks like you're stuck here
being Harper.

42

Griffin, no! I can't!
Papa and Sam depend on me.

Do you think
someone took it?

until you guys switch back.

54
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,804
Yes, but even
if she can be me,

00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:15,939
I can't be her.

56
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,640
Of course, you can.
You pulled it off earlier.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,576
Yes. With your help.

58
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,977
And what was that
you just said about‐‐

Here.

60

‐What's this?
‐It's Harper's clothes.

61
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,784
Once you put 'em on,
you'll look exactly like her.

62
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,720
And as far as being alone,
you won't be.

63
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,022
Now that you have this...

64
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,893
I'll be right there with you.

Oh! Right! About that...

00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,276
Yeah, but it's more than that.

71
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,578
It's how she communicates
with us.

72
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,947
Who? The ghost?

73
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,650
It's not just any ghost.
It's...

Well, it's y‐‐ your mother.

No. No, it's crazy.

I think
she wants to help us.

00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,770
Maybe if you ask her
something...

80
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:29,078
Mother, if that's really you,

81
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:32,582
please... I have to get back
to Papa and Sam.

If she knows
the crystal's missing,

she has to know
I'm stuck here, right?

Yeah, but...

I mean, she knows

we were doing?

00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:45,468
You know what?
I forgot, actually.

163
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:47,136
It's kind of weird, huh?

164
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,405
Very weird.

165
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,442
Yeah, I know. Uh, sorry.

166
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:55,244
Well, good luck on you guys',
uh, board thingy.

167
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,481
He forgot?

168
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:02,018
Probably hormones.
Teenagers are totally bizarre.

169
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:08,157
Harper:
I can't be stuck here.
I've got to get home.

170
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,394
It's okay,
they're just running late,
that's all.

171
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:13,129
I just wish there was a way‐‐

172
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,697
(floorboard creaks)

173
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,323
(clattering)

174
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,458
Jess:
Harper, is that you?

175
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,661
Yes, it is I‐‐ Me.

176
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:48,097
Harper.

177
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,299
Glad I caught you.

178
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:53,436
Where's Griffin?

179
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,874
He had to go home,
I suppose.

180
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,842
Uh, it's probably
for the best.

181
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,277
Taco night's gonna
have to wait.

182
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,112
The walk‐in at the cafe
broke again.

183
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,348
So I'm meeting
the technician now,

184
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,316
and that means
you're gonna have
to make dinner.

185
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,120
Dinner? Are you sure
that's necessary?

186
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,724
Well, it's not like
I'm asking you to cook
a four‐course meal.

187
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:16,592
There's lasagna in the freezer.

188
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,828
Just zap it in the microwave
for 10 minutes.

189
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:22,465
Microwave for 10 minutes.
Got it!

190
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,733
Thanks.

191
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:26,102
Oh, and could you please
go up and tell Topher

192
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:28,070
to stop goofing around
on his laptop

193
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,906
and finish his
language arts homework, now?

194
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,376
Stop goofing around
on his lapftop.

195
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,077
Lapftop?

196
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:40,016
I'm sorry, I meant...
I mean, um...

197
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,985
Harper, are you feeling okay?

198
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,556
Yes. I think I'm just...

199
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:50,159
‐I'm...
‐Having a rough day?

200
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:55,798
Aw, baby.
We all have those.

201
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,471
Thank you.

202
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,776
That's what moms are for, right?

203
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,377
I'll be no more than an hour.

204
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:25,328
Stop goofing around

Hey! What are you doing?

208
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,378
I'm supposed to be the one
who enters without knocking.

209
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:44,614
I'm sorry.
No one told me that.

210
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,217
‐What?
‐Never mind.

211
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:51,854
Um, Mother told me
to tell you

212
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,890
to stop goofing around
on your laptop.

213
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,194
Seriously?
Man, how does she do it?

214
00:11:59,061 --> 00:11:59,962
What?

215
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:01,998
How does Mom always know
what I'm doing,

216
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:03,532
even when she's not here?

217
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,301
Gives me the creeps.

218
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,639
Well, some women in our family
do have the sight.

219
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,140
The sight?

220
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,976
They're seers.
They see things
before they happen.

221
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,212
What kind of things?

222
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:20,049
Bad things, usually.
Really bad.

I've barely had any time
to look.

00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,974
Mrs. Dunn asked me to cook
some strange food for supper,

247
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,010
and now I can't even remember
what it was.

248
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,312
So? I mean,
you live on a farm,

249
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,713
you must know
how to cook something.

250
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:07,049
Of course, I cook
for Papa and Sam every day,

251
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,753
but... I don't know
how to use anything in here.

252
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:13,022
Well, sure you do.
How about the oven?

253
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,090
Yes, I see it.

254
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,593
Great. Uh,
now open the fridge.

255
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:20,563
And that's the, uh,
big silver box over there.

256
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:22,531
And cook the first thing
you find.

00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,202
Daisy:
Oh, my! Okay.

258
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,370
I think I can do that.
Then what?

259
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,972
The only thing that matters:

260
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,740
find the crystal.

261
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,016
You gonna keep staring
into that thing?

262

I'm working on it, okay?

Maybe we can call Papa

Call Papa?

How're you gonna do that?
Holler out the window?

270

Sorry, I meant, um,
where can I find milk?

271
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,408
Where do you think?

272
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:12,281
Okay, Sadie,
this is totally new for me.

273
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,618
So if I do anything wrong,
just... bleat.

274
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:17,887
And I'm sorry
if my hands are cold.

00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,066
Okay. A double.

278
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,701
A little late in the day,
isn't it?

279
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,905
Yeah. I just haven't been
sleeping that well lately.

280
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:38,574
Please tell me
it's not more creepy humming.

Well, what's going on?

The lady we saw
through the window.

291
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,397
We told you about her!

292
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:02,464
But you didn't believe us!

293
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:04,633
Okay, this is going
to end now.

294

You can't just
go around yelling‐‐

295
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,603
Her name is Mrs. Barker.

296

She's here
at least once a week.

297

300
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:16,245
Sorry.

301
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,546
Yeah, sorry.

302
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,049
It's okay. I get it.

303
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:21,984
I've got my own little
paranormal hunter at home.

304
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,128
Delicious!
What is this called again?

305
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:34,730
Creamed chicken and toast.

306
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,066
Huh! When did you learn
how to cook?

307
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:42,037
Last week, I watched you
burn frozen egg rolls.

308
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:42,871
Twice!

309

It's not that hard.

310
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,076
I just used some things
I found in the kitchen.

311
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,812
Come on,
how'd you really do it?

312
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,815
Must have some new recipe app
on your phone, right?

313
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,183
My phone?

314
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:56,952
This has recipes?

315
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,520
Only like a billion of 'em.

316
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,358
Man!
And just when I thought

317
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,460
we were having
frozen lasagna again.

318
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,462
Huh. Lasagna.

319
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:12,668
Saw Hoyt Sanders
at the post office
this morning.

320
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,704
Told me Molly's about
to start the fourth grade.

321
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:19,108
Fourth grade, huh?
I always did like Molly.

322
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,110
That's good to hear,

323
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,845
'cause you might be
seeing her again soon.

324
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,179
How's that?

325
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,948
I believe it might be
time for you

326
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,483
to start back at school
in the fall.

327
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,119
‐Both of you.
‐School?

328
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,287
But who's gonna help
with the chores?

329
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,023
This place is a lot of work.

330
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:35,958
And Mother always said

331
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,660
you're not
a young man anymore.

332
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:41,030
(chuckles)
Your mother had a point.

333
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,966
But your education
was important to her.

334
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,136
Come on, now.

335
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,238
I haven't made
the decision yet.

336
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:51,040
Just thinking about it,
that's all.

337
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:57,813
Oh, no!

338
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,558
I'm so sorry.
I have no idea
how this happened.

339
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,261
It's all right, Daisy.
Just a little burned soup.

340
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,430
But I turned off
that burner.

341
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,397
I know I did.

342
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,701
Well, memory can be
a tricky thing sometimes.

343
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:21,904
Now the two of you
get started on these dishes.

344
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:24,673
That old pot needs
to soak for a while.

345
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:32,815
(distortion)

346
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,249
(light flashes)

347
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,629
(evil laughter)

348
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,901
man on video:
...state of matter.

349
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,110
(man cackling)

350
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:03,545
(buzzing)

351
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,714
(laughter on TV continues)

352
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,693
(shimmering)

353
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:25,067
♪ ♪

354
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,307
Why would Moss Man be
in the secret room?

355
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:47,389
Sam?

356
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,193
(line ringing)

357
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,463
Griffin, I tried to search
Topher's room, but I‐‐

358
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,697
No, it's okay. Listen.

359
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:57,132
My friend Savannah
just sent me a picture

360
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,634
and I need you
to take a look at it.

361
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,569
What is it a picture of?

362
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,971
It's the maintenance man
at the hotel in 1962.

363
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,073
I think his name's Sam.

364
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,077
‐Sam? Like my brother?
‐Griffin: Exactly!

365
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:10,846
And it may just be
a coincidence,

366
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,748
but...

367
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,250
It could be him.

368
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,153
But why is he working
as a maintenance man in 1962?

369
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,421
Griffin:
No idea.

370
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,223
But he's an inventor, right?

371
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,659
I mean, I saw him
on that crazy bike thing.

372
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,160
And he's into time travel,

373
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,962
H. G. Wells,
that kind of stuff.

374
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:28,964
Yes, that's my brother.
Why?

375
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:33,368
Well, what if somehow
he's the key to all of this?

376
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:39,274
(knocking)

377
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:41,443
Sam. Everything okay?

378
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,981
Yeah. Guess I'm just thinking
about what Papa said.

379
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,483
You know,
about selling this place?

380
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:51,286
He just said
he was thinking about it.

381
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:52,387
Are you worried?

382
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:54,056
Yeah.

383
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,725
But not for me.

384
00:21:58,293 --> 00:21:59,328
For you.

385
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:01,063
What do you mean?

386
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,432
Our plan, remember?

387
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:08,971
I'm gonna travel the galaxy
like those fellas in my books

388
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:12,007
while you stay here
and tend the farm.

389
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,776
That's still your dream,
right?

390
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:17,579
Yeah! Yeah, of course!
I'm just‐‐

391
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,715
Um...

392
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,252
Sam,
something happened today.

393
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,621
I had this vision.

394
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,124
Vision?

395
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:31,493
I'm in a room,
but I can't tell where I am

396
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:32,928
because there's
so much smoke.

397
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:36,999
Smoke?
Like the burned soup earlier?

398
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,800
Maybe.

399
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:42,337
Oh, my gosh!

400
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:44,640
Daisy, you know
what this means.

401
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,541
‐What?
‐You've got the sight!

402
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,912
‐The sight?
‐You're a seer.

403
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,180
Just like Mother.

404
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:57,252
Of course, she always said
it skipped a generation.

405
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,987
So it wouldn't pass on to you,

406
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:02,758
only your daughter
if you ever had one.

407
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,061
Guess she was wrong.

408
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,464
So what do you think
it meant?

409
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,632
The vision, I mean.

410
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:13,468
Beats me.

411
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,938
But like Mother always said
when she had one...

412
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,641
it's never anything good.

413
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,679
And is usually a lot worse
than a burned pot.

414
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:45,534
Hang on, Harper. I'm coming.

415
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:50,305
Oh, come on!

416
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:52,607
Please work, please work.

417
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,176
Who said
you could touch that?

418
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:56,578
Sam.

419
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,789
Stupid rock!
Just like that movie.

420
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,361
Nooo!

421
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,298
Oh! (panting)

422
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:26,375
(screams)

423
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,346
Wyatt:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

424
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,482
There might be a way
we could get the portal
working again.

425
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:34,549
A way that involves
your brother.

426
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,151
We just need to find out
how he did it.

427
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,053
Savannah:
I know what this
radio really is.

428
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,221
You're building a time machine.

429
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:41,156
You have to go to school
to maintain cover as Harper.

430
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:42,891
Couldn't have changed
that much in 90 years.

431
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:44,493
It has to be here somewhere.

432
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:46,461
You've been acting
so strange lately.

433
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:48,397
Sometimes, I don't know
who to trust.

434
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,499
If we want more information
on ectoplasm,

435
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,000
we need to find experts.

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,001
Hello.

437
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:55,404
To be continued.
