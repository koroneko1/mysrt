Doesn't your head hurt?

00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:40,322
It does.

00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,462
So that's what my aunt looks like.

13
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,843
- You... - No, don't!

14
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:36,443

Tell me who you are.

I'm his classmate.

18

I see. A friend?

19
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:48,522
That's right.

20
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,093
We're not...

21
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,723

- So tell me who you are. - It's true that he's my friend.

00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,132
He is.

25
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,732
I'm the closest friend he has.

26
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,813
See? Wasn't it the right choice to change schools?

27

I, Go Yoo Han, Yeon Woo's closest friend,

33
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,493
will get going.

34
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,933
All right, get going. Your parents will be worried.

35
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,262
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

36
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:33,563
Aren't you going to walk me out?

37
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,403
I see you're not that close.

38
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,302
You must be the only one who thinks so.

39
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:41,973
Right. Well, then I'll see him out.

40
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:44,882
Okay, but don't take too long. I'm hungry.

41

- It's nothing. I'll be right back. - Sure.

44
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,253
That was odd.

45
00:02:58,392 --> 00:02:59,993
You seem overly excited.

46
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,093
Are you happy that your aunt's back?

47
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:06,003
- Your mask. - What? Oh, no, I forgot.

48
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,003
It's been off for a while now.

49
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,672
- Are you okay though? - Yes.

50
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,542
- I was worried for a second there. - Hey, my hair.

51
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:21,813
I can still see the colors.

52
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,753
- Decoloring hasn't happened. - Really?

53
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:26,982
You must've grown accustomed to it then.

54
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:30,193
Your feelings for me led to you getting used to it.

55

That's not the case. It isn't.

And...

58
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:45,802
- that's in yellow. - Yes, yellow.

59
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:52,783
And that...

60
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,952
- That's neon. - Neon?

61
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:58,023
Yes, fluorescent versions of primary colors.

62
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,392
That's the fluorescent version of the color blue...

63
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,593
which makes it neon blue.

Yeon Woo,

65
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,062
what's the color of that cafe sign?

66
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,593
Well... Yellow?

(Ultramarine Special Collection)

68
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:27,213
Back in the day, ultramarine blue was expensive to buy.

69
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,922
European countries had to import lazurite to make it.

70
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:34,653
Being made by lazurite that was imported overseas...

71
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,953
gave it the name ultramarine.

72
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,122
Before artificial dye-making became common,

73
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:42,992
the color was loved for its bright blue pigment.

74
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,732
In today's currency,

75
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,963
it would cost 15,000 dollars per kilogram.

76
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,102
What?

77
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:54,643
Due to its high price, nobles watched over the painters...

78
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,513
to check if they are using it correctly.

79
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,213
It sure is expensive.

80
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,143
In this painting,

81
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:03,682
the color was only used to paint in the Virgin Mary's clothes.

82
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,252
See that over there?

83
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:10,223
The sky isn't clear or blue...

84
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:12,593
because they couldn't waste the paint.

85
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:16,432
However, lapis lazuli is no longer expensive.

86
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,703
- Lapis lazuli? - That's lazurite in Latin.

87
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,502
Quite a large amount was needed to mix the ultramarine color,

88
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,703
but it was only expensive because it needed to be...

89
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,073
extracted and shipped from Afghanistan.

90
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,843
These days, it's hardly considered a gem.

91
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,612
