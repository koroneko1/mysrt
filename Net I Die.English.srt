00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,916
Hi, it's Munkaew here.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,750
Welcome to the "Moral Breasts".

3
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,750
You want to know
what this live broadcast is about, right?

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,000
The flashlight I'm reviewing
is the first version ever.

5
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,541
It's not an ordinary flashlight.

6
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,000
It fits in your hand.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,833
And you can...

8
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,125
I'll show you. You don't need to carry it.

9
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,000
Sometimes you can put it in your mouth.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,416
If you want it,

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,333
type a message now.

12
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,708
Send me your comment
and I'll answer you back.

13
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,208
Let's see all the comments
if anyone wants a flashlight.

14
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,958
THOSE ARE BREASTS OR BABY'S HEAD?
LOVE THEM.

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,041
There are only comments on my breasts?

16
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,750
I'm selling flashlights right now.
Could anyone care?

17
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,416
"Bitch! You're such an online whore!"

18
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,750
How do you know I'm a whore?

19
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,375
Normally, it's free if I'm pleased.

20
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,500
I even give tips, for taxi fares.

21
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,208
If anyone bullies me like this,

22
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,833
I'm gonna block that person.

23
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,708
And you'll have no chance to come in
to see my boobs.

24
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,916
This is a warning.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,166
BITCH. IF YOU BLOCK ME, YOU DIE!

26
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,750
"If you block me, you die!"

27
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,625
Who is this? You think I'm scared? Really?

28
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,500
I'll slap you with my breasts!

29
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,708
Haha. Hilarious.

30
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,208
Cyber-bullies. Are you on summer break?

31
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,458
Let me see your name. I'm gonna block you.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,583
"Monica."

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,666
If you wanna pull a prank,

34
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,458
be considerate a little.

35
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,291
We don't use the name of someone dead
in the joke.

36
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,833
Don't be out of line.

37
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,916
I'm blocking you now.

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,750
BLOCK

39
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,250
MONICA (CAN'T ADD MORE FRIENDS,
CLICK FOLLOW): I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

40
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,375
Top seller? Isn't it misleading?

41
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,708
Nah. Just a way of selling.

42
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,666
TRUE BEAUTY MUST COME FROM INSIDE.
ICONNIC CREAM USES NATURAL EXTRACTS.

43
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,666
Now, we'll go to the next step.

44
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,500
I have other vegetables ready.

45
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,625
Next, I'm gonna chop carrots
to add colors to the food.

46
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,916
We're in the process of
getting carrots ready.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Make it a bit colorful.

48
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,291
Okay, it's done.

49
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,333
While we're waiting for the water to boil,

50
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,250
let's read the comments here.

51
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,125
"How are you? You're doing okay?"

52
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,416
Yes, I'm fine.

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,208
"Which cream do you use?
Your face looks so bright."

54
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,625
Thank you.

55
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,791
Iconnic cream, of course.

56
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,750
"Cream that net idols trust."

57
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,666
Yes. Advertising a bit.

58
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,875
YOU AND SEVEN MORE PEOPLE ARE TAGGED
IN MONICA'S POST

59
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,708
Well,

60
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,500
the water is boiling.

61
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,541
I'll put all the ingredients we prepared
into the pot.

62
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:52,083
MONICA (CAN'T ADD MORE FRIENDS,
CLICK FOLLOW), NOW: "ON THIS DAY"

63
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,750
It's creepy just talking about it.

64
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,958
Don't know who used the dead person's
account to pull this prank.

65
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,166
I'm not too worried.

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,416
I just find it weird.

67
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,125
Anyway, don't come home too late, okay?

68
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,208
Yeah.

69
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,166
What happened, Sa?

70
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,583
What's wrong?

71
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,291
It's all right, Sa. It's all right now.

72
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,208
Who's Monica anyway?

73
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,875
A net idol
that I once hired to review my cream.

74
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,291
It was under the brand Malisza.

75
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,541
She was so audacious
to broadcast her suicide live.

76
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,833
She must have been stressed.

77
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,666
I heard that
she just broke up with her boyfriend.

78
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,458
There are also many people
that don't like or hate her.

79
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,583
There must be someone who used her account
to pull a prank on you.

80
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,291
If you feel uneasy about it,

81
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,916
then just block her.

82
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,791
Okay?

83
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,666
Well, I gotta go to work now.

84
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,000
It's late.

85
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,166

SOM PINSUDAH (IT'S ME, SOM)

87
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:05,250
Monica has tagged you in her video.

88
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,041
Missed call from Monica.

89
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:03,375
You've got a voicemail from Monica.

90
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,750
Hi, Som.

91
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,458
This is Monica.

92
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
My face is all ruined now.

93
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,416
Hi, Som.

94
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,166
This is Monica.

95
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,208
My face is all ruined now.

96
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,125
Hi, Som.

97
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,791
This is Monica.

98
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,833
My face is all ruined now.

99
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,791
My face is all ruined now.

100
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,875
My face is all ruined now.

101
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,958
My face is all ruined now.

102
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,666
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MONICA...

103
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:27,208
Hi. Today, you're live with Monica
and Ai-ai.

104
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,500
-Ai.
-No.

105
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,833
"Dance a little crazier."

106
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,041
Sure. Look at this.

107
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,083
"Could you moan my name?"

108
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,583
"Can someone please take
the mummy in the back away?"

109
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,791
Ai. They don't want you here.

110
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,250
"You are so cute."

111
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,416
Thank you.

112
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,833
Where are you going, mummy?

113
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,000
Come back here and dance with me.

114
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,000
Come here.

115
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,958
Anyway, if you want the mummy back,

116
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,291
click "Like".

117
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,333
If you want to see me, click "Love".

118
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,500
They said this shop is awesome.
Is it true?

119
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,166
You'll see.

120
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,416
Why?

121
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,916
You don't trust me?

122
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,583
You always say that.

123
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,708
Enjoy your meal.

124
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,541
Can I have a photo with you?

125
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,791
Of course.

126
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,791
One, two, three.

127
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,750
Yeah. One more, please.

128
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,916
After posting it,
don't forget to check in.

129
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,666
Yeah. I'll do it for you right now.

130
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
-Enjoy the meal.
-Thank you.

131
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,916
Hey, Sa.

132
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,375
Thank you.

133
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,000
-Please come again.
-Sure.

134
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,500
When I saw I was tagged in that post,

135
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,375
I was shocked.

136
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,166
I'm wondering
who pulled this fucking prank.

137
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,000
There was also
a check-in at your house, right?

138
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,333
Yeah.

139
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Do you have any idea
who knows her password?

140
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,500
I don't know.

141
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,041
I don't even know and I'm her friend.

142
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,833
If you really want to know,
why don't you look in her condo?

143
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,291
You can let me in there?

144
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,500
Well, it's possible.

145
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,833
But, well...

146
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,041
Wait here just a moment.

147
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,208
Here. Try it.

148
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,583
And does anyone else have a key card
to her room?

149
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,541
I don't know.

150
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,708
Probably not.

151
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,541
Please come again when you can, okay?

152
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:48,125
Sa, why did you bring me here?

153
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,791
I don't want to come to Monica's condo
by myself.

154
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,083
Are all net idols' rooms as untidy
as this one?

155
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,000
Were you like this?

156
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,000
Hurry and find it.
I don't want to be here too long.

157
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,125
Well, I'll check the computer.

158
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,125
Eighteen.

159
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,083
-Jak.
-Yeah?

160
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,791
Try "Munnikar".

161
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,875
It's her first name.

162
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,291
Yeah.

163
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,750
Munnikar.

164
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,041
Forget it.

165
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,833
Look for her cell phone?

166
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Sure.

167
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,375
Sa.

168
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:16,625
Yeah?

169
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,166
Found it.

170
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,166
Can you turn it on? It won't turn on?

171
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,625
No. Probably need to take it home
to charge it.

172
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
-Jak.
-Yeah?

173
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,708
I think we should go now.

174
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,291
Okay.

175
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:03,791
Sa!

176
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,416
Sa! What's wrong?

177
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,666
It's me. Jak.

178
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,708
What's wrong?

179
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:16,958
Sa.

180
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,208
What's wrong?

181
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,958
I think you should stop
reading social media.

182
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
What are you going to do
with Monica's cell phone?

183
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,666
We can't figure out the password.

184
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:54,583
I think I'm gonna ask my friend
to hack into it.

185
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,416
So that we'll have some idea
of who has been using it to prank us.

186
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,875
So you can relax.

187
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,708
What if it's not someone?

188
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,875
Don't think too much about it.

189
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,916
I'll go work on the inventory
at the factory.

190
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,416
I'll be right back.

191
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,916
"SAN" DIED TRAGICALLY. YOU'LL BE STUNNED
TO LEARN WHO HER FRIEND WAS.

192
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,750
Yes, Mom.

193
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,083
Yeah.

194
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,041
Ah, yes.

195
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,125
I'm so sorry, Mom.

196
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:23,875
Yes.

197
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,666
Yes.

198
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,666
I'll take good care of her, Mom.

199
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,291
Okay.

200
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,416
I'll keep you posted.

201
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,333
Yes. Okay.

202
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:38,666
Yes, Mom.

203
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,333
Yeah. Okay, bye.

204
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,458
How are you holding up?

205
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,208
Please come in, Jak.

206
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,375
DEWII CHECKED IN AT KHING-NGAN STUDIO
NOW.

207
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,458
There's a shoot going on today?

208
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah. A cute, little sexy one.

209
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,333
Sa hasn't been using my service lately.

210
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:07,708
My girls are all sexy and cute.

211
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,958
And the important thing is
they have a lot of followers.

212
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,458
If you want any girl, just let me know.

213
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,291
I'll arrange it for you.

214
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:17,208
Mr. Dewii, today...

215
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,916
I'll cut to the chase.

216
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,250
I came here to talk about Monica.

217
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,958
I've never believed in ghosts.

218
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,375
But this has gotten much worse.

219
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,833
Som, who used to work with Sa,

220
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,666
is dead after being tagged in that video.

221
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,791
The most recent person
is one of Monica's friends.

222
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,791
Started hallucinating all of the sudden
right before she got hit by a car.

223
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,291
You were also tagged in the video, right?

224
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,333
You don't find it weird?

225
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,333
I want to know what happened
before she died.

226
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,125
You were her manager.

227
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,750
You probably knew best.

228
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,666
You know I'm no psychic or anything.

229
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:27,583
But if you came here to ask me
why she committed suicide,

230
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,625
I can say that I know as much as you do.

231
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,625
Why don't you go ask her ex-boyfriend Sun?

232
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,416
He was also tagged in that post.

233
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,541
And he was closer to her than me.

234
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,416
You go and ask him, okay?

235
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,625
Is he the one named

236
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,250
Tawan Biker?

237
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,833
Yeah. You go and ask him, okay?

238
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,708
Would you excuse me? I'd like to
go check on my team at the set.

239
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,958
Mr. Dewii?

240
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:19,041
You didn't do anything bad
to Monica, right?

241
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,208
Are you crazy?

242
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:25,583
Monica is my money-maker.

243
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,666
Why would I do that?

244
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,500
Anyway, would you excuse me?

245
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,166
Bye-bye.

246
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,458
Hi. Hello, everyone.

247
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,541
It's me, Lodchong.

248
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:45,583
Today I'm shooting an ad.

249
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,958
There. I'm here with a pretty girl.

250
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,541
I'll show you around.

251
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,416
Oh, no.

252
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,375
Are you gonna work now?

253
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,333
Or do need me to give you hell first?

254
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,500
After work, you'll go live on the toilet
or whatever, I don't care.

255
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,083
Sorry.

256
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,458
Hi, everyone.

257
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,875
Keep following us, okay?

258
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,791
Seriously?

259
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,041
Hi, everyone.

260
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,000
Would you excuse them
so they can get back to work?

261
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,625
After work, they'll be right back.

262
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,375
Bye.

263
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,125
There you go.

264
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:32,041
Oh, man. They may unfollow us
because of what you just did.

265
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:35,000
You better know your time and place
during work hours.

266
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,916
Where is Munkaew?

267
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,291
Lower your voice.

268
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,291
She got a job reviewing flashlights.

269
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,333
High pay.

270
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,250
So I let her work on that job for now.

271
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,500
Why don't we get that kind of job?

272
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,500
You missed this job.
There'll be another one.

273
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,583
Get back to work.

274
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:56,833
Go!

275
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,333
Get back to work.

276
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:03,000
Hey, everybody.

277
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,083
The girls are ready.

278
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,541
Okay. I'd like to see some strong poses.

279
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:08,750
Hold the pose.

280
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,250
Beautiful.

281
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,833
Show your confidence, okay?

282
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,833
That's great.

283
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,583
Very good, girls.

284
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,250
Very pretty.

285
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,083
This one is nice.

286
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,958
Lodchong, show more confidence.

287
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,541
-Look at the camera.
-Change your arms a bit.

288
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:30,958
Cute. Good.

289
00:40:31,333 --> 00:40:33,125
Be a bit more cheerful.

290
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:37,166
Those eyes were great.
Open your eyes a bit wider?

291
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,625
Okay. Now switch places.

292
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:44,000
That's good.

293
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,208
Very good.

294
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,708
Great. That's great.

295
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,083
-Is everything okay now? Great.
-Yes.

296
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,541
All right, everybody, that's a wrap.

297
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,541
Let's pack up.

298
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,708
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, everybody.

299
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,416
See you next job.

300
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,041
Aren't you gonna go home?

301
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,208
Go pack it up.

302
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:12,625
Go.

303
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,666
Hello? Hi.

304
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,583
See you later.

305
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,291
My body is aching all over.

306
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,250
You wanna hang out?

307
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,291
Nah.

308
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,375
I'm tired. I just wanna go home.

309
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,750
All right.

310
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,625
By the way...

311
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,541
Munkaew is Dewii's favorite, huh?

312
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,041
He always gives her
all the easy good jobs.

313
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:58,458
Actually, that flashlight job should have
been for all three of us, right?

314
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,541
She took it all for herself.

315
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:01,666
Bitch.

316
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,166
Let it go.

317
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,916
The client probably hired just her.

318
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,375
If Mo hadn't died,

319
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,500
there's no way
that Munkaew would have got the job.

320
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,333
Who posted something in the group?

321
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,125
Fuck.

322
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:51,625
Hello?

323
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,083
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,750
Okay.

325
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,666
Thank you very much. You're so nice.

326
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,041
You always choose our service.

327
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,375
Yes. Yes.

328
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,250
What about the garden?
Let's do it as we agreed.

329
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,583
Okay.

330
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:12,125
On that day, we'll take care
of the clothes, hair and makeup.

331
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,458
Okay.

332
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,791
Yes. So you can confirm it on...

333
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:41,791
Hey, let's go.

334
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,291
What happened?

335
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Hello.

336
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:54,583
Is anybody out there?

337
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,000
Is anybody out there?

338
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,875
We can't open the door.

339
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,208
Please open it.

340
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,583
What should we do?

341
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,000
Is anybody out there?

342
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,166
Bonsai.

343
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,458
Where are you?

344
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,875
I can't see a thing.

345
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,583
Bonsai.

346
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,125
Where are you? Answer me.

347
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:35,125
Bonsai! Where are you?

348
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:44,166
Bonsai.

349
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,583
Bonsai.

350
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,250
Where are you?

351
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,041
Bonsai.

352
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,750
Bonsai. Are you there?

353
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,583
Open the door.
Anybody out there, open the door, please.

354
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,541
Please open the door.

355
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,500
I'm embarrassed.

356
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,291
What's there to be embarrassed about?

357
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,416
No. Go to Gon over there.

358
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,041
She knows how to be embarrassed?

359
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,458
Excuse me.

360
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,625
Yes?

361
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,625
Sun. Someone's here for you.

362
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,125
Well, excuse me. I'll go inside, then.

363
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,458
Hi.

364
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,833
What's up?

365
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,375
I wanna talk to you about Monica.

366
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,333
What about her?

367
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:23,083
You've seen Monica's post
that you were tagged in, right?

368
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,791
My girlfriend was tagged as well.

369
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:31,041
I'm sorry. Who is your girlfriend?

370
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,333
My girlfriend hired Monica
to review Malisza cream.

371
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:39,666
So, I want to know if the two of them
ever argued about anything.

372
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:43,583
I wouldn't say they argued.

373
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,000
Monica is dead...

374
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,958
because of your fucking girlfriend, right?

375
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:57,000
Listen to me.

376
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,458
This is my girlfriend's house.

377
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:04,458
I don't need to talk about the past here.

378
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,333
I also don't want to talk about it.

379
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,958
You'd better go home
and ask your girlfriend.

380
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,291
Because that bitch knows it
better than anyone.

381
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,958
Excuse me.

382
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,875
I think you should go.

383
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:16,041
Why did Monica commit suicide?

384
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:24,875
Why are you asking me?

385
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,625
Sa.

386
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,125
What are you hiding from me?

387
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,708
I'm trying to help you here.

388
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:46,208
Hi. Welcome to my party.

389
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,416
I'll show you how cool my party is.

390
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,666
Hey, everybody, say hi.

391
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,708
Who's not here? Call them over, hurry.

392
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:57,416
Call them over, hurry.

393
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,375
Who? Boom is not here yet. Look.

394
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,625
Everybody's having fun.
And we're all getting drunk.

395
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,958
I'll tell you this.
Our party is limitless.

396
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,750
Everything is here.
Lights, music and everything.

397
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:12,000
It's a party at my house,
so it's gotta be awesome, right?

398
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,625
Okay. Make everyone else jealous!

399
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,416
What's wrong, Sun? You look bored.

400
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,625
Not at all.

401
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,083
Is my party boring?

402
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,250
No.

403
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,166
-Really?
-Yes.

404
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,458
Who's that?

405
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:08,750
Sun!

406
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,000
What's wrong, Sun?

407
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,208
Sun! Sun!

408
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,958
Sun.

409
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,625
Sun!

410
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,500
What's up with you?

411
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:30,750
Go away!

412
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:33,000
Go away! I said go away!

413
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,041
Go away!

414
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,875
Stop, Sun! What are you doing?

415
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,791
Sun! Stop!

416
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,416
Sun!

417
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,916
Don't do anything crazy!

418
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,708
Stop it!

419
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,625
Don't do it!

420
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,333
Don't!

421
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:21,875
Sun!

422
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,833
Sun!

423
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,458
Did you go to Monica's room?

424
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,000
Put it back.

425
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,708
She's already suffered enough.

426
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:08,500
Cut to the chase.

427
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,750
Why are you here?

428
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,083
I want to know the same thing you do.

429
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:20,875
And I think your girlfriend
has the answer for us.

430
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,625
Sa...

431
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:30,666
five people that were tagged in that post
are dead now. You know, right?

432
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:35,875
Aren't you afraid that you'll be next?

433
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:45,791
Last year,

434
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,041
when I first launched the Malisza brand,

435
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:52,125
I was looking for a net idol

436
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,458
to review my cream.

437
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:03,000
I'm proud to recommend this girl to you.

438
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,333
Nice work. Lots of followers.

439
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:08,625
You won't be disappointed, I guarantee.

440
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:17,041
Hi. Today, I'm gonna review Malisza cream.

441
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,875
This one right here.

442
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:21,708
The box looks like this.

443
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,125
And the jar inside...

444
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:26,916
looks like this.

445
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,375
It's in a silver-white packaging.

446
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:32,041
The logo is in pink.

447
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:34,458
Let's take a look inside.

448
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:43,125
The cream is white.

449
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:46,666
Unscented. There's probably no perfume.

450
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,500
There's no strong scent at all.

451
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:52,791
Here you go. I'm testing it
on the back of my hand.

452
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:57,208
You can see that it is easily
spread on skin.

453
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,666
It's not ghostly white,

454
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,166
or much different from the skin tone. See?

455
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,875
I'll test it on my face now.

456
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,291
So you can see how it is,

457
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,333
how different it looks
when it's on the face.

458
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:18,958
Wow. I think I like it.

459
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,291
Because it's quite soft,

460
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:26,041
not sticky and easy to apply.

461
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,333
Here. I'll let you compare both sides.

462
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:31,625
This side, with cream.

463
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,333
This side, without.

464
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,708
You can see the colors are not different.

465
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:37,958
It absorbs into the skin really well.

466
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:40,333
It would be easy
to put on makeup afterwards.

467
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,875
Anyway, don't forget to follow me

468
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,791
on the Twenty Days Challenge
with Malisza Cream.

469
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,375
Bye-bye.

470
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:27,083
Okay, it's been a week now
that I've been using Malisza cream.

471
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:30,708
The package looks like this,
for those who have not seen it.

472
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,833
LET US SEE YOUR FACE CLOSER.

473
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:35,750
First, I need to say that
since I've been using Malisza cream,

474
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:38,708
I can feel that my face is softer...

475
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,750
YOU LOOK PRETTY AS ALWAYS.

476
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,833
...and brighter.

477
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:44,458
And the makeup stays on longer.

478
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,375
LIAR.

479
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:49,541
Besides, I have to say,
like in my previous clips,

480
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,291
that Malisza cream has no fragrance.

481
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:56,458
So it's quite suitable for sensitive skin.

482
01:02:56,541 --> 01:03:00,041
SOUNDS WEIRD.

483
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:04,541
Well, all right, we'll just wait and see

484
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:06,750
after I'm done with this challenge...

485
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,250
FUCKING LIAR.
SUCH THICK FOUNDATION. I KNEW IT.

486
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:11,333
...how my skin will be whiter,
brighter, better,

487
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:14,250
and more interesting

488
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:17,958
after the Twenty Days Challenge
by Malisza Cream.

489
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,958
Hi, Som.

490
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,416
My face is all ruined now.

491
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,250
Could you try to talk to Ms. Marisa

492
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:38,041
to see if she can pay me something,
so I can use it to treat my face.

493
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:41,916
Hi, you're back with me, Mo.

494
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,750
Today is the last day

495
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,375
of the Twenty Days Challenge
by Malisza Brand.

496
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,708
Well, I have used this cream for 20 days.

497
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,666
I have to say it's fucking good.

498
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,708
TODAY IS NOT FUN.

499
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:56,541
So good that it fucked my face.

500
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:57,458
FUCK YOU, FUCK FACE.

501
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:03,583
All right, I'll show you again
about how to apply this cream.

502
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,791
We put it on like this.

503
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:07,875
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

504
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,541
Like this. Your face will be soft...

505
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:11,458
DID ANYONE HEAR THAT?

506
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,416
...and super moist.

507
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,791
Your face won't be ruined. No more acne.

508
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:16,333
No allergies.

509
01:04:16,416 --> 01:04:17,333
SUPER ENTERTAINING TODAY.

510
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:19,750
It's non-allergenic.
This cream is for hyper-sensitive skin.

511
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:20,750
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

512
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:23,375
That's not enough. We'll apply even more.

513
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:27,208
Like this. More and more.

514
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:28,916
It is so good.

515
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,458
Don't forget to buy it.

516
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,541
It is Malisza brand.

517
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:35,833
Buy a lot of it.

518
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:39,916
Because after using this cream
we will all have a fuck face!

519
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,625
Thank you for following.

520
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,208
TODAY'S HIGHLIGHT

521
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:57,250
SO EXCITING

522
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,750
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?

523
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:02,250
NO ONE'S CALLING POLICE?

524
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,250
You can think that I'm mean.

525
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,791
But where is the proof

526
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:26,208
that my cream really ruined her face?

527
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,250
What about the other people tagged
in that post?

528
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,291
How are they involved?

529
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,750
There must be a reason

530
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:41,125
for Monica to kill them.

531
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,458
What do you want me to do

532
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:50,208
to make her leave me alone?

533
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,625
I need to die?

534
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:56,708
I don't know about the rest
that were tagged.

535
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,083
But you...

536
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:03,333
I think Monica really thought

537
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,041
that your cream was the cause
of all the terrible things.

538
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,875
And so do I.

539
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,333
So?

540
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:14,208
Want me to apologize?

541
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:16,333
Sorry! Fine, I'm sorry!

542
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,750
I'll apologize if it'll end this.

543
01:07:19,416 --> 01:07:22,083
How could I apologize to her? She's dead.

544
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,625
Monica killed herself...

545
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,416
because she was bullied by social media...

546
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,666
because of your cream.

547
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:33,708
If I were Monica...

548
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:38,166
I would probably like some justice
for what happened.

549
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:40,125
So?

550
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:44,666
Should I broadcast live to tell
everybody that my cream sucks?

551
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:47,916
That it ruined her face so bad
that she committed suicide?

552
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,125
I'll do it if it'll end this.

553
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,083
But how can you be so sure

554
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:57,583
that if I did do it,
she would stop harassing me?

555
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,541
Sa.

556
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,750
Sa.

557
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:37,750
Sa.

558
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,541
What's on your mind?

559
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm not sure.

560
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,000
I don't know what's gonna happen...

561
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,083
if we tell everybody about this.

562
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,666
Sa, right now you need to care
of yourself.

563
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:44,833
Even if you can't sell cream,
I can still support us.

564
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,083
Right?

565
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:52,916
How about this? We end this right now.

566
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:56,166
Then we start it over.

567
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:57,250
Okay?

568
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,583
Let's go.

569
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Jak.

570
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,041
I don't want to go upstairs.

571
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:29,583
Okay, you wait right here.

572
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,000
I'll put her cell phone back.

573
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:21,250
MONICA: WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU?
I'LL GET YOU ALL IF I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

574
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:25,750
Hey, when am I gonna get paid
for reviewing Malisza cream?

575
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:29,541
Geez, you're not gonna get it.
Your face is fucked up like that.

576
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,916
You didn't finish the campaign
as you agreed.

577
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,916
You should be grateful
that she didn't sue you. 

578
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:40,916
But I couldn't finish it
because of her cream.

579
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,333
It ruined my face when I used it.

580
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,541
You saw it, didn't you?

581
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:47,000
Hello?

582
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:48,833
Hello?

583
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,416
Som, you know that

584
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:56,041
-I used Malisza cream to review it, right?
-Yeah.

585
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,916
My face is all ruined now.

586
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,208
Yeah, I understand.

587
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,333
Don't panic.

588
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:05,625
Could you please
put me through to Ms. Marisa?

589
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:10,708
Sorry. She doesn't want to talk to you,
and she's not available.

590
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:16,583
How can you be sure that
you didn't use any other brand with it?

591
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,375
Som, ever since I took this job,

592
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,833
I haven't used any other cream.

593
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:26,958
Do you have any evidence against us?

594
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,500
Please help me. I'm begging you.

595
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,583
Please. Please, Som.

596
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,875
Don't forget to buy it.

597
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,625
Malisza brand.

598
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:41,916
So good that it fucked my face.

599
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:06,791
ANTIMONICA: SHARED A NEW VIDEO

600
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:09,291
Fun scandal, huh? Gotta share it.

601
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,916
What's the hurry, Sa?

602
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,750
Are you okay?

603
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,458
Hang in there.

604
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,250
I know about everything, Sa.

605
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,333
I know all about it.

606
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,708
How could you do something so cruel?

607
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:41,583
You ruined someone's life.

608
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,833
And you lied to me afterwards.

609
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,791
Why did you lie to me, Sa?

610
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:02,541
What I hate about myself right now is

611
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,458
that I forgive you despite all the facts.

612
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,958
I love you, Sa.

613
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:12,791
I love you, too, Jak.

614
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:43,166
Sa...

615
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,750
SIX MONTHS LATER

616
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,583
Could you please wait here for a moment?

617
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,916
Your mom is picking you up.

618
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,166
Wait a moment.

619
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:42,125
You'll be okay, Sa.

620
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:47,500
I'll be around to watch your doom.

621
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:01,791
