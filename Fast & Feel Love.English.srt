1
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,291
CUMULATIVE GPA: 2.16

2
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,958
Your grades are troublesome.

3
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,208
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,083
What do you want to do in the future?

5
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,125
Tell me.

6
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,833
Well, I want to be
an ice-sculpting champion.

7
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,333
Oh, my dear. Wake up.

8
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,208
Thailand doesn't have any snow.

9
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,875
Well…

10
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,250
I don't know.
But I saw it once and liked it.

11
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,666
It's beautiful, ma'am.

12
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,583
I think that it's possible. It's just…

13
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,166
I have to find a way.

14
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,375
I guess.

15
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,500
Try to think about
something possible, okay?

16
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,208
I want to travel the world.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,416
Monthon.

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,791
Traveling the world is not a career, hon.

19
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,750
Does traveling the world give you money?

20
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,541
Well, I'd record a video
of myself traveling.

21
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,541
And then upload it on the internet.

22
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,208
If a lot of people watch it,

23
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,875
I will get sponsors and earn money.

24
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,625
Well, I would go by myself.
I'd record it myself.

25
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,875
A girl traveling the world alone
is impossible.

26
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,708
It's dangerous. Don't you know?

27
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,500
-Huh?
-I see.

28
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,750
I want to be an artist.

29
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,291
I want to write rap songs and…

30
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,208
release singles, make albums,

31
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,750
and sign on
with a big international label.

32
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,750
Then…

33
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,375
hold my own concert.

34
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,750
Earn a lot of money.

35
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,583
Make a career out of it.

36
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,125
However, I think…

37
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,791
a career can't be made
from singing this kind of song.

38
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,708
It's possible, ma'am.

39
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,208
It really can be a career.

40
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,125
It's like…

41
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,458
Snoop Dogg.

42
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,541
Or Eminem.

43
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,958
They release rap songs, and whoa!

44
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,375
So mind-blowing, ma'am.

45
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,041
-It's--
-I understand what you're saying

46
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,750
but I don't think it's a career.

47
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,125
I'll be a doctor then.

48
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,708
Excellent.

49
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,000
HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC TRANSCRIPTION

50
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,625
I'm going to print my picture on t-shirts

51
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,916
and sell them at a high price.

52
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,125
I'll hold a concert
and give money away to the audience.

53
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,833
And I'll spray water
from my mouth on them too.

54
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,625
Ong.

55
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,916
Please, sympathize with me.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,250
I'm really tired today.

57
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,958
I want to raise an ant colony--

58
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:16,875
Stop, please.

59
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,958
I want to grow and sell marijuana.

60
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,041
Petch.

61
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,416
Let me ask one thing of you.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,916
Please do not do anything drug-related.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,125
Ma'am.

64
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,875
Marijuana is an herb.

65
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,666
-It treats diseases.
-Petch.

66
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,500
Drug users die, sellers go to jail.

67
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,583
Hello.

68
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,333
Come on. Take off your cap
when talking with me.

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,125
This term, you still have only 2.1.
I think it's too late.

70
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,208
Let me ask you.

71
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,250
What are you good at?

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,500
You have to be good at something.

73
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,541
I…

74
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,125
play sport stacking.

75
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,625
Sport stacking,

76
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,916
the popular sport
of stacking cups in the US

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,708
that tests your brain?

78
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,166
Stop playing.

79
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,625
Do you want to end up
working on an assembly line?

80
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,083
But…

81
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,791
even if you were
to work on an assembly line,

82
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,625
you wouldn't be able to do things
as fast as them.

83
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,416
Aren't people good at different things?

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,416
Don't talk back.

85
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
The entrance exam is coming.

86
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,916
Universities don't have
a cup-playing faculty, you know.

87
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,208
Of all that I've heard so far,

88
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,583
yours seems to be the most futureless.

89
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,791
Okay. You may go now.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,666
Jerita, 2.8.

91
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,750
GO AND SEE THE WIDE WORLD

92
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,500
I know you are good at English.

93
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,666
But for Thai, Science, and Social Studies,

94
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,791
your grades are very bad.

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,125
Wow.

96
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,625
Is this the sport
the teacher's talking about?

97
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,083
Hey, I'm fine.
You don't have to talk to me.

98
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,833
If you want to practice your Thai,
better find someone else.

99
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,375
No.

100
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,708
I wasn't here to talk to you.

101
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,125
I'm here to move the plants.

102
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,708
Hey, I understand, you know, Farang.

103
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,166
What's the deal with you?

104
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,708
Have you been teased all your life?

105
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,958
You're so tense.

106
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,958
What's with you? Lonely?

107
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,083
A Farang who loves plants

108
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,458
talking to a guy
who likes stacking is unusual.

109
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,791
You're weird, you know?

110
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,041
We're both weird.

111
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,458
That's why we're here
talking to each other now.

112
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,666
If I played football or basketball
like the others,

113
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,041
I wouldn't be here
playing alone like some weirdo.

114
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,166
I have myself to blame.

115
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,708
You wouldn't be weird
if you're in the right place.

116
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,625
Like this plant,

117
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,666
if it's placed in the shade, it'll die.

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,791
Exposing it to sunlight,
it'll grow in three days.

119
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,125
I hope there will be a place
like that for stacking.

120
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,708
If you love something,
it will take you somewhere.

121
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,333
You know.

122
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,666
My uncle has a flower pot factory.

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,875
He's now filthy rich,
who would've thought?

124
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,458
Your speech is way cooler
than the teacher's.

125
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,250
Why don't you become a guidance counselor?

126
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,666
If you need help with anything,
just let me know.

127
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,125
And…

128
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,958
what about you?

129
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,708
What do you want to do?

130
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe I can help in exchange.

131
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,166
I…

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,916
I don't have a special dream.

133
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,625
I'm average.

134
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,166
A normal person.

135
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,375
Normal? Like…

136
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,500
graduating, get a job, get married,
have kids, own a house?

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,625
Well, I guess so.

138
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,500
I think you just haven't found
your dream yet.

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Actually, you aren't average.

140
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,625
How?

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,041
Your special ability is that

142
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,083
you're kind.

143
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,791
Kindness is a special ability?

144
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,416
Can I use it to get into uni?

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,083
Well, it's not like everyone
talks with me like this.

146
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,250
It isn't easy to find a kind person.

147
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,250
Sure. Thanks, then.

148
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,916
It's not like everyone
talks with me like this either.

149
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,666
Well…

150
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,041
if I come up with something
I need help with,

151
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,208
I'll let you know.

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,333
Sure. What do you want me to call you?

153
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,500
Jay.

154
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm Kao.

155
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,916
Damn, you've distracted me,
but somehow I can play faster.

156
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,541
Want me to explain how to play it?

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,833
Sure.

158
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,250
It's about stacking the cups up

159
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,125
and collecting them as fast as possible.

160
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,166
But what I've been aiming to do
is to compete.

161
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,125
In competition,
there are a set of three, and of six…

162
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,125
When a plant is in the right place
at the right time,

163
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,750
it will grow quickly.

164
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,583
You can't see it.

165
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,541
You will never see it.

166
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,708
It's because the speed of 0.001 second

167
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,833
is the speed at which the eye can't see.

168
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,125
It's a speed when spoken of,
no one understands.

169
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:25,958
When you come to your senses,

170
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,125
you've already lost or won.

171
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,458
Sport stacking

172
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
is genderless…

173
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,166
doesn't care about age…

174
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,708
overlooks nationalities.

175
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,166
We're enemies for 0.001 seconds.

176
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,791
It is a sport that depends
on you and your hands.

177
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,375
No one can help you.

178
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,750
Speed without any pattern.

179
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,041
Meaning?

180
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,875
It's like when you untie the rubber band,

181
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,083
the brain will find the pattern
to untie it.

182
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,583
Keep doing it
and you'll be able to do it faster

183
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,208
because the brain remembers the pattern.

184
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,875
But this kind of speed

185
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,208
doesn't have a pattern.

186
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:13,833
It's absorbed.

187
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,000
It's above any thoughts.

188
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,000
And… what can I do to help you?

189
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,166
Oh, well…

190
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,916
help…

191
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,541
stay and keep me company.

192
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,291
What about as my girlfriend?

193
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,125
Staying with him might be the only way

194
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,208
that an average person like me
can help out.

195
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,541
In my country,

196
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,000
when you don't study
at a university like the others,

197
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,833
it's like throwing out your rice cooker.

198
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,541
Whenever you become
a part of something special,

199
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,708
you will feel like you're also special.

200
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,625
For me,

201
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,416
his world is something beautiful.

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,375
I want to see it growing.

203
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,500
Here.

204
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
Thank you for staying with me, Jay.

205
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,583
I freaking love you.

206
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,541
Not from winning.

207
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,416
But if I break a world record,

208
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,208
I'll get money from the sponsors.

209
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,916
I hear they pay out in dollars.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,875
The reward can last for two years.

211
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,791
So, if I can practice

212
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
and keep breaking the world record,

213
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,125
then stacking can become my career.

214
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,833
Jeremy from Austria, 4.753.

215
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,375
If I want him to be faster than 4.753,

216
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,000
I think just being his girlfriend
isn't enough.

217
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,250
Just you wait, Jeremy.

218
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,333
Kao! Come down and move the car.

219
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,125
There's no parking space for customers.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
It's okay. Keep playing.
I'll take care of it.

221
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,500
He once said that my special ability is

222
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,416
kindness.

223
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,291
Mom, I'll move it for you.

224
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,458
Jay, the keys.

225
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,416
Kao!

226
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,958
The sun's out, hang the laundry for me.

227
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,666
4.861, Jay!

228
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
4.861, Jay.

229
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,500
It's 4.861. I really am faster.

230
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,041
If an accountant like me

231
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,541
is able to help him
be a millisecond faster,

232
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm happy.

233
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,416
I'm happy for you.

234
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,625
Kao…

235
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:56,750
move the car.

236
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,166
Jay did it already, Mom.

237
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,333
Sorry. I forgot.

238
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:09,958
Jay.

239
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,583
With the conditions and the situation
that we are dealing with,

240
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,291
I think there is something very important

241
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,000
that we both need now.

242
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,541
The next level.

243
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,625
Don't tell me…

244
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,000
START AT 5.99 MILLION

245
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,041
Six million.

246
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,500
Split the mortgage.

247
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,416
Well…

248
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,041
I have some money,

249
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,500
but do you?

250
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,583
Kao! Buy some crispy pork belly for me.

251
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,041
Here is my source of capital.

252
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,625
When I win,
I'll return twice as much to my mom.

253
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
I'll go home and think about it.

254
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,958
Aside from his improved stacking speed,

255
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,500
our relationship has sped up
like skipping up steps.

256
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,416
Welcome.

257
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,166
Take a look around first.

258
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,416
If you're not satisfied,
you can let me know.

259
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,083
Our living room
uses the Empathy Design system.

260
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,625
We did research
with actual families before designing it.

261
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,750
The rooms upstairs
interlock with the ones downstairs.

262
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,291
You can see into them.

263
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,541
Would you like to take a look?

264
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,875
This is the kid's room,
suitable for both a boy or a girl.

265
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,666
It's the best corner of the house.

266
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,166
And most importantly,

267
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,333
it's exceptionally quiet.

268
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,958
Mr. Win, please take a look first.

269
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,125
But you'll need to hurry

270
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,541
because this is the last house
we have now.

271
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,666
I'll give you the answer tomorrow.

272
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,875
I think we'll take it.

273
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,166
JAY: WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

274
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,875
KAO: YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF IT. I TRUST YOU.

275
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,208
LET ME PRACTICE FIRST.
ANOTHER 0.001 SECOND IS COMING.

276
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,875
I'll take it.

277
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,541
You might think I'm crazy.

278
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,250
But have you ever fought
over pre-ordering stuff

279
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,416
or buying stocks?

280
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,500
I must have seen some kind of future here.

281
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,000
This is the kid's room, right?

282
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,541
Okay. Great,
it's like getting a free room.

283
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,916
We're not having kids anyway.

284
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,166
What should we use it for?

285
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Well…

286
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,375
this room is…

287
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,500
for you to play cup stack.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,291
This is the quietest room.

289
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,166
Ever since that day

290
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,833
I found that
the essential thing to stacking

291
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,916
isn't just hands or cups.

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,708
But it is a good environment.

293
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,708
This is the future.

294
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,000
I knew I could count on Jay.

295
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,750
This is clearly heaven.

296
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,208
It's like an arsenal of power,

297
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,625
complete with everything to enhance speed.

298
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,916
Clean air without any dust.

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Nature.

300
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,708
And most importantly above all else,

301
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,708
here, we can control
any sound and any drama.

302
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,208
Jay, don't take a bath!

303
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,916
Jay, don't flush!

304
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,125
Hey, today…

305
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,541
Thanks.

306
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:25,958
I broke it.

307
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,041
I broke it.

308
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,750
Jay, this house is our new weapon.

309
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,541
May I inform you with respect, ma'am.

310
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,375
This is my future,

311
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
the one you told me I didn't have.

312
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,916
This is the world sport stacking
championship.

313
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,750
This is my home.

314
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,708
I wish for you to continue working hard.

315
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,875
The next level.

316
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,541
If we love something,

317
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,250
it will take us somewhere.

318
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,166
Yam.

319
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,916
Are you free tomorrow?

320
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,041
I have to attend my kid's school event.

321
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,416
Oh, you aren't free?

322
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,458
Yes.

323
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,625
I want to watch a movie.

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,750
This means our house
is a competition court.

325
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,083
This means our house
is a competition court.

326
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,000
Jay.

327
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,875
Do you remember, you once told me

328
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,916
if we love something,
it will take us somewhere?

329
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,875
If I can really win this round,

330
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,625
let's find a way to move there
and never return.

331
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,208
Is that good?

332
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,208
Damn, he scared me.

333
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,291
Why was he hyped up like that?

334
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,875
When you're really into something,

335
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,458
you'd be hyped up about everything.

336
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Don't you remember when you were about to
slap that girl over sale items?

337
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,416
Damn. Just like Iron Man
fighting Captain America.

338
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,916
This is the most important match for him.

339
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,916
To move up to another level,
we need a good plan.

340
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,833
Jay.

341
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,666
Can you take this too?

342
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,208
Thanks.

343
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,500
I want to make it as smooth as possible.

344
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,833
Kao, our favorite ice cream shop…

345
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:34,833
Oh.

346
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,500
That's right.

347
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,125
Our favorite ice cream shop

348
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,875
opened a new shop around here.

349
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,291
I'm so happy.

350
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,458
POWER OF ATTORNEY
MR. PHUKAO BINKRAI

351
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,875
Because he trusts me,

352
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,291
I want to do the best I can.

353
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:04,375
His smile

354
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,041
still always gives me happiness.

355
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,791
Caterpillars.

356
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,541
Damn it.

357
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:25,083
I know how he gets that 0.001 sec faster.

358
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,208
So, I have to be as silent as possible.

359
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,208
Oh, she stopped.

360
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,208
Probably nothing.

361
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,625
I once wanted to go to America.

362
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,250
It should be good.

363
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,708
Actually, I don't like cold weather.

364
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,041
But I heard it isn't that cold over there.

365
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,708
Anything,

366
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,458
as long as we're together.

367
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,250
If we love something,

368
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,500
it should take us somewhere nice.

369
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,541
Hello. Do you ever buy stuff
you didn't need,

370
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,000
but still buy it anyway?

371
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,125
What is it?

372
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,958
You found a shirt at 70% off, huh?

373
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,958
Don't stress yourself out.

374
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:50,458
I'd buy it too.

375
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,833
You're quiet.
I don't think it's a shirt anymore.

376
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,333
What did you buy?

377
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,666
I found it so cute.

378
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,333
I couldn't help it, so I bought them all.

379
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,708
I have no idea why.

380
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:19,375
Now, kids' stuff
on Facebook Ads keep popping up.

381
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,000
Who the hell knows where they come from?

382
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:21,958
Jay.

383
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,625
You can trick anyone,

384
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,291
but you can't trick Mark.

385
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:32,250
Actually, I'm not surprised at all.

386
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:36,125
You love taking care of your plants,
your boyfriend.

387
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,208
You love anything and everything.

388
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,166
You're such a mother.
You were born to be one.

389
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,375
Don't you know yourself?

390
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,958
Hey.

391
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,666
You're already 30.

392
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,583
What you want or don't want,

393
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,083
you need to talk about it.

394
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,333
Isn't it being dramatic?

395
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,000
It is.

396
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,458
But shouldn't he hear your side?

397
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,125
But if I tell him, he'll lose his focus.

398
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,458
He'll play slower.

399
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,083
Then how would I be happy?

400
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,416
Jay.

401
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,416
You're kind to everyone.

402
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,583
Don't forget to be kind to yourself too.

403
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,875
Stop doing a voice-over to soothe yourself

404
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,666
when you're unhappy.

405
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,833
From my experience,

406
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,875
hurry up and do whatever it is you want.

407
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,625
Our ovaries aren't very kind to us.

408
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,000
Every hour,

409
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,291
an egg disappears.

410
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,458
There's still time, right?

411
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,500
You won't be born, kiddos.

412
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,708
SPORT STACKING STORE
AND SCHOOL OF THAILAND

413
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:09,958
See? Tearing down the wall
of 4.7 seconds isn't easy.

414
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,958
But it's not that you, you,
or you can't do it.

415
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,333
I know that teaching you guys

416
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,291
is like producing weapons
to backfire on me, right?

417
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,125
But I'm more than happy to teach you.

418
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,125
So, the first rule
I'm going to teach everyone is,

419
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,291
listen really carefully,

420
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:29,000
sport stacking is a sport using
the measurement of seconds

421
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,916
according to your speed.

422
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,125
It has nothing to do with your age.

423
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,708
There is no concept of child or adult,

424
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,375
senior or junior.

425
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,333
That's great.

426
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,375
Kao, bruh.

427
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,000
Pai-Liu, right?

428
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,750
Great. That's great.

429
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:10,708
Everyone listen up.

430
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,583
This is an example
of burning determination.

431
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,625
Great.

432
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm ready to spend all the time in my life

433
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,333
to take you down.

434
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,125
Great!

435
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,000
Of course, great. Kao, bruh.

436
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,250
Is…

437
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,833
is this your child?

438
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,583
Media really influences the youth.

439
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:35,125
I won't allow her
to watch John Wick anymore.

440
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't blame the media, ma'am.

441
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,791
I've transferred you
the money for the class.

442
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,875
Tell Jay to check it.

443
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,291
So?

444
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,958
We'll have to say goodbye soon, huh?

445
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,041
Be patient, Por.

446
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,166
We have another two months.

447
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,458
The tables of the game can turn anytime.

448
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,583
I'll still have to practice more
when I get home.

449
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:58,500
You've been playing for so long
and still can't break 4.7.

450
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,208
There are only two months left.

451
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,291
I bet that you will win.

452
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,750
I'm opening a betting pool.

453
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,125
Dude, you never know.

454
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,416
This time I'm playing
against kids around the world.

455
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,083
Who knows how many kids
are practicing while I'm sleeping.

456
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:15,250
Result speculation
is my special ability, you know.

457
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,041
You'll shudder if the tables turn.

458
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,250
All right. The tables have turned.

459
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,250
You're not the world's fastest anymore.

460
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,333
4.699.

461
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,166
You've got two more months left.

462
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,291
Edward D. Deluza.

463
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,250
A 10-year-old Colombian.

464
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,458
His dad works in logistics.

465
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,791
His mom is Nigerian.

466
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,625
She owns a big orchard.

467
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,791
He has never competed officially

468
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:10,083
because he started playing sport stacking
just last year.

469
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:14,041
But as of late,
his speed has been picking up

470
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,958
because it's summer break there

471
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,458
and he's at home all day.

472
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,208
So, with every second that passes,

473
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,541
Edward is able
to develop himself all the time.

474
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,291
What's his house like? Lots of plants?

475
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,791
A cottage in a forest in Colombia.

476
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,291
It must be a community,
very festive and loud music.

477
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,541
Silence starts at 2:00 p.m.
Hits the sack at 9:00 p.m.

478
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,916
Damn, and what about nutrition?

479
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,125
Mineral water from the mountains.
Fresh plums from his garden.

480
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,083
What about sleep?

481
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,458
Nine to eleven hours per day,
all supervised by his mom.

482
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,083
But what worries me the most is…

483
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,041
he'll never have back pain.

484
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,833
Damn terrifying.

485
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,333
The power of teenagers.

486
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,666
And, I want to tell you

487
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,416
that his idol…

488
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:58,833
is you.

489
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,166
Even if he's my fan or a groupie,

490
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,541
I can't let him win.

491
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,625
Remember…

492
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,500
-Hey.
-What?

493
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,125
Could you spare some time?
I want to ask you something.

494
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,625
-Is it important?
-It is.

495
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,458
Is it important enough to wait a minute?

496
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,875
I'm not ready to listen now.

497
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,708
-What if it's not important?
-What?

498
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,000
If it's not, then let's talk later, okay?

499
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,333
Well, right now,

500
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,041
my record of 4.7 seconds has been broken.

501
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,791
And the one who broke it wasn't me.

502
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,250
The five seconds we're spending now
is terribly long already.

503
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:58,041
If there's anything that needs to be done,
you can go ahead and do it.

504
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,583
I trust you.

505
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,833
Just choose what you think is best.
Thank you.

506
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:25,916
The next level.

507
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:28,250
I'll take care of it for you.

508
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,708
In the best way.

509
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,208
Just 0.002 apart.

510
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,750
Upgrading his level this time

511
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,166
will be the most critical for him.

512
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,583
But he will have to overcome it.

513
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
This is the best way for the both of us.

514
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,208
The two of us
will upgrade our levels together.

515
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,875
Jay, don't shower now.

516
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,166
Jay, the pump is noisy.

517
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,708
They're empty.

518
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,250
No one has filled them up.

519
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,416
I can't.

520
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,500
I can't let drama into my life now.

521
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,916
You can stay at my place
for as long as you want.

522
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
No worries.

523
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:33,833
You're acting like you've left
your eight-year-old at home alone.

524
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,500
Come on, Jay.

525
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,625
Concentrate, will you?

526
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,250
Focus on your goal.

527
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,916
If not, you won't be able to continue.

528
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,208
You did the right thing.

529
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,750
Letting go of your hand
is the quickest way he'll learn.

530
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:04,958
He's about to bow down to the pump.

531
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,708
Por, I'm doomed.

532
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:11,833
What happened?

533
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,500
The pump is running nonstop.
It's also heating up.

534
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,333
-Jesus, where is Jay?
-She's gone.

535
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,541
Gone? Gone where?

536
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,833
I don't know. I can't know right now.
If I do, my speed will surely drop.

537
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:22,250
What should I do? The pump's been like…

538
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,208
Hey! Calm down.

539
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,583
-Did she take your favorite stack cups?
-No.

540
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,166
Did she take your hands?

541
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,541
-No.
-And did she take your house?

542
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,083
Well, see?

543
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,791
Okay? You can keep playing, right?

544
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,000
Calm down.

545
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,166
Every problem can be solved.
It must start with yourself.

546
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,750
What are you talking about?
It sounds familiar.

547
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,666
Okay. Let's do this.

548
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,291
Try turning off the main water valve.

549
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,083
Shit. This is The Da Vinci Code.

550
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:09,250
Okay, whatever. No need to fix it.
Go buy a new one.

551
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,125
I want to buy a water pump.

552
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,541
What kind, sir?

553
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,125
Inverter or non-inverter?

554
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,625
What do you mean?

555
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:25,041
An inverter pump is different from
the normal ones mainly in two ways.

556
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,208
It saves electricity.

557
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,291
It uses up 35% to 55% less electricity.

558
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,708
The inverter system
is able to control and adjust

559
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,083
the motor speed
to be compatible with output needs,

560
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:35,541
so it uses less electricity.

561
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:38,875
What do you mean?

562
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,125
Then you need Summai, sir.

563
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,583
I'll take you to the cashier.

564
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:43,291
Do you need a company invoice?

565
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,500
SUMMAI AUTOMATIC WATER PUMP
BEYOND IMAGINATION POWER

566
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,791
You're closing the sale too fast,

567
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,958
I don't trust you.

568
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,916
Siraya.

569
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,500
Come over here.

570
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,916
Come and explain to him.

571
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,250
Kind sir.

572
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,333
Let's talk, one friend to another, okay?

573
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:05,708
Don't think of me as a sales rep.

574
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,333
Actually, the motors inside
are all the same.

575
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,041
Other brands
only have a one-year warranty.

576
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,750
But Summai gives you five years.

577
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,541
If you buy it right now,

578
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,291
I will give you a great deal.

579
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,166
I'll give you an employee discount.

580
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,666
If you leave the pump
to heat over a long time,

581
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,333
it might start a fire, sir.

582
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,833
Well, it's up to you, kind sir.

583
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,291
In the water pump universe,

584
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,083
I'm just a virgin newbie.

585
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,875
This is my speed when my head's
flooded with pump reviews

586
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,333
and the slyness of the sales reps

587
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:56,791
who only think of gaining profit

588
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,375
without thinking of the consumer.

589
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,125
Summai is good.

590
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:05,916
Summai is bad.

591
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,875
Summai is good.

592
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Summai is bad.

593
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:10,833
Summai is good. Summai is bad.

594
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,000
Summai is good. Summai is bad.

595
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,041
Summai is good. Summai is bad.

596
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,375
Summai is so-so. Oh?

597
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:15,291
Summai is good. Summai is bad.

598
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,208
Summai is good. Summai is bad.

599
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,666
At a certain point, you will realize

600
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,333
that you're just a worthless Gen Y.

601
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:30,041
The speed you got is just virtual speed

602
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:34,125
like a dream
at a retirement home at 4:00 p.m.

603
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,791
Summai is good. Summai is bad. Summai… 

604
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,666
So, does it need to be
inverter or non-inverter?

605
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,750
And this brand, Summai, can I trust it?

606
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,083
I give in.

607
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,916
I give in to everything, Jay.

608
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,875
Whatever you want to rant about,
just do it.

609
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,958
You're going to listen, right?

610
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,125
I don't want to go to America.
I want to have--

611
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,041
Stop!

612
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,500
The caption is savage.
Let's not click "see more."

613
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:18,875
Hey.

614
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,083
Are you being sarcastic?

615
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm not being sarcastic.

616
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,166
GOAT.

617
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,583
She closes all doors like this.

618
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,541
This is clearly a war with God.

619
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,416
I'm furious.

620
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,666
My ears are red.

621
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,750
My foot keeps shaking.

622
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,875
Farang, why are you so cheeky?

623
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,583
Farang knows what I'm like
and still does this to me?

624
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:51,916
Farang knows my weaknesses.

625
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,750
Farang knows even if I don't listen,
when I go home, I still can't play.

626
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,875
Farang, Farang, Farang…

627
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:03,916
-I don't want to go to America.
-Stop!

628
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,250
-I don't wanna…
-Stop!

629
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,583
Don't you see?

630
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,500
Go away.

631
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,750
Damn it.

632
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,250
Couldn't jot down any shit.

633
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,291
What? You've never seen people fight?

634
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:24,125
In the world of sport stacking,

635
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:25,916
we still need many players.

636
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,500
I can't allow Jay to monopolize me.

637
00:43:30,916 --> 00:43:31,750
Oom-Im.

638
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:35,041
You know how to do housework?
Want some extra money?

639
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,750
This question is against child labor laws.

640
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,416
-What's your name?
-What?

641
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,916
Wha… Stop!

642
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,000
-What's your name?
-Metal.

643
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,666
-What can you do?
-Everything.

644
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,958
See, it's making noise.
And not only that--

645
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,041
Stop making a fuss.

646
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:24,708
Keep still…

647
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,416
and listen.

648
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,000
It's not the pump that's broken.

649
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,958
It's the sprinkler.

650
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,375
Who are you?

651
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:09,625
Here,

652
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,208
I might be just an ordinary housekeeper.

653
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,916
But in my village,

654
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,083
everyone always calls me

655
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,583
the "Ancient One of Utilities."

656
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,500
I'm going to survive.

657
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,791
Metal, I choose you.

658
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:24,833
I'll leave it to you.

659
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,083
Edward.

660
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,500
I guarantee I'll make Liam proud.

661
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,875
The left ovary has…

662
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,041
eight eggs.

663
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,458
The right side has seven.

664
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,625
A total of 15.

665
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:11,875
Thank you so much, Doctor.

666
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,375
You're welcome.

667
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,583
Hello.

668
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:19,916
Hello.

669
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,125
You still have some eggs left.

670
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,791
Your visit has come at a good time.

671
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,791
The older you get,

672
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,541
the less they are

673
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:36,250
both in quantity and quality of the eggs.

674
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,958
Here's a brochure.

675
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,791
The expenses in harvesting the eggs
are 180,000 to 200,000 baht.

676
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,500
And another 40,000 annually.

677
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,375
One more advanced step is

678
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,458
some people want to have kids,

679
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,291
but don't want a husband.

680
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,833
They fly to Europe

681
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:02,125
to buy sperm from a sperm bank there.

682
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,666
You can do that too.

683
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,333
The next level.

684
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,916
Breakfast is served.

685
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:43,666
Shit.

686
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,666
It tastes better than Jay's.

687
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,125
Metal, remember this.

688
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:55,333
Presidents come and go,
but the Supreme Court goes on forever.

689
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,416
Okay.

690
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,083
Mr. Kao.

691
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,250
I think…

692
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,125
to be even more complete,

693
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,958
you should have a driver.

694
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,750
It will be easier for you
when you go teaching.

695
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,625
Really?

696
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,041
And an English tutor.

697
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,250
So you have a better accent
when you go there.

698
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:28,958
Great strategy.

699
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,208
Well thought out.

700
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:31,916
You're much more than a maid.

701
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,416
Go get them.

702
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,458
I'm Kang.

703
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,041
I'm good at driving.

704
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,041
I know all the directions.

705
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,875
I'm Woo. I graduated from UCLA.

706
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,375
Please let me help.

707
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,666
I don't need Jay anymore.

708
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,958
Is Jay the old maid?

709
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,083
I'm allergic to cow's milk.
Why didn't you tell me?

710
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:03,833
Bully?

711
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,125
Really?

712
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,250
Jay.

713
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,875
Can you not leave me?

714
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,958
Even if I don't leave you,

715
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:35,833
if you win and go to America,
you'd still have to leave me anyway.

716
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,583
I'll help you for the last time.

717
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:47,000
I'll waste a bit of your time,

718
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,625
but I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

719
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:51,583
After this,

720
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:54,250
no matter where you are, you will survive.

721
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,791
When it's done,
we'll go our separate ways.

722
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,250
Which one isn't cow's milk?

723
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,791
Ask someone else.

724
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,291
Pretend I'm not here.

725
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:59,875
Uh, excuse me.

726
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,041
Well, I…

727
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:06,583
I can't drink cow's milk.

728
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,375
I'm not sure which one I have to buy.

729
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,833
If you can't drink cow's milk,

730
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,375
why not try drinking buffalo milk?

731
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,708
Are you making fun of me?

732
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:18,208
BUFFALO MILK

733
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:31,833
What are you filming?

734
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,625
An elementary school kid
learning how to buy milk.

735
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,166
Did you put the hair here on purpose?

736
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,000
Huh? There's…

737
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,458
Normally, there isn't any hair
clogging the drain.

738
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:49,666
You're exaggerating.

739
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,375
Have you ever noticed anything?

740
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,291
Get to it.

741
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,833
Shit.

742
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,875
Feels like a coming of age.

743
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,791
Wow.

744
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,708
Respect.

745
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,250
You used your hand.

746
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,166
I just use my foot.

747
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:21,000
Why…

748
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,291
didn't…

749
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,208
you…

750
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:24,458
tell me?

751
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,875
Is it normal to get a sore neck
while washing the dishes?

752
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:32,875
Yes.

753
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,125
But if you get yourself a step stool
and rest one foot on it, it helps.

754
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:40,583
Is it normal to get back pain
while doing laundry?

755
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:42,291
Yes.

756
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,916
But?

757
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:47,291
But if you don't let it pile up
and do the laundry often, it won't ache.

758
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,208
Is it normal to get shoulder pain
while hanging clothes?

759
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,208
Yes.

760
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:54,625
But?

761
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,041
But you have to endure it.

762
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,250
Tell me when you're done,

763
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,500
and I'll come up for a nap.

764
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,208
Hey.

765
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,375
Are you the old housekeeper?

766
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,583
But you know, right?

767
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,208
I'm the current one.

768
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,416
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

769
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,666
Hello, Miss.

770
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:41,250
Metal, help me!

771
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,208
Just shut up and do it.

772
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,416
Isn't the weather lovely today?

773
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,708
Who are you?

774
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,125
What's with all these people?

775
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:52,041
This is the driver.

776
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,416
This is the English tutor.

777
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

778
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,708
You brought your relatives here to work?

779
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,458
Do I look Korean?

780
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,375
Let's just say,

781
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,583
no need.

782
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:06,333
The two of you
don't have to come back anymore.

783
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:08,291
Mr. Kang!

784
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,833
Mr. Kang, Mr. Woo, don't leave me!

785
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:11,750
I love you!

786
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,458
You've got to do it now.

787
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:27,125
-Hey, are you crazy?
-Don't you see?

788
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:28,333
Jay.

789
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:31,000
-I'm scared. What if I pee myself tonight?
-Stop fighting!

790
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,000
Let me help.

791
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,500
This isn't the kind of help I needed!
Have you switched sides?

792
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,750
Jay, I can't fry it. It's hot.

793
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,416
-Please.
-You can't do that?

794
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:44,500
It's about to burn.
If it's overcooked, it won't taste good.

795
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,833
I can eat overcooked eggs.
And I don't have to eat any now!

796
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:52,250
This is the hardest.

797
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,166
Hey.

798
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,250
Normally, there isn't any dust, right?

799
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,125
There's me, so there's no dust.

800
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,958
Why is this world full of dust
like being in a time loop?

801
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,541
Why is it never-ending?

802
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,583
Dusting out the niche
builds up your tolerance tenfold.

803
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:54,750
Keep doing it.

804
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,291
I'll have to tell you about bed bugs.

805
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,875
America also has them.

806
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,250
What's wrong?

807
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,583
I told you to water the plants every day.
Why couldn't you do it?

808
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,333
Hey, just…

809
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,875
calm down.

810
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:57,833
I…

811
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,416
You scared me.

812
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,833
I thought something happened.

813
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,250
We can buy new ones.

814
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,333
It's just dead plants.

815
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:12,833
When I love something,

816
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,250
I don't let it die.

817
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,000
Didn't you know?

818
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,041
Every plant that I've taken care of,

819
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,375
none of them have ever died.

820
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,041
I'm telling you,

821
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:29,583
if I could've taken them all,
I would've done so.

822
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,416
I wouldn't leave them like this.

823
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,291
I won't let the plants die anymore.
I promise.

824
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:12,000
This one uses two parts soil,
one part sand.

825
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,166
I don't like sand.

826
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,333
It's coarse,

827
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,708
rough, irritating,

828
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:23,208
and it gets everywhere.

829
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,125
Do you think I like it?

830
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:30,666
Fair enough.

831
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:56,041
Pao's Gas Shop, 088-979-7851.

832
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,375
The Rescue Foundation…

833
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,291
1418.

834
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,625
What the hell?

835
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,750
If I die, am I supposed
to call the rescue team myself?

836
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:10,916
It's not like that.

837
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,250
Just in case,
like if a snake comes into the house,

838
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,625
they can take care of it.

839
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:19,375
If you finish this course, you won't die.

840
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:22,208
Living in either America or Venezuela,
you'll survive.

841
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,583
As for the other stuff,
I'll jot it down for you.

842
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,541
A whole week has gone by.

843
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,833
Are you the only one who lost a week?

844
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,583
Your back aches, right?

845
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,166
Want me to stick a pain relief patch on?

846
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:03,625
Well…

847
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:04,708
That'd be nice.

848
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,708
Thanks.

849
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,791
Well, when you do these chores,

850
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,208
do you ache a lot?

851
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,291
Yes.

852
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:29,875
And…

853
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,125
what did you do?

854
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,791
Nothing. It's normal to ache.

855
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,833
Sticking the pain relief patch on the back

856
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,375
can't be done alone, right?

857
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,750
Some things in life can't be done alone.

858
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,166
Now I know.

859
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,416
She's mad because
she has to do the chores all by herself.

860
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,666
That "Break 4.7 without me
is cooler" thing is just an excuse.

861
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,666
"I don't want to go to America." Nonsense.

862
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,666
Anyway, I'll use this chance
to save everything.

863
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:11,666
Jay, I'm sorry.

864
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,333
I'm the one who told you

865
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,875
to let me know
if you need help with anything.

866
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,916
But…

867
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,458
in the end, I'm the one who forgot.

868
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:30,166
If there's anything
you want me to help with,

869
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,666
feel free to tell me.

870
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,291
Here, sign this.

871
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,166
It needs two signatures.
Then I can take care of the rest.

872
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,500
Sign? Sign where?

873
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,458
Aren't you going to read it first?

874
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,041
It's okay. I'll sign it now.

875
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,291
So you don't tire yourself
trying to get me.

876
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,958
It will make your life more convenient.

877
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:54,000
I want to help you out.

878
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,083
Read it.

879
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:56,625
These documents,

880
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,541
no matter how close we are,
you need to read them.

881
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,208
Fine.

882
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,666
POWER OF ATTORNEY

883
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:10,208
TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO SELL PROPERTY

884
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:11,875
AND THE BUILDINGS ON IT.

885
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,166
Which house are we selling?

886
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,125
This house.

887
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,208
Hey…

888
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:25,458
Are you selling it because you're mad?

889
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,416
I'm not mad.

890
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:39,833
I'm not a smart man,

891
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,875
but I know what mad is.

892
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:43,458
I thought you were going to help.

893
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,250
Hold on…

894
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,291
So…

895
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:52,000
This isn't just about you
not wanting to go to America, right?

896
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,416
Just the tip of it,
and you've already struggled like this.

897
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,666
You don't want to know the rest of it.

898
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,000
It's good that you stopped me there.

899
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,625
-It's nothing you can do.
-How do you know I can't do anything?

900
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:26,333
Okay, I give in.

901
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,333
I will give up sport stacking then.

902
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,166
I won't go to America either.

903
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:34,791
I choose you.

904
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,375
You can't just quit like this.

905
01:06:40,666 --> 01:06:42,916
I've been with you for ten years.

906
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,541
I won't let it end like this. Understand?

907
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,541
If you quit now,

908
01:06:48,625 --> 01:06:50,625
all of this would be a waste
of both of our time.

909
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,708
Oh, I get it.

910
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,083
The reason you're closing all doors is…

911
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,625
because you want to break up.

912
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,333
Actually, you can just tell me
you don't love me.

913
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:10,583
Then…

914
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,375
I'm going to finish what I said that day.

915
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:20,000
I don’t want to go to America.

916
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,583
I want to stay here.

917
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,208
I want to have a home.
I want to have a child.

918
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,375
Can you do that?

919
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Explain…

920
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,541
I… I don't get it.

921
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,875
If you have a kid, you'll have back pain.

922
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,833
When sport stacking,
you also have back pain.

923
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:44,833
I've never asked you to explain
why you like sport stacking.

924
01:07:44,916 --> 01:07:46,833
I see that you're happy and I get it.

925
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:49,750
So, is this really your dream?

926
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:51,958
Is that really it?

927
01:07:52,041 --> 01:07:52,916
Yes.

928
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,500
Well,

929
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:59,208
people can have plain,
ordinary dreams, can't they?

930
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,458
Then…

931
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,000
let's do it…

932
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,375
If you want to have kids…

933
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,708
we can't do it the normal way.

934
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,416
There are special positions.
The timing must be right.

935
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,750
Babies aren't conceived in two seconds.

936
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,125
Don't say stupid things.

937
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,083
If you ask me

938
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,291
what I want you to help me with…

939
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,916
I want you to compete and win.

940
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,875
And let me go.

941
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,958
It's not easy, I understand.

942
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,125
I also think it's not easy.

943
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,250
Look at this.

944
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,833
You don't need to sign it.

945
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,458
Why bother burning it?

946
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,125
I'm…

947
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,375
not…

948
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:29,541
selling.

949
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:40,458
At first, I thought I'd do it
the right way.

950
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,666
You forgot, didn't you?

951
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,583
You left everything up to me.

952
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,833
Oh…

953
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,416
Damn!

954
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,916
Jay! Come back!

955
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,916
Fire!

956
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,333
What should I do?

957
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,250
Jay!

958
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,083
Whoa.

959
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,208
Actually, this situation is good.

960
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:20,625
It ended well.

961
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,166
What do you mean?

962
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,208
It's a damn mess.

963
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,625
If you think about it,
the situation is good.

964
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:27,916
It ended well.

965
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,125
What do you mean? It's a damn mess.

966
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:31,375
If he won't let you sell it,

967
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,875
then it means he loves you.

968
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:35,125
Otherwise,
why would he stretch things out?

969
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,166
If she wants to sell it,
then it means she loves you.

970
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,500
I think this is such a beautiful breakup.

971
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,958
Very mature. I like it.

972
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:45,291
Stretching it out is a waste of time.

973
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:48,583
I think you should get back to practicing.

974
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:52,208
I think you should
get back together with him.

975
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:55,625
URGENT SALE

976
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:58,500
When did you announce the sale?

977
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,833
When you were convincing me.

978
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:04,375
That's quick.

979
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:09,291
This way.

980
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:12,500
The atmosphere here is nice too.

981
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,666
There are a lot of trees.

982
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,916
-Umm.
-Okay.

983
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,916
Lots of big trees.

984
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,083
Nice.

985
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,333
Will the neighbors complain
if we play music?

986
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:26,208
NOT FOR SALE

987
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,916
Right now, it's on the market.

988
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,333
-Okay.
-I wasn't sure at first

989
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:38,416
and a lot of people kept calling, so…

990
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,708
-Come in.
-Uh-huh.

991
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,958
I really like the common facilities here.

992
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:48,333
The gym is big and not many people use it.

993
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:26,000
You really are slow.

994
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:35,875
I believe the missing 0.2 seconds,

995
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,833
are gone because you're missing her.

996
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,083
Can't you multitask?

997
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,583
I'm probably not good enough.

998
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,583
I'm just saying.

999
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,750
If you're any slower than this,

1000
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,083
you'll run out of time.

1001
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:19,708
Never mind.

1002
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,458
I'm going to lose anyway.

1003
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,125
-I'm past my prime.
-Hey!

1004
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,416
You…

1005
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,416
must…

1006
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,333
win.

1007
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:39,083
Why do you believe in me so much?

1008
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,166
Do you know how painful it is

1009
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:50,833
when I tell people what I do for a living
and they laugh?

1010
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:58,000
Every time I ask
for airfare sponsors for you,

1011
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:59,375
they never help out

1012
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:02,416
because they don't believe
it's an actual sport.

1013
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,375
Liar.

1014
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,250
I know you're working here
because it's an easy job.

1015
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,625
I see that you just trade stocks
and resell stuff online.

1016
01:14:10,708 --> 01:14:11,916
Tell me the real reason.

1017
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,875
I made a bet with Oom-Im's mom for 50,000.

1018
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:17,041
When you said you bet that I would win,

1019
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,458
it was a real bet, wasn't it?

1020
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,625
I thought you would win.

1021
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,083
So, I put in everything on you.

1022
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:22,791
I knew it.

1023
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,458
That's why you're really pushing me.

1024
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,041
But in the deepest corner of my heart,

1025
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,791
I really want you to win!

1026
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:33,916
All right.

1027
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,750
I'll practice more at home then.

1028
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:46,666
SALE

1029
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,000
Miss Jay said,

1030
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,625
"You want to mess with me?
We split the mortgage, remember?"

1031
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,041
Sir.

1032
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,208
Man.

1033
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:09,291
Is this really a sport stacking movie?

1034
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,750
I haven't gotten to practice yet.

1035
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,916
This must be half of the movie already.

1036
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,916
Stacking is only 20% of it.

1037
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,541
The trailer shows furious plays.

1038
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:19,875
There isn't any in the movie.

1039
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:23,375
I saw on Twitter
that people have anticipated it.

1040
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:25,708
And then there's the studio too.

1041
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,291
I promised them
there'd be action throughout the movie.

1042
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,958
Got kicked out of your house or what?

1043
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,583
No, I…

1044
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:57,416
I just want to come back and be with you.

1045
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,333
In case you need something, I can help.

1046
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:02,916
Take me to make
my annual merit-making tomorrow.

1047
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,083
Why are our daily lives
filled with all these routi…

1048
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:14,708
Where are you making merit?

1049
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,666
Up there.

1050
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,166
Can I wait here?

1051
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:25,166
It's up to you.

1052
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,708
In such critical times like this,
if I'm going to get through this,

1053
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:35,583
time management
is the best path to winning.

1054
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,000
Time management is over.

1055
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,708
Are you okay?

1056
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,333
Hey.

1057
01:17:13,416 --> 01:17:15,125
Why didn't you tell me about your leg?

1058
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:17,833
It's nothing much,
so why bother other people?

1059
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:20,541
Mom.

1060
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,416
If it hurts,
you don't have to go and make merit.

1061
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
What's the reason for it anyway?

1062
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,500
It's a total waste of time.

1063
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,916
The next life isn't real.

1064
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,166
You've been tricked.

1065
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,750
I'm not making merit for my next life.

1066
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,000
I'm making it for you.

1067
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:34,958
So you can play with your cups faster.

1068
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,291
This is the only way I can help you.

1069
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:41,916
I've devoted so much to raising you,
letting you play cups all day.

1070
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,250
If you're not the fastest,

1071
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:45,291
I won't let it go.

1072
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,166
Usually, I don't want
to take up your time,

1073
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,875
but this year,
I really can't do it on my own.

1074
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:59,333
Every year, Jay's the one who takes me.

1075
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,458
But this year, I couldn't reach her.

1076
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:03,083
She must be busy, I guess.

1077
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:15,500
From now on,
if you need anything, just tell me.

1078
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,166
I'm free.

1079
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,208
Okay.

1080
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,333
Careful.

1081
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,041
After this, let's go straight home.

1082
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,333
Home?

1083
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:36,291
After we're done, we'll go home, right?

1084
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:39,333
What? This is the first temple,
there's another eight left.

1085
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:41,291
-Huh?
-Huh, what?

1086
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,666
I thought you said you were free.

1087
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,916
MY NECK HURTS WHILE WASHING DISHES.
ANY SOLUTIONS?

1088
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:20,166
NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D ASK THIS QUESTION.
PRACTICING TO BE A HOUSEWIFE?

1089
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:27,875
VISITING THE BANK BEFORE A LONG WEEKEND,
A WHOLE DAY'S GONE.

1090
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:39,000
RENTING YAM'S KIDS TO PLAY WITH FOR A DAY.

1091
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,458
IT'S NOT HARD TO HAVE A BABY.
GIVE IT A TRY.

1092
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:45,375
HERE'S THE DETAIL OF THE CLINIC
WHERE I DID THE EGG FREEZING

1093
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:47,208
YOU NEED TO HURRY.
NO EGG AND YOU HAVE NO CHILD

1094
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:17,375
WRITE THE NUMBER IN THE EMPTY BOX

1095
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,583
Antoine, what are you doing, son?

1096
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,416
I'm doing my homework and waiting for Mom.

1097
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:33,750
Can you do it?

1098
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,625
You've been sitting here
for some time now.

1099
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,916
I can't do it.

1100
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:43,375
All right.

1101
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,000
I'll…

1102
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,583
I'll teach you.

1103
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:48,333
It's not hard.

1104
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,500
Try again, five times one?

1105
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,000
-Five.
-Five times two?

1106
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,458
-Ten.
-Five times three?

1107
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,375
-Fifteen.
-Five times four?

1108
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,291
Twenty.

1109
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,833
What's five times five, son?
How many times do I need to ask?

1110
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:18,583
If I knew, I'd tell you already!

1111
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:21,000
What the hell? It's so damn easy!

1112
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:22,750
I'll do it, punk.

1113
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:24,541
I mean… son.

1114
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:35,208
That's all. Like I said, it's easy.

1115
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,500
Although…

1116
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:49,458
I might be stupid…

1117
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,583
I might be slow,

1118
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,916
thank you

1119
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,000
for trying to teach me.

1120
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,458
It reminds me of the time…

1121
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,500
when my dad used to be around.

1122
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,750
He helped me with my homework every day.

1123
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:15,291
But now…

1124
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,333
there isn't anything like that anymore.

1125
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,750
Thank you so much.

1126
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:35,041
Let's have a look.

1127
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:37,791
-Wow, this room is really nice.
-Right.

1128
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,166
-Look, that's awesome.
-That's right.

1129
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,166
-It's really beautiful.
-So beautiful.

1130
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:43,458
What do you think?

1131
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,333
The dressing room is to your liking.

1132
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,833
It's humongous!

1133
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,416
It should be big enough for your closet.

1134
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:55,000
-Let's check out the sports club next.
-All right.

1135
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,041
Jay.

1136
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:15,833
I'll…

1137
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:18,375
I'll help sell the house too.

1138
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,291
I already tried. I…

1139
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:33,875
I'm sorry.

1140
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,875
I really just can't do it.

1141
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:38,291
When you say "chill,"

1142
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:40,625
you can't really chill, believe me.

1143
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,666
Hey.

1144
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,916
Just a sec, Mom…

1145
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:52,166
Mom wants me to move the car again.

1146
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,583
All right. Let's talk later.

1147
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,541
And this here…

1148
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:28,041
is the living room.

1149
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:30,083
It's…

1150
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:32,291
comfortable.

1151
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,250
There's a swimming pool outside.

1152
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,125
It's…

1153
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,666
nice and cool.

1154
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,583
There are lots of lights.

1155
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:49,541
They make everything bright.

1156
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:52,625
Sir! If that's all you're going to say,
how will you sell it?

1157
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:54,125
Tell them the details.

1158
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,500
The house has an app.

1159
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,708
-You have to do the hard sell.
-What app?

1160
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,708
A good house is one thing,

1161
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:03,125
but what's better is that here,
they have the Smart World app.

1162
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,666
If you want to pay the water bill,

1163
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:07,416
the electric bill, find a repairman,

1164
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,708
fix the pump, clean the air conditioner,

1165
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,250
do some gardening, receive your packages,

1166
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,000
e-stamp your parking cards,

1167
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,291
talk with the guards at the gate,

1168
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:17,916
look at the communal CCTV cameras,

1169
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,333
press the do not disturb button,

1170
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,958
or ask the neighbor to move their car…

1171
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,125
All this can be done through this app.

1172
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,000
Here.

1173
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,291
You have to try it.

1174
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,833
Try using it first.

1175
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,375
This…

1176
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:41,208
This room is the children's room.

1177
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,875
In case you have any in the future.

1178
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,791
Actually, this house is pretty big.

1179
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,666
Do you live here alone?

1180
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:51,875
Well, at first
I didn't plan to live alone.

1181
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,791
But in the end, I had to anyway.

1182
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:57,833
So, it really is too big.

1183
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:02,333
Dramatizing.

1184
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:05,000
How could you ask such a thing?

1185
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:10,250
Well, please have a look around first.

1186
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,250
This house is really great.

1187
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,208
But I don't like the garden.

1188
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,791
Then we can take it out.

1189
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,000
As for the swimming pool,

1190
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:38,500
we can fill it in.

1191
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:40,333
You're afraid of water, aren't you?

1192
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:41,875
Oh, you remember?

1193
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:42,958
You're so sweet.

1194
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:48,625
As for the kid's room,
we can tear it down.

1195
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:50,583
Aren't you going to sell things online?

1196
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:52,875
We can turn it into a storage room
or something.

1197
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,041
It's big.

1198
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,041
Can we change it into a toilet?

1199
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:57,416
I want a large one.

1200
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,833
It's called a bathroom or a shower room,

1201
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,083
not a toilet.

1202
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:15,083
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?

1203
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,291
-For what?
-To buy a house.

1204
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:17,708
-A new house?
-The same one.

1205
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:19,458
Are you high on something?
You're not making any sense.

1206
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:20,875
I'll tell you later.

1207
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,500
Stocks or crypto?

1208
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:23,625
Wait, what?

1209
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,916
If you choose crypto,

1210
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,958
you have to download a wallet first.

1211
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:29,291
After you download the wallet,
you have to fill up a form.

1212
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:31,166
It takes about three days.

1213
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,458
They might or might not accept it.

1214
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:36,375
You also have to choose how to pay,
either by credit or bank account.

1215
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,083
You have to pay VAT and tax.

1216
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,333
Choose your currency.

1217
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:40,500
Baht, pounds, US dollars, Aus--

1218
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:41,666
I think…

1219
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,833
I better go back
to practice to beat Edward.

1220
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,541
This is my speed

1221
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:56,000
when my head's filled
with all sorts of drama.

1222
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,583
Hey Edward,
don't you have anything else to do?

1223
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,875
The competition is all you think about.
I'm not free right now!

1224
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:18,166
This is how lonely this sport gets.

1225
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:21,666
If you're slow,

1226
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,250
no one can help you.

1227
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,333
Jay.

1228
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,416
Can you please wait for me?

1229
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,958
This room is 25.5 square meters, right?

1230
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,625
Yes, but we have lots of large windows.

1231
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,458
So it feels like 35.

1232
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:55,083
It's good for living alone.

1233
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,791
But you said that you might have a family.

1234
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:05,208
We have other choices for you.

1235
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:06,458
Let's take a look.

1236
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:14,916
That's all for today.

1237
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,791
Go home and practice a lot.

1238
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,291
The more you practice,

1239
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,375
the faster you'll get.

1240
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,833
But if you don't get any faster,

1241
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:31,541
it's fine.

1242
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:52,458
You're agitated, right?

1243
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:00,416
You're talking nonsense.

1244
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:02,750
Huh?

1245
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:04,875
How do you know?

1246
01:31:08,083 --> 01:31:09,875
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?

1247
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:10,833
-For what?
-To buy a house.

1248
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,375
-A new house?
-The same one.

1249
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:13,500
Are you high on something?

1250
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,583
I'll tell you later.

1251
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:15,583
Stocks or crypto?

1252
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:16,625
Wait, what?

1253
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:18,875
-You're nosy.
-I'm not.

1254
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:23,541
How do ordinary people get rich quickly?

1255
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:24,625
-For what?
-To buy a house.

1256
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:25,833
-A new house?
-The same one.

1257
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,000
You guys like to think that

1258
01:31:30,083 --> 01:31:31,416
those younger than you

1259
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,125
aren't interested in these things.

1260
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,750
Even if you're interested,
it doesn't mean you understand.

1261
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:10,041
Damn. The cold silent merciless stare,

1262
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:12,291
how focused must Pai-Liu be?

1263
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:14,083
She must have a warm family.
A dustless home.

1264
01:32:14,166 --> 01:32:15,916
A soundproof practice room.

1265
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,708
Enough sleep. A green yard.

1266
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,083
No drama.

1267
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:21,166
No love. And no boyfriend.

1268
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:23,208
I was seeing a few people.

1269
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,125
Is my voice-over too loud?

1270
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,583
You're so fast, why not compete?

1271
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:29,625
Competing isn't important to me.

1272
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:32,666
If you're good, there's no need to boast.

1273
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,291
I just show my friends.

1274
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:36,083
This answer is like
coming from a Jedi master,

1275
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,958
Li Mu Bai, Ip Man, Donnie Yen.

1276
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:40,041
You don't have to believe me.

1277
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:43,083
I just want to tell you

1278
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:45,666
there's still hope.

1279
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,041
Pai-Liu.

1280
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,833
Will you teach me
how to be as fast as you?

1281
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,500
When you speak with grown-ups,
look them in the eye.

1282
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:21,083
Will… Will you please teach me

1283
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:22,666
how to play as fast as you?

1284
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:28,041
Sure.

1285
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:44,041
Pai-Liu. Did you stop watching John Wick
and start watching Star Wars?

1286
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,000
Shut up.

1287
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:46,083
Listen up.

1288
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:47,458
You have only 15 days left.

1289
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:50,375
All right, the first thing
I'm going to teach…

1290
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,333
Damn it!

1291
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:53,500
Get out! I'm warning you!

1292
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:04,750
How can you lift the washing machine?

1293
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,291
I was doing the laundry and saw a snake.

1294
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:10,250
I was scared, so I ran out.

1295
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,500
Damn. I've only heard of people
escaping a fire with a fridge.

1296
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:15,166
The wonders of adrenaline.

1297
01:34:18,666 --> 01:34:19,958
Mr. Kao, just go back in.

1298
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:21,583
I'll find a way myself.

1299
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:22,875
It's my duty.

1300
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:25,166
-Let me take care of it.
-Sir, don't.

1301
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,291
It's dangerous.

1302
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:27,916
Don't waste your life on me.

1303
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,250
Call 1418, The Rescue Foundation.

1304
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,666
They have snake-catching services.

1305
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,083
Hello.

1306
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,000
Yes.

1307
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,791
A snake is in my house.

1308
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:37,500
Yes.

1309
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:39,583
I think it slithered in.

1310
01:34:39,666 --> 01:34:40,916
-I can't believe this.
-Yes.

1311
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,125
This is what's called growth.

1312
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:58,416
See, Pai-Liu.

1313
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:00,708
When you grow up,

1314
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,625
there will be lots of things
you have to think about.

1315
01:35:04,541 --> 01:35:07,458
Whether we have a competition or not,

1316
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:08,875
no one is interested.

1317
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,458
Drama pouring in all the time.

1318
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:13,083
Just look at today,

1319
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:14,875
a snake came into the house.

1320
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:17,916
It didn't bother to ask
what we were doing.

1321
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,458
But I couldn't ignore it either.

1322
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:25,041
Right now, I don't want to win alone.

1323
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:29,583
I want everyone around me
to win with me too.

1324
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,250
But do you know?

1325
01:35:33,083 --> 01:35:34,916
Ever since
I've been thinking about such things,

1326
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,541
I haven't become any faster.

1327
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:39,833
Do you know?

1328
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:43,708
What I'm going to teach you is

1329
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:47,000
even if it's only your hands
holding the cups,

1330
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:48,541
in this sport,

1331
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,541
we can play as a team.

1332
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:54,000
If you see others,

1333
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,041
then others will see you.

1334
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:58,583
Sometimes,

1335
01:35:58,666 --> 01:36:01,041
starting from yourself
might not be the answer.

1336
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:03,666
It must first start from a structure.

1337
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:06,500
Mr. Kao.

1338
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:09,416
Since you saved my life,

1339
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,500
I want to tell you

1340
01:36:10,583 --> 01:36:11,791
to go out there and fight for it.

1341
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:12,833
I'll be your defense,

1342
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,083
and I won't ask for overtime.

1343
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:18,791
I did some research
on getting a quick home loan.

1344
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,291
Here, I'll explain it to you.

1345
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:22,416
What's with all the people?

1346
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,291
Kao.

1347
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:27,541
The monk said you're down on your luck,
so I got this as a lucky charm.

1348
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,416
Right now,

1349
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,333
you have eight hands and four brains.

1350
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,375
Is that enough?

1351
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:38,541
I never knew before that my housekeeper…

1352
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:41,458
the school's manager…

1353
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:44,375
and a noodle shop owner…

1354
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:49,750
are really important players in my life
as a sport stacker all this time.

1355
01:36:52,416 --> 01:36:53,666
Everyone, thank you. Really.

1356
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:10,166
Metal, I don't have much time left.

1357
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,125
There are two weeks left
before the long weekend.

1358
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,541
And I don't believe it will be calm.

1359
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:17,083
So, while I'm in this room
and if something happens,

1360
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,833
I'm asking you to be the last defense.
Please block them for me.

1361
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:21,291
Yes, sir.

1362
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:22,666
Mom.

1363
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,375
Right now, I need a lot of blessings.

1364
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:26,375
-You have to go make merit for me.
-Sure.

1365
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:28,250
I'll go free some cows right now.

1366
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,250
As for Por…

1367
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:33,958
Please take my mom to free some cows.

1368
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:35,375
If I win this competition,

1369
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,416
I won't need to take out a home loan.

1370
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,666
When did you believe in this stuff?

1371
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,166
Whatever, I'll take anything right now.

1372
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:47,291
Now, can we start?

1373
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:52,208
Delivery!

1374
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:56,041
Damn, it's started.

1375
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,416
Keep on playing.

1376
01:37:58,041 --> 01:37:58,958
I'll take care of it.

1377
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,041
To the owner of 99/1, please attend
the homeowners' meeting.

1378
01:38:04,125 --> 01:38:05,541
Keep on playing.

1379
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,125
I'll go.

1380
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,208
Blackout.

1381
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,458
Damn, Metal hasn't returned.

1382
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,291
Sir. Hey.

1383
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:21,333
The lights went out.

1384
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,666
But the other houses are fine.

1385
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,666
What?

1386
01:38:27,708 --> 01:38:29,666
Did you pay the electric bill, sir?

1387
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,958
It's been three months!

1388
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:33,958
Damn it.

1389
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,833
I'd like to pay the electricity bill.

1390
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,291
If your electricity has been cut off,

1391
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,333
you have to pay it
at the Electricity Authority.

1392
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:46,333
I see.

1393
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:52,083
-I'd like to pay my electricity bill.
-Sure.

1394
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:56,291
The staff will turn on the electricity
before 6:00 p.m.

1395
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:58,166
-You have to wait briefly.
-Can it be at 5?

1396
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:00,458
I'm not sure. It's all up to the staff.

1397
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:01,625
Can it be at 5:15 p.m.?

1398
01:39:01,708 --> 01:39:03,083
It really is up to the staff.

1399
01:39:03,166 --> 01:39:04,833
-How about 5:17 p.m.?
-5:18 p.m. then.

1400
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:06,458
Wait a bit.

1401
01:39:08,583 --> 01:39:09,916
Man, a whole day's gone.

1402
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:18,333
Hello, Jay.

1403
01:39:19,708 --> 01:39:20,541
Kao.

1404
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,583
Today's the 28th already.

1405
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:27,291
Thanks for still worrying about me.

1406
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,958
But it's okay. I'm going to crush it.

1407
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,458
Even if I only have three days left,

1408
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:34,000
I will win it.

1409
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,375
No. What I meant was

1410
01:39:37,458 --> 01:39:39,833
you have to buy mutual funds
for a tax rebate.

1411
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:42,291
Today's the last day. Have you bought any?

1412
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:47,000
But today's only the 28th.

1413
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:48,583
The last day has to be the 31st.

1414
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:51,083
They close for New Year's
on the 29th this year.

1415
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:55,041
The tax revenue department
is faster than you think.

1416
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:57,833
Why does life hate me so much?

1417
01:39:57,916 --> 01:39:59,708
The bank is still open.

1418
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,750
You still have some time.

1419
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:08,875
Metal.

1420
01:40:09,458 --> 01:40:10,625
It's over.

1421
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:13,458
How can I make it?
There are only two hours left.

1422
01:40:16,583 --> 01:40:18,375
I won't let it end so easily.

1423
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,041
Let me help you.

1424
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:29,750
I buy LTF funds every year.

1425
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:32,000
I'll help out with it.

1426
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,041
Thank you.

1427
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,541
I want to buy mutual funds.

1428
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:47,208
There aren't any LTFs anymore
for this year.

1429
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,333
There's only SSF.

1430
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:52,458
It's a new fund that supports citizens
to make more long-term savings.

1431
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:53,791
-They can…
-Damn.

1432
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:55,208
Why does he look familiar?

1433
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:59,125
This is different from LTF,
which focuses only on Thai stocks.

1434
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:02,291
Oh, my god, there isn't any LTF?

1435
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:04,041
Damn it.

1436
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:08,041
Give me some recommendations.
I've come far. This is wasting my time.

1437
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:10,875
My recommendation is
to buy the funds on the app.

1438
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,791
There's still a lot to learn
about living, right?

1439
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:19,791
When your electricity gets cut off,
you can pay the bill via the app too.

1440
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,041
Number…

1441
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:36,791
Pai-Liu.

1442
01:41:36,875 --> 01:41:39,166
I think life is getting back at me.

1443
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:42,166
The more I try, the more it kicks back.

1444
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:50,375
Exceptional speed can't occur
in a normal environment, Kao.

1445
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:54,125
Creativity without boundaries

1446
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:55,791
comes from restrictions.

1447
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:59,416
Animals evolve by finding ways to survive.

1448
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,208
You don't need to comfort me.

1449
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:02,583
I'm really going to lose.

1450
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,166
Did you know,

1451
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:11,375
how I got…

1452
01:42:11,958 --> 01:42:13,500
that 3.876 seconds?

1453
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:18,583
In that clip,

1454
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:22,291
I was stacking
while my parents were fighting

1455
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,083
in the living room.

1456
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,791
They were going to get a divorce.

1457
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:28,791
That day,

1458
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:30,750
it was so freaking loud and chaotic.

1459
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:33,416
I was stressed out, but I kept playing.

1460
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:38,250
But that was
the only time I was that fast.

1461
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:42,666
Must you have so much grief
to gain that speed?

1462
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,208
Should I change sports?

1463
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:47,333
And now what?

1464
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:49,208
Do I need to find drama in my life?

1465
01:42:49,291 --> 01:42:50,916
Where am I going to find any at this time?

1466
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:54,750
Weren't you the one who told me

1467
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:58,666
adults always have drama in their lives?

1468
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:13,958
Honey, do you want that house?

1469
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:16,916
What do you think?

1470
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,916
Damn, I feel the drama.

1471
01:43:19,875 --> 01:43:21,333
I like it.

1472
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:22,416
Let's buy it.

1473
01:43:23,791 --> 01:43:24,750
Yes.

1474
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,458
Sure. It's nice enough.

1475
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,291
It's darker than the DC Universe.

1476
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:30,708
Great.

1477
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:32,750
That's the power source.

1478
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,083
It's too dark, Pai-Liu.

1479
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:37,750
I can't overcome it.

1480
01:43:37,833 --> 01:43:39,000
They're going to buy it.

1481
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,958
I can't feel my legs anymore.

1482
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:42,875
Don't be afraid.

1483
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:43,916
Get up.

1484
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:46,458
Your mom went to make merit for you.

1485
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:47,625
Did you forget?

1486
01:43:53,416 --> 01:43:55,416
It doesn't seem too superstitious, right?

1487
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,458
You're quite straightforward, eh?

1488
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:58,958
I don't know.

1489
01:43:59,041 --> 01:44:01,083
I just know I'm doing what I can do.

1490
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:02,458
Perhaps it will help.

1491
01:44:09,541 --> 01:44:11,708
We'd like to buy the life of a cow.

1492
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:14,750
Amen.

1493
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:16,083
Wait!

1494
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:18,791
Maybe we shouldn't buy it now.
The economy is bad.

1495
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:21,000
Even a better reason to buy.

1496
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:22,250
The price is really low.

1497
01:44:22,333 --> 01:44:24,291
It's like their house is burning.

1498
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:25,375
Let's buy it.

1499
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:27,291
True.

1500
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:28,458
You're right.

1501
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,500
Should we buy one more?

1502
01:44:31,583 --> 01:44:32,750
In case it's not enough.

1503
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,333
I think he'll need a lot.

1504
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,708
Excuse me, one more, please.

1505
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:41,458
Amen.

1506
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,083
Wait! But Mom once told me

1507
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:45,166
if it's not necessary, then don't buy it.

1508
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,083
Let's not.

1509
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:49,583
What are you worried about?
I'm the one paying for it.

1510
01:44:49,666 --> 01:44:50,500
I'll buy it for you.

1511
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,333
-Another one?
-Hello?

1512
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,541
Hello, Kao.

1513
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:03,666
Shall we go half each? I'm out of money.

1514
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:07,625
I'll take the house.

1515
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:11,208
I'll pay for it on the 4th
before my wife changes her mind.

1516
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:13,958
I don't know what's up with her.
She has mood swings lately,

1517
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:15,333
like she's been possessed.

1518
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:16,250
Oh, sure.

1519
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:18,166
Thank you.

1520
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:20,500
I'm really glad.

1521
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:23,041
Okay. See you then.

1522
01:45:23,125 --> 01:45:24,458
Bye.

1523
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:52,666
I just want to tell you

1524
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,375
that I sold the house already.

1525
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:57,083
They're going to pay upfront,

1526
01:45:57,166 --> 01:45:58,875
probably next week.

1527
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,625
I'm happy for you.

1528
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:09,333
So, we can really break up now.

1529
01:46:10,666 --> 01:46:12,458
At first, I thought
it'd be longer than this.

1530
01:46:14,291 --> 01:46:16,041
This is much sooner than I thought.

1531
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:26,125
I want to tell you…

1532
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:28,958
that…

1533
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:35,208
you can give them my number.

1534
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:36,875
I'll…

1535
01:46:36,958 --> 01:46:38,416
I'll take care of it.

1536
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:42,416
And the day
we have to go to the Land Office,

1537
01:46:42,958 --> 01:46:44,375
if you want to, come.

1538
01:46:44,458 --> 01:46:47,041
But if you're not free, then it's fine.

1539
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,500
It's coming…

1540
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:20,041
I can feel it.

1541
01:48:16,166 --> 01:48:17,541
Let the fire burn.

1542
01:48:28,458 --> 01:48:29,625
If you don't go any faster…

1543
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:36,458
your house will be sold for sure.

1544
01:51:15,208 --> 01:51:16,333
I'm happy for you.

1545
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:21,625
See?

1546
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,250
You can do it without me.

1547
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:35,583
Believe me.

1548
01:51:38,333 --> 01:51:40,541
I couldn't do it without you.

1549
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:55,041
I'm sorry for…

1550
01:51:57,541 --> 01:52:00,083
always stealing your time.

1551
01:52:02,041 --> 01:52:03,958
I don't know how to give it back.

1552
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,750
It's fine.

1553
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:16,833
No matter what,
it was a good time in my life.

1554
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:18,166
I don't regret it.

1555
01:52:56,708 --> 01:52:58,000
I'm sorry.

1556
01:52:59,708 --> 01:53:02,208
Before I got here…

1557
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,916
another person who came
to look at the house…

1558
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:06,916
had just paid for it.

1559
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:10,958
Which means…

1560
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:13,791
I'm not selling it to you, sir.

1561
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:21,083
Who bought it?

1562
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:28,583
What's wrong with you? Is that possible?

1563
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:35,666
Oh… I'm sorry.

1564
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,958
Can I have a word with you for a second?

1565
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:41,291
Please.

1566
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,500
Well…

1567
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:50,125
I'm really sorry.

1568
01:53:50,208 --> 01:53:52,750
I sold the house with my ex

1569
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:55,041
and there must have been
a miscommunication.

1570
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:56,541
-I--
-Honey.

1571
01:53:57,708 --> 01:53:58,958
I'm sorry.

1572
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,250
-This is a freaking waste of my time!
-I understand.

1573
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:03,125
Honey.

1574
01:54:14,583 --> 01:54:16,916
You have to teach me negotiation skills.

1575
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,458
It looks useful.

1576
01:54:23,708 --> 01:54:25,250
Let's go inside.

1577
01:54:25,333 --> 01:54:26,458
I'm ready to buy.

1578
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,750
It's too big for you to be living alone.

1579
01:54:44,833 --> 01:54:45,791
Trust me.

1580
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:48,583
Save your money and buy some other place.

1581
01:54:48,666 --> 01:54:50,541
Then you find one for me.

1582
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:54,083
Sure.

1583
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:55,583
What are you looking for?

1584
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:02,625
I want a house where

1585
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:04,625
the front door doesn't match the house.

1586
01:55:06,708 --> 01:55:09,416
The bedroom floor has a burn mark.

1587
01:55:11,166 --> 01:55:13,750
The bedroom smells like
pain relief patches.

1588
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:18,125
I want a house with plants

1589
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:20,083
that are in front of me
when I do sport stacking.

1590
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,875
I want a house that when I'm in there,

1591
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:26,208
it reminds me of when we were together.

1592
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:38,291
If you find one, I'll sell this one, okay?

1593
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:49,541
After today, we probably
won't see each other that much.

1594
01:55:50,291 --> 01:55:52,000
But if one day, you're tired,

1595
01:55:52,833 --> 01:55:53,916
or bored,

1596
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:56,500
you can always come to visit.

1597
01:55:57,791 --> 01:55:59,750
Don't think of it as my house.

1598
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:01,583
Just think of it…

1599
01:56:02,666 --> 01:56:04,083
as our home.

1600
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:10,666
Your house? Our home?

1601
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:11,750
What?

1602
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:12,791
I'm confused.

1603
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,166
Whatever. Just drop by sometime
when you're free, Farang.

1604
01:56:33,916 --> 01:56:34,833
Well…

1605
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:36,791
Before I leave,

1606
01:56:37,625 --> 01:56:40,333
I've been wanting to tell you this one
thing for a long time,

1607
01:56:40,416 --> 01:56:41,791
but I've never told you.

1608
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,708
But…

1609
01:56:44,791 --> 01:56:46,833
I think it's time.

1610
01:56:52,625 --> 01:56:54,291
-I also love you.
-You snore.

1611
01:56:57,666 --> 01:57:00,333
Sometimes it's so loud, I couldn't sleep.

1612
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,750
At first, I was afraid to tell you,

1613
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,958
but just in case you live with
someone else and you aren't aware of it.

1614
01:57:08,208 --> 01:57:10,291
Go see a doctor when you have time, okay?

1615
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,250
Can't we have a sentimental ending?

1616
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:15,666
-I think this is very sentimental.
-Sure.

1617
01:57:23,333 --> 01:57:24,166
Let's go.

1618
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,625
LAND DEED

1619
01:57:45,708 --> 01:57:48,500
FOR MR. PHUKAO BINKRAI
AND MS. JERITA RITHTHUMRONG

1620
01:57:50,291 --> 01:57:56,083
FOR MR. PHUKAO BINKRAI

1621
01:57:57,333 --> 01:57:59,958
This is the level
I didn't want to complete.

1622
01:58:03,125 --> 01:58:05,833
This is also the level
I didn't want to complete.

1623
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:09,916
But…

1624
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,750
I have to thank you, Jay.

1625
01:58:14,166 --> 01:58:16,041
I also have to thank you, Kao.

1626
01:58:41,791 --> 01:58:44,416
In the end, our homes
are in different places.

1627
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:47,291
But I feel like Jay is still nearby.

1628
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:50,083
Even if we're a quarter-mile away

1629
01:58:50,166 --> 01:58:51,791
or halfway across the world,

1630
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:53,541
Jay has never left.

1631
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:55,916
She will always be with me.

1632
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,583
Because we're family.

1633
02:00:45,916 --> 02:00:47,125
Hey.

1634
02:00:47,208 --> 02:00:48,625
We'll have to say goodbye soon, huh?

1635
02:00:52,833 --> 02:00:53,833
Well…

1636
02:00:55,291 --> 02:00:56,333
I guess so.

1637
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:57,875
So,

1638
02:00:58,541 --> 02:01:00,291
I wanted to come and say thanks.

1639
02:01:00,375 --> 02:01:01,208
It's fine.

1640
02:01:01,291 --> 02:01:02,708
You already paid me back.

1641
02:01:03,208 --> 02:01:04,041
One sec.

1642
02:01:05,041 --> 02:01:06,250
Hi, Oom-Im's mom.

1643
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,583
I got the money transferred already.

1644
02:01:14,375 --> 02:01:15,958
I've got a headache…

1645
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:19,541
having to find a new teacher,
and I'm not sure who to ask.

1646
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,916
Is there an age limit?

1647
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,166
This sport is about numbers.

1648
02:01:28,708 --> 02:01:30,125
No gender. No age.

1649
02:01:32,291 --> 02:01:33,166
Great.

1650
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,916
I know someone. I'll ask her.

1651
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,375
She's good at teaching.

1652
02:01:51,208 --> 02:01:52,833
Do you want to teach sport stacking?

1653
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,041
Sure.

1654
02:01:56,125 --> 02:01:57,000
Bruh.

1655
02:02:06,625 --> 02:02:08,791
Is today's temple far?

1656
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:09,833
No.

1657
02:02:09,916 --> 02:02:11,958
But we're going to several places today.

1658
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:15,250
Hey, everything is in order, right?

1659
02:02:15,333 --> 02:02:16,291
Thanks a lot.

1660
02:02:16,375 --> 02:02:17,666
Metal really is good.

1661
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:19,833
Whichever temple we go to,
she has everything prepared.

1662
02:02:20,666 --> 02:02:21,791
But…

1663
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:24,458
you'll have to take care
of snakes for her.

1664
02:02:25,916 --> 02:02:27,208
I'm just kidding.

1665
02:02:30,916 --> 02:02:32,458
Well…

1666
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:35,500
I…

1667
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:38,916
Thank you so much, Mom.

1668
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,500
Sure.

1669
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:48,375
Let's go.

1670
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:52,833
-Thank you.
-No prob.

1671
02:02:56,708 --> 02:02:57,750
-Mom.
-Yes?

1672
02:02:57,833 --> 02:02:58,666
This is…

1673
02:02:58,750 --> 02:02:59,916
Mr. Kang.

1674
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

1675
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:03,000
Hello, ma'am.

1676
02:03:03,083 --> 02:03:03,958
Let's go.

1677
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:05,708
Thank you.

1678
02:03:09,041 --> 02:03:11,041
-You go sit in the front seat.
-Okay.

1679
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:12,833
Thank you.

1680
02:03:16,583 --> 02:03:17,958
Ever since that day…

1681
02:03:18,541 --> 02:03:20,666
I never went back to that house again.

1682
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:24,708
On some days, I wonder…

1683
02:03:24,791 --> 02:03:26,333
what he's doing.

1684
02:03:29,041 --> 02:03:31,000
Can he change the bedsheets?

1685
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:36,333
Can he do the laundry?

1686
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:43,458
I hope his back doesn't hurt
while washing the dishes.

1687
02:03:49,416 --> 02:03:52,458
I hope he can do everything
that I once taught him.

1688
02:03:59,875 --> 02:04:02,333
And I hope that the plants

1689
02:04:02,416 --> 02:04:03,708
are still alive.

1690
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:08,541
But if I think about it again,

1691
02:04:09,416 --> 02:04:12,125
I believe he can do it.

1692
02:04:15,791 --> 02:04:18,458
And no matter
how many other levels there are,

1693
02:04:18,541 --> 02:04:20,208
he'll be able to complete them all.

1694
02:04:45,041 --> 02:04:46,500
Now…

1695
02:04:46,583 --> 02:04:49,125
I'm ready for the sequel.

1696
02:04:56,416 --> 02:04:57,333
I promise.

1697
02:04:57,416 --> 02:04:59,708
I'll sport stack for the entire movie.

1698
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:02,625
I know how to do everything.

1699
02:05:02,708 --> 02:05:04,833
Do the dishes,
do the laundry, mop the floor.

1700
02:05:05,958 --> 02:05:07,333
From now on,

1701
02:05:07,416 --> 02:05:08,916
it's going to be…

1702
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,750
furiously fast!

1703
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:34,250
METAL! THIS PLANT IS WATERED
ONLY IN THE MORNING.

1704
02:11:35,083 --> 02:11:36,166
Hi, neighbor.

1705
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:37,791
Haven't seen you in such a long time.
