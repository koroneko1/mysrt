1
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,479
Fortunately,
we saw both Phookan and Panda off

2
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,560
to study abroad,

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,640
otherwise they would tag along with us.

4
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,359
I don't really want to go there, sis.

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,319
It's good to have you with us,
so we can deal with the new dormitory.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,760
Are we there yet, Khoi?

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,959
-Here we are.
-Stop the car. Let's go.

8
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,959
Bring your luggage.

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,159
Just like when I was in Manchester,

10
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,560
it's raining lightly.

11
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,480
Wow.

12
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,439
That's our new dormitory,

13
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,879
-isn't it?
-It is.

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,879
I have no idea about it.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,239
-It's so heavy.
-In your heart?

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean this stupid toilet.

17
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,280
-Pancake needs us.
-It's us who need Pancake.

18
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,879
You think so?

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,319
Pancake. Pancake.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,200
-See some shit in Pancake's toilet?
-Move your face closer.

21
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,079
-Let's go. Come on.
-That's our shit.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,439
Close the gates.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,800
Lock them up.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
Sis, why is it so quiet here?

25
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,960
It is.
There's nobody to welcome us.

26
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,960
-Who's gonna let us in, Khoi?
-I don't know.

27
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,479
You know nothing, Khoi.

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Sis.

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,879
Shit.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,560
-Why do you look so scared? It's me.
-Why don't you come in, Pancake?

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,759
Sis, I can't.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
The guardian spirit must be powerful.

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,840
The mansion's guardian spirit,

34
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,680
please let Pancake in.
She's a good spirit.

35
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,680
-What's it to do with the guardian spirit?
-What do you think?

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,280
-Just open the gates for me.
-That's it?

37
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
-Idiot.
-Why do you talk ill of me? We're friends.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,840
We used to get along so well.
Let's go.

39
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,319
You're rolling your eyes at me? Bitch.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
It's good to have you, Pancake.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,919
Here. Your room.

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
Why did I die in here?

43
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,479
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

44
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,360
Sis, that's Songkram.

45
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,639
-Moddam.
-Yeah.

46
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,520
I haven't seen you for years.
You're still deaf?

47
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,360
Good. Help Pancake with her room.

48
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,439
Girl.

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,800
I'd like to welcome you all
to Maison la Dolce Vita.

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,159
Three aunties, please follow me.

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
-You called us aunties?
-Three sisters, please follow me.

52
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
That wing is our boy students' dorm.

53
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,080
-I want to stay here.
-Definitely not.

54
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,919
Keep following me, please.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,560
As you can see,
our mansion is beautiful.

56
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,520
-Good God.
-Be careful, honey.

57
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,719
I'm alright.

58
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,360
This wing is your residence.
Please get your luggage and enter.

59
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,360
Yes. Yes.

60
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,000
-Who're those people?
-They're our boy students.

61
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,079
What's wrong with you?

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Quiet.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Where have you been?
I told you not to go to the Red Building.

64
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,959
Listen to me. I'm Suanswart.
Little monsters.

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,519
Such a brat.

66
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,079
He went to study abroad, right?

67
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,519
-Right.
-Bad students.

68
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,800
You guys have seen things, right?

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,959
So stupid.
Why don't you listen to me?

70
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,800
-Right.
-Why the hell does he keep saying "right"?

71
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,000
-Welcome to Maison la Dolce Vita.
-Right.

72
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,319
You want to go to sleep, right?

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,959
Please.

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's talk tomorrow.
We'll see you in the morning.

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,079
-Who is he?
-Mr. Suanswart. He's the dorm's keeper.

76
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,399
Don't go to the Red Building.

77
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,560
What's the Red Building?

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,720
-A red building.
-Bitch.

79
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,680
-Right.
-You're doing well, right?

80
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,480
-Right.
-Okay. Right.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Our dorm's swimming pool
is on your left.

82
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
Honey, who's swimming at this hour?

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
Nobody.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
But I saw someone there.

85
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,879
-Where is he?
-I saw him too.

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,040
Where has he gone?

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,319
-Did you see him?
-I did.

88
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,519
How could he just disappear
in the blink of an eye?

89
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,800
-Songkram.
-Songkram, where are you going?

90
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,800
I think I saw him.

91
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,199
-I did.
-Let's go.

92
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,639
-He's gone.
-Sis.

93
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,920
Wow.

94
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,399
This is the most beautiful dorm
we've ever been in.

95
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Yes. Does it suit you, Cartoon?

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,160
What kind of dorm
would suit someone like you?

97
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,759
-Bitch.
-Mom.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,040
-This dorm is so beautiful.
-We're not on vacation.

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,720
We're on a mission.

100
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,000
Pancake.

101
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,319
Where have you been?
You keep popping up here and there.

102
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,680
Sis.

103
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,199
-I've explored this dorm.
-Really?

104
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,000
From what I've seen so far,

105
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,480
-this dorm is haunted.
-What?

106
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,879
-It's pretty evil.
-Really?

107
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,040
Yes.

108
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
-It's coming.
-What?

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,759
-You can fight it.
-You want a piece of me?

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,759
-You can beat it.
-Fine.

111
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,720
You are one of the best.
Don't be scared.

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,279
Don't give up, Pancake.

113
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,040
-Sis.
-What?

114
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,439
I can't hold it anymore.

115
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,600
-Where are you going?
-To the loo.

116
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,040
-I thought you were fighting it.
-I relaxed.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
Let's work on our mission.

118
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,160
-Does it have something in here?
-What is that?

119
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,079
A ghost.

120
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,519
-Are you scared?
-Just pretending.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,199
Bitch. Scream when you see one.
Come on.

122
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,319
It's quiet. So creepy.

123
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,399
-What?
-You're pretending again?

124
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
I don't want to see any ghosts.

125
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,559
-She dresses like Namning.
-Well, sis...

126
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,759
How could that be Namning?
She might've been reborn by now.

127
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,679
Khoi, go and take a look.
Check if it's Namning.

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,519
-Not Namning, Mom.
-You're a guy. Go.

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
She's twitching.

130
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,399
Khoi, take a look.

131
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,799
Look at her face.

132
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,159
She's not Namning.
Decaying.

133
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,519
Decaying.

134
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,159
Why did we go upstairs?
The door is over there.

135
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,360
Quick.

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,159
Why are you so scared?
I'm not a ghost.

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,879
Not a ghost, my ass.
Your face looks horrible, bitch.

138
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,759
Your saliva is all over me.
Why did you just spit on my face?

139
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,759
My phlegm.

140
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,559
No. Not yet.
Save it for when the time is right.

141
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,240
-I'm gonna kill you.
-I'm leaving.

142
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,159
She's pulling my dress.

143
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,039
She's pulling my dress.

144
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,679
-I'm leaving.
-Can I have my sister's dress?

145
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't you feel lonely
swimming by yourself?

146
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,440
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you mind if...

147
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,360
Thank you.

148
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,039
Ma'am.

149
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Wanna join me?

150
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm afraid I can't.

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,399
Not in this dress.

152
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,480
Maybe next time.

153
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,919
It's alright.

154
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,480
Good luck.

155
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,000
How about this dress?

156
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,639
Sure.

157
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,399
Water will be bursting.

158
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,919
Overflowing.
Choose your words wisely.

159
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,120
It has a double meaning.

160
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,039
Are you flirting with me?

161
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,960
-Ma'am.
-Excuse me.

162
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,039
I'm not that easy...

163
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,320
-I'm sorry.
-...but approachable.

164
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,879
Even though I look like this,

165
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,799
boys go crazy about it.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,480
Ma'am.
Why don't you look at my face?

167
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,799
I've been distracted by something else.

168
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,759
Shit.

169
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,679
-Why up here? Where are we going?
-Then why did you lead us here?

170
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
You followed me.

171
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,559
-I did.
-Mod, behind you.

172
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,639
Excuse me, ma'am.

173
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm not a ghost.

174
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Shit.

175
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,120
-You're good.
-See? I used to be a kick boxer.

176
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
-Bitch. You hurt me.
-There you go.

177
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,600
-Let go of me.
-Hit her.

178
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Do I look like a ghost?

179
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,559
-What?
-Mom.

180
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,600
I told you to go outside. There's a ghost
in here. It's right behind you, you know?

181
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,559
What are you babbling about?
I don't get it.

182
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,639
You're my son, my mother or my father or
I'm your mother? Why don't you tell me?

183
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,399
The ghost is right behind me?

184
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,200
I just wanna know
why you guys keep running.

185
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,519
I'm a human, not a ghost.
I'm exhausted, trying to keep up with you.

186
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
Bitch.

187
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,039
Bitch.

188
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,240
Songkram, hurry up.
She might get you.

189
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,559
Stop it. I know what you want.
I can take it off myself.

190
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,200
-You will ruin my dress. Here.
-I don't want it.

191
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,080
What am I supposed to do
with this stupid dress?

192
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,960
Have you been shot in the face?
It's totally a mess.

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,960
-So damaged.
-Who are you talking to?

194
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,480
-I'm talking to you.
-Good. Not to me.

195
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Who am I talking to?

196
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,759
Oh, it's the morning.

197
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,000
I told you not to come here.
You didn't listen to me.

198
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,759
-It's so creepy.
-Let's move.

199
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,000
Take a peep.
Anybody there, Khoi?

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,919
-There's no one, Mom.
-Told you, they're gone.

201
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,279
All clear. Nobody's here.

202
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,279
Khoi, you said there was nobody here.

203
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,559
They're off to school.

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,919
It's really annoying.
I have to wake you guys up...

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Oh, my God.

206
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,919
Should we feel nervous?

207
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,080
I don't give a shit.

208
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,639
-How about you? Nervous?
-Not at all.

209
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,200
You should be the one
to feel nervous, but you don't.

210
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,279
Will they throw up when we walk by?

211
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,399
-Mom, are you nervous?
-Me? Sure.

212
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,399
Pancake.

213
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,960
She never answers me
when I call.

214
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,080
She used to respond right away.
Now she ignores me. Pancake.

215
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,639
Pancake. Can you hear me?

216
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,000
Why do you keep calling me?
I'm sleeping here.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,000
How can I sleep right here?

218
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,480
Oops.

219
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,840
Has anyone seen me in this?
Sis, I'm coming.

220
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,360
Pancake. Pancake.

221
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,840
-Sis.
-Oh.

222
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,440
Next time,
you should bring my room with you.

223
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,480
-It's heavy, you know.
-Sorry. I forgot.

224
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,840
-What the hell are you wearing?
-A swimsuit.

225
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,240
You went swimming,
so you ignored me, huh?

226
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,519
I almost got killed
by that decaying ghost last night.

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,120
Not just you.
There was a ghost right here too.

228
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,200
What?

229
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,480
A male ghost.

230
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,480
-Oh, a male ghost.
-Well...

231
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,119
You guys hyped up
when I said it's a male ghost.

232
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
What the hell is this dress?

233
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,799
Is it nice?

234
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,559
It is, but not on you.

235
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
Nice shape.

236
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
Chubby shape.

237
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,359
Nice shape. Chubby shape.
Nice shape.

238
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,839
The male ghost?

239
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
-Tell me.
-Tell us.

240
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,279
Sis, I'd like to suggest
that you don't meet him.

241
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,200
Why not?

242
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,240
-He looks horrible.
-How horrible?

243
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
-Let me see your foot.
-Sure.

244
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,720
Here you are.

245
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,079
It touched my nose.
Let me tell you,

246
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,440
your foot looks much better
than his face.

247
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,839
-Really?
-Absolutely.

248
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,039
-How about his and mine?
-His is better.

249
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,640
My foot looks better
than my face?

250
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,279
How about her face and his?

251
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,720
No doubt.
Her face can beat them all.

252
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,000
-Really?
-Her face is no joke.

253
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,640
What about last night?
Tell us more.

254
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,799
Sis, sometimes I can hear your calling,
sometimes I can't.

255
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,279
Why don't you choose
an easier way to contact me?

256
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,559
-Like, promptly?
-Yeah.

257
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,559
Fine. Whatever you want.
Do I ever say no to you?

258
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,799
I can get you anything you want.

259
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,000
Here. Blackberry.

260
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,519
It can fit two SIM cards.
You can watch TV with this.

261
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,839
-Bitch.
-What?

262
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,599
-It's a dupe.
-Just kidding. Here's a real one.

263
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,119
We will give her our PIN numbers.

264
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,319
-You all have these?
-Yes, we have.

265
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,759
Scanning barcodes?

266
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
Sis, thank you.

267
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,359
They're here.

268
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,839
Greetings to all of you.

269
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,200
-His mom must be a beauty queen.
-I think she's faking it.

270
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,599
These two talk back at you.

271
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,480
They're right.

272
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,559
I...

273
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,880
was a Tamarind Beauty Queen
three years in a row.

274
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,240
-Sweet tamarind?
-Chubby tamarind.

275
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, she's chubby.

276
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:06,960
Welcome to Pa Tong Misa.

277
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,559
-Maison la Dolce Vita.
-Maison Pa Tong Pizza.

278
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,799
-Maison la Dolce Vita.
-You're right.

279
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
You'd better keep in mind that

280
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,200
you came here

281
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
just to be keepers of this dorm,

282
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,039
not teachers.

283
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,680
Don't forget that fact.

284
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,160
It might sound a bit too harsh,

285
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,160
but what I'm going to say
might be not that harsh.

286
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,640
You guys went to
the Red Building last night?

287
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
-How...
-I know.

288
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,759
-Who...
-I just know it.

289
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,079
From now on,

290
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,319
I forbid you to go to the Red Building

291
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,240
because I will move all the boys out

292
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,759
to the Big Building.
Are we clear?

293
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,200
Isn't she too beautiful?
I'm daunted.

294
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,920
Daunted?

295
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,640
-Intimidated.
-Oh, I see.

296
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,839
-Ms. Waewswart?
-What's up?

297
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,640
How did you know that
they went to the Red Building?

298
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,039
Is there anything
that I don't know about?

299
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,759
I know. Everybody knows.

300
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,759
-You, Suantwarn.
-Suanswart.

301
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,240
Right. I mean Suanswart.

302
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,960
First, we have to move those boys
out of that dorm of happiness.

303
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,279
Then, we find a way to chase those bitches
away before they find out our secret.

304
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,720
-What should we do with them?
-I wonder.

305
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,359
-I've got an idea.
-What is it?

306
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,559
We'll have a rite
to summon Taengtong's spirit

307
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,319
so we can remove the savage mole
that we put inside him.

308
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,519
He'll be back to savage mode
and scare those bitches away.

309
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,279
-You're mega clover. Brilliant.
-It's mega clever.

310
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,480
-Come again?
-Mega clever.

311
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,559
-You're mega clover. Brilliant.
-It's mega clever.

312
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,559
-You're mega clever. Brilliant.
-Right.

313
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,519
-Such a dumbass.
-That's right.

314
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,960
You must be very happy

315
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,319
to get a chance
to wear women's clothes again.

316
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,440
Not really. I don't mind.

317
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,640
-You swear?
-Don't. Global warming is real.

318
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,559
The weather has been chaotic.
Thunderbolts can happen anytime.

319
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,000
I can remember it.

320
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,440
Oops.

321
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,359
We have an exam tomorrow.
It's too bad.

322
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,720
-What subject?
-Hey, Junior!

323
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,759
-You still wanna go to the Red Building?
-No. I've been haunted by that face.

324
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,039
What?
You guys won't go for it tonight?

325
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,799
I'm out. What if Mr. Suanswart
finds out about this?

326
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,400
I still want to know whether
what we saw the other night was a ghost.

327
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,960
Boys.

328
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,039
-Hello.
-Hello. I'm Sis Taew.

329
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,799
This is my son, Khoi.
He's older than you guys.

330
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,640
-Hi.
-Well...

331
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,480
everyone come closer to me.

332
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,119
Can I ask you something?

333
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,400
Well...

334
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,279
I want to know that this place

335
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,200
-and the Red Building...
-Red Building?

336
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:30,240
Right. What's with the Red Building?

337
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,279
What are you doing, boys?

338
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,440
Ms. Waewswart's already told you
not to mingle with our boys.

339
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,359
-I'm leaving now.
-Please do.

340
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,400
Mom, the decaying ghost.

341
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,480
-You're not a ghost?
-I told you I'm not.

342
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,759
-Right.
-A ghost can't be pretty like this.

343
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,319
How on Earth can a person
be this much of a mess?

344
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Please.

345
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,119
Boys.

346
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,240
All of you have to move out
to the Big Building in two days.

347
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,400
Understand? Oh.

348
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
If those three weird sisters

349
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,440
ask you about this place,
tell them nothing.

350
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,640
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,359
Sir.

352
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,079
Sir.

353
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Sir?

354
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,599
Sir.

355
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,079
Are you around here?

356
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,799
No swimming tonight?

357
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,119
-Good evening, ma'am.
-My goodness.

358
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,279
You scared me to death.
You just popped out.

359
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,079
Actually, we've seen each other
for two days.

360
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,240
I still don't know your name.
I'm...

361
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,839
Pancake.

362
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,440
I'm Taengtong.

363
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,400
Taengtong.

364
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,079
Nice to meet you.

365
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,200
-Have a seat.
-Have a seat.

366
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,960
What's wrong with Pancake lately?

367
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,640
You're right.
She doesn't come when we call her.

368
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,400
Why don't you text her?
She's got a smartphone.

369
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,079
That's right.

370
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,000
-Do you feel lonely?
-Not at all.

371
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,079
How about you, Miss Pancake?

372
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,400
Is your boyfriend upset
when you're flirting with me?

373
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,839
I used to have one, but...

374
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,480
One day,
he asked me to go to his room.

375
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,440
I had no idea that...

376
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,400
-What's wrong, ma'am?
-They text me.

377
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,200
Sis, you can't call me right now.

378
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,119
She said she's busy.

379
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,920
Busy? You're busy, Pancake?

380
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,359
-Where were we?
-He asked you to go to his room.

381
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,519
Into his room.

382
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
Then he brought me into his room.

383
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,960
I couldn't believe what I saw.

384
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,880
Over 20 men were standing, naked.

385
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,680
After that...

386
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,240
-What's wrong?
-They text me again.

387
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,079
Sis, why do you keep calling me?

388
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,680
Bitch.

389
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,039
She's busy.

390
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Just turn off the phone.

391
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Keep interrupting me.

392
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,759
I was beaten by them.

393
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,519
Guys won't accept a girl like me.

394
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Well, do you have a girlfriend?

395
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,799
I did have one,

396
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,559
and our love

397
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,480
was impossible.

398
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,359
One night, I was swimming
in this pool.

399
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,920
Then, suddenly...

400
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,319
You've got texts?

401
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,279
I got electrocuted and died.

402
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,920
You're dead.

403
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,319
That means you're a ghost.
Excuse me,

404
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,880
please go away.
I'm scared I will make merit for you.

405
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,279
-Miss Pancake?
-Yes?

406
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,640
You're dead too.

407
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,160
Yes.

408
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,599
-Let's go to bed. I want some sleep.
-Bitch.

409
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,079
It's late so you feel sleepy?

410
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
It's so late
and you feel sleepy too?

411
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,039
I'm her company.

412
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,920
Right. It's late.
Let's go to bed, Khoi.

413
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,880
Mom, Pancake is with a guy.

414
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,759
Have you seen those three old hags
that have just moved in?

415
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,599
Their faces are too large.

416
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,519
It's hard for you to imagine.
Picture this.

417
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,960
You put those three faces together
and it's larger than a football pitch.

418
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,680
Damn you, Pancake.

419
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,680
You couldn't cope with them.
They're horrible,

420
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,039
rude, cruel, and tough.

421
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,400
You'd better stay away from them.

422
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,640
I warn you.

423
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,480
Should I expose that bitch? Go.

424
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,200
It's raining. You should go inside
or you'll catch a cold.

425
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,200
You bitch...
Where they've gone?

426
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Now she can disappear too?

427
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,200
-Sis.
-What?

428
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,279
-We should go to bed.
-Go. Go.

429
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,400
I'll talk to you later, Pancake.

430
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,599
Walk in a line.
Don't be scared by me

431
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,799
because we're going to stay
in the same dorm.

432
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
Are you guys done?

433
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,839
Move faster.
What are you babbling about?

434
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,599
-Quick.
-Those boys are moving out.

435
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,519
There must be a reason.

436
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,240
Look at those four bitches.

437
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,400
They're standing and their faces
are just perfectly matched.

438
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,200
Looks like a herd of animals.

439
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,000
-Am I right, Khoi?
-Yes.

440
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,240
Am I right, Songkram?
Sorry. I forgot that you're deaf.

441
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,759
Taengtong.

442
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,759
Where are you, Taengtong?

443
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm coming for you.

444
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,759
Taengtong.

445
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,279
Where has he gone?

446
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,799
I put on a fancy swimsuit for him.

447
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,359
Taengtong.

448
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,480
-Where are you?
-I'm here.

449
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,799
You look pretty uptight.

450
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,359
No swimming tonight?

451
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,519
I put on a swimsuit to swim with you.

452
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,839
If you want that,

453
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:10,960
take off my clothes.

454
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Really?

455
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Pancake!

456
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,440
Why does she call me that harshly?

457
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,319
-Yes, Sis.
-I texted you. You said you're busy.

458
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,400
Is this what was keeping you busy?

459
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,240
-Mom.
-Not now.

460
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,920
-Sis.
-You ungrateful kid.

461
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,559
You're so evil.
A slut. A liar.

462
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,160
This is a house, not a brothel.
You slut.

463
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,960
You're such a whore.
Always flirting with guys. Slut.

464
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,759
Get out of my house.

465
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,079
Bad girl. Such a whore.

466
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,400
Thank you for calling me a whore.

467
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Bitch.
I'm so fed up with you.

468
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
You ungrateful kid.

469
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,880
Sis.

470
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,400
You smacked my face.

471
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,279
I won't say a word.

472
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,000
But about telling me to go away,

473
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
is this your house?

474
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,559
You just moved in two days ago.

475
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,359
To be precise,
you and I moved in at the same time.

476
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,480
-Is that right, Khoi?
-Yes.

477
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,400
You whore.

478
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,839
You whore.

479
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,200
You whore. Ouch. Ouch.

480
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,640
I hurt.

481
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:49,480
-What's wrong?
-Pancake.

482
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,359
She's into that guy.

483
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,319
-She totally ignored us.
-Why?

484
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,640
She saw me, she scolded me
and she hit me too.

485
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,440
Why on Earth
did she do such a thing, Khoi?

486
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,640
-How could she do that?
-No.

487
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,000
-What?
-It's Mom who scolded her and hit her.

488
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
-What?
-You ungrateful child.

489
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,200
The guy that Pancake fell for...

490
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,599
-What?
-He's gorgeous.

491
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,039
-What's his name?
-He's called Taengtong.

492
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,519
Taengtong.

493
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,480
Cartoon. Moddam.
Are you guys ready?

494
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,759
Take it easy, Sis.
What's the hurry?

495
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,240
No need to rush. I can wait.

496
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,599
Mom, where are you going?

497
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm going to find your new dad, Khoi.

498
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,960
Keep your eye on these two.
Don't let them interrupt me.

499
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,160
Got it?
And then you'll get a new dad.

500
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,240
-Mom.
-What?

501
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,640
-You look great tonight.
-Just call him Daddy.

502
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,240
Taengtong.

503
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm here, Taengtong.

504
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,279
Sis, we're ready.

505
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,880
Khoi, where's your mom?

506
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,960
My mom said that you two
should wait for her in this room.

507
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,319
-Go back inside.
-Why?

508
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,759
I need you to swim with me.

509
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,279
Taengtong.

510
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,039
You called me?

511
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,440
Taengtong, I need you
to swim with me.

512
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,440
Swimming in a creepy place...

513
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,759
I'm ready for it.

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,839
Brand new.

515
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,920
Taengtong.

516
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,839
The water is pretty cool.
You might catch a cold.

517
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,519
Let's go upstairs to my room.
Follow me.

518
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Is she coming?

519
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:56,920
Taengtong.

520
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
-Follow me, Taengtong.
-Go back. I'll call you if she's here.

521
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,800
Let's go to my room.
Follow me, Taengtong.

522
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,840
I tripped, Taengtong.

523
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Follow me.

524
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:19,880
She's coming.

525
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,719
Why? Is it a secret?

526
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,159
Taengtong.

527
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,480
Taengtong.

528
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Come with me. Quick.

529
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,239
Hey.

530
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,800
You might wonder what I'm doing.

531
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,880
Taengtong.

532
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,199
Here.

533
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,719
Come on over.

534
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,920
Quick, Taengtong.

535
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,239
You ungrateful kid.
So evil. A slut. A liar.

536
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,840
This is a house, not a brothel.

537
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,639
You slut. Always flirting with guys.

538
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:13,440
You're such a whore. Slut.
A sex addict.

539
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,920
Get out of my house.
You're such a whore.

540
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,039
Thank you for calling me a whore.

541
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,559
Bitch, I'm gonna smack your face.

542
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm so fed up with you.

543
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,920
You ungrateful kid. A whore.

544
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:36,039
That bitch talks trash about you.
What an ungrateful spirit.

545
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,079
Sis, why do you let her
talk to you like that?

546
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,800
How dare she behave like this
to an old lady?

547
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
Pancake.

548
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,679
Don't worry, Sis.
I'll make it right for you.

549
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,400
We'll see who he chooses,
between me...

550
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,880
and me.

551
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,519
Mom, do I have a new dad?

552
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,639
Just look at me and you'll know it.

553
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,679
-Yes?
-No.

554
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,599
Taengtong.

555
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,360
-We'll see who's the one he chooses.
-Between a drag queen and a troll.

556
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
For your selection, Taengtong.

557
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,360
Taengtong.

558
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,360
Taengtong.
Oh my God, you're so hot.

559
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,639
How could Pancake say that he's ugly?

560
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,760
What's wrong with you people?

561
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,639
You keep saying Taengtong.

562
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,159
The others do that too.
You guys keep calling me all night long.

563
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,559
Taengtong,

564
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
just pick one.

565
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,920
Choose one.

566
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,679
Your swimsuits look great.

567
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,480
You guys are so slutty.

568
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,199
Think before you put on your clothes.

569
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,920
Let me tell you something.

570
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,239
-This man. Can I have him?
-Fine.

571
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:42,960
I give up.

572
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,199
-Can I call my psychiatrist?
-Sure.

573
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,639
Not now.

574
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,000
Taengtong, do you prefer
a lady with a lush body?

575
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,800
Moddam, your friend's gone.
What are you waiting for?

576
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,840
-I haven't had a bite.
-Bite me!

577
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,199
Fine, my dress is pretty lame tonight.
Can't beat the bikinis.

578
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,199
That's a real eyesore.

579
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,840
How could a toad like her wear those?

580
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,800
You look like a dead toad.

581
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,360
Nobody in his right mind
would wear that outfit.

582
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,679
-What did you say?
-I said, you in that bikini...

583
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,639
-is stunning.
-Bullshit.

584
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,239
I understand what you said.

585
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,880
-You know that?
-Bitch.

586
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,159
Are you alright? Are you upset?

587
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,440
-I am.
-More than I was?

588
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,480
-So upset.
-Let's go, all three of us.

589
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,519
Let's cry together...

590
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,400
all three sisters.

591
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,800
Don't put on a thong ever again, will you?
I don't like it.

592
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,280
I will get your robe.

593
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,239
Come.

594
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,360
-It's time to hold a rite.
-It should be.

595
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,960
Quiet. I'm summoning here.

596
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,239
He's gone. Where is he?

597
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,199
-He's gone.
-Why did you summon me here?

598
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,199
Shit.

599
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,239
-Why are you here, Takaidao?
-Can I join you? I'm scared.

600
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,880
I'll kick your face.

601
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,559
I'll handle him.

602
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,000
Go and grab
the savage mole from him.

603
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,760
-You mean them, right?
-I mean you.

604
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,639
-I'm busy. I'm holding something.
-Hurry up.

605
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm scared.

606
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,880
He hit me.

607
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,920
Let him do it.
You'd better take that mole off quickly.

608
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,599
Hurry up.

609
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,840
-Quick.
-I'm hurt. You're not the one he hit.

610
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Yeah.

611
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,800
On the count of three,
I'll pull it out and run away.

612
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
-Fine.
-One.

613
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,599
Two. Three.

614
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,519
-He hit me again.
-Did that hurt?

615
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,440
Can't you see? My face is swelling.
How about this?

616
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:09,559
You know the drill,

617
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,519
-you take it off.
-Should I?

618
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,559
You should. Hear me out.

619
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,159
On the count of three,
I'll run away. You ready?

620
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,800
One. Two.

621
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,440
-Run.
-Where's my three?

622
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,320
Count it yourself, asshole.

623
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,159
Why did you kick me?

624
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,400
That's Suanswart.

625
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,000
I'll get you. Why did you kick me?

626
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:39,400
Mom. Mom.

627
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,360
Why did Ms. Waewswart
come into the dorm?

628
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Right.

629
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,679
Right, my ass. I'm asking you.

630
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,800
-There must be something.
-Right.

631
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,880
-I have nothing to do with you.
-But I have.

632
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,719
I don't. My face is swelling like hell.

633
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:09,039
You can't just beat me.
Beat them. I gotta run.

634
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm busy.

635
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,239
You want to scare me?

636
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,599
You're not scared by me?

637
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,199
-Boo.
-Boo.

638
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,920
You're gonna suck my blood for real?

639
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,559
Good news. I did a checkup.
The lymph in my blood is not good.

640
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,320
If you insist, take him.

641
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,440
Just go. I'll handle him.

642
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,400
You wanna suck my blood?

643
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,280
Come and get it.

644
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,760
How could he do this to you?

645
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:47,800
Ms. Waewswart got hurt too.

646
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,320
Right. Look at my face.
It's swelling like a balloon.

647
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,360
-So big.
-My face?

648
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,280
Your boobs.

649
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,400
Asshole.
I was born with big boobs.

650
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,559
Suantwarn. We need backup.

651
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,280
I can't take it.

652
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:07,599
I look like a monkey.

653
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,760
Two friends of mine

654
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,559
are so good at casting spells.

655
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,719
We need them now.
I guarantee you that they will win.

656
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,079
Karakade.

657
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,000
A ghost! Go away.

658
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,800
-You don't recognize Taengtong?
-Who are you? I don't recognize you.

659
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,159
Get out! Ouch!

660
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,320
Ouch!

661
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,719
I haven't seen you for ages.
Why is your nose flat like that?

662
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,360
My nose has always been flat like this.

663
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:46,679
Get out. Help me.

664
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,599
-Taengtong. Are you alright, flat nose?
-It's Karakade.

665
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,119
What did you do to Karakade?

666
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,960
Thanks.

667
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,159
-You!
-Oh.

668
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,679
Ouch!

669
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,079
Don't hurt Khoi, Taengtong.

670
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,119
-You recognize Taengtong?
-No. You said that yourself.

671
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,719
-Don't hurt Kiddo.
-It's Khoi.

672
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,480
-Don't hurt Khoi.
-Don't strangle Khoi too hard.

673
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,960
Where is everyone?
Why is it so quiet here?

674
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,159
Whatever.

675
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,440
We'll see who is Taengtong's pick,
between you guys and me.

676
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,480
-Taengtong.
-Taengtong.

677
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,920
-Golden dick.
-Come, Taengtong.

678
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,519
They call me every night.

679
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,119
Act like they're my wives.

680
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,280
-Taeng--
-Stop.

681
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,280
Come, Taengtong.
Old dogs keep barking.

682
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,519
You call us dogs? Bitch.

683
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:51,840
-I'll get you.
-What're you doing here?

684
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,159
-Who are you?
-Bitch. Whore.

685
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,000
-I know.
-That guy's wife.

686
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,159
-Who are you?
-Bitch.

687
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,719
I see. You're Pancake.

688
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,440
Shit.

689
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:01,400
Who are you?

690
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,599
You jerk!

691
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,960
You can't hit me.
Let me hit you first.

692
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,559
Got it? Here.

693
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,519
Well, asshole.

694
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,199
I just want to smack your face.
Why can't I?

695
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,639
I'll get you.

696
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,119
Oh, no, Taengtong.

697
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,599
See? He picks me.
He comes to me first.

698
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,239
Oh, no. Don't kiss me.

699
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,280
My friends are jealous of me.

700
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,960
-Right?
-Look at that. I've got chills.

701
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,280
It's not right.

702
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,039
He's gonna eat me.

703
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,679
Mom.

704
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,360
Mom. He strangled my dick.

705
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,400
What?

706
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,239
My neck.

707
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:11,159
Why is he so savage?

708
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,360
He's gone.

709
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,079
I'm so relieved.

710
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,760
It hurts all over my body,
like I've been beaten.

711
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,280
I ran, so I've lost one of my stockings.

712
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,880
That's not my big toe.

713
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,880
This is my foot, of course.

714
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,639
This one is not mine.

715
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,719
Why is it not tickling?

716
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,039
Dear Lord...

717
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,280
Go away. Leave me alone.

718
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,639
-Go to somewhere else.
-Where can I go now?

719
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:05,079
-I don't know. Just go.
-I will stay right here.

720
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,239
Dear Lord, don't you find me.

721
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,119
Taengtong.

722
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:08,559
We've gone beyond the bed.

723
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,679
-What're you laughing at?
-Laugh, my ass. I'm crying.

724
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Taengtong.

725
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,880
You wanna suck my blood? Pancake.

726
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,079
You want to rip me apart?

727
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,519
Do it. I'm exhausted.
I can fight you guys no more.

728
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,199
What are you doing?
You are really annoying.

729
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
You are so happy seeing your lover.

730
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,320
I am alone, all by myself.
So exhausting and tiring.

731
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,239
Stop it.

732
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,360
She passed out.

733
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:53,840
I cannot fall asleep, I am so mad.
I am going mental.

734
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,239
She's talking in her sleep?

735
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:58,880
Enough. You scared me.

736
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,480
He can't come in.

737
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,679
Who's that? Who?

738
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,079
Is that you, Cartoon?
Come in and close the door.

739
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,639
-Close it.
-Close it.

740
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:18,079
Oh.

741
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,119
Locked.

742
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,639
Sis Taew,
let me out with you.

743
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,800
-It's a small space.
-Sis Taew, why are you so mean?

744
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,760
-You are a mean sister.
-What?

745
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,079
-Won't you let me out?
-Or what?

746
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,480
You can't come inside.

747
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,880
-What?
-Stay there.

748
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,280
-Serves you right.
-Cartoon.

749
00:50:36,679 --> 00:50:38,400
You are a mean sister.

750
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,480
Oh, Taengtong.

751
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,320
Why are you here?
I'm taking a shower.

752
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,239
I'm taking a shower.

753
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,639
Gosh.

754
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,760
What are you looking at? I'm a lady.
You should be a gentleman.

755
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:01,719
Soap.

756
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,960
How do you know
that I prefer a bar of soap?

757
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,519
Can you rub it on my back for me?
I can't reach it.

758
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,639
Rub it. Yeah, like that.

759
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,880
Your hand is so strong, Taengtong.

760
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,079
What? Pancake?
How dare you put your foot on my back?

761
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,320
If you mess with my man,
I'm gonna rub it on your face too.

762
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,159
Bitch. Why do you get all the spotlight?

763
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,280
-Sis, get out.
-You evil spirit.

764
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,199
I'll go, bitch.

765
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,119
You... Oops!

766
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,320
Listen, you and I will sort this out.

767
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,079
-Who closed the door?
-You didn't open it, dumbass.

768
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,840
-You did this to me?
-Your saliva is all over me.

769
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,760
You're such a cow.

770
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:02,000
Calling me a cow? So lame.

771
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,559
Don't you know
the water bill is pricey?

772
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,000
She's gone.

773
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,199
Mom, Taengtong is standing
right behind you.

774
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,639
-I don't know how he get there. He grins--
-What?

775
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,880
What did you say? I don't get it.

776
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,599
How can you stay here?
I'm talking to my son.

777
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,039
Why don't you go inside?
How can you come out here?

778
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:34,360
What are you talking about?

779
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,280
-How can you be right here?
-Taengtong,

780
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:38,360
bite her neck.

781
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:42,400
Don't...

782
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,960
-He can't.
-Taengtong, bite her neck. Do it.

783
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,119
Do it, Taengtong.
Bite me. Wow.

784
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,000
Khoi. Hey, Khoi.

785
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,000
-Hold on. Grab me.
-Sis.

786
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,599
Yeah, Pancake. Take that.

787
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,280
Be careful, Mom.

788
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,480
Wow.

789
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,079
Come and bite me.

790
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,199
Let's see where you can go now.

791
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,559
-What will you do, Pancake?
-I will let Taengtong bite your neck.

792
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,079
I'm Sis Taew, you know?
Khoi.

793
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,840
Pancake, my balls.

794
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,079
Pancake. Khoi.

795
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,039
Pancake.
Don't do this to me.

796
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,719
You think you'll make it?

797
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,079
He's climbing after me.
Sis, I'm just kidding.

798
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,679
Good job.

799
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,079
Go swimming every day.

800
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:56,360
My Khoi will get stronger.

801
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,199
Don't forget to flip back.
Backstroke, good.

802
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,000
So people can see your dick.
It's a must.

803
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
Mom, what's a mug?

804
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:11,519
-I'm not.
-It's a must.

805
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,519
Oh, a must.

806
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,800
I've got an accent.

807
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:17,840
Auntie.

808
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:20,159
What's the matter, Nymph?

809
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,920
-My name is Karakade.
-What's up, Karakade?

810
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,559
-I have something to tell you.
-Say it. There are just three of us.

811
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,079
Well, I...

812
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:30,719
Karakade.

813
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,119
He called you. What?

814
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,280
Hey, girl.

815
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,760
You say nothing.

816
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:43,679
Hey, what's up?

817
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,840
Girl.

818
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,320
Go back... what?

819
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,039
Khoi. My Khoi.

820
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,760
Khoi is drowning.

821
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:57,920
Oh, Khoi is diving...

822
00:54:58,719 --> 00:54:59,719
to the pool's bottom.

823
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,239
What is it, son?

824
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,760
I found treasure there.

825
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:21,800
Treasure can't be in a pool.

826
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,480
You're so dumb. Who's your father?
He must be so stupid.

827
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,239
But I'm your mom,
so let me see it.

828
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,440
What is it?

829
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,440
Let me see.

830
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,440
Hey, this is a talisman.

831
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,039
Moddam. Cartoon.
A talisman.

832
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,239
What talisman?

833
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,360
Khoi found it at the bottom of the pool.

834
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,960
Right. I took it off.

835
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,920
It must be a talisman
for keeping someone's spirit there.

836
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,440
What? The talisman we used
to keep Taengtong's spirit.

837
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,760
-They took it off. Shit.
-That's right.

838
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,159
Taengtong will go wild all over the place.

839
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,079
That's right.

840
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,760
-Will he come here?
-Definitely.

841
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,639
Hey, you guys.

842
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,960
You think Taengtong will be here?

843
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,760
He's not coming. Just go to sleep.

844
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,559
-I don't care if he's here.
-Why?

845
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
Here. I've got holy garlic,

846
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,519
imported from Romania.

847
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,239
-Not from Bon Marche market?
-Bitch. I ordered it from Romania.

848
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,800
Your joke is so lame.
Go to bed.

849
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,280
Sleep tight. Sleep well.

850
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,840
Go to sleep.

851
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,679
Why are you here?

852
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
-I came to see you.
-I didn't let you.

853
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,800
-I miss you.
-I don't miss you.

854
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:18,960
Ms. Waewswart?

855
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,960
Look. You're scared
by my cross-shaped hairdo.

856
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,079
It's not all I've got.
I have something so cool.

857
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,880
Here. Do you know what it is?

858
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,280
Garlic from Romania.
I gotcha.

859
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,840
Here.

860
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,559
Oh, they're worms.

861
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,000
Waewswart,
worms are all over my face.

862
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,039
I'm your boss, bitch.

863
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,199
Don't come any closer. Here.

864
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,079
I have garlic. Are you scared?
This is holy garlic.

865
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,840
You're not scared at all?

866
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,639
What are you gonna do to me? Don't.

867
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,760
Take this.

868
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,280
How about that?
My boobs are useful right now. Come on!

869
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,280
I will smack your face
with my boobs.

870
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:42,239
There's something in this place...

871
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:44,280
What is it?

872
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,119
A ghost, dumbass.

873
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:52,480
Abotigisling Botichabu okubogi akanabogi
panasquiba anoyayei leyami--

874
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,159
-Who are you talking to?
-Find that ghost, bitch.

875
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,599
-I haven't seen one.
-Pretend like you see one.

876
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,360
Here you are,
Glutathione and L-carnitine.

877
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,480
-You want me to do the exorcism tonight?
-Right.

878
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,159
That ghost is a male, right?

879
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,559
-Right.
-He wears a white thong, doesn't he?

880
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,119
He has a tattoo right here?

881
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,920
-How do you know?
-Suanswart's just told me that.

882
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:26,480
Maybe I didn't catch that.

883
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,760
A male ghost. I will take him down.

884
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,760
Okay. I'll be there tonight.

885
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,320
It's you. Everybody tells me
that you're so savage.

886
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,639
-That's right.
-We're going to destroy you.

887
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,119
Hello.

888
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,360
-Hello.
-He's so well-mannered.

889
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,840
Is it you who died in a white thong?

890
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,719
-Like this?
-Wow.

891
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,119
With a tattoo.

892
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,440
It's on my back.

893
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,880
Where's your six-pack abs?

894
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:00,320
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

895
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:05,159
-My goodness.
-Wow.

896
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:07,280
Oh, wow.

897
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,840
Great body, what a hunk.
You go to the gym every day, right?

898
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,760
That's right.

899
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,599
-May I count?
-Please.

900
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,119
One pack.

901
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:18,639
Two packs. Three packs.

902
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,679
Four... what?

903
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,639
Pull it out.

904
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:27,039
Oops.

905
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:30,599
Four packs.

906
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:32,599
Five packs.

907
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:36,039
Six packs. Six packs. Six packs.

908
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,719
Why is this pack is so tiny?

909
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:40,039
-I don't really exercise it.
-You don't?

910
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,159
It's bouncing.

911
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,519
Have Men's Health magazine

912
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,519
ever contacted you to be a cover guy?

913
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,400
-They called me twice.
-Bullshit.

914
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:56,920
Cancel the mission. I'm leaving.

915
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,440
-Oh.
-Oh.

916
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,519
-Who's that?
-A ghost.

917
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,719
That one is so savage.

918
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:10,880
Shit.

919
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,920
My God. She passed out.

920
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,360
-What should we do?
-Stop it.

921
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,159
Don't be scared.
I have a magic strawberry.

922
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,840
Look.

923
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,239
What should I do?

924
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:44,519
What're you looking at?

925
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,559
Don't look at me.

926
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:57,079
No.

927
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,400
It's not what I...

928
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,199
Strawberry. Strawberry.

929
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,159
Oh, no strawberry.

930
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,039
I'm out.

931
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,119
I'm leaving.

932
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:33,840
Taengtong, what's wrong with you?

933
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,840
Strawberry is so good.

934
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,800
So sweet.

935
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:42,960
What happened, Taengtong?

936
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,840
You're so cute.

937
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,320
-Dao.
-Yes.

938
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,440
-You don't have smaller ones?
-I have.

939
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,760
Here.

940
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:01,920
Suantwarn.

941
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:05,480
Where did you get these two?
They're useless.

942
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,559
But they're the best exorcists.

943
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,800
I think all of us
are supposed to go there.

944
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,280
-We could be intimidating.
-Then, get ready.

945
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:33,559
Oh.

946
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,119
A dead body.

947
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,880
Waewswart Mirueleum.

948
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,119
She's already dead, sis.

949
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,880
Then, who's the one we saw?

950
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:48,519
Who's that woman we saw?

951
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:49,440
Hey.

952
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:50,844
WAEWSWART MIRUELEUM
11 AUGUST 2510 - 7 AUGUST 2543

953
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:52,679
We've got company.

954
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,119
Hurry.

955
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:04,519
Hey,

956
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,239
Waewswart.

957
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,840
Finally,

958
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,679
this mansion is mine.
Only mine.

959
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:14,519
You know,

960
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,880
don't be jealous of me.

961
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,199
Waewswart.

962
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,440
Waew.

963
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,039
Don't you dare trick me.

964
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:40,320
-I see.
-That's right.

965
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
I knew it.

966
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,119
You guys,

967
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,960
keep it secret. Tell no one.

968
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,760
-Right.
-Got it, Khoi?

969
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,000
-Let's go.
-To where?

970
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,400
In that coffin perhaps?

971
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:54,960
I mean outside.

972
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,280
Do you have anything to tell us,
Karakade?

973
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,639
-No.
-I think you have.

974
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,679
That's why
you keep following us around.

975
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,519
Karakade, who killed Taengtong?

976
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:17,800
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.

977
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,079
-What should we do now?
-Oh.

978
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:21,880
-Huh?
-I...

979
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,639
I just know that there were two people

980
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,880
who killed Taengtong.

981
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,000
When I saw them,

982
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,039
they grabbed my head and smacked it

983
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,320
-over and over so my nose got broken.
-That's why you've got a flat nose.

984
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,360
It's not natural.

985
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:47,719
Right. I used to be very pretty.

986
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,199
Then I couldn't remember anything.

987
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,920
Oh, dear.
You've lost all your memories.

988
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,119
-But...
-What?

989
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,280
I can't really remember anything.

990
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,920
Do you have any idea

991
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,679
-who sent this letter to us?
-I have no idea.

992
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,760
You guys want to know what's inside?
Read it.

993
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:11,159
Don't look at me. Read it.

994
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:12,960
Sis.

995
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,239
The first time we read it,
There was no picture. We saw only letters.

996
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,159
-Where's this picture come from?
-Hello. I'm Pakakrong.

997
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:25,280
Help me. Help me.
Sis Taew, Moddam and Cartoon.

998
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:31,119
I'm so scared.
There's a murder at Maison la Dolce Vita.

999
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,880
Just die. You die.

1000
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,639
Let me use your identity.

1001
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:42,159
Fake Waewswart
killed the real Waewswart.

1002
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,880
She kills everyone
who knows her secret.

1003
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,880
Serves you right. Nosy bitch.

1004
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,840
-Are you talking to me?
-To her.

1005
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:52,039
Fine.

1006
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,360
You had it coming.

1007
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,679
-Waewswart and Suanswart.
-How can you come in here?

1008
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,880
You're so evil.
I can't believe you can kill people.

1009
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,760
I won't stay here with you.
You're so cruel.

1010
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,159
-I will be a nun.
-Huh?

1011
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:05,079
Be a nun.

1012
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:07,280
-Pee? The loo's over there.
-No. Be a nun.

1013
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,079
-A nun, in white dress and hairless.
-What?

1014
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,559
I will be a nun. I've said it
too many times. You are so dumb.

1015
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:17,280
-Why do you call me dumb?
-I'm leaving.

1016
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,559
Help me.

1017
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:20,199
Now you know

1018
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,119
who sent you that letter.

1019
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,599
It's you.

1020
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,280
I think this is the best spot
to summon that spirit.

1021
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,320
L and Gluta, let's go.

1022
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,440
Geepa!

1023
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:40,840
-Sabu sabu.
-Hey. Hey

1024
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,480
-Sabo nopide.
-Hey. Hey.

1025
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,400
-Sabo nopide.
-Hey. Hey.

1026
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,800
So annoying.

1027
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,519
Suanswart, you can't just scream
at this hour. Pancake.

1028
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,599
-What are you doing with them?
-Right.

1029
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,920
Who's Pancake?

1030
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:01,320
Pancake is a ghost.
She is pretty nasty too.

1031
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:03,880
She scared us two to death.

1032
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,320
-Really?
-Yeah.

1033
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:10,239
Bitch, who are you?

1034
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,239
-Hey.
-Hey.

1035
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,440
-Who are you?
-Hey.

1036
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,760
Who is she?

1037
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,319
Pancake.

1038
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,399
Boo.

1039
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,600
Boo, my ass.
They scream "Hey", sis.

1040
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,399
Suanswart and Waewswart.
What're they doing here, Pancake?

1041
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,720
They're going to capture
Taengtong's spirit.

1042
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,159
Y'all, please help Taengtong.

1043
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,079
Right.

1044
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,119
-We must help Taengtong.
-Our Golden Dick.

1045
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:24,279
-Hey.
-He belongs to us.

1046
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,560
He's my man.

1047
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,079
Well...

1048
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,319
Look. They're having fun.

1049
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:50,840
Suantwarn.

1050
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,960
These stupid bitches
made a mistake again.

1051
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:55,359
Sis.

1052
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,159
If it weren't for those two,
I could have done it.

1053
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,159
Dumbass.

1054
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:01,039
Those two are the ones
you're supposed to destroy.

1055
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,680
Oh, shit.

1056
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:05,600
But Gluta and L-carnitine
know a lot of spells.

1057
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,279
Stop it. That is the spell
for summoning a spirit.

1058
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:13,479
Oh.

1059
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,399
Oh, shit.

1060
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,800
Why don't you just sit on me?
Is it necessary to be this close?

1061
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,479
I've got an idea about this.

1062
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:27,279
A friend of mine

1063
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,000
is really good at casting spells.

1064
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,560
He also has a pack of wolves.

1065
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:38,319
Vampires don't like werewolves.
Have you ever seen the Twinglight movies?

1066
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:41,319
-It's called Twilight.
-Right. Twilight.

1067
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,920
Eclipse.

1068
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,880
Sis Taew, Moddam and Tookta.

1069
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,640
-What took you so long?
-It's Cartoon, not Tookta.

1070
01:11:55,715 --> 01:11:57,479
Cartoon or Tookta,
quite the same thing.

1071
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,159
-It's not.
-What's wrong?

1072
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,600
Suanswart went to a burial
at a goldsmith's shop.

1073
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,399
-Where's Suanswart?
-She's upstairs.

1074
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:09,520
You two go and get Suanswart.
I'll get Waewswart.

1075
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,039
How can you understand that?
She's babbling.

1076
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,760
I get it. She said Waewswart
went to Taengtong's tomb.

1077
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,159
You heard something
about a goldsmith?

1078
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:19,279
-They're both Chinese. That's why.
-Go to Taengtong's tomb.

1079
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:20,239
Come on.

1080
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:23,359
Taengtong.

1081
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Taengtong.

1082
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:32,239
Where is he?

1083
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:34,800
I dressed up for him.

1084
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:37,600
Taengtong.

1085
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,000
Taengtong.

1086
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,079
Taengtong is in danger.

1087
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,039
Taengtong Kyongye Yes
22 June 2528 - 30 January 2550

1088
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,920
-Waew.
-Why did you call me?

1089
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,319
Why are you up there?
Come down.

1090
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:10,640
-Should I?
-Yeah.

1091
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:14,079
-Chubby.
-Knew it.

1092
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:16,760
-Hit it.
-Who?

1093
01:13:18,039 --> 01:13:19,640
There are just two of us.

1094
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,079
Hey.

1095
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,479
-Why are you running in a zigzag?
-Doesn't it look more exciting?

1096
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,239
I want to hit you with this stick.

1097
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,520
Go. Just go.

1098
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,279
Come here.

1099
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,239
I'm standing on the wrong side.

1100
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,680
-Don't come closer.
-Don't.

1101
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,439
You dare?

1102
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,479
You dare?

1103
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,880
Oh, you do.
What do you want from me?

1104
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,119
You can't do this to me.
It's disgusting, bitch.

1105
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,359
I put on a fancy dress, bitch.

1106
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,319
Why do you need me here?

1107
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,520
Here.

1108
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,920
They're fake teeth.
You tricked me.

1109
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,960
Fake teeth.

1110
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,399
They don't have any fangs.

1111
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,880
Take them off.
Take your fangs off.

1112
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,720
Enough, bitch.
How dare you?

1113
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,479
My parents never hit me.
Who do you think you are?

1114
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,239
How about that, huh?

1115
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:21,920
What did you say?

1116
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,439
What the hell?
It doesn't make any sense.

1117
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,760
I'll call my mom.

1118
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,520
Why this location?
A graveyard?

1119
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:40,600
Take them off. Come on.

1120
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,680
Fine.

1121
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,439
I'll call my mom.

1122
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,960
Your saliva's dirty.
Don't you dare.

1123
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:52,039
-Oh.
-I'm coming.

1124
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:54,199
Huh.

1125
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,920
Here.

1126
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,920
Suanswart must be in that place.

1127
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,520
You want a piece of me?

1128
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,479
Hey, take a look.

1129
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:43,000
-Open the tomb.
-What?

1130
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,090
Me again?

1131
01:16:56,119 --> 01:16:57,800
Why so scared?

1132
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,359
Don't be scared.

1133
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,800
Bitch.

1134
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:05,159
What are those flowers on your head?

1135
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,920
She bought them from a funeral home.
Ms. Waewswart, here's your toilet.

1136
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:13,399
You put it down. Put it down.

1137
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:17,279
Suanswart.

1138
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,479
Shit.

1139
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:22,039
He's gone mad.

1140
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,520
What happened to his face?

1141
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,279
Want to pick a fight with him?

1142
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,079
-Yes.
-Do it yourself.

1143
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,439
Come on.

1144
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,600
Oh, you're here.

1145
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,359
Hey, that's rude.

1146
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,560
-They're boobs.
-Wolves.

1147
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,159
Right, wolves.

1148
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,720
Good boys.

1149
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,920
Bitch. That's worse.

1150
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,079
-Nosy.
-I just wanna talk to them too.

1151
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,319
Can you?

1152
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,479
I can't.

1153
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,880
Is this Taengtong?

1154
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:16,680
That all the girls are crazy about.
I've heard you have a golden dick.

1155
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,279
I'm dying to see that.

1156
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:21,039
Here, his golden dick is right here.

1157
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,800
-This is his dick.
-It's completely rotten.

1158
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,520
Taengtong.

1159
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,960
I'm going to kill you with my hands.
You'll be dead.

1160
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:35,439
Why did you stop me?

1161
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,720
-I didn't.
-Did you?

1162
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,960
I'm praying.

1163
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:43,840
What are you doing to Taengtong,
Waewswart?

1164
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,279
-What the fuck is that?
-Fuck you.

1165
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:49,800
-Oh, she's talking to me.
-I can hear that.

1166
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,199
Are those what you called eyebrows?

1167
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,680
Bitch, she's judging me.

1168
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,399
That must be Pancake,
the bitchy ghost.

1169
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,119
-Right.
-Good. You'll see.

1170
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,680
-Is it true--
-You bitch.

1171
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,000
It's good that you're here, Pancake.
You're gonna die.

1172
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:09,079
Get that toilet.

1173
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,720
-You wanna poop?
-I'm gonna kill you.

1174
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:15,560
-You can't do that. That's my room.
-You can go to hell.

1175
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,560
Oh.

1176
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,039
Who are these people?

1177
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,640
Pancake, can you remember
where you died?

1178
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,119
-No.
-You have to die right there again.

1179
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,359
No.

1180
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,560
Hey.

1181
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,960
-Pancake.
-Sis.

1182
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:35,479
Sis, help me please.
Oh.

1183
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,199
You're stunned by my hair?

1184
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:40,279
Your hair's just perfectly matched
with the location.

1185
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,640
Waewswart, look at my hair.

1186
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,680
-Give me a hammer.
-Sis, help me.

1187
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,359
-Bitch, you almost hit my face.
-I'm not good at it.

1188
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,880
Ouch, sis.

1189
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,119
-You die, Pancake.
-No.

1190
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,039
Don't.

1191
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,159
Don't do it.

1192
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,479
Fuck. It's not broken.

1193
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,840
Oops.

1194
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,840
-Why is it not broken?
-Harder. On its side.

1195
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:15,680
-On its side?
-Yeah.

1196
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,600
Pancake.

1197
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,720
-No.
-Sis.

1198
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,560
You die.

1199
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:28,920
Pancake.

1200
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,399
-Are they following us?
-How should I know that?

1201
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,920
You two can't run away from me.

1202
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:44,479
-It's time for you to die.
-You want to kill me?

1203
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,000
You'd have no reason.

1204
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:49,159
Your laugh is terrible.

1205
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,239
What's wrong?

1206
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,720
He's scared of a mirror.

1207
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,039
Look at this.

1208
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,319
He can't stand the mirror.

1209
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,359
Moddam, you broke the mirror.
What should we do now?

1210
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:15,279
Find a new one.

1211
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,560
My face.

1212
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:22,159
It has two sides. Look.

1213
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,600
Waewswart.

1214
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:31,039
Waewswart. You ugly bitch. You think you
can bully my mom? We won't let you do it.

1215
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,840
They don't get it.
Say it again.

1216
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,319
You can not hurt my mother.
I won't let you do that. You ugly moron.

1217
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,399
-What?
-Don't you get it, newbie?

1218
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,119
Do you understand that?

1219
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:46,680
-He said you're a dumbass.
-Don't be scared. Get them.

1220
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,399
Meet my wolves.

1221
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,439
Sis Taew.

1222
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:53,520
-Who's that?
-The toilet is here.

1223
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,039
What are you doing here, Karakade?

1224
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,680
I just brought the toilet here.
Here you are, Sis Taew.

1225
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:03,920
I know this scent.

1226
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:05,920
Don't be fooled, Ms. Waewswart.

1227
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,279
I took this toilet myself.

1228
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,359
Takaiduen,
I found the toilet you wanted.

1229
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:17,960
What an idiot. How on Earth
is that a toilet in bed? Over there.

1230
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:20,399
-Where is it?
-Here, Takaidao.

1231
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,319
-Must be this one.
-Yeah?

1232
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:28,399
You took that from the loo?
We poop in that one.

1233
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,600
This one is the toilet
Pancake died on.

1234
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,560
-That's a lie.
-Pancake.

1235
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,479
-Pancake.
-Your toilet is safe.

1236
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,439
-You can come back, Pancake.
-Sis.

1237
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,239
Over here, Sis Taew.

1238
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,920
I'm back.

1239
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:47,760
-Pancake!
-Taengtong.

1240
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:49,720
Pancake has come to rescue you.

1241
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,439
See that?

1242
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:00,399
-It's huge.
-We're going down, my flying dick.

1243
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,439
I'm sorry
for keeping you waiting.

1244
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,600
Well...

1245
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,199
I've changed my outfit.

1246
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,119
-Great.
-She's gorgeous.

1247
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,039
Waewswart.

1248
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,720
Mayfeung.

1249
01:23:18,279 --> 01:23:21,039
-My turn.
-You guys, get them.

1250
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:22,560
I'll handle this.

1251
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:26,600
Oh, werewolves.
You guys look hot.

1252
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:29,600
You don't know that I'm half Chinese?

1253
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:31,399
I'm gonna eat you all.

1254
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:45,840
You'll see what my stick can do.

1255
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,880
Do you think that stupid stick

1256
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:53,880
-can hurt us, the dynamic duo?
-Right.

1257
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,920
Everyone, be careful.

1258
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,479
You guys, move.

1259
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,199
-Waew, where are you going?
-What?

1260
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,800
-Do I have to stay here?
-Of course. We're the dynamic duo.

1261
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:06,000
You're right.

1262
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,479
Bitch, where is she?

1263
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,880
Khoi, watch out.
Follow me.

1264
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,720
I'll help you.

1265
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,199
Why are you interrupting me?
Get out.

1266
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,800
Get out.

1267
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,039
-Waewswart.
-What the hell?

1268
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,840
You die.

1269
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,479
Don't come after me.

1270
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:05,760
Werewolves?

1271
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,560
I'll make you bark like a dog.

1272
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,319
Run.

1273
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,560
Pancake, where are you?
Help us.

1274
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,760
Oh, sis.

1275
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,119
I haven't done anything
and you call me for help?

1276
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:33,880
Hurry up, Pancake.

1277
01:25:34,119 --> 01:25:35,199
I'll be back.

1278
01:25:39,399 --> 01:25:41,680
You'll die after seeing this one.

1279
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,119
Come on.

1280
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:50,399
What's he doing?

1281
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:05,079
Don't go.

1282
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,880
Khoi, get me some silver bullets.

1283
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:12,359
You ugly eyebrows, I gotcha.

1284
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,239
-Waewswart, what happened to your face?
-What?

1285
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,239
What's going on with my nose?

1286
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:50,479
-Wait. Wait.
-What?

1287
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,399
My back hurts.

1288
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,760
-Sis, hit the ball.
-Whose balls?

1289
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:03,119
I mean this ball.

1290
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:06,039
-What's gonna happen if I hit it?
-He will lose his power.

1291
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,680
He put all of his power into this ball!

1292
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,600
-Why don't you hit it?
-An old person has to do it.

1293
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,119
-Here.
-I'm younger than you.

1294
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:19,159
You think you're so smart, huh?
Your power is in this ball?

1295
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,640
He's tickled.

1296
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,920
Waewswart, you should try my stick.

1297
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:47,920
Oh, you have one too?

1298
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:49,680
-Where did you get it?
-From you.

1299
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,359
How? Mine's supposed to be here.

1300
01:27:52,439 --> 01:27:53,399
-Where's yours?
-Here.

1301
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,439
Oh, shit.

1302
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,279
-Here.
-Waewswart.

1303
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:13,520
It moves.

1304
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,920
How can you do that?

1305
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:17,920
Squeeze.

1306
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:55,960
I can't hold it anymore.

1307
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:05,680
See? That's what happens
when you mess with Pancake.

1308
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,600
Taengtong, Khoi's gun is jammed.

1309
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,279
Taengtong. Werewolf.

1310
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:40,239
Mane.

1311
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,680
-Do you love me?
-I do.

1312
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:49,039
I don't believe you.
Every guy can sweet talk.

1313
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,199
It's you, Mane.

1314
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:56,079
Taengtong.

1315
01:30:58,279 --> 01:30:59,199
Mane.

1316
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:06,479
Pancake is confused.
This is Taengtong. That's Mane.

1317
01:31:07,119 --> 01:31:08,119
How?

1318
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,920
Please
Please don't make me choose

1319
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,239
Because I can't

1320
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,600
I can't pick one

1321
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:32,640
I can't live without him
and I need you too

1322
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:36,119
I don't want to choose

1323
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,640
I want to keep...

1324
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,760
Both of you

1325
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:43,880
Ouch.

1326
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,119
I'm emotional here.

1327
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:51,359
Do whatever you want.

1328
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:00,479
-Khoi.
-Pancake.

1329
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,720
-Khoi, are you hurt?
-Taengtong.

1330
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:04,600
Taengtong.

1331
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,079
Taengtong needs help.
Taengtong is too weak now, Khoi.

1332
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:14,079
He died in the pool.

1333
01:32:16,279 --> 01:32:17,520
Can you stand up? Come on.

1334
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,720
Khoi.

1335
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:27,680
Is he gonna die?
He's already dead.

1336
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,279
Taengtong, go for it. Get him.

1337
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:35,439
Taengtong, go get him.

1338
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:41,279
Taengtong. No, Mane.

1339
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,039
Don't fight. Don't fight.

1340
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:48,520
It's because of my beauty. No.

1341
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,079
Wow, he's powered up.

1342
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:58,199
Taengtong.

1343
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:09,960
Taengtong.

1344
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:14,880
Taengtong, are you alright?

1345
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,319
Taengtong.

1346
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,439
Taengtong.

1347
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:26,359
Hurry up, the monks are coming.

1348
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,640
Quick.

1349
01:34:28,359 --> 01:34:30,119
Go. Go.

1350
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,279
The monks haven't been here yet.

1351
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,800
Not yet.

1352
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,439
Auntie Cartoon, hurry up.

1353
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:49,399
Beautiful.

1354
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,239
Cartoon is really beautiful.

1355
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,640
The monks are here.

1356
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:56,840
She is stunning.

1357
01:34:57,319 --> 01:34:59,199
-You've got goosepimples.
-Really gorgeous.

1358
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,079
Year 2008 outfit.

1359
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,479
-How do I look?
-Stunning.

1360
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,600
Strike a pose.

1361
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:09,439
Wait up.

1362
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:11,479
Auntie Moddam.

1363
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,479
-Moddam is prettier than me.
-She is.

1364
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,039
I need more plastic surgery.

1365
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,479
Yours was the second runner up.

1366
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,359
I spent more time dressing up.
It's the Year 2009 outfit.

1367
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,600
Year of Big Flu.

1368
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:27,720
The monks are here.

1369
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,600
-Over here, sir.
-Please.

1370
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:36,479
Bless you with longevity, happiness

1371
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,359
and health.

1372
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1373
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:45,439
You look happy after making merit.

1374
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,239
-We gotta go now.
-Right. Right.

1375
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:49,760
Have fun with your class.

1376
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:53,119
Sis.

1377
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:54,680
Wow.

1378
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,600
Pancake.

1379
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,760
The last one.

1380
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:02,359
Mom, it's Pooklook's.

1381
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,840
-Her dress is more beautiful than ours.
-This is Gam.

1382
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,920
Sis, I have good news.

1383
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:10,359
-What?
-I'm getting married.

1384
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,199
-Bullshit.
-Who's your groom?

1385
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:15,880
That's all you need to know.

1386
01:36:16,119 --> 01:36:17,800
Everyone, go inside.

1387
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,560
I'll take care of this.

1388
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,920
Bullshit. Getting married?

1389
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:25,319
Pancake.

1390
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,359
Excuse me,
my name is Pooklook.

1391
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,520
-Pooklook.
-What, Gam?

1392
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:40,439
You think you're pretty, huh?

1393
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:43,399
Well, I don't care for what you think,
but I...

1394
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,560
nailed it.

1395
01:36:47,079 --> 01:36:50,840
Nailed it? Nailed it, huh?

1396
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:54,079
See that?

1397
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:03,000
Bitch, you did the grand finale.

1398
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:05,680
You make me look generic.

1399
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,600
That squeaky ass.

1400
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,439
I thought my outfit
was the winner.

1401
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,439
Her ass just beat me.

1402
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:32,319
Congratulations, Pancake.

1403
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,760
You're a beautiful bride.

1404
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,079
Dearly Beloved, please join me...

1405
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:13,239
Father is so hot.

1406
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:16,920
Just kidding.

1407
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,840
...to witness these two
commended in matrimony.

1408
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,880
The bride and the groom,

1409
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,119
please join hands.

1410
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,079
Well...

1411
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,560
Not like that. Higher.

1412
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,319
Too high, take it down.

1413
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,560
Too low. I give up.

1414
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,880
Father,

1415
01:38:46,279 --> 01:38:47,319
I like your joke.

1416
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,760
So cute.

1417
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,880
That's enough.

1418
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:55,279
Pancake.

1419
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:59,000
Do you take Mr. Taengtong
to be your husband?

1420
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,680
Father, can I have your number?

1421
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,520
-What a slut.
-I do.

1422
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:10,960
Mr. Taengtong,

1423
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,439
do you take Miss Pancake
to be your wife?

1424
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,000
-I do.
-If anyone objects to the union

1425
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:21,079
of these two people, speak now.

1426
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,359
-I...
-Sis.

1427
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,199
Don't ruin Pancake's big day.

1428
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,359
No. I was going to say no one.

1429
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,800
Well,

1430
01:39:31,479 --> 01:39:35,000
I now pronounce Miss Pancake
and Mr. Taengtong,

1431
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,439
bride and groom.

1432
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,399
No, wife and husband.
I'm joking.

1433
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:45,640
You may now kiss the bride.

1434
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:48,760
Kiss him. Just let him kiss you.

1435
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:50,680
Closer.

1436
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,199
Closer.

1437
01:39:53,399 --> 01:39:54,760
Next time, me and Father.

1438
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,000
I have to go now.

1439
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,840
Good luck to you two.

1440
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:04,079
Father...

1441
01:40:07,399 --> 01:40:10,039
-you're so cute.
-Bitch.

1442
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:14,359
Wow.

1443
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:16,079
It's the time you've been waiting for!

1444
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,159
Throw it to me. This way.

1445
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,279
Ready, sis?

1446
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,840
-Cartoon, got it?
-I will marry Father.

1447
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:32,159
-I'm getting married.
-Give it to me, sis.

1448
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:34,720
I want Father to be my bae.
Give it to me.

1449
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,239
Where's Taengtong?

1450
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,640
He disappears every night.

1451
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,439
You don't care for me and our baby.

1452
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:50,520
I'm going to take a DNA test.

1453
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,640
I'm going to take a DNA test.
Why I am so stupid?

1454
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,760
I'm a dumbass.

1455
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,359
You keep following me
but don't give me a hand?

1456
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
-Can you manage?
-Khoi.

1457
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,399
You're so strong, Pancake.

1458
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:09,560
-Sis Taew.
-Over here.

1459
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,720
There. Over there.

1460
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,840
-Sis Taew.
-What?

1461
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,079
-I know who I want.
-Who, Pancake?

1462
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,319
-I want to know it.
-Talk to me.

1463
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:19,880
-What?
-You see my shoulder?

1464
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,920
-Pancake.
-Can you guys stand on the same side?

1465
01:41:23,239 --> 01:41:24,239
What are you carrying?

1466
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,560
You swear that you don't see it?

1467
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,720
Sis, ask somebody for me.

1468
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,199
Is there a therapist around here?

1469
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:31,880
-Why?
-I need to fix my shoulder.

1470
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:34,119
My love is so heavy.
He's breaking my shoulder.

1471
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:35,159
Cut.

1472
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:49,720
You're like the purest diamond

1473
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,960
Thirty-four has been lost

1474
01:41:53,079 --> 01:41:58,920
And sweeter than the sweetest honey

1475
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,520
-This comeback.
-Slate, please.

1476
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:05,319
Scene 30.

1477
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:06,399
-Sis.
-What?

1478
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:07,800
Ouch.

1479
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,800
Bitch.

1480
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,199
You closed the door on my hand.
Sis, I'm kidding.

1481
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,079
You had pizza?

1482
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,680
Slate.

1483
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,039
You old bitch. You can not hurt my mom.
I don't know what I'm saying.

1484
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,920
I won't stay with you.
I'm going to be a nun.

1485
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,079
-What?
-Be a nun.

1486
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:33,239
-Pee? The loo's over there.
-No, be a nun.

1487
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:35,920
-What? Do what?
-I said I'm going to be a nun.

1488
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:37,520
I can't speak Thai clearly.

1489
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,600
I have to repeat it too many times.

1490
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,640
You're such a whore.
Always flirting with guys. A slut.

1491
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:43,800
What?

1492
01:42:44,279 --> 01:42:46,640
You're a sex addict.

1493
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,479
You're worse than a dog.
Is that right?

1494
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:49,840
Worse than a dog.

1495
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:53,680
-Bitch.
-No.

1496
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,680
She forgot the Chinese parts.

1497
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,520
She did.

1498
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,239
