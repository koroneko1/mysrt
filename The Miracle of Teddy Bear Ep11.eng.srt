1
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you want to be gay?

2
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,319
Don't you want to be a man?

3
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
Are you and Nut in love?

4
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,840
Yes.

5
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
You can hate me all you want.

6
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,599
But I will never be who you want me to be.

7
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,159
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you
from dating a younger man?

8
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,360
Not all younger men are the same.

9
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,719
Don't generalize us.

10
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,319
Don't you have confidence in me

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,599
when I'm with you at all?

12
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,840
Didn't you say you had lots of homework?

13
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,800
You better go.

14
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,280
I want to drop you off at home.

15
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,879
I want to keep seeing your smile.

16
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,000
But my freedom

17
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,399
ended once I was at home.

18
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,439
Get home safely.

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,759
I'm going then.

20
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,319
Who was that?

21
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,360
Just a friend.

22
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,240
I know now

23
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,120
why you were angry with me.

24
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,959
I said the same thing as Tatarn, didn't I?

25
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
When I was at home,

26
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,399
I felt suffocated.

27
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,399
Tarn seemed to realize

28
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,839
that home didn't feel like home to me.

29
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,319
He tried to give me
a bit more time to smile

30
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,560
by the gate.

31
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,560
That's why you chose
to keep it to yourself

32
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,959
and didn't even tell your mom.

33
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes.

34
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,399
We were secretly dating for about a year.

35
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
It was risky

36
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,439
but exhilarating.

37
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,040
The more you were oppressed,

38
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,079
the more you wanted to rebel.

39
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Am I right?

40
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,240
I was so happy to beat them,

41
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
even though it was behind their backs.

42
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
But one day,

43
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,800
I almost got caught.

44
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
That scene really impressed me.

45
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,360
-Which scene?
-Take a guess.

46
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,439
-The book opening scene?
-Yes.

47
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,639
When the book was opened
and the music started,

48
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,920
I almost cried.

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,439
-Were you sucked in?
-Of course.

50
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,439
That person had a crush
on the other person for a long time

51
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,000
but they had to say goodbye.

52
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,000
Nut!

53
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,360
Dad.

54
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,319
Hello.

55
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,319
-Let's go home.
-Please calm down, Uncle.

56
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,399
I'm not your uncle!

57
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,519
-Come on. We're going home.
-But Dad…

58
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
We're going home.

59
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,519
Come on.

60
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,439
-But--
-Stop.

61
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,839
I said to stop.

62
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,959
I got away with it that time,

63
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,240
but luck didn't stay with me for long.

64
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,360
-What are we doing here?
-Just follow me.

65
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,639
Come. Sit down.

66
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,399
Gosh.

67
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,079
I was expecting a bigger surprise.

68
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,279
Nut.

69
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,360
In two months,

70
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,319
I'm leaving for Chiang Mai.

71
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm going to miss this.

72
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,159
Miss school?

73
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,720
School

74
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
and someone at school.

75
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,519
If you miss me,

76
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,080
you have this as a keepsake.

77
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,159
Seeing you in the flesh is better though.

78
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,919
How about

79
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,320
I go and study there too?

80
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,960
There's no need for that.

81
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,759
I don't want that to be your reason.

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,679
I want you to study
at the university of your choice.

83
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,879
But if I'm far from you

84
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,399
and we miss each other,

85
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,440
what would we do then?

86
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
We can do something before I leave.

87
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
What are you two doing?

88
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,679
It happened at the gym.

89
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,600
I was returning something
to the second floor,

90
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,919
at the gym storeroom.

91
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,039
What I saw was…

92
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,240
Peeranut and Tatarn

93
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,039
kissing each other.

94
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
I…

95
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,440
I am sorry.

96
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,279
-Hey!
-Please don't.

97
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,759
Mr. Sib,

98
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,240
I beg you.
Please don't start a fight here.

99
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,559
Go.

100
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,240
If you don't stop seeing him,
don't you dare call me your dad.

101
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,039
Come with me.

102
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,440
Once I broke it off with him,

103
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,879
I stopped feeling happy.

104
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,480
Can I see you one last time?

105
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,559
Tarn.

106
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,759
Nut.

107
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,039
I get it.

108
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,519
Even though this is it for us,

109
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,679
I'll never forget you.

110
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
In my heart,

111
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,559
all the space

112
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,000
is occupied by you.

113
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,240
I'm not dead yet.

114
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,399
I won't let you die before I do.

115
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,679
I want you to stay with this
for a long time.

116
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,039
I'm asking you to keep it.

117
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,720
One day,

118
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,000
if you're afraid
and you don't know what to do,

119
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,480
give it a hug

120
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,440
like when we hugged.

121
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,840
I believe that you're strong

122
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,000
and brave enough
to find your own happiness.

123
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,879
Thank you.

124
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,720
But I don't have anything for you.

125
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,480
I just want you to be happy.

126
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,320
Then I'll be happy too.

127
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,080
Can I ask you one thing?

128
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,960
Can I hug you one--

129
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Nut!

130
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,200
Why are you doing this?

131
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,240
Please don't, I'm begging you.

132
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,879
Dad, don't do it.

133
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
-Please don't.
-Nut.

134
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,879
Nut.

135
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,240
Don't do it, Dad.

136
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
-We're going home. Come with me.
-Nut.

137
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,720
-Come on!
-Nut.

138
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,960
-Come.
-Let go, Dad.

139
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,759
-Come with me.
-I said let go.

140
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,399
You're such a disgrace.

141
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,120
Have you thought of my reputation?

142
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,840
-Will you stay out of this?
-Come.

143
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,799
Come here.

144
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,039
What is going on?

145
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,000
-He sneaked off to see him.
-Mom.

146
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,919
They were hugging in the mall.

147
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,039
I told you to break it off.

148
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,480
But you went behind my back.

149
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,720
Do you want a beating?

150
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,679
Please don't. Stop it.

151
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,159
Please don't. Stop it.

152
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,600
Nut, don't.

153
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,559
You want to fight?

154
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,639
Do you have no respect for me?

155
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,639
Don't you respect me anymore?

156
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,399
If you want my respect,

157
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,679
you have to earn it.

158
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,120
Nut!

159
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
No, don't!

160
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
Please don't.

161
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,080
Why are you protecting him?
You damn moron.

162
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,080
Why protect him?

163
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,559
I don't want a fucking
mean dad like you either.

164
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,000
Where are you going?

165
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,039
Did you think you could run away?

166
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,279
Don't.

167
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,159
Nut!

168
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,840
Nut! Open up!

169
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,200
Open up!

170
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,840
Nut, open up!

171
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,759
How dare you raise your voice at me.

172
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,159
How dare you raise your voice
at your own dad.

173
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,159
Nut!

174
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,159
A little pervert like you
will never achieve anything.

175
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,600
You two are never going to last!

176
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,480
You want to see each other?
Over my dead body!

177
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,919
-Open up!
-Please don't.

178
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,240
-Please don't.
-Are you not opening up?

179
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,240
Fine.

180
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,680
Since your mom failed to teach you,
I'll do it myself!

181
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,680
What are you going to do?

182
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,119
What are you going to do?

183
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,440
That's why

184
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
on the day I woke up,

185
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,759
Nut was crying.

186
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,480
I should actually thank my parents

187
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,480
for ending my relationship with Tarn.

188
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
It gave me the courage

189
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,440
to do something
I never had the courage for.

190
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,519
Nut?

191
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,920
Why don't you come down for dinner?

192
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Your dad wants you
to take a military exam.

193
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,359
Please study hard.

194
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm not taking it.

195
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,480
I don't want to be a soldier.

196
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,279
If you won't be a soldier,
what do you want to be?

197
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,440
Anything.

198
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,119
I just don't want to be like Dad.

199
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,680
Will you please

200
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
listen to your dad?

201
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,279
He wants the best for you.

202
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
He wants the best?

203
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,720
For me or himself?

204
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,480
I've never been allowed
to do anything I wanted.

205
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,839
You wanted me to transfer, so I did.

206
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,680
You told me to end my relationship,

207
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,480
I did.

208
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,319
Now, you want me to stop being myself?

209
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Do I have any say in my own life, Mom?

210
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm sorry for making your life like this.

212
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
All you do is apologize.

213
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,680
You can be angry with me all you want.

214
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,559
But will you come down for dinner?

215
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,920
Your dad won't be angry for long.
He'll cool down when he sees you behave.

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
If you want to see a doctor…

217
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,039
I'm gay.

218
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,279
I don't have a disease.

219
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,480
It doesn't go away.

220
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,799
I agreed with no military exam,
yet you took the communications one.

221
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,440
It's what I want to study.

222
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,079
Reject that offer

223
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,240
and take the engineering exam.

224
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,599
If that's what you want, do it yourself.

225
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
Nut!

226
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,640
I'm going to study what I want.

227
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,599
I can transfer as many times as you like,

228
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,000
try out however many military services
or see however many doctors,

229
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,720
but I'll still be the same me.

230
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,599
But I forbid it!

231
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,359
If you want to do that,

232
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,039
wait until I'm dead!

233
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,039
Sure!

234
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,799
Since you two won't let me be myself,

235
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,720
I'll live somewhere else.

236
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,319
Since you despise who I am that much,

237
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,119
I'll tell everyone

238
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,160
that we are not related,

239
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
that I'm not your son.

240
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,039
Don't you ever say that again.

241
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,400
You are our son.

242
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,759
-Nut.
-Let him go!

243
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,839
If you step out of this house,
don't ever come back!

244
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,680
Your dad said that out of anger.
Don't take it to heart.

245
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,640
Why don't you eat something?

246
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,799
Go ahead and eat if you want.

247
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,319
Mom is good.

248
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,839
Good at making me behave.

249
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,759
Whenever we had a fight,

250
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,759
she would give us food

251
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,319
and apologize.

252
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
When in fact,

253
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,240
she simply wanted me to obey Dad

254
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,039
the way she did.

255
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,200
Even when I said I was leaving,

256
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,519
she still wanted me to concede to him.

257
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:07,400
She never loved me.

258
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,119
She wanted an obedient son

259
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,799
like you.

260
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,519
That's why she agreed to let you stay.

261
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,960
Is that why

262
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,640
you refuse to eat from your lunchbox?

263
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,359
I refuse to eat what she prepared

264
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,039
because whenever I see it,

265
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,279
I'm reminded of that day,

266
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,960
of what she said.

267
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,039
If I could turn back time,

268
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,440
I would rather have Dad beat me to death

269
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,480
than have the person I loved the most,

270
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,519
the person I thought would take my side

271
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,039
and protect me

272
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,359
turn against me like that.

273
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm so sorry.

274
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,559
I was going to lock up.

275
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,960
I'll leave that to you.

276
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,119
I get it now.

277
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,559
The reason you blow up at your mom…

278
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,160
is to resist the feeling of love.

279
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,559
You're afraid that if you love someone,

280
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,279
you'll lose them.

281
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,319
What happened at the mall…

282
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,119
You were hesitant to enter

283
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,119
not because of bad memories,

284
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,319
but because it's where you lost
your loved one.

285
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,200
You lost him for good.

286
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,559
I never realized that my backstory

287
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,200
had everyone upset.

288
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,880
This must be why he loved to hug me

289
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,079
when he was sad.

290
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
It wasn't because he loved the teddy bear,

291
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,720
but because

292
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,480
I represented someone he loved dearly.

293
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,559
I apologize for my lies.

294
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,519
I am actually hurt

295
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,400
and jealous of Tatarn.

296
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,359
Am I a liar now?

297
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,680
But no matter how jealous I am,

298
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,480
I'll always be here.

299
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,000
Whatever reason he had for hugging me,

300
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,720
his hugs

301
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
have always been my safe harbor.

302
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,640
Right now, he's in need
of a safe harbor too,

303
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,480
isn't he?

304
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,680
What can I do to help
Nut and his mom reconcile?

305
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,160
At first, you two fought.
Now, Nut and his mom also have issues.

306
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,160
If you won't help, be quiet.

307
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,319
Nut and his mom
have always been like this.

308
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,799
We've spoken about it.

309
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,440
But…

310
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
as you know,

311
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,240
he's a complex character.

312
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,519
He has been through a lot.

313
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,119
Right now,

314
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
he has a good person supporting him.

315
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,960
I think things are looking better.

316
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,039
They are a family. They'll talk it out.

317
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:40,039
Someone once told me,

318
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,039
to help another person understand,

319
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,039
you should be honest.

320
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,079
Talking is not that hard.

321
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,039
I'll give it a try.

322
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,119
That lot is now working things out.

323
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,119
This lot needs to do the same.

324
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,759
What's with that lot and this lot?

325
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,119
I'm not talking to you.

326
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,599
I have something important to discuss.

327
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,720
Tomorrow,

328
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,920
will you meet me?

329
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,279
I have something important to discuss.

330
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,920
Tomorrow,

331
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,160
will you meet me?

332
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,960
Hey.

333
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:22,880
What are you thinking?

334
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,400
Nothing.

335
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,680
If you want me to do that,

336
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,319
let me in first.

337
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,839
Just say what you have to say,

338
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,880
so I can go back to bed.

339
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,279
Why did you want to see me so early?

340
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,559
Let me ask you this.

341
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,359
Do you not like younger guys,
or do you just not like me?

342
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,680
You seem to like me, though.

343
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,079
Why do you pretend
that you have no feelings?

344
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,920
What's wrong?

345
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,639
I want to know what I have to do
for you to give me a chance.

346
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,239
Could it be

347
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,840
that whatever I do,

348
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,239
you're never going to like me

349
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,599
because you can't forget your damn ex?

350
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
Come on.

351
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,119
I'm being serious.

352
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,559
Not every kid is like that.

353
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,679
There are many good kids out there.

354
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,679
You don't have to come.

355
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,159
It's just a scratch. It's not deadly.

356
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,639
Once I get my salary,

357
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,639
I'll treat you to a meal.

358
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,440
It's just tiring

359
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
when you try your best to please someone,

360
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,480
but they don't even notice.

361
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,280
Why aren't you saying anything?

362
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
You're making me nervous.

363
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,360
Gen?

364
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,840
Is it you, Gen?

365
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,199
Win.

366
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,000
When did you get back from Australia?

367
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,719
A month ago.

368
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,679
May I ask

369
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,599
who you prepared this surprise for?

370
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,880
Your boyfriend?

371
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,440
Yes. We met when we were there.

372
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,079
We came back together.

373
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,159
I wanted to make it official.

374
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,519
You and I haven't spoken for three years.

375
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,679
I'm glad

376
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,679
that we can still talk.

377
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,360
Well,

378
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
we parted on good terms.

379
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,679
Even though I was upset,

380
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,639
I understood

381
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,840
that you had to plan for your future.

382
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,679
Back then, I didn't treat you well,

383
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,000
but you always treated me like a king.

384
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,039
Actually,

385
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,960
I did many things for you

386
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,199
without you having to ask.

387
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,920
You were head over heels.

388
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,320
Seriously though,

389
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,599
if I could turn back time,

390
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,519
I would still break up with you.

391
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,880
Good relationships

392
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,400
come at the right time.

393
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,519
-Song…
-By the way.

394
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,199
What is it?

395
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,400
I'm all grown up now.

396
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,400
I eat my vegetables,

397
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,760
but I no longer like cabbage.

398
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,360
Do you still grow it?

399
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,760
No, I don't grow it anymore.

400
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,800
I grow ivy gourd now, got it?

401
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,280
I thought you had left.

402
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,280
I can wait.

403
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,280
I just don't want to watch.

404
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,320
You're too sensitive.
It's because you're the youngest son.

405
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,400
What did cabbage boy want?

406
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,559
His name is Marvin.

407
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't care what his name is.

408
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,840
Tell me what you were talking about.
Are you getting back together?

409
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,519
Song, are you blind?

410
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,119
This is for his boyfriend.

411
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,239
Where would I fit in?

412
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,800
You didn't answer my question.

413
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,880
Did you have to drag me here
to tell me your answer?

414
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,159
I want to talk this through.

415
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,719
Here.

416
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,840
Drink this to cool yourself down
and listen to me.

417
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,519
Okay?

418
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,639
Okay.

419
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,079
You've talked with your ex.
Now, you have to talk to the new guy.

420
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,679
Why do you keep resisting me?

421
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,719
Why? Did cabbage boy hurt you that badly?

422
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
We were in a relationship three years ago.

423
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,599
He was 18 at the time.

424
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,199
I was 24.

425
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,239
Did he ask you out?

426
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,960
No, I approached him.

427
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,320
He was so cute.

428
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,039
I was generous with my money.

429
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,800
He liked eating cabbage, so I grew some.

430
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,880
I even cooked it for him.

431
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,840
It lasted less than a year.

432
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,960
He went abroad to study.

433
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,199
I told him I was willing to wait,

434
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,599
but he said I shouldn't waste my time.

435
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,599
Also, he might meet someone better.

436
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,760
When I saw him just now,

437
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,440
he stood by what he said before

438
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,239
and he's not sorry he said it.

439
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:47,000
Maybe he was focusing on his future,

440
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,679
but he obviously didn't love you enough.

441
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,199
That's why he let you go.

442
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,400
He and I are different people, you know?

443
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,639
I know that.

444
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,119
What are you afraid of then?

445
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,440
What happened to you in the past

446
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,599
made you lose faith in love,

447
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,800
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

448
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,599
People change.

449
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,159
You're young. You have a lot to see.

450
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,000
This is all I have to say.

451
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,039
Hey.

452
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,480
Hey, where are you going?

453
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,960
Hey.

454
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,639
So what if I'm young?

455
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,039
I'll grow up one day.

456
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,079
You're afraid I'll change,
but what about you?

457
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,199
If you were to die tomorrow,
what would I do?

458
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,320
Are you cursing me?

459
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,079
I'm not cursing you.

460
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,599
I'm serious.

461
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,199
What are you afraid of? It just
complicates everything and wastes time.

462
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,480
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

463
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,119
Why can't we just get together now?

464
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,039
Where are you going?

465
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,559
Can we talk this through?

466
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,360
Wait.

467
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,719
I'm going home.

468
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,800
I need to water my plant,

469
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,000
so it grows quickly,

470
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,000
like someone I know.

471
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,960
Are you agreeing to our relationship?

472
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,679
Finally!

473
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,679
I can't wait to eat some ivy gourd leaves.

474
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,119
-Hooray.
-Let me down.

475
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,239
We're in a park. Don't make so much noise.

476
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,880
I'll refrain from making noise.

477
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,159
-Let me kiss you instead.
-Don't.

478
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,039
Stop it. Keep your hands to yourself.
Do you hear me?

479
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,679
Look, there are people around.

480
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Okay?

481
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,280
I love you. Let's go home, shall we?

482
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,119
Come on.

483
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,480
-Are you driving me?
-Yes.

484
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,119
Get on my back.

485
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,599
One, two, three.

486
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,639
Let's go home.

487
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,480
Let me help you.

488
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,719
Are you thinking about last night?

489
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,440
Why would I?

490
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:54,320
You want to make things better, don't you?

491
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,639
You get irritable with your mom,

492
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,000
but you're not really angry.

493
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,079
You just…

494
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,039
hold a grudge.

495
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,639
You've been holding onto it for so long

496
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,519
and you can't seem to let it go, right?

497
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,599
You're such a know-it-all.

498
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,320
Someone once told me

499
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,639
that families should try
to resolve their problems.

500
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,719
If you love someone, you should say so.

501
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,840
If you want to understand,
you should talk to each other.

502
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,960
Mutual understanding

503
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,360
requires an open mind.

504
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,119
When did you get so smart?

505
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,840
Do you like it?

506
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,119
I like it.

507
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:42,039
I like listening to your voice.

508
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:48,599
Let me help.

509
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:12,360
Don't do what you did yesterday.

510
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,079
As long as Mom doesn't start it.

511
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,320
Nut.

512
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,719
All right. I won't.

513
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:25,840
Are you satisfied now?

514
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,400
I'm satisfied.

515
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,960
You're very cute like this.

516
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,480
If I'm cute, I want a reward.

517
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,960
Let me think about what to give you.

518
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,079
Kuenchai.

519
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,840
Mrs. Na.

520
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,639
Mom.

521
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,360
I'll check upstairs.

522
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,679
Mom.

523
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,079
Sorry, the number you've dialed
cannot be reached--

524
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,760
She's not upstairs.

525
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,320
Sorry--

526
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,840
Where did she go?
Why is her phone switched off?

527
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:46,920
I forgot to tell you

528
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,119
that her phone is broken.

529
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,360
I'll go and ask the neighbors.

530
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,239
Ms. Chair, do you know where Mrs. Na went?

531
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,840
Ms. Chair.

532
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,719
Ms. Chair.

533
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,760
Ms. Chair.

534
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:31,599
Chu and Nhong didn't see anything.

535
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,480
Kuenchai.

536
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,679
I have a doctor's appointment.

537
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,800
I'm going to see the doctor.

538
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,480
She is…

539
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,920
I forgot your mom
had an appointment this month.

540
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,079
I'm sorry for not taking good care of her.

541
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,199
It's not your fault. It's my fault.

542
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,159
You're worried about her too, aren't you?

543
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,159
-Hi, there.
-Hello.

544
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,800
Hi, Nut, Tofu.

545
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,960
I came to pick Mom up.

546
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,840
Really?

547
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,679
I saw her going that way.

548
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,159
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

549
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,119
The psychiatrist sent me
the preliminary test results.

550
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,000
You shouldn't worry.

551
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,559
The symptoms you described
could have stemmed from several causes.

552
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:08,960
It could be a side effect of the medicine.

553
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:10,320
How about this?

554
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,559
I'm going to run a few more tests

555
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,519
and do an additional blood test.

556
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,320
This way we can identify the real cause.

557
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,360
There she is.

558
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,000
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

559
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,360
Mrs. Na.

560
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,679
Are you all right?

561
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,400
Are you hurt, Nut?

562
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:27,960
Are you?

563
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,119
Are you hurt, Nut?

564
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:37,000
Are you?

565
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
Are you hurt?

566
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,679
He's bleeding.

567
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:51,960
Oh, no.

568
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,159
Does it hurt?

569
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,079
Does it hurt a lot?

570
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,440
Not at all.

571
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,320
How could it not hurt?

572
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,840
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

573
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,039
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

574
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,360
I cast a magic spell.

575
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,079
Your wound is going to heal soon.

576
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:52,840
Is it? Thank you.

577
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,679
Thank you, my boy.

578
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,920
Excuse me.

579
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,239
I've finished dressing your wound.

580
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:08,360
Thank you.

581
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:28,199
Does it hurt?

582
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,840
How could it not hurt?

583
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,119
How could it not hurt?

584
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:44,920
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

585
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,320
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

586
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,000
I'll go collect the prescription.

587
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:06,639
Sit down.

588
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:09,559
They found you?

589
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,880
Where were you going just now?

590
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,000
You left by the back door.

591
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,639
I was…

592
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:26,039
just thinking about stuff
without realizing where I was going.

593
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:29,960
By the time I realized it, there I was.

594
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:35,880
Next time, you should go with her,
so she doesn't get lost.

595
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,079
You seem to have the meds.
Make sure to remind your mom to take them.

596
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:50,760
Yes, Juea.

597
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,599
I'm at the hospital.

598
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:55,679
I have something to do.

599
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,960
Okay. Once I've taken Mom home,
I'll be there.

600
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,760
I better get going.

601
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,960
Sure.

602
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:09,360
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

603
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,480
Thank you.

604
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,000
Let's go.

605
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,159
NEVER FORGET THE GOOD DAYS

606
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,920
ALWAYS CARE

607
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,800
STILL WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

608
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,559
STILL WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

609
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,000
I broke up with him.

610
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,079
You two broke up?

611
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:13,159
It was my decision.

612
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,719
Why?

613
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,440
It's just…

614
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,960
I'm not over my ex.

615
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,599
I can tell that you really like him.

616
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,840
You must have been together a while.

617
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,559
He seems to have left quite an impression.

618
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,480
Only one year.

619
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:36,719
He was my first love though.

620
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,119
They say people tend to remember
their first love.

621
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,480
They also say first loves

622
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,440
often end badly.

623
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,920
Who was he?

624
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,400
My junior in school.

625
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,519
NEVER FORGET THE GOOD DAYS

626
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,440
SOMEONE SEE… AND VALUES

627
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,920
ALWAYS WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

628
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,159
ALWAYS WAITING, WHEREVER YOU MIGHT BE

629
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,280
Prib.

630
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,000
-Where's Juea?
-Hi, Nut.

631
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,440
Can you check this out?

632
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,800
-I want to know if--
-Watch out, Juea.

633
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,639
What's wrong with your arm?

634
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:39,400
I had an accident.

635
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,400
Hey, Nut.

636
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,840
I want to discuss the script
with you. Come.

637
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,800
-Ouch. Careful, Juea.
-Sorry.

638
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,079
-Nut, can you first check this out?
-Prib.

639
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:49,360
We have work to do.

640
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,199
You don't get it, Uncle Juea.

641
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,760
When am I going to finally find out?

642
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:06,880
The scene where Kawee argues with his dad,
and his mom hits Kawee.

643
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,079
You describe the mom's feelings like this…

644
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,360
His mom is angry
because he disobeys his dad.

645
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,280
Why would you think so?

646
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,480
I'll tell everyone

647
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,519
that we are not related,

648
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,159
that I'm not your son.

649
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,039
Don't you ever say that again.

650
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,679
You are our son.

651
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:33,199
Because his mom is angry.

652
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,199
This child who's been obedient
all this time

653
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,719
suddenly rebels and threatens
to cut ties with his parents.

654
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,880
As I read your script
and got to know your characters,

655
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,360
it seemed that prior to this

656
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,239
Kawee's mom was too afraid
to stand up for him.

657
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,840
But in this scene,

658
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,639
it seems more like his mom
is trying to protect him.

659
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,159
What do you mean?

660
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,880
If his mom doesn't hit him,

661
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,719
his dad probably won't stop.

662
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,840
She hits him
to avoid any further violence.

663
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,000
His dad might end up beating him to death.

664
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,119
But what she has done

665
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,840
shows that she is affected.

666
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,840
She just locks up the feelings of remorse

667
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,039
and pain inside.

668
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:30,400
So long as you're okay, it doesn't hurt.

669
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:34,440
However, if you're hurt,
I'll feel it even more.

670
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,119
Since you despise who I am that much,

671
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,079
I'll tell everyone

672
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,039
that we are not related,

673
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,679
that I'm not your son.

674
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,280
Don't you ever say that again.

675
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,400
You are our son.

676
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,039
If the mother protects her son
by hurting him,

677
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,239
how does she expect him to understand?

678
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,440
That's hard to say.

679
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,800
There's more to what she did
than I can get from the script.

680
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,239
It's not easy to tell
without scratching the surface.

681
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,320
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

682
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,599
WHAT IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?

683
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,800
Ms. Chair has fallen asleep.

684
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,679
The house is really quiet.

685
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,400
Mrs. Na has been very quiet too.

686
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,800
Surely, she's still upset
about what happened last night.

687
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:58,920
I think there's more to it.

688
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,679
Since we came back from the hospital,

689
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,960
she has been silent,

690
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,639
as if she has something on her mind.

691
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,440
Tofu?

692
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:25,639
Can you do me a favor?

693
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
I know that doing this is wrong.

694
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,280
If Nut finds out, he'll be angry with me.

695
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,360
I want to know what he thinks about me.

696
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,679
I want to know

697
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,920
if he says anything bad about me.

698
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,559
Why do you want to find out
all of a sudden?

699
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,280
Is it because of last night?

700
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,159
I made many mistakes in the past.

701
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,480
I want to find a way to correct them.

702
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,480
I want to make things better

703
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,800
before…

704
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,079
it's too late.

705
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,000
Can you read it out for me?

706
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,119
Okay.

707
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,639
Moving house

708
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,960
is such a hassle.

709
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,360
There are so many things to think about.

710
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,559
There's the house itself
and the people in it.

711
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,519
At least, living here is better
than our old place.

712
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,800
I haven't bought everything we need yet.

713
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,360
Fortunately, I brought my desk and chair
from our old house.

714
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,639
They might be old,

715
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:16,920
but I really like them.

716
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,880
It's my favorite desk.

717
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,480
I've written a lot on it.

718
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,039
I like sitting at this desk while working.

719
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,079
I feel comfortable writing on it.

720
01:02:33,239 --> 01:02:36,800
You used to tell me
that Nut wasn't home a lot.

721
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,119
But it sounds like he loves this house.

722
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,039
He chose everything in the house.

723
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,760
I'm terrible.

724
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,960
I've lived in this house for years,

725
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,760
but I've never thought
about how each item came about.

726
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:57,679
It's okay.

727
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,679
It's just everyday stuff.

728
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,599
But Nut's everyday thoughts

729
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:05,400
don't seem to include me.

730
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:11,880
I'm sure they do.

731
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,360
I haven't reached halfway yet.

732
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:26,519
Here we go.

733
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,719
Mom's phone is so old.

734
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,280
I'm getting my paycheck today.
I'll buy her a new phone.

735
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,360
I shouldn't have bought it.

736
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,760
She complained it was expensive.

737
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,920
What's the matter?

738
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:48,800
What else did he write?

739
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,599
He wrote that you complained
it was expensive.

740
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,719
I don't need something
this new and expensive.

741
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,760
You should have saved the money.

742
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:31,239
I didn't know what to do.

743
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,280
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

744
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,199
I should have told him how good it felt

745
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:43,440
that he had thought of me.

746
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,920
I should have at least said thank you.

747
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:51,920
But I didn't say that.

748
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,559
Nut wanted you to have a good phone,

749
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:01,159
while you wanted him
to keep the money for himself.

750
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,039
You both had different ways

751
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:05,800
of showing good intentions.

752
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,840
If you had been honest
with each other that day,

753
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,480
Nut wouldn't have been upset.

754
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,599
What else did he write?

755
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:22,960
There's more.

756
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,880
I've already bought
everything for the house,

757
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,400
but it's still so damn quiet.

758
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:33,199
Adding a new member to the household

759
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,320
should make it feel more like home.

760
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,400
And this little guy is supposedly smart

761
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,199
and easy to keep and train.

762
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,519
He makes a good companion.

763
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,000
He's just right for Mom.

764
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,840
He can keep Mom company while I'm at work.

765
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:03,800
Despite having heavy workload

766
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,639
that makes him unable
to stay home with you,

767
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,039
Nut is always trying to take care of you.

768
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,679
I'm very lucky.

769
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,320
He might be stubborn at times,

770
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,719
but he has always been a good son.

771
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,239
I know now

772
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:42,920
why she didn't want to read it herself.

773
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,880
She would rather not face
the harsh reality.

774
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,559
The reality

775
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:53,960
that Nut hardly ever writes about her.

776
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:57,079
When he writes about her,

777
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,639
it's not necessarily in a good light.

778
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:03,400
You've done your best, Teddy.

779
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:08,639
Sometimes, humans tell white lies
to make others feel better.

780
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,239
I wasn't intending to lie to her.

781
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:14,760
I know

782
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,760
that even when he writes about her
that way,

783
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,880
when it comes down to it, he loves her.

784
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,159
If the mother protects her son
by hurting him,

785
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:43,039
how does she expect him to understand?

786
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:44,960
That's hard to say.

787
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,880
There's more to what she did
than I can get from the script.

788
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,400
It's not easy to tell
without scratching the surface.

789
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:06,559
If you don't see us when you get home,
don't panic.

790
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,320
I'm taking your mom out for some exercise
as Dr. Kanya recommended.

791
01:08:20,119 --> 01:08:22,039
Since I moved here,

792
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:24,039
I've never come out for a walk like this.

793
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:29,319
As a matter of fact,
I haven't done it since I was a kid.

794
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:33,159
Back when I was still single,
I was a workaholic.

795
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,399
When I got home, I had to look after
my mom who was old.

796
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,359
After I got married,

797
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:45,800
I had to take care of the family.

798
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,880
You always put others' needs
before your own.

799
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,600
I grew up with my mom.

800
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,920
My parents separated.

801
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,039
It really affected my mom.

802
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,119
I just wanted to be good
to relieve her burden.

803
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,119
When I got married,

804
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,960
I wanted my children
to have a loving family.

805
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:24,680
Not like mine.

806
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:30,279
But Nut wasn't like other boys.

807
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,960
Isn't this pretty?

808
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,239
Nut. That's a girl's dress.
You can't wear that.

809
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,560
Why not?

810
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:47,199
Can't boys wear it? I like this dress.

811
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,640
Pink is for girls.

812
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,680
You are a boy.
You shouldn't like pastel rainbows.

813
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,319
It's silly.

814
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,439
Being different
isn't the same as being bad.

815
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,199
I admit that I was negligent back then.

816
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:16,079
I didn't know why Nut was like that.

817
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,119
I was genuinely concerned.

818
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,159
I was concerned about his future.

819
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,399
I wondered if he would be accepted,

820
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,600
if anyone would love him.

821
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,560
His dad couldn't accept it

822
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,479
and blamed me
for not raising him properly.

823
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,600
That's why I took his dad's side

824
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,960
and forbade Nut from being himself.

825
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,359
He's turning gay
because of your negligence.

826
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:52,680
He's just a nice boy.

827
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,359
Don't talk back to me.

828
01:10:54,439 --> 01:10:56,319
Boys have to be strong.

829
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,960
What kind of mom are you?

830
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:00,399
I'm not taking it.

831
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:03,279
I don't want to be a soldier.

832
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,199
If you won't be a soldier,
what do you want to be?

833
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,880
Anything.

834
01:11:08,439 --> 01:11:10,319
I just don't want to be like Dad.

835
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,159
Will you please

836
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,239
listen to your dad?

837
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:18,640
He wants the best for you.

838
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,960
He wants the best?

839
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,119
For me or himself?

840
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:29,640
I was weak and selfish.

841
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,800
As a mother,

842
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,359
I should have sided with him

843
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,920
and protected him.

844
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:42,720
Instead, I trampled on his heart.

845
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,000
I forced him to comply the way I did.

846
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,600
I forbade him from being himself.

847
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:03,600
I failed to support him.

848
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,399
I know that you feel bad about it.

849
01:12:25,399 --> 01:12:27,640
But now that you've acknowledged
what happened,

850
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,039
you feel better, don't you?

851
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,920
If you want
to get anything off your chest,

852
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,359
you can tell me.

853
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,159
I'm willing to listen.

854
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,760
After that day,

855
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,399
Nut avoided me.

856
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:03,000
He barely uttered a word to me.

857
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:07,960
I never had a chance to apologize to him.

858
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,239
After his dad passed away,
we became even more distant.

859
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,840
Nut.

860
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,439
Come for dinner. I'll warm it up.

861
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:31,720
There's no need. I've eaten.

862
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:48,560
Mom,

863
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:50,680
I'm moving to a dorm next week.

864
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,920
I knew that Nut moved here
because of my condition.

865
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,840
He didn't want me to be reminded
of what had happened before.

866
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,239
Despite our move,

867
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,399
the distance between us didn't change.

868
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,319
The longer it went on,

869
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:32,720
the harder it became to heal the rift.

870
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,800
Then I came to realize

871
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,039
that Nut didn't need me anymore.

872
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,039
I wronged him

873
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,960
because I grew up in an unstable family.

874
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,760
I wished for my own family to be perfect.

875
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,479
But in this world, nothing is perfect.

876
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:16,359
I used to fear

877
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:21,359
that Nut was abnormal for being like this.

878
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:25,119
In fact, being gay is normal.

879
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,680
These days

880
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:34,960
seeing him all grown up,

881
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,000
capable of supporting himself…

882
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,520
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH PEERANUT BURARAT

883
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,960
…being accepted by others,

884
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,159
with friends like everyone else…

885
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,079
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH PEERANUT BURARAT

886
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:22,319
I've realized that kids
should be themselves.

887
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,640
They should be allowed
to choose their own paths

888
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:31,840
with the support of their parents,

889
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,560
without being under control.

890
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,920
A child's life is their own,

891
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,199
not their parents'.

892
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,680
You accepted who he was long ago, right?

893
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,119
That's why you could accept me.

894
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,119
I never wanted to kick you out
like Nut always feared.

895
01:17:56,359 --> 01:18:00,359
I'm actually thankful
for your presence in our life.

896
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:04,720
I no longer care about
what others might say.

897
01:18:06,119 --> 01:18:07,640
The smile on his face

898
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,920
makes me realize what makes him happy

899
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,840
and what makes me happy.

900
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,960
Thank you
for throwing me a birthday party.

901
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,960
Do you like it?

902
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,479
Yes.

903
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,079
Do you like the party

904
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,119
or me?

905
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,920
What a cheap shot.

906
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,479
When you asked me what I wanted

907
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,560
for my birthday

908
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,960
and I said nothing,

909
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:50,039
that's because

910
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:53,640
I already have you.

911
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,479
Stay by my side…

912
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,760
and don't go anywhere.

913
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,840
Thank you so much

914
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:20,039
for making him happy.

915
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:26,680
You make him laugh and smile
like I haven't seen him do for so long.

916
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:31,479
Also,

917
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,520
thank you…

918
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:40,000
for being there for me

919
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,359
and supporting me through all this.

920
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,960
If I hadn't been sick, I would have
been able to talk to him more.

921
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,159
Now that I feel better
and I'm thinking straight,

922
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,880
it seems like it's too late.

923
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,640
It's never too late.

924
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:07,199
You can always start over.

925
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:10,119
You can do that right this minute.

926
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,840
Shall we go home?

927
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,920
Let's go.

928
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:24,000
How about this?

929
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,119
Think about it.

930
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,199
From what you've written,

931
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:29,960
the mother and her son

932
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:32,000
don't really show it,

933
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:34,760
but I can tell for sure

934
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,319
that they still love each other.

935
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,600
Do you think I should revise it?

936
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,079
You should ask yourself that.

937
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:48,560
You're the one writing it.

938
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,880
How the relationship
between the mom and her son will turn out

939
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,199
is not up to me.

940
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:57,640
It's up to you.

941
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,920
You came home late today, Nut.

942
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,079
I thought we might go out for a walk.

943
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,640
I took a walk with your mom.

944
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,439
We talked about many things.

945
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,119
She knows about us.

946
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,680
She's not opposed to it.

947
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,560
Perhaps she doesn't say anything,

948
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,479
not because she doesn't care,

949
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:33,920
but because she accepts who you are.

950
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,880
I know

951
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:44,960
that you're staying silent

952
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:47,279
because you're thinking.

953
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,840
Your mom is like this too.

954
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,359
If you listen carefully,

955
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:58,800
the silence

956
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:02,479
may hide deep love and concern.

957
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:09,560
Don't you think you should give yourself

958
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,800
and give your mom a chance?

959
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,079
You're quite the philosopher.

960
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:23,399
Are you talking now?

961
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,880
Today, your mom had sore feet.

962
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:34,399
Shall we buy her new shoes tomorrow?

963
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,960
Mrs. Na?

964
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,159
I came to tell you to dress up tomorrow.

965
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:14,119
Yes?

966
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,880
Why?

967
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,119
Well, we are going shopping tomorrow.

968
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,399
Nut is taking us.

969
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,880
Really?

970
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:15,039
Is this outfit okay, Tofu?

971
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,600
I don't go out much.
I only have old clothes.

972
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,840
You look great.

973
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,119
Where's Nut?

974
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:30,960
He…

975
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,239
Are they both your sons?
They're so handsome.

976
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,720
Yes.

977
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:49,720
He is my son.

978
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:52,600
He is also my son.

979
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,439
Tarn told me
that he wanted Nut to be happy,

980
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:01,079
and what happened between them

981
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,640
should just be left as a happy memory.

982
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,079
He was the one who made me understand

983
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:10,800
that being gay isn't a disease.

984
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:12,760
It's not down to bad karma,

985
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,640
or an emotional disorder.

986
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:18,479
And it's not a joke.

987
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:24,279
NEXT EPISODE

988
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:25,840
Tarn.

989
