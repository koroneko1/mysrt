1
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,037
Phuc!

2
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,676
I boiled some water in the kitchen.

3
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,170
Get me a glass of water, please!

4
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,471
Yes!

5
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,156
Ouch! It's too hot!

6
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,481
What's wrong with you?

7
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,927
I got burned by boiling water!

8
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,135
Why are you suddenly scalded like that?

9
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,135
Ouch! It hurts me so bad!

10
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,370
Phuc! 

11
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,370
Bring me some ice!

12
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,069
Let me see your wound!

13
00:02:14,943 --> 00:02:16,943
It's so painful!

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,434
Put your hands in there! It keeps you not blistering.

15
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:30,257
Does it still hurt?

16
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:32,257
It hurts so much!

17
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,459
So painful!

18
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:44,252
Please try a little more!

19
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,886
Where does the smell of medicine come from?

20
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,886
Is anyone sick?

21
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,390
No, it is!

22
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:23,019
What's the matter with you?

23
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:24,987
I got nothing!

24
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,613
I feel your hand is hot.

25
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:30,094
I'm fine!

26
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,220
You thought I could see nothing,

27
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,678
so you ignored my concern.

28
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:41,379
Give me your hand!

29
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,382
It's hurt!

30
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,943
Why did you say you got nothing?

31
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,943
But now you suddenly show it to me!

32
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Is it so painful?

33
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,564
Does it still hurt?

34
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,564
Yes, it does!

35
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,287
Phuc!

36
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,476
You think when loving someone, what will they be like?

37
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:38,717
How do you know I'm here?

38
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:41,478
Because of your fragrance.

39
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,585
Too aromatic is also an inconvenience.

40
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:50,257
You still don't answer my question.

41
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,467
Well...

42
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,843
They will want to talk, stick by their lover,

43
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:01,698
and want to see them.

44
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:07,281
I've always felt something strange inside of me.

45
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:10,228
 I got angry easily!

46
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,849
Every time I knew that person was with me, 

47
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,932
I became irritated.

48
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:16,932
Bit of a mixed blessing.

49
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,932
You might have late puberty.

50
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,940
It's successful puberty.

51
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,948
Hey, you...

52
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:28,165
I have no boyfriend.

53
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:30,816
I also don't put salt in your pasta.

54
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,729
So don't be mad at me!

55
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,874
Who got mad at you?

56
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,681
There!

57
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:43,154
It's exactly that face and that voice.

58
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,154
If these expressions aren't anger, what could they be?

59
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,610
You've fallen in love with someone, haven't you?

60
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,188
Do you think who I can love?

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,662
Well, if your lover is a girl, she is Nu.

62
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:08,568
If your lover is a boy, it's none other than me.

63
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,174
How confident you are!

64
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,004
I'm not pretty, but I'm very confident.

65
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
Do you want me to help you?

66
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,231
With my current situation,

67
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,616
hearing that person's voice makes me happy.

68
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:32,459
If we can do that, it's great!

69
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,376
Give me the phone number! I will call!

70
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,376
No need!

71
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,406
Why not?

72
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,406
I'm hearing...

73
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,429
Don't joke with me!

74
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:49,989
It's an important matter of a lifetime.

75
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:55,594
Let you be! I don't lie to you!

76
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,945
Can you walk alone?

77
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:06,657
I got there!

78
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,972
Hey!

79
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:41,576
Uh? Duy? 

80
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,240
Do you want to get a ride?

81
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,963
No, I don't! I wanna take a walk and go home later.

82
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,262
Well, let me go with you!

83
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,756
Yes!

84
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,397
Does your hand still hurt?

85
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,610
It's much better!

86
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:03,171
Nu didn't do it on purpose! Don't take it to heart.

87
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,978
Did Nu and you grow up together?

88
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,990
It's a kind of childhood sweetheart , isn't it?

89
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,364
I'm the son of a concubine.

90
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:20,098
That's why Thach speaks with a northern accent,
but I speak with a southern one.

91
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:26,034
So you don't live with your father, right?

92
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,350
 Previously, my dad came here for a business trip.

93
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,703
Then he met my mom and fell in love with each other.

94
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:38,148
Boom! After 9 months and 10 days, I was born.

95
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:41,763
He is a politician.

96
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,801
It's not good when having a concubine and stepchild,

97
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,331
so they didn't register their marriage.

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,830
After a while, my mom passed away,

99
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,830
so I came here to live with Thach.

100
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,830
After that, I studied abroad,

101
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,597
and my dad also passed away.

102
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,001
Mr.Thach is so good!

103
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,820
Since the day our dad died, he took care of everything. 

104
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,663
He shouldered our relatives.

105
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,375
But when getting into an accident, no one visited him.

106
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,422
How long has he been in an accident?

107
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,427
It's been two years.

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,675
At that time, there was also our sister in the car.

109
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,924
She's the same age as Nu.

110
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:28,032
It was an extremely difficult time for Thach.

111
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,705
He can't see anything and can't walk.

112
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,140
That changed all his life. 

113
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:40,774
I was still in the US at that time
so I couldn't care for him.

114
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,045
Fortunately, it has been for Nu.  

115
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:45,363
But things don't seem to get any better!

116
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:48,527
How about Thach's mom?

117
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,891
I have never met her before.

118
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,230
She broke off with Thach

119
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,692
because he was dating Linh.

120
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:04,584
She didn't want to accept him as her son anymore.

121
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,736
Since his accident, hasn't she come back here yet?

122
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:10,910
Yes, she has! 

123
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,549
But Thach didn't know it!

124
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,014
Anyway, he is still her son.

125
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:16,514
Yes!

126
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,194
She couldn't abandon her son!

127
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,077
Nu returned home to care for him for 2- 3 months.

128
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,790
When he got better,
she came back to continue studying.

129
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,518
How about Linh? Has she come back here? 

130
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:36,854
Yes!

131
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,143
But she came back here for money.

132
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,986
When Thach was hospitalized,
she took care of him until he woke up.

133
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:47,529
She disappeared after 2 -3 months at home.

134
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,046
Then she ran out of money and returned here.

135
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,666
She used the excuse of
caring about him to ask for money.

136
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,847
Thach is only 30 years old,

137
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:57,907
but he's very talented.

138
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:58,775
What?

139
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:03,714
That face and body belong to a 30-year-old?

140
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:07,131
You react as if it's the first time you know it!

141
00:12:07,131 --> 00:12:08,480
What time do you start your work?

142
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:09,687
Just a little more!

143
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,687
But now, I have to go to the park to see Nu.

144
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:13,060
What does she see you for?

145
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:14,795
I don't know!

146
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,723
So let me take you there!

147
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:17,783
No, I can go by myself.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Get in! Let me bring you there!

149
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,373
Yes!

150
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:41,881
Phuc! I'm here!

151
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:42,381
Yes!

152
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,285
I'm so sorry!

153
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,755
The teacher let me leave too late.

154
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,019
No problem! Just sit here!

155
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,742
Yep!

156
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,670
What did you call me here for?

157
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,465
Uhm...

158
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,116
I hope what I'm about to say won't make you sad.

159
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,309
Just tell it to me!

160
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,501
Could you quit your job?

161
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:05,246
I also stayed here, so let me care for Thach.

162
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:07,680
But did he allow me to do that?

163
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,210
Yes, he did!

164
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:11,053
I told him already, and he agreed!

165
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:16,112
Thank you for caring for him for the past 1 month!

166
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,721
It's my duty!

167
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,565
Ah? Are you going to leave right now?

168
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,402
Nope! I'll come to his house to get my stuff.

169
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,261
Get your things?

170
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:29,169
Well, just go home! I'll have the deliverer give it to you.

171
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:31,283
I can go by myself.

172
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,388
Ah... Let me go with you.

173
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:35,447
Yes!

174
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,447
Uhm! Let's go! 

175
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,953
How about the restaurant?

176
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,212
Why did you suddenly ask that?

177
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:51,144
Want to shave your head? Let me do it for you!

178
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,855
Why did you ask me to do that?

179
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,264
Uhm... Because lately, I felt the weather's too hot.

180
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:58,060
I wanna shave my head first,
but I'm scared of being ugly.

181
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
That's why I shave your head for a trial.

182
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:05,032
Have you just come, Phuc?

183
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,032
It's me, Nu!

184
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,683
Ah! I just think it's Phuc!

185
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,381
Let's clean up your stuff! Go!

186
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,514
Thach!

187
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:15,562
Is it Phuc?

188
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,339
I'm getting in there to take some CDs.

189
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:22,038
But you just lent them to me?

190
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,725
- But now...
- I also want to borrow it!

191
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,423
It's an introductory linguistics document.
What do you borrow it for?

192
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,399
I'll take it and leave immediately!

193
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,382
Where are you going?

194
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,611
Nu said that you let me quit my job.

195
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,104
I've said that when?

196
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:46,261
Would you say that because I came back here,

197
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,562
you didn't need a carer anymore?

198
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:50,678
Did I say that?

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,895
Yes, you did!

200
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,401
Ah! That day, Duy also heard it, right?

201
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:57,545
Did I say that, Duy?

202
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,509
I don't remember it!

203
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:02,442
So do I!

204
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,093
I remember that day, I was not drunk.

205
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:10,586
That night, we drank up the bottle of wine.

206
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,297
Maybe I said nonsense things.

207
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,297
Don't take it to heart! Just keep doing your job!

208
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,182
Yep!

209
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,182
So let me come in there to clean up!

210
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:40,529
One day, I'll treat you
the way people pluck a bird's feathers.

211
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,323
No matter what you're mad at, don't take it out on plants.

212
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,901
I think throwing rocks into the water
 seems to make you happier.

213
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:57,937
Then I will jump down there, right?

214
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:04,174
Why did you let Phuc quit his job?

215
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:06,174
I feel threatened!

216
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,519
Phuc does nothing with you!

217
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,149
He's just like Linh,

218
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:11,440
the poor living on others.

219
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,774
How can you say that? 

220
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,269
What? You love him, huh?

221
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,573
No, I don't!

222
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,188
Brother!

223
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:27,752
Did you say that when I was in trouble, you'd help me?

224
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,638
Is it right?

225
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:30,289
Yes!

226
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:32,061
Please love Phuc for me!

227
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,351
Then flirt with him!

228
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:34,462
You will flirt with him

229
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:36,462
and keep him away from Thach for me,

230
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,167
is it okay?

231
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,822
You think what my feelings are
that anyone can get it easily?

232
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not what I mean!

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,910
Don't mind who my brother loves and wants to go with.

234
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,768
How can you stop two people from falling in love?

235
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:48,313
But I love Thach!

236
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,484
I don't know what to do now!

237
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:52,484
It seems that Thach fell in love with Phuc!

238
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,484
I don't know what to do! Please help me!

239
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:55,858
Please help me, bro!

240
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,858
Thach is still in love with girls, right?

241
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,858
He likes Phuc just because
he wants to try something fresh.

242
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,350
Is it right?

243
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,733
I won't leave you at peace if you say any words.

244
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Suddenly, I think that

245
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Linh's departure is related to you, right?

246
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:17,045
I have my own eyes,

247
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,196
so I can see who he is.

248
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,055
I have a heart,

249
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:25,035
so I can sense for myself
who is good and bad for my brother.

250
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,769
I'm sorry! I can't help you with this!

251
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,205
His face is still as obnoxious as
when I first met him.

252
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,167
It's okay! He'll get angry if you keep asking like that.

253
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,383
God! If he says he had a boyfriend, I'll laugh to death.

254
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,813
Okay! Let's meet at the coffee shop! 

255
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,037
Thank you!

256
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:42,059
It's yours!

257
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:42,882
Thanks a lot!

258
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,181
Do you know the Rio coffee shop?

259
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,224
Yep?

260
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:50,224
I'm going there too!

261
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:51,811
I didn't say I'd go with you.

262
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,805
Hey, bro! Can I ask you this question?

263
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:12,427
You say your dish is only for high-class guests, huh?

264
00:19:13,002 --> 00:19:15,002
And people like us can't try it?

265
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,072
Oh! You are right!

266
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:18,609
We have no money,

267
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,829
but dishes you cook 

268
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,889
are just the food of poor people.

269
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:27,549
Stop being arrogant! You're not better than anyone!

270
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:32,397
You are just the one who cooks food.

271
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,110
There is no such thing as art here.

272
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,264
Who do you say is arrogant?

273
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,507
It sure is! If you've taken the interview,
 please cooperate with me!

274
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
One day, I'll force you to cook for me!

275
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,736
Leave me out!
