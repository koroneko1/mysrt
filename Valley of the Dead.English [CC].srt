Who told you about my birthday?

26
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,541
If I catch the bastard
who spilled the beans, I'll kill him.

[man] Ready!

28
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,958
No, no, no, guys, seriously now. 
For real.

29
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,666
Let's drop this already, okay?

30
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,500
Talk to my uncle, General Lozano.

31
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,333
Get him now.
This is a misunderstanding.

32
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,708
[man] And… aim!

33
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,541
No, I'm the General's nephew!
Let me go now!

34
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,500
If anyone dares to pull the trigger
you'll be in fucking trouble!

35
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,958
Stop!

00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,166

[gasps]

39
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,833
I'm very happy to see you here, Uncle.

40
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,125
You and I need to talk.

41
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,125
Release him!

42
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,791
Take him to my office as soon as possible.

43
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,041
Well, then…

44
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,333
didn't you hear him?

45
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,500
Let me fucking go already,
you bunch of hicks!

46
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,375
Uncle, I gotta admit that you had me
doubting there for a sec today.

47
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,708
Obviously, it was just for a split second,

48
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,125
but I swear,
I thought that was it for me.

49
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,666
I got there in time to stop them
from shooting you, Jan.

50
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,666
But they still want you dead.

51
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,458
Well, here I am, right?

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,291
[sighs]

53
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,041
Not for much longer.

54
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,250
It's the third time I've saved your life,
but it'll be the last time.

55
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,166
I convinced them not to execute you,

56
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,708
but in return,
they want something similar.

57
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,291
They want you to take this envelope
to Colonel Alarcos.

58
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,791
-Alarcos? But he commands the Sixth.
-Tell me something I don't know.

59
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,708
The Sixth is on the other side 
of the Sierra.

60
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,875
I'd have to skirt no man's land.
It's impossible.

61
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,166
I told you it was almost an execution.

62
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,833
You can't do this to me. That's like…

63
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,750
You head-butted a judge!

64
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,250
For the record, I hurt myself too.
It seems that doesn't matter.

65
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,916
You and your typical little jokes,
right, nephew?

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Well, as it turns out, that judge
is a lifelong friend of Franco.

67
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,291
They're almost cousins, you idiot!

68
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,416
Look, I had no clue he was Franco's
almost cousin. I'll keep it to myself.

69
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Those powerful men have had 
their eye on you for ages, Jan.

70
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:07,666
You've drawn too much attention saving 
those Reds from death with your trials.

71
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,458
"Private Decruz, accused of desertion
and cowardice on the national front."

72
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,041
You insisted on
freeing him from execution.

73
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,416
He's not a coward, he's just 
a 17-year-old boy who's scared to die.

74
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,958
I've done everything I can, Jan,
I wish you'd used your head better.

75
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,041
Yeah, well, Franco's almost cousin
doesn't think the same.

76
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,583
The judge sentenced you for treason.

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,708
The only way they'll overturn the sentence
is proving that you're a good soldier.

78
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,166
And you'll prove that 
by delivering this envelope to Alarcos

79
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,041
and coming back before dawn.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,166
-Maybe execution would've been better.
-Watch that mouth, Jan.

81
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,791
That fucking mouth.
If your father were alive today…

82
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,458
Get out of here and be careful.

83
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,625
I've already lost too much family
to this war.

84
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,333
Let me remind you, 
my brother's still alive.

85
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,750
Well, not for me.

86
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,541

[keys rattling]

88
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,791
-What's this?
-There's a vehicle outside.

89
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,250
You know I don't know how to drive.

90
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,875
Don't worry,
we've also thought of that.

91
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,041
[door squeaking]

92
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,750
[Jan] Private Decruz.

93
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,416
-Are they gonna shoot me already?
-[Jan] No.

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,958
Today's your lucky day.

95
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,166
[Decruz] Thank you, Captain,
but I didn't do anything.

96
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,208
[Jan] You were supposed to be 
fighting at Ebro,

97
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,750
but they arrested you
20 minutes away from Boiro.

98
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,208
Meaning you were scared shitless
and you ran to your mother.

99
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,125
-So there's a sentence already?
-Yeah, you're a coward.

100
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,625
-You can drive, right?
-Sure, in Boiro, when we were kids…

101
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,583
-I only asked if you can drive.
-Sorry, Captain. Yes, I can drive.

102
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,833
Very good, you'll drive me to the Sixth.

103
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,083
-To the Sixth?
-Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,875
But that's impossible, Captain.
There's no way to get back alive.

105
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,750
-Would you rather be executed?
-It's kind of the same thing.

106
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,708
You have a girlfriend?

107
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,083
I've got friends. A few friends, actually.

108
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,375
There's one in Boiro and one in Cambados,

109
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,000
but the one in Boiro is a better friend.

110
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,083
So you're a virgin?

111
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,625
In Boiro we're all virgins, Captain, sir.

112
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,500
-Are you good with weapons?
-It's not my forte.

113
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,791
And what's your forte, soldier?

114
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,500
I don't have any fortes, Captain, sir.

115
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,833
Mother of God…

116
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,833
Considering you're a coward 
and I'm a lawyer,

117
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,541
together we're a dangerous duo, huh?

118
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,666
[man] Captain!

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,708
Lozano! Hey, stop!

120
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,000
Montoya, what happened to you?

121
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,166
Uh, you see, shrapnel from a Red mine,
I barely survived.

122
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,875
These Germans say they can 
make me a prosthesis, or whatever.

123
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,083
Yeah, can't wait to be able
to jerk off again, huh?

124
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,000
[chuckles]

125
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,583
Uh, Captain, could I get a cigarette?

126
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,833
That old crow won't even let me
take a drag.

127
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,541
-Sure.
-Oh.

128
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,250
Mmm, thank you. Mmm!

129
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,000
[woman] What's going on?

130
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,666
Smoking is bad for your health.

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,166
So is the war, right?

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,583
Do you think those little stars
mean anything to me?

133
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,375
I'm in charge here, not you.

134
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,041
But what is this?
Was this sloppy job done by Laura?

135
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,375
When I get back from Garabandal
I'll show her.

136
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,625
Why are you standing there?
Let's go, I don't have all day! Let's go!

137
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,041
That's the old crow?

138
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,416
If she's going to Garabandal
she won't be back till tomorrow.

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,166
[man shouting in German]

[speaking German]

141
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,208
Wait, wait a minute. I said wait. Halt!

142
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,291
Fuck!

143
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,041
Thank you, Captain.

144
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,750
[ominous music playing]

145
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,166
[door clanking]

146
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,041
[Decruz] In Boiro I worked at
my uncle Chete's repair shop.

147
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,500
My thing is motorcycles,
but there's no engine that can resist me.

148
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,208
Cars, tractors…
If it has screws, I'm your man.

149
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can't we go a little faster, private?

150
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,708
Yes, we sure can, but I prefer to go slow,

151
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,125
that way maybe we'll live 
a little bit longer.

152
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,458
-Although maybe we could…
-No, no. I'm telling you right now.

153
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,083
-But I didn't even say anything.
-I'm not going to Boiro with you.

154
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,791
How did you know I would ask that?

155
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,083
Turn right, Private.
We'll cut through the valley.

156
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,458
-Are you sure about that, Captain?
-Mmm-hmm.

157
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,666
That's no man's land.

158

Just relax, kiddo.
I promise nothing will happen to us.

Sure. And are you just saying that 
or do you really believe it?

You can't pass through. 
Please turn around.

Well, I'm in a hurry. You can start
moving all that out of the way.

-That is confidential.
-I asked where.

183

Confidential means you know exactly

Alright. When we can, let's stop, okay?
I'm about to puke.

Well, you already asked if I'm a virgin.

197

Had to take a side, you know?

In my town, everyone sided
with the puff pastries.

201

"Puff pastries"?

202
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,875
The nuns add something 
that makes different.

203
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,208
And if you ask them, they won't tell you.

204
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,458
So, of course, with the war,
our first thought

205
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,166
was that if the Reds captured the nuns
the Puff Pastries would be gone forever.

206
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,500
We could never allow that.

207
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,583
You're telling me that puff pastries
put you in this war?

208

If you put it like that.

-Any motive is better.

00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,958
Seems to me you're not 
in a position to negotiate anything.

316
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,833
For now, we're taking both of you
to the camp and we'll see how it goes.

317
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,041
You caught me on a good day…

318
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,041
but don't push your luck.

319
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,833
Let's go.

320
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,333
Move it!

321
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:45,916
[Match] Walk!

322
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,166
Pulitzer, here I come.

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,791
Ahh!

327
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,250
[screaming] Get him off of me!

328
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,416
Get him off of me!

329
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,916
-Jesus!
-Get out of the way!

330

Oh, shit.

335
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,125
What the fuck is this?

336
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,916
[choking]

[gunshot]

345
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,166
Can someone tell me
what the fuck that was?

346
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,750
[Decruz] He was possessed.

347
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,500
Decruz, shut up!

348
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,250
[Brodsky] He's right.

349
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,125
Back in Mother Russia they say
that when those that passed away…

350
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,333
Brodsky, now isn't a good
a good time for your stories.

351
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,500
What stories?

352
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,500
I've told you a thousand times,
I'm Russian!

353
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,500
I was brought here as a child,
goddamn it!

354
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,125
You do have a taste for vodka.

355
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,291
Okay, that's enough.
Stop acting like children.

356
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,333
Match, how's the American?

357
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,500
There's nothing we can do.

358
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,041
He's pretty dead.

359
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,291
Let's get out of here.

360
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,458
Wait. Hold on, hold on.
You're gonna leave them like that?

361
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,625
-What do you want, a Christian burial?
-Sergeant, the fascist is right.

362
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,541
The American was an idiot,
but leaving him is wrong.

363
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,875
Fuck, man, don't you know 
how to check if someone's dead?

364
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,291
Ah, shit!

365
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,708
What the…

369
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,041
Brodsky, please. 
You know he was one of us.

370
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,708
I'm not so sure about that.

371
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,166
I can't believe it.

372
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,083
Sergeant…

373
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,083
[gnashing]

374
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,291
He's suffering.

[gunshot]

376
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,250
Okay, now we can go.

[planes droning overhead]

378
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,125
Now what?

379
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,375
Messerschmitt 109s.

380
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,458
No, these are Pablos.
The one that fell wasn't a Pava.

381
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:49,333
-Who asked you anything, fascist?
-The fascist is right, they're Junkers.

382
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,666
Where are they going?

383
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,958
[grunts]

384
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,875
Starting now, you'll only speak 
when I tell you, understand?

385
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,333
[gasping]

386
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,666
Try anything and I'll drop you
in your tracks.

387
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,583
Fascist, what's going on here?

388
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,916
I know as much as you.

389
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,708
We'll see when I leave you alone
with the Nail Clipper.

390
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:15,708
"Nail Clipper"?

391
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,875
What the hell, none of you 
have normal names here?

392
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,666
It's an appropriate name. 
You'll see.

393
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,000
He's our man for extracting information 
and he's the best at it.

394
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,416
That's 'cause you don't know 
my aunt Charo from Tudela.

395
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,291
I doubt you'll be so funny 
when you meet him.

398
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,208
That's at the encampment.

399
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,833
Let's go.

400
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,791
Fucking fascists.

401
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,041
Looks like my interview with
the Nail Clipper has been canceled.

402
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,250
Well, he was our only reason
to keep you alive.

403
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,375
Move, fascist!

404
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,458
[Sergeant] Ochoa!

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,333
Manolo!

406
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,125
Hey! Anyone still alive?

407
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,750
Fucking goddamn it!

408
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,583
I had a CS1 like this,
when they brought it to the garage…

409
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,625
It's an ES1.

410
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,708
And it was mine…

411
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,333
Of course, it's an ES1, whatever you say.

412
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,833
It's the same dust
the pilot was covered in.

413
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,791
That's enough.

414
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,916
You talk right now
or I'll blow your head off.

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,833
What's that fucking crap that you dumped?

00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,750
-I swear to God I have no idea!
-[Priest-killer] Sergeant!

417
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,916
It's Ochoa!

418
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:40,125
Kill them already
and let's get to the checkpoint.

419
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,750
Why the fuck would I do that?

420
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,541
[exhales]

421
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,750

out of here right now, guys.

What the fuck's happening?

427
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,083
Same thing as with the pilot
and the American.

428
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,833
There's only one thing we can do.

429
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,875
Don't even think about it!

430
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,125
It's Ochoa! She needs help!

431
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,583
I'm not getting near her, Sergeant.

432
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,416
[snarling softly]

433
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,041
Please, come on. 
Could someone just untie us?

Mary Mother of God!

Could you please untie us, 
like right about now?

438
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,583
What the fuck is happening?

439
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,958
Are they alive or what?

440
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,208
Father?

441
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,541
No! No, no, no! Kid!

442
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,583

-Shut the fuck up!
-[Jan] This doesn't look good, Sergeant.

No! They're fucking comrades,
we have to help them!

[Sergeant] No! Cease fire!

-Cease fire, they're our people!

You have to shoot them in the head!

We have to get out of here!
We can't do anything for them!

Let's get the fuck out!

Come on! Come on! Push!

Help us, you imbecile!

What about me? I can help you guys.

465
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,416
I don't trust you at all! Come on!

Come on, push!

[Sergeant] Let's go!

473
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:02,208
Gutiérrez, the Gardner,
and that kid from Manresa.

00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,125
Massip.

475
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,250
The dead are walking.

476
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,791
Their blood is dry.

477
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:38,125
The kid was right, they're possessed.

00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,791
Stop with the nonsense, damn it.

479
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:41,708
That's not possible.

480
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,875
Well, you guys shot the shit
out of the Italian pilot

481
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,291
and your comrades too, by the way.

482
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,250
Don't remind me, son of a bitch!

483
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,291
They weren't dead, they were walking!
You guys fucking saw it!

484
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,625
-They wanted to eat us.
-Will you shut up, Brodsky?

485
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:57,250
Well, yeah, it's true,
you saw what they did to Carlos.

486
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,000
Come on, fascist,
you must know what's going on.

487
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,000
You guys believe in nuns and all that!

488
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't have to believe in nuns, 
they exist.

489
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,666
You understood, asshole!
Nuns, priests, God and all that nonsense.

490
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,625
Look, in the Bible doesn't it say that God
rose up three days later in Bethlehem,

491
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,000
like those demons?

492
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:17,208
Let's see, first of all,
it wasn't God, it was Jesus.

493
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,375
Second, it wasn't in Bethlehem,
it was in Jerusalem.

494
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,000
Third, when Jesus rose the third day
he didn't start eating fucking people!

495
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,208
We know the same as you about that.

496
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,958
It bothers you, 
but we're on the same side.

497
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:30,666
No, that's not true. In this war, 
we're on the side of the Republicans,

498
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,625
and you guys on the side
of the fucking sons of bitches.

499
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,541
How nice.

500
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,166
Hey, untie him.

501
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39,666
Mmm.

502
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:42,666
Hold on…

503
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,083
I've got something to say.

504
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,000
[grunts]

505
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,291
Now we're at peace. Yeah.

506
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,041
Careful, careful.

507
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,541
"You can't die twice
if you don't escape death once."

508
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:59,958
What are you saying?

509
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,500
What-- What does that phrase mean?

510
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,791
It's not a phrase,
it's a Russian proverb.

511
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,583
Bunch of ignorants.

512
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,916
Brodsky isn't only Russian,
he's also a poet.

513
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, exactly like Machado, right?

514
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,416
Maybe they came back to life!

515
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,708
My uncle from Cambados
had a catalepsy attack

516
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:16,458
from drinking two bottles of moonshine.

517
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,458
They thought he died. Two days.

518
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,750
Until he woke up.

519
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,666
He vomited for three hours.

520
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,833
But three days later,
he was drinking moonshine again.

521
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,333
It doesn't sound like 
the same thing to me, kid.

522
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:29,500
All that doomsday shit is just a bunch 
of tales to scare the people.

523
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,041
If they were walking, 
they weren't all that dead.

524
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,458
They didn't attack each other.

525
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,750
What they wanted was us.

526
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,166
What do we do now?

527
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,375
We go to a hiding place we have near here.

528
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,958
Why, to meet more comrades of yours?

529
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:44,916
No, no, don't worry.

530
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,083
There's only weapons, ammunition 
and food. Well, and a radio.

531
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,208
Let's see if we can find out
what the fuck is going on.

532
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,583
Does the Captain agree?

533
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:55,500
I don't know. Any other options?

534
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,500
Yes…

535
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,750
We shoot you two
and throw you into the river.

536
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,666
Then it seems like a great plan.

537
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,041
[snarling]

538
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,583
If we hurry,
we'll get there before it's dark.

539
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:32,916
[bushes rustling]

540
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,125
What the…

541
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,875
What, here too?

542
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,333
[zombies snarling]

543
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,125
Fuck!

544
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,041
Shit!

545
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,333
I told you they were possessed!

546
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,916
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun, I can help!

547
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,208
Don't try anything stupid

548
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,291
or you'll meet the Virgin, Jesus 
or whoever the fuck you pray to!

549
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,083
This doesn't change a thing, fascist!

550
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,458
[Jan] Did I say anything?

551
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,875
-Come on, kid, move it!
-Whoa!

552
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,166
[growling]

553
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,083
Get the fuck out of here!

554
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,208

-Brodsky!
-Hold on! Hold on!

561
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,041
Let me go!

562
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,166
-We can't do anything!
-Let me go! Brodsky!

563
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,750
Clear out! Get out of here, come on!

564
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:11,208
[Brodsky] Get out of here!

Don't touch me, fascist!

568
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,041
Come on!

569
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,500
Why are those two still alive?

570
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:35,125
They're of no use to us!
Let me handle…

571
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,125
Haven't you had enough of this shit today?

572
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,541
What the fuck's wrong with you?

573
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,083
[ominous music playing]

574
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,833
Someone beat us here.

[all cocking weapons]

576
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,625
Just what we needed.

577
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,000
Wait… what's going on here?

578
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:50,458
It's a long story, actually, 
what happened…

579
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,250
Nobody move! Freeze! Nobody move!

580
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,750
No. Hold it, freeze!

581
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,250
I'm Captain Lozano, Requetés Regiment.

582

Requetés Regiment, my ass!

583
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:01,000
Drop the weapon, you fascist,
or we'll mow you down!

00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,291
[man] Drop yours 
or I'll blow your head off.

A fucking Arrow and a Muslim!

586
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,000
Hands up now or I'll take out your boss!

587
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,375
-Look at the fucking nun!
-Freeze. Everyone freeze.

588
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,500
Priest-killer, shoot her!

589
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,583
Do it! Soon enough I'll be running
after you trying to eat your guts.

590
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:17,833
What if I blow your head off?

591
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,375
Well, I guess that changes things.

592
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:23,125
Rafir, take out the old guy.
I'll take care of this runt.

593
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,291
Be careful with the old guy,

594
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,666
he'll blow your balls off
before you can pull the trigger.

595
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:28,833
Can we just drop this?

596
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,958
Stop aiming at him or I'll shoot you.

597
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,958
If it's about having balls,
let's solve this now.

598
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,791
-What are you waiting for, asshole.
-Hmm?

599
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,291
Don't aim at my captain,
or I swear you'll taste some lead, huh!

600
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,791
-You should take the safety off first.
-Sorry.

Shit! Shit, I'm so sorry.

604
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,208
-Are you an idiot?
-Nothing happened, alright?

605
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:51,625
We can shoot each other 
and whoever survives

606
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,583
can deal with the crazy ones outside.

607
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,333
Or… we can lower our weapons

608
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,208
and try to think of a way
to get out of this alive.

609
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,500
I don't trust the Arrow.

610

Lieutenant, identify yourself.

611
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:06,083
Lieutenant Jurel. Spanish Phalanx
of the National Syndicalist Offensive.

612
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,833
Good. You?

-You know what's going on?
-The dead aren't dying!

615
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,333
-What are you doing here?
-We were crossing the Sierra when--

616
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,041
-Rafir! Shut the fuck up!
-You shut up, Lieutenant!

617
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,500
From now on you will follow my orders.
Are we clear?

618
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:26,666
Alright.

619
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,833
Then answer me.
Why are you here?

620
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:32,041
The Junkers mistook us and shot at us
as we were crossing the Sierra.

621
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,083
Out of ten, only two survived.

622
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:37,000
And the next thing we know,
our own comrades were trying to to eat us.

623
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,916
So we ran through the woods
and came across Sister Flor.

624
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,583
And God guided our steps to here.

[scoffing]

626
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,708
Now there's a few more of us here,
so we have to work together.

627
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,333
Yeah, with the Reds 
who'll shoot us as soon as they can.

628
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,916
Oh, you better believe it.
Right between the eyes, huh?

-Match!
-Let's cut the crap already!

There's only one way
to get out of this alive.

Together.

632
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,416
So whoever thinks they'll do better
on their own can leave.

633
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:12,541
So be it.

793
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:50,958
I think I saw your demon tail 
poking out earlier.

794
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,208
You were looking at my ass?

795
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,000
No, no, I mean, I…

796
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:59,541
Where I come from,
all the men have very rough hands.

797
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,458
You've never been to battle, huh?

798
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:03,541
I'm a lawyer.

799
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,750
-A lawyer.
-Corporate.

800
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:08,000
What the fuck is a lawyer doing here?

801
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,791
Yeah, you'll be very useful to us.

802
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,625
Well, I broke Franco's friend's nose.

803
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,416
Well, actually, his almost cousin.

804
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,375
So, in reality, I've done more damage 
to the Nationals than all of you together.

805
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:21,166
A lawyer… Well, fuck me.

00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,041
Shit! There's one coming.

810
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:49,041
-Muslim, let me try your rifle!
-No way.

811
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,250
Only I touch Leila.
If not, her barakah wears off.

812
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,458
Fucking Muslim!
That one won't be up again.

We've got company!

The Muslim shot one
but the others are coming.

we don't know how many there are.

843
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,875
It smells like pig.

844

How do you know
what a pig smells like, Muslim?

845
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,125
Because I fucked your father once.

846
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,666
Oh, so you're a queer.

847
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,583
No.

848
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:33,541
It's nothing to worry about.

849
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,250
But if you fucked my father,
you're queer.

850
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,625
Yeah, he's right about that.

What's this?

854
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,833
They fenced off the valley.

855
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,416
Who fenced off the valley?

856
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,541
The Germans. I saw them roll it out.
They fenced off the entire valley.

857
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,541
They're frying.

Hey!

870
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,166
If the Nazis put this up,
then you guys must know something.

871
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,291
Right now we're all risking our lives,
fascist, don't fuck with us.

872
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:38,208
[sighs] They're not going to let us out.

873
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,083
Because we're in the middle 
of their operations.

874
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:43,083
You see that? I was right.

875
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:44,916
Son of a bitch,
you knew from the beginning!

876
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,375
No, wait, I can explain.
It's the same note you saw earlier.

877
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:52,250
I didn't know it had a hidden map,
It must be invisible ink, who knows?

878
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,000
I discovered it at the house.

879
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,166
What's it mean? It's German?

880
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,208
Yes, here it says something about hours, 
minutes, and advance speed…

881
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:02,666
Look, the dog recognizes 
his master's voice.

882
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,666
-Advance of what?
-Advance of troops.

883
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,833
No. What troops?
You seen any troops around here?

884
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,583
No, it's something else.

885
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,250
It's them.

886
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,291
What I know is that whatever's going on,
has its origin here.

887
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,041
You dragged us in with no warning.

888
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,083
No, I didn't drag you anywhere.

889
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:21,041
I have no idea what these things are 
or where they came from.

890
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,875
I am sure they don't care 
what side we're on.

891
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,250
At least they don't argue all the time.

892
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:28,333
They seem more in agreement than we are.

893
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,291
-Sorry, I meant no offense by that, huh?
-[Jan sighs]

894
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,750
Okay, let's see…

895
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:36,875
The good news is if there's a map,
they aren't at all places, right?

896
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:40,583
The bad news is that we're in the part 
of the map where we shouldn't be.

897
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,666
I don't know, we can keep walking
until they find us,

898
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,125
but the X is here.

899
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:45,541
There's gotta be a reason.

900
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,791
I say we try to find out
what the fuck's going on.

901
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,375
Are we in a frying pan
jumping into the fire?

902
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:53,916
Sometimes it's the only way to put it out.

903
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,791
Without setting a precedent,
the fascist might be right.

904
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,958
I vote for investigating it.

905
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,625
Without setting a precedent,
I second the four-eyes.

906
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:08,750
We've got nothing to lose.

907
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,291
-Decruz?
-Huh?

908
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,708
Oh, yeah, of course.

909
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,125
What are you afraid of, Jacinto?

910
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:21,291
The Virgin of the Sacred Heart
is with you.

911
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,125
Let's go.

912
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,791
Fucking democracy.

[ominous music playing]

914
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,833
Let's imagine for a moment
that the fascist is right

915
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:15,416
and there's something making
the dead become alive again.

916
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,000
If we find it, 
we gotta do something about it.

917
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,416
What are you saying?

918
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,250
That we could use it for ourselves.

919
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:26,416
Of course if we find it, we'll have to
get rid of our new traveling companions.

920
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:31,625
I just want to make sure that
you know where your loyalties lie.

921
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,541
I know exactly what side I'm on.

922
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,416
I hope so.

923
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,958
[Jan] It's not that late,
somebody should be up.

924
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,583
[Sergeant] Maybe they turned off 
the lights due to the bombings.

925
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:53,416
[Match] Or maybe they were all 
eaten alive.

926
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,000
What a battle.

927
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:09,125
No, this definitely wasn't a battle.

928
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,750
Here some were shooting
and others just took the bullets.

929
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,916
-Decruz, go see if it starts.
-Yes, Captain, sir.

It's the blue powder again.

00:56:49,791 --> 00:56:50,750
Hey, Sergeant!

If you're alive, show yourself.

00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,916
[creaking continues]

938
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,708
We're going to start shooting in three…

939
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,958
Two…

940
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,458
-One!
-Wait!

941
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:44,083
I'm out.

942
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,375
I'm out. Don't shoot.

943
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,750
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

944
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:53,791
You aren't dead?

945
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,416
Have you seen any dead people talking?

946
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,833
I've seen them walking.

947
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:58,916
And your leg?

948
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:01,500
I got hurt trying to escape.

949
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,125
Escape? From whom?

950
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:05,625
From the groom, I bet.

951
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:11,791
[Priest-killer] It's alright.
You're with us now.

952

[breathing raggedly]

00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,333
What's your name?

954
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:20,500
Ana.

955
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,500
And what side are you with?

956
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,041
A little bit of each side.

957
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:27,291
So the war's over?

958
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,458
Let's say we're in a parenthesis.

959
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,250
What happened here, Ana?

960
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,333
It was the happiest day of my life…

961
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,875
[sighs]

962
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:41,625
…until the Germans arrived.

963
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,708
[clattering]

964
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,083

[snarling continues]

966
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,291
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

967
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,875
-[tools clattering]
-Fuck!

968
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:58,875
My fiancé, well… my husband.

969
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:02,791
He fell on me, that's how 
I protected myself from the bullets.

970
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,416
Only one got me in the leg.

971
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:09,666
Then more soldiers arrived…

972
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,833
and they locked themselves up
in the church with those huge boxes.

973
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,708
I took the chance to hide in the cellar.

974
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,458
And then I heard the noises.

975
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,375
The dead began to move outside

976
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,916
and got up on their feet.

977
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,625
They wandered aimlessly around the plaza.

978
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:32,000
I wanted to go out,
but that wasn't my family.

979
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,666
That wasn't my husband.

980
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:37,666
The Germans would watch everything
from the bell tower and laugh.

981
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,833
Now and then they would capture a few
and took them inside the church.

982
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,750
They were doing experiments in there.

983
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,833
And we were their guinea pigs.

984
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,708
Then there was an explosion
in the church…

985
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,875
And that's when they stopped laughing.

986
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,625
Everything was filled
with the blue smoke again

987
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:04,333
and suddenly they were the ones
running around and devouring each other.

988
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,791
They tried to defend themselves,
but there were too many of them.

989
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,500
They didn't stand a chance.

990
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,583
With nightfall, everything got quiet.

991
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:17,125
I gained the courage to go out 
a few minutes ago.

992
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:20,000
I was crossing the plaza
when I heard footsteps and…

993
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,041
I thought it was those creatures
coming back for me.

994
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,500
But it was just us.

995
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:33,541
[ominous music playing]

996
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:38,750
[Ana] And I hid here, 
and that's all I know.

997
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,166
And where are the people now?

998
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,291
Where did they go?

999
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,875
[truck engine starting]

1000
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,083
-[Jan] Everyone to the truck. Now!
-You can hold on to me, I'm strong.

1001
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:53,875
What? She's a poor widow!

1002
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:55,958
[Sergeant] Come on, let's go!

1003
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,416
Not so fast, comrades.

1004
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,833
Huh? What the fuck are you doing?

1005
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,958
I found the formula that produces this.
We have the weapon.

1006
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,541
Perfect, then we'll take it with us.

1007
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:09,791
Yeah, of course we'll take it with us.
But they stay here.

1008
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,458
Fucking Republican son of a bitch!

1009
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,583
Next I'll aim for your head.

1010
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,875
Jaime, for your mother's sake, 
drop the weapon,

1011
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:19,166
-and let's all get out before--
-Shut up!

1012
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,916
This isn't a military decision.

1013
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,875
It's a political matter. 
and as such, I give the orders.

1014
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:26,166
We have to take this information
to headquarters.

1015
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,375
The Russians will know what to do with it.

1016
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:32,166
If we dump the powder on their cities,
we'll win the war.

1017
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,625
They'll kill each other.
We'll kill all of them.

1018
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,541
These people have helped us,
we can't leave them behind.

1019
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,583
Not only can we, but we're going to do it.

1020
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:43,333
But, of course, if you prefer, you can
stay here with your new girlfriend.

1021
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,291
What, did you think we hadn't noticed?

1022
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,291
I won't tell you again, Jaime.

1023
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,250
I'm fucking telling you to put it down.

1024
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,208
Watch your mouth.

1025
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,041
They're coming! We need to--

1026
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,583
What's going on here?

1027
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:02,083
You're a damn hick
who doesn't know anything!

1028
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,541
You're out of your league here.

1029
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:07,000
The Party gives the orders,
and I'm the Party representative.

1030
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,250
And you're all idiots.

1031

[grunts]

We can't go out that way.

1038
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:50,291
I know this church.
It has an underground exit.

1039
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:51,333
[Match] Of course.

1040
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:54,375
Rats always have several escape routes
in case they need to run away.

Are you sure about this, sister?

1042
01:03:00,708 --> 01:03:03,125
If those beasts get in
and this tunnel has no way out,

1043
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,708
we're pretty much fucked.

Look at those cowards run.

Of course they're not gonna wait.

"…and the God of peace 
brought back from the dead

1111
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,416
-the great Shepherd of the sheep…
-[zombies snarling]

1112
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,375
…our Lord Jesus through the blood
of the eternal covenant,

1113
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:50,625
to Him whom be glory forever and ever.

1114
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,708
Amen!"

1115
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:04,416
It looks like we're all clear,
and the truck's still running.

1116
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,333
-Decruz, you know how to drive it?
-Don't offend me, Captain.

1117
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,708
Great. What do you want to do?

1118
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:13,750
Listen. In Las Águilas there's a train car
with the same emblem we saw in the church.

1119
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,541
I think I know who's behind this.

1120
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,000
If we manage to get there--

1121
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,916
Stop, stop, stop.
Do you take us for idiots or what?

1122
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:22,041
Why would we want to go
to a camp with fascists?

1123
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:25,166
It's impossible they've unleashed
all this without having an antidote.

1124
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,916
-There must be some way to stop it.
-Why do you want to stop it?

1125
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,791
We already know it's a weapon.
And it's yours.

1126
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:34,333
We're already fucked in this war, there's 
nothing we can do against this. You won.

1127
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,208
My brother is fighting with you.

1128
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,041
My own brother is fighting with you.

1129
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,458
Every time I receive a dispatch
I think I'm going to find out that

1130
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:50,208
he's fallen at the front or that
he's in some prison waiting to be shot.

1131
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,750
Whatever happens, I lose.

1132
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:56,125
If we let that out of Las Águilas

1133
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:58,208
this war will never end.

1134
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:01,416
It will go on until none of us are left,
is that what you want?

1135
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,708
If we let that weapon get out of here,

1136
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,458
we all lose.

1137
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,416
Smooth talker.

1138
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,333
What did you do before this?

1139
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:14,833
He was a corporate lawyer.

1140
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:15,916
No shit?

1141
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:20,625
I also studied criminal law,
but haven't practiced it until now.

1142
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:24,291
I'm going to Las Águilas
to try and stop this.

1143
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:28,500
You can all come with me or wander around
the valley until you run out of bullets.

1144
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,791
If we enter Las Águilas
we'll end up executed or digging ditches.

1145
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,458
At least here we can take a chance.

1146
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:36,083
Oh, don't worry, 
we'll treat you very warmly.

1147
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,500
For us to end up like Brodsky,

1148
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,416
we might as well
shoot ourselves right now.

1149
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,708
Your little speech wasn't bad.

1150
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,416
But that doesn't change anything.
We lost the war.

1151
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,375
Fuck that. If we go to Las Águilas
and get--

1152
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:55,416
No, not this one, idiot, the other one.

1153
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,541
You won that one.

1154
01:08:57,458 --> 01:09:00,125
Even if we stop those bastards,
this country is yours.

1155
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,083
Listen, I'm too old.

1156
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:06,000
I don't give a fuck what happens to me.
They can kill me.

1157
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:07,583
But I do have one request,

1158
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:10,750
whatever happens, 
my comrades survive, alright?

1159
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:15,291
So let's find whatever we have to find
and make sure they make it back home.

1160
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:19,666
Swear to me.

1161
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,750
Hey, wait a minute. Where's Decruz?

1162
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,541
-He was here a second ago.
-Damned kid! Where'd he disappear to?

1163
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:31,875
[horn honks]

1164
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,458
We're ready to go now!

1165
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,333
[sighs]

1166
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:41,125
Well, look at that.
The fascist has some balls after all.

1167
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:45,166
Kid, the line that separates the brave
from the stupid is very thin.

1168
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:48,125
If only you knew, Captain, sir.

1169
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,125
[Sergeant] Let's get going!

1170
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,750
[Sergeant] So what's your plan?

1171
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,416
We get in, we find the antidote
and then we get out.

1172
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,041
-And you know where this antidote is?
-Mmm-hmm.

1173
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,541
More or less. Yeah.

1174
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,041
And you know this place?

1175
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:10,500
Yes.

1176
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,291
Well, actually I've only been there once.

1177
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,916
And that's the best plan we have?

1178
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:20,416
I don't know if it's the best,
but it's the only one.

1179
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:25,416
Great.

1180
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
[suspenseful music playing]

1181
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,458
That's the rear of Las Águilas.

1182
01:10:38,541 --> 01:10:41,166
There are some tunnels
that lead up to the main area.

1183
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:44,583
The train car I saw was there.
I guess it's their lab.

1184
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:46,041
We'll find out soon.

1185
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,416
Good luck, lawyer.

1186
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,083
This isn't a card game, I don't need luck.

1187
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,750
[suspenseful music playing]

1188
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:23,625
[guard] Halt!

1189
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:27,958
Not another step!

1190
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,666
I'm Captain Lozano!

1191
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,875
I brought a group of survivors!

1192
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:55,291
Do you always not give a shit
about your orders?

1193
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,041
I guess I'm like you that way.

1194
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,916
-Nice to see you, Uncle.
-Did you bring Alarcos' answer?

1195
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,166
As you can see I took a shortcut,
and I ran into a little problem on my way.

1196
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,000
But you managed to get yourself here.
You're your father's son.

1197
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:10,208
Let him pass.

1198
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:13,333
Mm-mm-mm-mm.
The orders are that no one enters.

1199
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,875
I don't give a shit about the orders.

1200
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,333
See how I'm just like you?

1201
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,333
I came with three soldiers
and some prisoners.

1202
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:20,750
I sent you to the Sixth
so you could learn how to fight.

1203
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:23,208
And that's exactly what I'm doing,
fighting for my men.

1204
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,375
I don't give a shit about your men either.

1205
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,500
You can see we're not that much alike.

1206
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:30,875
You want them to enter,
they have information about your weapon.

1207
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:31,916
You think I don't know?

1208
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,250
One of them reported your adventure
to the post in Moncayo.

1209
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:38,083
What he didn't know is that
we took over that post ten hours before.

1210
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,708
Your prisoners
have no fucking idea about anything!

1211
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:42,583
You don't understand
what's going on out here.

1212
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,500
[General] You're the one
who doesn't understand.

1213
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,958
The Russians have something similar
to what he have.

1214
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:49,666
They haven't perfected it,
but it's just a matter of time.

1215
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,166
Do you really believe
they'll think twice before using it?

1216
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,416
You aren't in your city office anymore.

1217
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,583
We're in a war 
and I'll win it at any cost.

1218
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,500
Despite everything,
the test has been a success.

1219
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,208
Now we'll be wiping out the valley.

1220
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:03,708
Best for you to come in
before they start bombarding it.

1221
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:06,083
Try to be reasonable, Uncle.
Those men are under my command.

1222
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,375
I gave them my word.
I can't leave them behind!

1223
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:10,291
[tense music playing]

1224
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:11,291
Come on, Jan.

1225
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,083
Don't fuck around.

1226
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,666
I'm not leaving them behind.

1227
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:28,375
-Captain!
-[cocking pistol]

1228
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,666
That's an order!

1229
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,583
What the hell are you doing?
Follow me, you fucking idiot.

1230
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,708
-What happened, Captain, sir?
-Good luck!

1231
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,375
-Hey, General--
-[machine gun firing]

1232
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,791
Fuck, I'm a fascist!

1233
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:51,625
Motherfuckers, you can't trust anyone
in this country.

1234
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,583
[General] Stupid idiot!

1235
01:13:55,666 --> 01:13:58,583
We'll have to delay the bombardment.
I'm calling Alarcos.

1236
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,166
[scoffs] Forget about that.

1237
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,625
You are no longer in charge
of the situation.

1238
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:07,041
Actually, you never were in charge.

1239
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:08,916
What are you saying?

1240
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:13,041
I'm the one in charge around here.
And my orders will be followed.

1241
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,250
Fucking German.

1242
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,291
[Sergeant] I told you 
it was a shitty plan.

1243
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,750
They'll get here sooner or later.

1244
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:40,125
And they won't care what uniform
they find in front of them.

1245
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:41,208
[Jan] No.

1246
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,625
They're going to bomb the area.

1247
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:46,333
The airplanes are on their way.
This will all become wasteland.

1248
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,750
Well, I'm not leaving
without making some noise.

1249
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,625
Match.

1250
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:06,333
-Got anything to blow up that den?
-I've got some siphons and dynamite.

1251
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:07,333
It might work.

1252
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:09,833
Where are my explosives?

1253
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,791
I've got them.

1254
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,416
What are you doing with that?

1255
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,000
Turns out you were right, Captain.

1256
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,833
I wanted to be brave…

1257
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,125
but I guess I'm just stupid.

1258
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:25,625
What are you saying?

1259
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,000
The plaza was pretty much clear.

1260
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,083
But not the truck.

1261

Where will you go now?

I'll try to cross over to France.

Fuck. I know this is 
a pretty shitty country, but France?

Yeah, but the thing is 
we did meet each other.
