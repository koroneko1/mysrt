1
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,920
Stay by my side…

2
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,439
and don't go anywhere.

3
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,800
Your mom said,

4
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,039
It's about putting your heart into it.

6
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,199
How are you involved with what happened
to Nut and his mother?

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,639
You're nosy because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

8
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,319
Why would I be jealous?

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Well, everybody loves her.

10
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
This includes Mr. Saen too.

11
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,719
Have you heard of the phrase

12
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,199
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

13
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,560
No. I've only heard of sympathy.

14
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,039
I'm off, Mom.

15
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,439
Tofu.

16
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
Want to see the series you were in?

17
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,520
Juea just finished editing the teaser.

18
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,479
Do you?

19
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,479
I shouldn't.

20
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,719
I just went out yesterday.

21
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,919
I was going to help your mom
with the chores.

22
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,400
Don't worry about me.

23
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,280
I'm healthy now.
I can take care of myself.

24
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,159
You should do what you want,
so you don't get bored.

25
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,479
Maybe another time.

26
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,360
I have a lot to do.

27
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,360
That's up to you. I'm off.

28
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Bye.

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,479
Bye, Keunchai.

30
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,639
Song.

31
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, Tofu. What is it?

32
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,720
Song. Can you do me a favor?

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,079
Do you know

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
which close friend of Neung
has a name that begins with "T".

35
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,959
Is it Thanayut,

36
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,480
Title,

37
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,639
or Tatarn?

38
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,839
Neung's close friend
with a name beginning with a "T"…

39
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,480
I think he's the only one.

40
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,959
Tatarn.

41
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,639
That one. They have a picture together.

42
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,160
This one?

43
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,360
That's right.

44
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,199
Watch this. I just finished editing.

45
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,240
There.

46
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,399
AN OLD STORY RETOLD…
AFTER A LONG WHILE

47
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,079
There's only one moon.

48
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,879
How about I draw another moon?

49
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,480
If you draw another moon,

50
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,079
the first moon will lose its meaning.

51
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,720
Then one is enough.

52
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,120
TATARN: SOMETIMES RAIN FALLS DOWN,
BUT SOMETIMES IT POURS UP.

53
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,759
TATARN: SOMETIMES RAIN FALLS DOWN,
BUT SOMETIMES IT POURS UP.

54
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,000
TATARN: I MIGHT BE FAR AWAY,
BUT I'M NEVER GONE.

55
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,320
TATARN: I MIGHT BE FAR AWAY,
BUT I'M NEVER GONE.

56
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,200
TATARN: I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE SAD.
I WANT THE WORLD TO BE NICE TO HIM.

57
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,759
TATARN: SOME THINGS,
WE HUG TO FILL OUR ARMS.

58
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,480
TATARN: BUT SOME THINGS,
WE HUG TO FILL OUR HEARTS.

59
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,639
Tatarn's Facebook is public.

60
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,519
It seems like he wants
to send someone a message.

61
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
That someone

62
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,559
could be Nut.

63
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
But there's not
a single photo of Nut here.

64
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,919
There's also no information
about Tatarn's whereabouts, job,

65
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,080
nor how to contact him.

66
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,000
TATARN, OUR LIFE

67
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
That man seems familiar.

68
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,399
Is it someone who knows Nut?

69
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,360
He's not just someone he knows.

70
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,639
He's someone Nut loved.

71
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,879
Why would you look at his pictures?

72
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,159
Don't worry about it.

73
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,919
He's the past.

74
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,279
Now, you're the only one for Nut, okay?

75
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Are you and Nut in love?

76
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,399
Yes.

77
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,559
You got it right.

78
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
We are in love.

79
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Tofu makes me happy.

80
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,440
He's the reason I can tolerate this house.

81
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,679
What are you trying to do
by asking him behind my back?

82
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,039
Are you driving him away again?

83
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,279
Are you doing the same thing again?

84
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,399
Don't go anywhere,

85
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,600
or I'll go with you.

86
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,600
If you can't accept it,
then I won't stay here.

87
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,039
Where are you going?

88
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,279
You're my son.

89
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,840
Your son is gay!

90
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
If you dream of a happy family
like you find in books,

91
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,039
I can tell you now

92
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,559
that it will never come true

93
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,879
because I like men.

94
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,759
I can never marry a woman
and give you grandkids.

95
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,120
Calm down, Nut.

96
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,879
Are you hurt

97
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,080
to have me as a son?

98
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
It hurts me, too,

99
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,559
that you're my mom.

100
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
You can hate me all you want.

101
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,120
But I will never be who you want me to be.

102
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Nut.

103
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,960
If you want me to stay,

104
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,159
I'll stay,

105
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,879
but I'll be myself.

106
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,159
I'll love him like this.

107
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you doing?

108
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,039
Nut.

109
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,200
Nut.

110
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,039
Nut.

111
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,159
Nut.

112
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
Let's talk.

113
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,000
You'll never understand
what I went through.

114
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
All you do is side with her.

115
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,960
I don't.

116
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,600
I just didn't want you to do that.

117
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,440
Nut.

118
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
Nut!

119
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,840
Song.

120
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:10,879
Here.

121
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,679
Why did you come all the way here?

122
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,120
I had a fight with Tofu.

123
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,279
I don't want to see him.

124
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,960
What did he do?

125
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,360
I'll change the question.

126
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,120
What did you do?

127
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,879
My mom knows I'm with Tofu.

128
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,799
What did she say?

129
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,720
I don't care

130
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,559
if she yells at me.

131
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,519
I won't break up with him like last time.

132
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,240
Are you saying
that you broke up with your ex

133
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,039
because of your mom?

134
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,279
What does Tofu have to do with it?

135
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,440
He doesn't understand me.

136
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,279
I kissed him in front of Mom to spite her,

137
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,559
and he just pushed me away.

138
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,759
I wouldn't just push you away.

139
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,919
I would dropkick you.

140
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,360
Why are you acting like a child?

141
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,440
Don't you ever consider his feelings?

142
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,600
What about your mom's?

143
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,279
Fine.

144
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,159
I know I was wrong,

145
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,279
but I wanted to hurt her

146
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,120
like she hurt me before.

147
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,840
All right.

148
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,279
Hey, come. Let's have lunch.

149
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,919
Here. These are all Nut's favorites.

150
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It has been a while.

151
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,559
Let's eat.

152
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,919
He has a boyfriend now.

153
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,879
He has forgotten about his friends.

154
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,840
Stop talking about him.

155
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,440
If I can't talk about him,
then you can leave.

156
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,720
Go home. Get out.

157
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,879
Hey, you're always welcome here,

158
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,600
but I would be glad
if you were happier at home.

159
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,879
Who's here?

160
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,679
How did you know Nut was here?

161
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,879
Lovers should know each other well,

162
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,399
just like how I know you.

163
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,519
You brought Tofu all the way here,

164
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,559
you can anticipate war.

165
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,160
Our weekend seems jolly today.

166
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,279
You guys must be hungry.

167
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,279
Let's dig in.

168
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,400
-Come on.
-Okay.

169
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,599
Let's eat.

170
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,319
I remember that you like eggplant.

171
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,559
-Nut.
-Get that for me.

172
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,359
I want that piece.

173
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,359
-Nut.
-Give me some fried pork too.

174
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,160
Do you want anything else?
I'll get it all for you now.

175
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,640
I don't.

176
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,799
Just eat. Don't bother me.

177
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:02,519
How can I eat when you're mad?

178
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,920
Whose fault is it that I'm mad?

179
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,079
Hey.

180
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,759
Whoever's fault it is,

181
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,240
let's clear it up after we eat.

182
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,519
It would be a shame to ruin lunch.

183
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,359
I don't know what you fought about,

184
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,720
but there aren't many chances for us
to eat together like this.

185
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,359
So the time that we spend together

186
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,599
should be a happy time.

187
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,720
The dining table is a war-free zone.

188
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,960
-We should enjoy the food.
-Right.

189
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,640
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

190
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,319
All right. That's that.

192
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
Let's eat,

193
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,079
so we can cheer up with desserts.

194
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,839
Do you think you own the place?

195
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,559
What?

196
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,599
You almost destroyed my home

197
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,759
by bringing Tofu here.

198
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:11,880
Just leave.

199
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,920
I won't.

200
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
-You won't?
-Right.

201
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Your dad invited me to stay.

202
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,720
Nut. Talk it out nicely, okay?

203
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,480
Thank you for lunch, Gen.

204
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,079
Thank you, too, Song.

205
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,440
Right.

206
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,559
Thank you for your meddling.

207
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,039
I'm so darn touched.

208
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,319
Let me tell you about Gen.

209
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,960
-What are you doing, Nut?
-Don't worry.

210
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
Nut. What did you say?

211
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,079
You'll find out soon.

212
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,640
What did he say, Song?

213
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,359
What is this?

214
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,240
Can we turn it off?

215
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,279
Gosh, Nut.

216
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
Nut.

217
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,319
Ouch.

218
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,839
Nut.

219
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,359
Tofu.

220
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
If something is bothering you,

221
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
you can tell me.

222
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,519
You might feel better.

223
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,359
I'm sorry

224
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,559
for what I did just now and at home.

225
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,519
I'm not mad.

226
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,160
I know you probably feel bad too.

227
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,599
Don't you?

228
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
I know I was wrong,

229
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,480
but Mom was wrong too.

230
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,519
It may be hard to imagine,

231
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,640
but Mom and I used to be close.

232
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,720
But as I grew up,

233
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:23,519
I found out

234
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,359
that we were never really close.

235
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,680
-Mom.
-Yes?

236
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,960
They say that Thailand
was never colonized.

237
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,519
What about the two times we lost to Burma?

238
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,960
Well…

239
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,279
we only count the Western Colonization
during the Rattanakosin period,

240
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,240
not during the Ayutthaya period,
since we weren't a country back then.

241
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,000
What are the pros and cons

242
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,319
of never being colonized?

243
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,599
What are we talking about?

244
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,119
I have something for you.

245
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,839
I'm hungry.

246
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,839
I'll cook you something.

247
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,400
Isn't this pretty?

248
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
Nut. That's a girl's dress.
You can't wear that.

249
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,839
Why not? Can't boys wear it?

250
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,599
I like this dress.

251
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:09,759
Pink is for girls.

252
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,759
What color is for boys, then?

253
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:16,319
Why can't it be pink?

254
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,160
Haven't I told you
not to let him play with these?

255
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,559
Sib.

256
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,559
-You shouldn't go so far--
-Shut it.

257
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,119
He's turning gay
because of your negligence.

258
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,880
-He's just a nice boy.
-Don't talk back to me.

259
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,240
Boys have to be strong.

260
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,480
What kind of mom are you?

261
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,079
Nut!

262
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,519
Honey!

263
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,359
Hey! Stop!

264
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,400
Do you see
he's wearing heels like a queen?

265
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,039
Do you want to be one?

266
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,759
Do you want to be gay?

267
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,799
Don't you want to be a man?

268
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Answer me!

269
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,079
What are you looking at?

270
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,440
What did I do wrong?

271
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,839
Why can't boys play with paper dolls?

272
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,240
Why can't we like pink?

273
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,680
Why can't we wear heels?

274
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,920
They never explained it to me.

275
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,680
just that they're not for boys.

276
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,160
My parents ruined my self-esteem

277
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
and made me feel abnormal.

278
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,160
Nut is a normal boy like anyone else.

279
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,640
Can't you see how girly he is,

280
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
-that he's queer?
-That's not true.

281
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,240
That's not what he is.

282
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,079
Are you saying I'm making this up?

283
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,400
How did you let him turn out this way?

284
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,359
Instead of saying,

285
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,559
"Nut might not be so manly,

286
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,680
but nothing's wrong with him,"

287
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,599
she just said,

288
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,759
"Nut is a normal boy like anyone else,"

289
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,319
because she didn't want to admit
that she let me turn out this way.

290
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,680
What are you doing?

291
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,359
I just want to know what you wrote.

292
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,599
Is there something I can't see?

293
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,279
What's this poem? It doesn't even rhyme.

294
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,279
What I write is my business.

295
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,039
The only thing I could do at home
was write,

296
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,759
but they took that from me.

297
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,680
They told me to stop writing

298
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
and focus on my studies

299
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,079
because I should join the military.

300
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
Mom knew that I didn't like it.

301
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,920
I hated everything about the military.

302
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,519
I didn't want to be like Dad,

303
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,400
but Mom asked me to.

304
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,559
They forced me to move

305
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,599
to a school where someone
can watch me for Dad.

306
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,400
I thought my world had ended.

307
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,640
But you know what,

308
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,079
that place gave me a new world.

309
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,039
A world that's bigger than home.

310
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
A world that changed my life.

311
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,359
Hey.

312
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
Hey, are you okay?

313
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,960
Neung, we should take him
to the infirmary.

314
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,720
What's going on? My goodness, Peeranut.

315
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,039
You're in trouble on your first day.

316
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:11,759
You two, take him to the infirmary.
Quickly.

317
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Be careful.

318
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,160
Hurry up.

319
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,119
My goodness.

320
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,880
Thank you.

321
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Thank you.

322
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,039
Thank you.

323
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, thank you.

324
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,039
You're claiming them all.

325
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,839
Neung. Here's a snack.

326
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,440
Thank you.

327
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Bye. Thank you.

328
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,639
I'm so tired today.

329
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,800
I waited for ages.

330
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,800
I barely played.

331
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,880
Hey, Neung.

332
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,000
You got snacks again?

333
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,480
-Man, I'm jealous.
-Right.

334
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,400
I can't eat them. Whose are they?

335
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,800
Throw them out.

336
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,159
I'll take them off your hands. I'm hungry.

337
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,280
Don't you want any? It's good.

338
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,760
Go ahead.

339
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,760
BASKETBALL TEAM ASSISTANT WANTED

340
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,639
New assistant?

341
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,639
Yes.

342
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What's your name?

343
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,199
I'm Nut.

344
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm Tarn.

345
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,960
Tatarn.

346
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
Tarn, come on.

347
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,400
Okay.

348
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,280
You can do it.

349
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,719
Hey, why aren't you in the girls' toilet?

350
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
You want to see our junk?

351
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,920
Does your dad know

352
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,840
you're a sissy?

353
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,599
Hi, sissy!

354
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,119
Think you can fight me?

355
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,760
Why don't you go
ask your beloved Neung for help?

356
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,280
Oh, sissy!

357
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,639
This is a toilet, not a kennel.

358
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,800
If you're not peeing, get out!

359
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,199
If you want to gang up,

360
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,719
meet me on the court.

361
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
I'll play all of you.

362
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,599
Hey, let's go.

363
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,880
Are you okay, Nut?

364
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,519
I'm fine.

365
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,880
Thank you.

366
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,719
What do you want to eat?

367
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,719
Up to you.

368
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,559
What about hotpot?

369
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,519
You were great.

370
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,280
Hey! Be careful!

371
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,039
Daydreaming again.

372
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,760
Are you okay?

373
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,239
I'm fine.

374
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

375
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,880
Tarn, get ready.

376
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,920
Let's play, Tarn.

377
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,480
Go on, Mr. Hero.

378
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,440
Do you like this book too?

379
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm just looking. I don't like it.

380
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,039
Just admit if you like it.

381
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,280
Why hide it?

382
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,599
I don't like it.

383
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,880
Take it if you do.

384
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,440
BE WITH YOU

385
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,880
What are you doing?

386
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,400
What were you doing?

387
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,280
I…

388
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,119
Wait.

389
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,599
Take this one too.

390
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:38,960
Okay.

391
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,360
Please move.

392
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,239
Just go.

393
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,000
-I'm going to the toilet.
-Hurry up, then.

394
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,079
Please let me go.

395
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm begging you.

396
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,840
Are you that scared?

397
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,039
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

398
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,199
What are you looking at?

399
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,320
I tried to avoid him.

400
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,880
But you know what,

401
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,119
the more I hid, the more I saw him.

402
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,760
I was such a child back then.

403
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,400
I was afraid he would find out
that I liked Neung.

404
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:15,920
He was a real prankster.

405
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,119
If he found out,

406
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,119
everyone else would too.

407
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,159
I was afraid my parents would know.

408
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:38,199
-Tuck your shirt in.
-Yes.

409
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,320
Don't come to school looking so scruffy.

410
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,880
I was in a hurry.

411
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,440
You still have to dress properly.
Where's your belt?

412
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,719
I forgot it.

413
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,559
Buy a new one. We sell them in the shop.

414
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:51,840
-Okay.
-Go.

415
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,239
Hey.

416
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:03,880
You're dropping him off.

417
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,960
Hello.

418
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:07,559
Go to class.

419
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:09,920
Goodbye.

420
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,880
Look after him for me.

421
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,679
Yes. Don't worry.

422
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,079
He's a good boy.

423
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:20,800
How is he at school?

424
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,559
He doesn't misbehave

425
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,840
and fits in with friends.

426
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:28,679
Waiting for me?

427
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:30,880
-Let's go.
-We can guide him.

428
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,840
Just guide him little by little.

429
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,360
It's still possible.

430
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,239
I chose to stop going to the club,

431
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,880
but there was still a cause
for us to meet.

432
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,880
They were one person short,

433
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:45,440
so they asked me to help.

434
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,559
I don't know why,

435
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,039
but I didn't feel the same with Neung.

436
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,559
Catch it.

437
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,159
Pick up the ball.

438
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:56,519
Tarn!

439
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,360
Focus!

440
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,480
Come on.

441
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,159
There you go.

442
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,159
Go.

443
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,519
-Ouch.
-Tarn, are you all right?

444
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:09,280
What's going on?

445
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,159
My arm hurts.

446
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,960
Let's take a rest.

447
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,599
You two, give him first aid. Go on.

448
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,559
-Hey.
-What is it?

449
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,159
My leg hurts too.

450
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,599
Slowly.

451
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,400
Next person, get ready.

452
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,679
You should practice.

453
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,400
I'll ask Nut to take me to the toilet.

454
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,800
Take care of him.

455
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,280
Come on.

456
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,400
Hurry up. I have to pee.

457
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:33,079
Do you need help?

458
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,039
Do you mind?

459
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,400
Do you really not want to see my face?

460
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,400
Just hurry up.

461
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,519
Wait for me.

462
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,440
I don't know if I held it too long
or if there's someone here,

463
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,760
but I'm nervous.

464
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,480
Are you done?

465
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,960
Yes.

466
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,960
You haven't answered

467
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,400
if you were really that mad at me.

468
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,920
If you can stand on your own,

469
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:51,440
I'm leaving.

470
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:52,960
Nut.

471
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,880
I'm sorry

472
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,079
for making you upset.

473
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,480
I don't want any bad blood between us.

474
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,320
It's okay if you don't want to look at me,

475
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,199
but please

476
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,960
don't hate me.

477
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,960
I don't hate you.

478
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,679
But you don't like me.

479
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,000
You not liking me now

480
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,360
doesn't mean
you won't like me ever, right?

481
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,639
I didn't answer,

482
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,880
so he planned to make me confess to Neung

483
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:49,800
on Valentine's Day.

484
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,320
He was a crafty guy.

485
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,119
He knew I would get turned down
since Neung already had a girlfriend.

486
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,679
Didn't you go see Neung?

487
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,559
I did.

488
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,840
I gave him the socks you asked me to.

489
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:36,920
He asked me to thank you.

490
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,840
Why are you here?

491
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,280
Well…

492
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:10,840
I brought you a Valentine's Day gift.

493
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,400
Let's exchange.

494
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,960
BE WITH YOU

495
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,679
TO NUT FROM 'T'

496
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,519
Let's go for milk near the school.

497
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,639
I'll wait until you come.

498
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,239
I didn't know that a rough guy
could be sweet.

499
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,920
You didn't stand him up, did you?

500
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,039
I didn't, because I…

501
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:27,880
waited for him myself.

502
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,400
I didn't know why I went there.

503
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:34,679
I probably wanted to challenge my parents

504
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
or just

505
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,119
wondered what would happen.

506
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:21,039
I thought you weren't coming.

507
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,400
You would drag me here

508
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:29,360
if I didn't come.

509
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,800
You know it's not you that I like.

510
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,159
Why do you keep bothering me?

511
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,119
Once you like someone, it's hard to stop.

512
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:49,880
Hey.

513
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:52,519
You've never dated, right?

514
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,920
I'm going to college next year.

515
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,440
If this year we try dating
and it doesn't work out,

516
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:06,480
then that's that.

517
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,400
Sounds good?

518
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,159
No.

519
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,159
What? Why not?

520
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:15,599
I thought so hard about it.

521
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,840
BE WITH YOU

522
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,840
You know it's not you that I like.

523
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,039
You also know

524
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:33,239
that Neung will only see you
as his junior.

525
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,679
I know that.

526
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,280
It's good.
Nobody needs to know about this.

527
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,239
Nut.

528
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,480
It's not like our lives will end

529
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:51,679
if we choose this path.

530
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,519
There's nothing wrong with it.

531
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,920
Even if you don't agree to date me,

532
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,639
BE WITH YOU

533
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,480
I still want you to reconsider.

534
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,400
Why so?

535
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,119
Have you tried their dessert?

536
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,559
No.

537
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,280
My parents don't like it

538
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,840
because it's too sweet.

539
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:21,000
Then try it

540
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,880
and see for yourself,

541
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:27,719
not from what others said.

542
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:35,960
If I eat this, you'll take it
as a yes, won't you?

543
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,800
Just try it.

544
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,239
How is it? Good?

545
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:33,599
BE WITH YOU

546
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,480
IT'S SWEET, BUT I LIKE IT.

547
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,559
IT'S SWEET, BUT I LIKE IT.

548
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,679
I didn't know

549
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,679
that a rough guy like you can be sweet.

550
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,719
Here you go.

551
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:09,920
Are you a masochist?

552
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,960
You keep listening even when it hurts you.

553
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,559
I won't tell you any more stories.

554
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:17,039
I'm really fine.

555
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:18,679
Do you want a mirror?

556
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:21,000
Your face doesn't look fine.

557
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,320
I just envy him a little,

558
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:29,559
I'm a bit jealous.

559
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,639
But when it comes to your stories,

560
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:34,480
I want to know everything.

561
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,519
You're just thinking of him,

562
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:41,679
but you aren't missing him.

563
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:51,360
Finally, I got to know
how Nut ended up with Tatarn.

564
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,760
Their love seemed fine,

565
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,840
but…

566
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,400
what happened
between Nut, Tatarn, and Nut's mom?

567
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,519
Why have Nut and his mom
had a problem for so long?

568
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:13,679
Right. What's your problem?

569
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:17,800
My dad asked what the problem was.

570
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,599
You've been watering for five minutes.

571
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,519
My vegetables are probably dead.

572
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,840
Gen cherishes that plot.

573
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,199
It will rot if you water it too much.

574
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,400
Gen will yell at you.

575
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,360
I don't cherish it.

576
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,480
My mistake.

577
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,079
You used to cherish it.

578
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,599
That plot was for his ex.

579
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:37,960
Dad! Don't.

580
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Is that true?

581
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,679
Yes. Well…

582
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,159
my ex wouldn't eat vegetables,

583
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:50,239
so I tried to get him to eat those.

584
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,800
He would only eat those

585
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,079
if I planted them.

586
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,079
That kid liked cabbage,

587
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,280
so he paid special attention to those.

588
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,800
Dad! Again?

589
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,199
I guess they're useless now
since you broke up.

590
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,960
Can't I plant them for myself?

591
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,559
I like ivy gourd leaves, though.

592
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,360
Listen.

593
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,199
When you leave my house,

594
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,199
turn left and you'll find a market.

595
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,800
Buy as many as you like.

596
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,440
Come on, mister.

597
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,760
I want you to plant those for me.

598
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,239
Just like this.

599
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,119
Please.

600
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,599
-Just a few.
-Why should I?

601
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,960
Plant them yourself.

602
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,480
I have the seeds.

603
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,559
Really? Where?

604
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:46,800
Over there.

605
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,199
I got them for free.

606
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,679
Are my vegetables just a giveaway?

607
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,719
Are you going to plant them or not?

608
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,800
Of course, I am.

609
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,280
Hey.

610
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,880
Mr. Sitha, cool it.

611
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,559
Well, yes.

612
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:15,719
Yes. Okay.

613
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,440
Wait. What's that?

614
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:25,119
What's that?

615
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,559
Meow.

616
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,960
-Meow?
-Hey!

617
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,360
What? Don't.

618
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,800
I know why you like ivy gourd leaves.

619
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,320
Why so?

620
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,880
They're creepers.

621
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,800
Hey.

622
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,639
There. Take that.

623
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,400
Come here, Song.

624
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,840
Stop.

625
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:56,760
I'll wash it for you.

626
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,440
Come on. Stop pestering me.

627
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:01,679
I'm tired of yelling.

628
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:07,559
I'm not fooling around anymore.

629
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,239
Let me ask something serious.

630
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:17,159
Do you not like younger guys?

631
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,400
What are you saying?

632
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,480
Earlier, Nut told me…

633
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,360
Gen won't like you.
He doesn't like younger guys.

634
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,039
Is it because of your ex?

635
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,880
Earlier,

636
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,440
your father said you went out

637
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,760
with someone younger.

638
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,639
Did your ex-boyfriend traumatize you
from dating a younger man?

639
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,639
Not all younger men are the same.

640
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:55,960
Don't generalize us.

641
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,280
The difference in our age
was only a few years,

642
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,039
yet my ex and I broke up.

643
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:05,280
Our age gap is nine years.

644
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,599
What if you meet someone better
in the future?

645
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,360
What if you become famous?

646
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,119
Your life has a long way to go.

647
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,559
That time hasn't come yet.

648
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:20,440
Why would you worry?

649
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,880
Do you think I'll turn out like them?

650
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,960
Don't you have confidence in me

651
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:37,800
when I'm with you at all?

652
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,239
I…

653
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:50,800
I don't want to risk it.

654
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,760
Hey, Gen.

655
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,960
Drink some water.

656
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,000
Thank you.

657
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:19,199
It's a little tough.

658
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:21,840
Gen is a stubborn kid.

659
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:27,440
I'm very serious about him.

660
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,800
I don't know what else to do.

661
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,920
Kanya and I were the same.

662
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:40,519
When I pursued her,

663
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:42,840
she was hard to get like Gen.

664
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,400
When older women marry younger men,

665
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,320
they worry about a million things.

666
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,840
People would say
she's going out with her brother,

667
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,079
or that she's my mom.

668
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:01,519
What did you do, then?

669
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,760
I just kept going?

670
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,639
You just kept going?

671
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,559
What else could I do?

672
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,800
If you really like him,

673
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,719
then show him that.

674
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,639
Just do it.

675
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,159
It won't be a waste.

676
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:23,480
As Gen's father

677
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,599
who raised him with my own hands,

678
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,559
his life has always been a breeze.

679
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,960
He got to study what he wanted.

680
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,119
He has a good job.

681
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,039
Nobody minds who he is.

682
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,800
Kanya and I have always understood
and supported him,

683
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,599
so he wants some things to be difficult.

684
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:47,719
Love, for instance.

685
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,039
I have to try harder, do I?

686
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,119
Do your best, if you can.

687
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,840
If you want some help, tell me.

688
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,239
I'll understand if you want to give up.

689
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,199
My son is high maintenance.

690
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:12,280
Thank you.

691
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:19,440
Cheer up.

692
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,360
Have you two eaten?

693
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:50,400
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

694
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:54,639
I didn't want to do that.

695
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,880
I was just afraid you wouldn't like it,

696
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:01,320
and that it would affect your health.

697
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,039
I didn't want it to bother you.

698
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:11,960
I'm sorry.

699
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,199
What are you doing?

700
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,119
I'm working.

701
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,439
A change of scenery.

702
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:28,600
I'm writing a boys' love screenplay.

703
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,399
I get inspired with you around.

704
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,760
I'll try not to make loud noises,
so you can focus on work.

705
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,399
You want to know

706
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,279
what I'm writing about?

707
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,520
If you want to tell me, I'll listen.

708
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,640
I'm writing about a boy's love.

709
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,640
Despite being a high school love,

710
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,279
it's not as jolly as a fantasy world.

711
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:08,239
I won't write about
such an idealistic world.

712
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,359
In reality,

713
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:13,720
it's hard for men to be in love.

714
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,199
Family, friends,

715
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,760
or people next door don't accept it.

716
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,359
That's just reality.

717
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:33,640
Oh. It's time for Keunchai's dinner.

718
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,399
He's probably starving.

719
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,760
Then,

720
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,119
I won't bother you anymore.

721
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:43,600
Work hard.

722
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,000
Come on, Keunchai. Let's eat.

723
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:49,479
Come on.

724
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Let's eat.

725
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,279
What are you trying to do?

726
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,800
Aren't you curious to see

727
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:09,840
what will happen if Mom sees us?

728
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,640
Let me help.

729
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:19,960
Tofu.

730
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,720
I want coffee.

731
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,359
Wait a second. I'm helping your mom.

732
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:27,479
I want it now.

733
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
You should make him coffee.

734
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,279
You're so slow.

735
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,680
Let me see it.

736
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,960
What are you doing?

737
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,119
I want your attention. Can't I do this?

738
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,960
You usually know how to make coffee.

739
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,119
Today, I forgot.

740
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,960
In case you're hungry.

741
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:15,279
Thank you,

742
01:12:16,359 --> 01:12:17,319
but I'm not.

743
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:24,239
Tofu.

744
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,279
Feed me. My hands are busy.

745
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:49,880
Thanks.

746
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:15,800
SCENE 36. BOOKSTORE. KAWEE, TONNAM.
KAWEE IS LOOKING AT BOOKS ON THE SHELF.

747
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:24,279
KAWEE IS LOOKING
AT THE FRONT OF THE BOOKSTORE.

748
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,439
I'll take it off for you.

749
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,159
You can go.

750
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,560
Since you're so inspired, any progress?

751
01:13:57,479 --> 01:13:58,520
Quite a lot.

752
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:00,720
Perfect timing.

753
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:03,359
Do a scene with me.

754
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,520
What scene?

755
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,640
You've only got that.

756
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:10,520
Just do what I say.

757
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,359
Stay still. I'll do the work.

758
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,039
Let's do a romantic scene.

759
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,439
Like this, Tofu.

760
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:21,159
What are you doing?

761
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:22,319
Come on.

762
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,560
Nut.

763
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,479
Nut!

764
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,960
Let's talk.

765
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,840
What's wrong with you?

766
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,520
Why did you do that?

767
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,239
You couldn't write a single scene anyway.

768
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,039
That's my problem.

769
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:56,399
It's not just your problem.
We live together.

770
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,560
Are you saying that if you're not happy,

771
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:05,199
no one else is allowed to be happy?

772
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:06,239
That's not right.

773
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:07,560
Tofu.

774
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,119
You saw it.

775
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,880
I went that far, but Mom still ignored me.

776
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,840
The more she ignores me,
the more invisible I feel.

777
01:15:17,319 --> 01:15:20,560
Nut, it's not your fault
for being who you are,

778
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:22,479
but it's not hers either.

779
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:26,760
Your mom is just trying
to keep everyone in the household happy.

780
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,239
It's fake happiness.

781
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,439
She keeps fooling herself.

782
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,680
She has never really known me.

783
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,199
How can we love each other

784
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,520
when we barely know each other?

785
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,840
What do you want, then?

786
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:43,800
If she knows the real you, she'll be hurt.

787
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,840
When she's hurt, you're hurt.

788
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:50,439
It's a circle of pain. When will it end?

789
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,920
Why don't you try talking about it?

790
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,359
I'm sorry.

791
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:07,159
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

792
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:09,880
I just happened to hear it
while passing by.

793
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,760
I'm really sorry.

794
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:14,039
What are you fighting about?

795
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,680
-I'm here.
-You're here.

796
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,439
What took you so long?

797
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,239
Gosh. Oh, take a seat.

798
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:31,279
Well…

799
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,159
Tofu.

800
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:37,239
You don't look so good.

801
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:38,720
Is there a problem at home?

802
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:42,520
Nut and his mom are fighting.

803
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,479
I don't know how to help.

804
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:48,279
It's a tough job.

805
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:50,000
Ever since I moved here,

806
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:52,359
Na and Nut are always arguing.

807
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:55,239
It's not that hard, Nhong.

808
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,119
Of course, there's something we can do.

809
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,720
Listen.

810
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:04,079
Na and Nut are mother and son.

811
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,119
Of course, they have some issues.
It's called a generation gap.

812
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,359
Generation gap?

813
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:11,359
Right.

814
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,119
Nut grew up in an open world

815
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:15,680
with freedom

816
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,840
and all sorts of information.

817
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,319
Whatever he does or asks, he needs facts.

818
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:25,439
On the other hand,
Na is framed within her society.

819
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,760
She's from my generation.

820
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,880
She needs to be meticulous
in everything she does.

821
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,680
That's her quality.

822
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,039
She was taught that way
since she was born.

823
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,880
They're from different generations.

824
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,439
They both have expectations.

825
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,680
Mother expects her son
to be a certain way.

826
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,199
The son expects his mother
to be a certain way.

827
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:47,640
The expectations
aren't met on either side,

828
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:51,039
so they hurt each other
without realizing it.

829
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:59,880
Wherever there's a gap,
you need to pay special attention.

830
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,359
It can be dangerous
if the gap is too wide.

831
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:07,199
How do we reduce the gap?

832
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,560
Hey.

833
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,920
The gap can be filled

834
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,520
with family ties.

835
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,000
If Nut and Na love each other,

836
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:17,640
they should talk it out

837
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,159
and maintain the ties.

838
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:21,720
It will be fine
as long as they communicate.

839
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:29,720
Because Mrs. Na and Nut won't communicate.

840
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,279
she does things
without asking what Nut wants,

841
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:36,520
as she thinks those are her duties

842
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,119
as a mother.

843
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,960
Nut also has demands from his mom.

844
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:43,960
He always acts sarcastically,

845
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,800
but he doesn't tell her what he wants.

846
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:52,960
The gap between mother and child
should be narrow,

847
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,319
but it keeps widening.

848
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,520
I don't want it to be like this.

849
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,439
Is there a way I can help them?

850
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,560
I'm sorry.

851
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,840
Okay.

852
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,039
It's not all your fault.

853
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:36,680
I don't know how hard it is to be you,

854
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:40,520
but it's not easy being your mom either.

855
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:45,800
You might have faced
many things in your life,

856
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,439
but your mom has too.

857
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,159
I want you to think about her feelings.

858
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,640
Thanks for reminding me.

859
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:04,880
I'll try to be a better person.

860
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,319
You're not that bad.

861
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,159
Try to be positive.

862
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,319
I think there are a lot more good things
in your life.

863
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:23,399
You're the good thing in my life.

864
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:27,680
It's not just me.

865
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,560
Think harder.

866
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:36,520
I told you.

867
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:38,720
I won't talk about him anymore.

868
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,119
It's okay.

869
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,920
I want to know everything about you.

870
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,399
I don't want you to act fine,

871
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:52,079
when you're actually not.

872
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,960
As long as you're not hurt
when you talk about it,

873
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,199
I'll be fine.

874
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,079
Continue.

875
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,359
After you agreed to go out with Tatarn,

876
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:16,800
how happy were you?

877
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,600
It wasn't just happiness.

878
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:26,560
The world at home

879
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:29,960
and the world when I was with him

880
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,199
were drastically different.

881
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,720
Nut.

882
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,039
Don't spend too much time on activities.

883
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,560
Your dad is worried about your grades.

884
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,079
And regarding that other matter,

885
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:02,239
you should behave.

886
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,720
I won't stand it if you disobey me.

887
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:11,239
Let's eat.

888
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:12,439
I already ate.

889
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,840
My parents act like I don't fit in

890
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,760
and that it's embarrassing.

891
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:46,079
Hey, Nut.

892
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,840
I wrote it.

893
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,560
How is it?

894
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,760
It's great.

895
01:23:15,319 --> 01:23:16,960
-Really?
-Yes.

896
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:25,560
You could become a writer.

897
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:29,479
But Tarn

898
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,640
made me feel like
I had discovered another world.

899
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:36,840
He made me feel like

900
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:40,279
I wasn't the only odd one out anymore.

901
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,520
Having a rough guy like him around,

902
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,399
who dared to do things
that wouldn't hurt anyone,

903
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,239
got me to open my mind
and I started to feel free.

904
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,000
Wait.

905
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,680
Nut!

906
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:33,640
Happy birthday, Nut.

907
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:38,000
I didn't think I would get one this year.

908
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,680
I wouldn't forget your birthday.

909
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,000
I added jelly for you since you like it.

910
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:48,479
Thank you.

911
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,399
Try it.

912
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:04,119
Is it good?

913
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,960
Feed me.

914
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:11,720
Okay. You can have a big bite.

915
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,840
Is it too big?

916
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,840
Is it too big?

917
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,960
Here you go.

918
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,039
Oh, wow.

919
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,039
Your lips are sweet

920
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:20,680
and soft like jelly.

921
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:42,039
What happened to you in the past
made you lose faith in love,

922
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:43,199
NEXT EPISODE

923
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:46,680
but I'm going to show you
how serious I am about you.

924
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,720
The reason you blow up at your mom…

925
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,439
is to resist the feeling of love.

926
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:58,640
But now that you've acknowledged
what happened,

927
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:02,760
you feel better, don't you?

928
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,159
You get irritable with your mom,

929
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,560
but you're not really angry.

930
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:11,359
You just…

931
01:29:12,359 --> 01:29:13,600
hold a grudge.

932
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,520
You're such a know-it-all.

933
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,159
Mom.

934
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:19,920
-Mom!
-Mrs. Na.

935
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,600
