1
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,119
Nadia? You were screaming.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,039
Yeah, I was having a nightmare.

3
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,359
Come on, time to get up.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,039
I have to open up the store,
get your father ready...

5
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,280
I can't manage everything alone.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,759
Coming, Mom.

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,679
Come on.

8
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,439
It's getting late.

9
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,159
But the alarm hasn't even gone off yet.

10
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
-He takes forever.
-What?

11
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
Ander, in the shower.

12
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,640
Once he goes in there, say goodbye.

13
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,319
We had to get a bigger boiler
because we'd end up with no hot water.

14
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,680
-Sit down. Want some coffee?
-No, don't worry.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,599
Don't be shy. Come on, kid.

16
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,439
If you're going to stay here,
I want you to...

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,800
I don't know,
to feel comfortable around me. Okay?

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,719
-I don't know how to thank you.
-You don't need to.

19
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,560
After I outed you to your father
in the school hallway,

20
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,000
it's the least I can do.

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
Relax. Before...

22
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,400
I became the pink sheep, I was already
the black sheep of the family.

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,280
I wasn't kicked out because of that.

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,439
Want me to drop you off at school?
It's on the way.

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,680
Now that you're back,
you won't want to be late.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,919
-I'm off. I have to meet someone.
-Without having breakfast? And so early?

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,520
You...

28
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,319
You're a selfish asshole.

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
How could you tell me that?

30
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,199
What do you want me to do?
Keep this shit to myself?

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,599
Polo, I can't.

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,759
-Don't scare me, Ander.
-I can't act like nothing happened.

33
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,759
I can't even look Guzmán in the eye.
You've destroyed his life.

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,520
-And you're going to have to tell him.
-No.

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,159
-You have 24 hours.
-No.

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,039
-Either you tell him or I will.
-Ander...

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,919
Let's talk about Polo.

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,319
Polo? Why?

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
59 HOURS MISSING

40
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,439
We are investigating

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,879
whether anything that's happened here
since the start of the school year

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,199
could be related
to Samuel's disappearance.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,479
Did Polo tell you
what happened at the pool?

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,319
Oh, boy, I'm gonna ask
the cleaning lady for a mop.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,919
-You're drooling all over.
-What are you talking about?

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,719
That suddenly the marchioness
has gone from evil Barbie

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
-to saint in your eyes.
-All I said was

48
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,960
that Polo's messages
could be about anything.

49
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,919
Sure. I'm just saying that before you were
trying to find out if she was guilty,

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,479
and now all you want is
to know she's innocent.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,719
But, hey, that's your business.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,759
-I was waving at you on the stairs.
-And I waved back.

53
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,519
What did you expect? A curtsy?

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,399
If you don't mind,

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,800
-class is about to start.
-I do mind. You've ignored me all week.

57
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,560
We kissed the other night.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,319
You kissed me.

59
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,879
I'd been drinking.
I don't remember what I was doing.

60
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,040
You're gonna act like you don't remember?
Great, but stop playing with me.

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,399
Good day.

62
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,959
Look. Your girlfriend just arrived.

63
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,120
Hey.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How's Omar?

65
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,000
Fine. He's at my place,
but we haven't kidnapped him.

66
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,879
You can go see him if you want.

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,759
How are you?

68
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,600
Tired, but good otherwise.
Well, pretty fed up.

69
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,480
I can imagine.
I saw you the other day on your bike.

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,399
I said hi,
but you had headphones--

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,040
I'm rarely seen without my bike.

72
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,439
-I need cash to get Nano--
-Listen.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,879
Maybe it's not the right time to say this,
but I believe you.

74
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,079
I think your brother's innocent.

75
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,680
Thanks, man.

76
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,079
Yeah.

77
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
Since we've made up,

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,079
I thought we could go have
a romantic dinner, just the two of us.

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,560
I said I have plans with Ander tomorrow.
I'm not going to just bail on him.

80
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,879
-Tell him to join us.
-Come on...

81
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,160
And tell him to bring
his Muslim boyfriend, too,

82
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
and we can have a double date.

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,680
-Well, if it doesn't bother you.
-Of course it doesn't.

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,079
He gave me an ultimatum.

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
What do you mean, an ultimatum?

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't know what to do.

87
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,040
I've been self-medicating.

88
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,600
That's why I can't sleep.

89
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,759
And it just came out.

90
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,360
-Fuck, what am I going to do now?
-It's okay.

91
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,879
Come. Come here. Calm down.

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,600
It's out of our hands, Polo.
Soon, everyone will know.

93
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
It's best if we finish this.

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,360
Go to the police station
and tell them what you did.

95
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,319
It's important
they hear your version of the event.

96
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,120
that it was an accident.

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,759
Nothing will happen to you.
You're a minor.

98
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,879
What do I tell them?

99
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,560
That you thought Marina
had stolen the watch from me.

100
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,000
You had an argument.

101
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,360
You got very angry,
and you killed her by mistake.

102
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,519
Tell them where the trophy is.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,399
And it will all be over.

104
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,039
What about you?

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,639
I didn't do anything, my love.

106
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,480
You don't have to implicate me.

107
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,879
That way, you repay me
for what I did for you.

108
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,159
And we put an end to this agony
once and for all.

109
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,039
What do you say?

110
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Will you do it?

111
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,639
-Hi.
-Hi.

112
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,159
-Is everything here?
-Yes, everything you asked for.

113
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,600
Omar, when are you coming back?

114
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,440
Dad needs your help and so do we.

115
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,320
Why not try putting yourself
in his shoes?

116
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,519
Why doesn't anyone try putting themselves
in mine? Fuck. Now I feel free.

117
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
You might be free,

118
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
but you've condemned me.

119
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,080
I have to take care of the store
on my own. I don't have time for anything.

120
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,639
That's why you want me to come back?
To make life easier for you? Awesome.

121
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
That's right. For me, for Dad, for Mom.

122
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,120
They have been moping around
since you left.

123
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,639
And it's not about making my life easier.
It's about having a life.

124
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Period.

125
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,679
Well, the only way to do that
is to leave that house.

126
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,720
You know what?
Dad might have survived a stroke,

127
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,080
but I don't know if he would survive
another of his children leaving.

128
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
I have to go back.

129
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,440
He came up on the right like a madman.
I didn't see him coming.

130
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,000
Can't people get off their asses
to get their own churros with chocolate?

131
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,039
Fuck!

132
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,039
Fuck you! Do you get sick pay?

133
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
Which planet are you on?

134
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,600
Tell them where to fucking stick it.
Please, Samuel.

135
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,600
Poor people can't tell anyone
where to stick it.

136
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,200
Don't talk to me like you do
to those snobs in class.

137
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,679
No, I'm talking to you
like someone who doesn't need money.

138
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,600
Okay.

139
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,799
There are things we can't have,
not even with all the money in the world.

140
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,440
Tell me one thing you can't have.

141
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,559
My dad never told the construction company
he worked for where to shove it.

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,840
When he had the accident,
they blamed him for being careless,

143
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
and all we got were a few pats
on the back and a thank-you. 

144
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,279
Here. In case you come to your senses.
My mother's offer is still on the table.

145
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,000
I've started working at the gas station
under the Choto bridge.

146
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,960
It's for a temp agency.

147
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,519
It's killing me,

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,559
but it's a good way to make money
and save up, so it's good.

149
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,879
Forget about the fucking bail.
Forget about me.

150
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,240
If I have to be locked up for two years
until the damn trial, so be it.

151
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,919
What difference does it make
whether it's 20 years or 22?

152
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,000
-Hi.
-I'm glad you called me. I got you a job.

153
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,240
-Your table will be ready in five minutes.
-Thank you.

154
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,639
Polo, answer me.

155
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,159
Did you go to the police?

156
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,480
Don't ignore me.

157
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,240
Tell him already. Tell Guzmán. Now.

158
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,559
What are you waiting for?

159
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,080
Don't put it off, honey.

160
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,480
NOW.

161
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,519
Darling...

162
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,519
Polo.

163
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,960
What?

164
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,639
We're asking
if you want the apartment in Madrid.

165
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,799
I don't care.
I'm going to Guzmán's house.

166
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,840
-Now?
-Very good, darling.

167
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,240
Go and support your friend.

168
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,879
He's going through a difficult time
and surely needs you.

169
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,320
Do you want anything?

170
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,639
Something to eat or drink?

171
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
No.

172
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,080
-Well, just tell me.
-You and I are like chalk and cheese.

173
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,080
Samuel, don't look at me like that.

174
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,519
Like what?

175
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,080
You know. This is not going anywhere,

176
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,759
and if we carry on like this,
we will end up suffering.

177
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,639
I totally agree.

178
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,759
Why did you come here to tell me this?
You could have just sent me a message.

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,320
-Want some macaroni?
-Excuse me?

180
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Yesterday's leftovers,
but I can heat them up in a minute.

181
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,600
We can also do things with clothes on.

182
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,879
You and I are definitely going nowhere
with our clothes on.

183
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,960
You're right, then.
We should call it quits.

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,399
Do you remember
how we used to sleep over at your house?

185
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,720
Sure.
You came all this way to ask me that?

186
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,840
We played video games till dawn.

187
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,519
Eating popcorn...

188
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:50,600
And we wouldn't stop
till our hands got sore.

189
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,960
Can we do that tonight?

190
00:14:58,679 --> 00:14:59,600
Sure.

191
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,480
Why?

192
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,639
Why not?

193
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,039
Those are the best memories I have.

194
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,440
What a sad life, Polo! Seriously.

195
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,559
You're my best friend, Guzmán.

196
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,159
More than that.

197
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,440
Do you know you're the reason
I found out I like guys, too?

198
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,279
Well, I didn't know that.

199
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,720
Relax, I got over it quickly.

200
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,159
Polo,

201
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,799
I love you very much,
but not that way. You know what I mean.

202
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,879
I also love you very much.

203
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,399
And I'm so sorry...

204
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm so sorry
for any harm I have done to you.

205
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,759
What harm?

206
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,399
What harm?
What nonsense are you talking about?

207
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,759
What's wrong with you?

208
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,000
Shit, man.
Which game should we start with?

209
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
What's up with you? Geez.

210
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,080
Polo, answer your fucking phone!

211
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,000
Did you speak to Guzmán or not?

212
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,000
I swear I'm not bluffing.
You are running out of time!

213
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,480
Polo always seemed like a great guy to me.

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,840
You don't have something
to tell me about him?

215
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,559
Something about what happened?

216
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,519
What happened?

217
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
After Marina's death,

218
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,279
security cameras were installed
throughout the facilities.

219
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,799
Are you sure
you don't have anything to tell me?

220
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
What...

221
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,559
Hey.

222
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,519
Shit...

223
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,440
Hey!

224
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,160
Polo!

225
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,480
Polo! Help!

226
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,759
Help!

227
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,960
Polo!

228
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:54,880
Okay...

229
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,640
Ander!

230
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,640
God, call an ambulance! Call anyone.

231
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,839
Ander?

232
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,880
Ander, please, come to the school,
I don't know...

233
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,640
He's not breathing.
I think he's not breathing.

234
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,079
Polo!

235
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,079
Please! Polo!

236
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,240
Very good!

237
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,559
Okay...

238
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,839
Very good. Get it out.

239
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Get it out.

240
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,160
Get it out. Ander!

241
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,400
-Thank God! Call an ambulance!
-No! We aren't calling anyone!

242
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,599
-Shut up!
-What?

243
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,759
How are you?

244
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,400
Are you okay?

245
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,839
-Come on.
-It's okay, don't worry.

246
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,119
That's my thing.
Falling asleep at school is my specialty.

247
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,680
What?

248
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,839
Was it a long night?

249
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,839
Order pick-ups until 3:00 a.m.

250
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,359
Damn exciting stuff.

251
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,799
We can do the lesson some other time
if you want. I don't mind.

252
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm sure,
but I don't have any more free time.

253
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,680
So you're not going out tonight?

254
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm afraid I won't be going out
for a long time.

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
Really?

256
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,000
Not even if I tell you
that Guzmán might be at the club tonight?

257
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,680
Why are you so eager for me and Guzmán
to get together?

258
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,599
Call me Cupid.

259
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,599
I believe in love.

260
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,480
I've seen how you look at each other.

261
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,279
Do you know how rare it is
to desire someone with all your heart,

262
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,839
and for them to reciprocate?

263
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,480
That's luck,
and you can't be that lucky every day.

264
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Valerio.

265
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

266
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,680
Come tonight.

267
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,880
Even death row inmates can enjoy...
their very last night of happiness.

268
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,160
That party will be awesome. For real.

269
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,240
Polo, where are you?

270
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,160
What are we gonna say?

271
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,920
The last thing Polo needs is his mothers
finding out what he did.

272
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,559
He's all right.

273
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,440
We pumped his stomach,
and he'll be out in no time.

274
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,920
-Good...
-I'm calling his parents.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,079
Don't worry...

276
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,519
I've already told them. He's my brother.

277
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,359
They're on their way now.
I hope he's learned his lesson.

278
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,759
Because I don't know how...

279
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,319
He's into those online videos
where people do stupid things.

280
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,240
This week's challenge was
to take as many pills as possible.

281
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,680
We had swimming first thing
in the morning. He couldn't swim,

282
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,839
so I had to pull him out.

283
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,480
Thank God I'm a good swimmer.
He could have died.

284
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,359
We need to talk to him.
I'm a mess. God.

285
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,039
Polo! How are you?

286
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,440
Hey, how are you feeling?

287
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,759
I couldn't do it.

288
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,039
You can tell him if you want.

289
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,759
Do you guys know anything about Polo?
He's not here today.

290
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,519
He was, but he got really sick.

291
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,640
He threw up in the locker room.
He made a real mess, right?

292
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,799
Poor him. Anyway...

293
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,920
Yes, we took him home.
He couldn't manage by himself.

294
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,920
What's going on?

295
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,440
What is this about?

296
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,839
Because Polo and Samuel,
they weren't even friends.

297
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Lots of other people could have reasons
to get rid of him.

298
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,400
I thought you didn't know Samuel.

299
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,559
I don't, but...

300
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,839
people said that he changed
after what happened to Marina.

301
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,519
That he became violent...

302
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,839
and he was hanging out
with the wrong crowd.

303
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,200
Yes?

304
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,079
Hi. Sandra sent me.

305
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Good. Thank you very much, kid.

306
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,960
What's up, dude? Was it easy or not?

307
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,160
Yes, it was almost too easy.

308
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I already told you.

309
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,759
My mother wouldn't put you in danger.
That's how it will always be.

310
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,559
-I don't know if I want to keep doing it.
-Well, think about it.

311
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,880
She trusts you.

312
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,000
Could we start by paying me
for this trip? I'll decide later.

313
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,519
It's just that she's away till tomorrow.
But don't worry.

314
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,960
You'll get the dough right away.
Once you have it, you'll come around.

315
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,200
-Please come in, miss.
-Thank you. I'm one of Polo's friends.

316
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,359
-May I?
-Sure.

317
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,759
-This way, please.
-Yes, sorry.

318
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,640
My cook made chicken broth.

319
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,359
She always says it's the best thing
when you have a stomachache.

320
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,720
Thank you, but you didn't have to come.

321
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,400
Listen...

322
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,640
I'll sit down.

323
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,079
I know we don't really know each other,

324
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,359
and I don't want you to tell me
why you did what you did.

325
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,440
You must have your reasons.

326
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,759
But I want you to know
that if you need anything, I'm here.

327
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,960
And I wouldn't like anything to happen
to you because...

328
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,759
it was hard to pull you out of the pool!

329
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,599
Like... Yes.

330
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,279
Polo, call me.

331
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
Thank you very much.

332
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,720
It's okay...

333
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,880
For coming to see me.

334
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,599
-And for lying in the hospital.
-Yeah.

335
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,640
And for jumping into the pool...
and for the resuscitation thing. All that.

336
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,400
You look so cute when you smile.

337
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,519
You look very cute. I'm being serious.

338
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,640
Your eyes screw up and...
Are you embarrassed now? Don't be!

339
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,279
Well, I just came to bring you this, so...

340
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,160
I'll give it to your cook
so she can heat it up.

341
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,839
It'll taste better when it's hot.

342
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm leaving. See you in class, okay?
Get some rest.

343
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,119
Well, let's save ourselves some work,
shall we? I ask what's up with Polo,

344
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,519
you say nothing, I insist,
I ask you what's up,

345
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,519
you call me annoying,
I tell you to fuck off,

346
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,920
and we'll have an awesome dinner.

347
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,400
-Hilarious.
-Thank you.

348
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,920
What's hilarious?

349
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,839
He quit tennis.

350
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,119
I know. Hi.

351
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,119
What a pity, Ander.

352
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,759
You don't look well.

353
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,079
Go back to playing sports.

354
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,880
Do yourself a favor.
I'm just worried about you.

355
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,119
-Hi.
-Hi. Did you order yet?

356
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,440
No. I'm actually not hungry at all.

357
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,960
Neither am I.

358
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,559
For fuck's sake, dude,
I told you three times.

359
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,599
Should I tell you in another language?
You're being so annoying.

360
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,920
-Are you letting us in now or what?
-Hey, Luciano, how are you doing?

361
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,200
They're with me. Let them in, okay?

362
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,160
Thanks for nothing, Luciano.

363
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,359
Stop arguing.

364
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,559
-Rum and Coke, right?
-Please!

365
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,680
-You?
-Just Coke. Thanks.

366
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,359
Right away!

367
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,759
So let's see what's going on here.

368
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,799
Bitches are out and about.

369
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
We almost didn't get in
because of that stunt you pulled.

370
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,559
I was helping Samuel
get his brother out of prison.

371
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,039
Or rather, you wanted to get rid of Carla

372
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,759
using those crazy ideas
that he has in his head.

373
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,240
And all because you like him, right?

374
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,000
Don't go all advice columnist on me.
You have your issue, too.

375
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,720
-My issue?
-Why did you come here, Nadia?

376
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,119
For that oh-so-cool blond snob.

377
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,680
That's if he decides to show up,
because Nadia won't do anything about it.

378
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,319
The girl that gets 9.5 out of ten
and goes to complain.

379
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,799
But when she likes a guy,
she just sits in the corner waiting

380
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,000
or she leaves everything
to the hands of fate.

381
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,440
Listen up, babe.
Fate is a son of a bitch.

382
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,559
He has a girlfriend.

383
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,200
Sure.

384
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,440
That is his problem and your excuse.

385
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,039
And you?
When are you going to go for it?

386
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:49,480
Never. Samu likes marchionesses,
and I'm a jester in comparison.

387
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,079
So basically, that's your excuse.

388
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,359
Samu, are you coming to the club?
I want to talk.

389
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Or I'll come by your house,
whatever you want.

390
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,920
Ander, that's enough.

391
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Fuck.

392
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,519
Can I tell you something?

393
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,160
I love your eyebrows.

394
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,519
That's cute.

395
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,119
When I was little,
I got teased for having bushy ones.

396
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,839
I got teased, too.

397
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,240
I'm thinking about changing my look a bit.
Maybe shape them a little...

398
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,759
Get a piercing. Something like that.

399
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,799
I think I would like that.
Not so sure about your sister.

400
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
All the more reason to do it.

401
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,720
Cheers to that.

402
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,359
Let me tell you something.

403
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,279
That shirt was a great choice.

404
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,200
-Wow, thanks.
-You're welcome.

405
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,240
-At least somebody noticed it.
-I didn't want to say anything.

406
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,480
Why?

407
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,799
-Because that shirt... It's not you.
-Maybe the shirt is me,

408
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,319
and the dark hoodies I wore
were someone else.

409
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,759
-Come on, Ander...
-Stay out of it. That's his partner.

410
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,920
All right.
Let's talk about each other's partners.

411
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,559
That is the first thing
you've said to me all night.

412
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,559
I've been trying to have dinner
just the two of us all week,

413
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,640
and all I've managed to get is this.
No offense.

414
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,799
What shall we do with these two?
Could they be any more boring?

415
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,559
You speak Arabic?

416
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,640
Two years in Abu Dhabi, honey. Languages.

417
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,359
I don't get it.
I can't believe you're Nadia's brother.

418
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,279
I'm at the club.

419
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,160
-You're actually charming.
-I sometimes think the same thing.

420
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,400
I just saw your...

421
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,039
It's so good reheated.

422
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,079
Who needs a chef when you have
the cheapest microwave available.

423
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,519
You won't see me as a princess
when sauce is dribbling down my chin.

424
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,880
No. I'll do something a lot worse.

425
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,400
I'll ask you what this is.
What are we doing?

426
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,279
It's really noisy outside, isn't it?
Nonstop, all around us.

427
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,440
It's so quiet in here.

428
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,920
I don't know what we're doing.

429
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm quite lonely,
and I think you are, too.

430
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,079
So we could be lonely together.

431
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,359
You have some tomato sauce on...

432
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,839
-Where?
-Wait.

433
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
Here.

434
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,240
Fucking hell...

435
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,039
Thanks.

436
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,000
-Give it to me.
-Don't, Lu.

437
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,839
The dinner was my idea. It's on me.

438
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,640
-They're my friends. I want to pay.
-You want to, but you can't!

439
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,400
Can we talk about this at home?
Don't make a scene.

440
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,559
-No, I'm going out for a drink.
-What?

441
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,159
-I want to go out, not be cooped up.
-Being with me is like being cooped up?

442
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,199
I didn't say that.
I said I want to go out for a drink.

443
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,639
It's what you say all the fucking time.

444
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,519
You know what? Do what you want.

445
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,639
You will anyway, whether I like it or not.

446
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,639
Maybe we should get going...

447
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,559
I'm going somewhere.
I have something to do.

448
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,960
What do you have to do this late?

449
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,000
So you don't tell your boyfriend
anything either? Fucking great.

450
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
-Absolutely nothing.
-Ander?

451
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,159
Just like you.

452
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,920
-Guzmán?
-Ander!

453
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,599
Ander!

454
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,719
If you bottle everything up inside,
it'll eat away at you!

455
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,159
You really want me
to tell you what's wrong?

456
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,039
I want things to go back
to how they were before.

457
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,039
You, me, and Polo.

458
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,239
That's all I'm asking for.

459
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,239
Are you coming?

460
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,719
I thought you would pretend
you don't know me or something.

461
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,519
I'm not drunk.

462
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,000
No?

463
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,199
No.

464
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,480
What do you want to do?

465
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,119
-We can't go to my house.
-And yours, no chance.

466
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,400
There's a place,

467
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:37,960
but...

468
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,000
You have condoms in all the drawers.
I'm kidding. They are in the nightstand.

469
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,159
Maybe it wasn't a good idea
to bring you here.

470
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,920
-I'm sorry.
-It was what it was meant to be.

471
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,880
Relax. I'm fine.

472
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,239
I'm a little bit scared.

473
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,159
Me, too.

474
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,039
I remember how much you liked the pool.

475
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,679
Let's do it!

476
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,599
I'm really angry.

477
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,880
I think it was really unfair of you
to unload that onto me.

478
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,400
But I'm your friend, and I don't want you
to do anything stupid again.

479
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,920
Thank you.

480
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,440
It was an accident, Ander.

481
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,719
You don't crack someone's head open
by accident.

482
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,880
But I believe you when you say
that you didn't mean to.

483
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,159
You lost control.

484
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,719
I swear, if only I could go back...

485
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,320
There is one thing we can do.

486
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,280
There's an innocent guy rotting in prison
for something he didn't do,

487
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
at least until the trial begins.

488
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:42,360
How much money
can you take out of your account?

489
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,440
Ander...

490
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:59,039
Do you want me to leave?
Is that what's wrong with you?

491
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,119
No...

492
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,639
Then why are you acting so strange?

493
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,639
It has nothing to do with you, Omar.

494
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,559
So why don't you tell me about it?

495
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,320
Trust me, okay?

496
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,119
It'll pass.

497
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,760
-Samuel?
-In the bathroom.

498
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,559
Hey. You okay?

499
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,480
There was a letter in the mailbox
with your name on it.

500
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I'm going to bed.
I'm exhausted. What a day...

501
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,960
-Where's the money from the Sáez family?
-I forgot.

502
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:41,199
Mrs. Sáez called to tell me
you stole a dress from her.

503
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,199
I could have died of shame!

504
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,920
Isn't stealing on the Internet
enough for you anymore?

505
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,880
I don't steal!
I do crowdfunding to launch my designs.

506
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
To make clothes for yourself
that you don't sell.

507
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,000
How are you going to pay them back?

508
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,320
This has to end.

509
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,320
Mom, we'll talk about this at home.
Don't say anything.

510
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,519
I won't say anything.

511
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,719
You are going to say it all.
In front of the whole class.

512
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,559
You'll say that I'm your mother

513
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:06,280
and that you're here on a scholarship
because we're broke. And proud.

514
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,440
-It'll be okay.
-Let go.

515
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,440
Mom, please! Don't ruin everything.

516
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,000
For the first time,

517
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,719
I'm starting to feel part of something.

518
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,519
I have friends.

519
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,119
And someone that could be
more than a friend.

520
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,199
-Mom...
-Hi.

521
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,679
Is there a problem?

522
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,400
No.

523
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:33,639
This young lady's chauffeur
throws his cigarette butts on the ground,

524
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,920
and the school entrance
looks like an ashtray.

525
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,559
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.

526
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,559
Enough of that.
She's a cleaner, not your fucking slave.

527
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:45,360
-The other day in the bathroom, and--
-Do I stick my nose in your business?

528
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,880
You, with your sunglasses,
your look, and all that?

529
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,039
So much money and so little class.

530
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,119
Listen, Cayetana, it's only eight,
and I'm not in the mood for it,

531
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,000
but you're asking for a slap, honey.

532
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:58,880
Hey, drug-dealer Barbie.

533
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,360
Thanks, Lu.

534
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,920
You don't want to make trouble with me.

535
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,000
Careful with badass Barbie.

536
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,719
She'd be right at home in my neighborhood.

537
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,000
By the way, Latin Barbie...

538
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,679
Good day.

539
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,159
I was having a rough time.

540
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,840
My girlfriend,
who I'd been with since I was 12,

541
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,159
had left me for someone else, and...

542
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,679
it was hard for me
to come to terms with.

543
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,880
And, yes,

544
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,440
I tried to...

545
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:33,639
Well, you know.

546
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,480
But now it's over,
and it made me stronger.

547
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:43,679
Anyway, I don't know
what this has to do with Samuel.

548
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,000
Samuel believed that you were connected
in some way to Marina's death.

549
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,159
That's absurd.

550
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,159
You arrested the culprit yourself, right?

551
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm guessing that if you're here,
that means you haven't confessed.

552
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,719
You guessed right.

553
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,440
I couldn't do it to you.

554
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,360
What does that mean, Polo?

555
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm a weak person.

556
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,360
If I confess,
I'll end up telling them everything.

557
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,880
That you were an accomplice.

558
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,440
And I don't want to do that to you, love.

559
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:25,400
Hey.

560
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,719
I forgot to reply to your text yesterday.
What did you want to say?

561
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,800
I can't remember.

562
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:33,599
Don't worry.
It was probably something stupid.

563
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,519
Hi, darling.

564
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,079
So, did you have a good time at the club?

565
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,760
Guzmán! Let us know next time
you're going out, you bastard.

566
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:56,480
Good morning, class.

567
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
