1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,837
VICTOR: Well, Simon,
I don't know what's going on,

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,632
because I thought I might be like you,

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,009
but lately I've been hanging out with Mia,

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,929
and I really like her, which is confusing,

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,014
so I've been doing research.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,475
Like, a lot of research.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,271
And sexuality is a spectrum.

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,649
Some guys like guys,
some guys like girls,

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,486
some guys like both,
and some guys like feet?

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm not even sure what I like,
but it's definitely not feet.

11
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,035
So, I think I'm gonna give
things with Mia a chance.

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,164
I feel really connected to her,
and who knows?

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,625
I didn't think I was gonna like
the Impossible Burger until I had one,

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,293
and it was actually pretty good.

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,755
So, maybe Mia's my Impossible Burger.

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,139
Mia?

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,891
[clanging]
‐ Oh! Victor.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,852
You really shouldn't sneak up on people

19
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,020
who are holding tools
that can melt your face off.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,274
I mean, unless you're in the market
for a cool, intimidating scar.

21
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,192
‐ Ah. Maybe I am.
[chuckles]

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,486
So, you weld?

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,365
‐ Uh, more like fail to weld.
This is my dad's creme brulee torch.

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,494
‐ Well, um, it's cool, whatever it is.

25
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,330
‐ A sculpture.

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,417
Something big enough to make a shadow.

27
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,794
‐ I like that.

28
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,964
‐ I actually stole that line from this
old lady sculptor

29
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,591
named Gertrude Barnstone.

30
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,635
She wanted to create things
that were big enough to make shadows,

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,555
and I don't know,
take up space in the world.

32
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,724
You know? Uh, sorry.

33
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,185
I get really worked up
about artists I like.

34
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,021
I know it's lame.
‐ No. It's not.

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,649
I love old lady sculptors.

36
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,235
I actually have all the trading cards.
‐ Oh. Oh, yeah?

37
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,115
‐ Hey, Mia, would you wanna go on a date?

38
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,579
There's this Battle of the Bands thing
at the coffee shop I work at.

39
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,289
‐ That's perfect.

40
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,083
Uh, yeah. 'Cause,
well, Lake and I were‐‐ were gonna‐‐

41
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,836
were gonna go, but she'll understand.

42
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,004
‐ Great.

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,550
Well, I'll let you get back to it.

44
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,429
Please don't melt your face off
before our hang.

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,681
It's, uh, it's a really good face.

‐ Good morning.

58
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,513
Bebita. Wow, you are lookin' good.

59
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,931
‐ Good?

60
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,101
This is two hours of makeup
and a full blowout.

61
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:08,021
The only adjectives I want to hear
are stunning,

00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,440
gorgeous, and‐‐
[gasps]

63
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,984
‐ I'm making Mom a Facebook profile

64
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,570
so she can keep in contact
with everyone back in Texas.

65
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,823
‐ Oh, Pilar. That is so nice of you.

66
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,867
‐ She's paying her.
‐ And there it is.

67
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,244
‐ Yeah.
ARMANDO: Where's Victor?

68
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,830
‐ Basketball practice.
[camera shutter clicking]

69
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,292
‐ You know, maybe we should, uh,
take this new look out on the town.

70
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,043
Show it off.

71
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,462
‐ Yeah?
‐ You went through all this trouble.

72
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,549
Take you to dinner.
‐ All right.

73
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,553
Pilar, can you watch your brother?
Or do you have other plans?

74
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,639
‐ I was gonna watch Scream
on Facetime with Eric,

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,891
but then he brutally dumped me,

76
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,686
and destroyed my ability
to love another human, so, no. No plans.

77
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,356
‐ Can someone else watch me?
‐ [laughs] No.

78
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,946
‐ Hey, Diane. Love the bangs.

79
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,489
ANDREW:
What you in for?

80
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,033
‐ Oh. Andrew. Uh,

81
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,161
I gave the frog I was dissecting
a smoky eye. You?

82
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,122
‐ I pantsed Coach Ford in practice.

83
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,999
Turns out he doesn't wear underwear.

84
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,085
We saw everything.

GEORGINA [over TV]:
Tonight, on the five o'clock news,

00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:17,090
would you shop at a haunted supermarket?

87
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,219
I'm Georgina Meriwether.
Stay peachy, Atlanta.

88
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,679
‐ Is it, like, weird
seeing your mom on TV?

89
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,015
‐ Uh, the TV part you get used to,

90
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,185
but not the randos
coming up to us in public, and being like,

91
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,437
"Will you say it?" And she's all, like...
[chuckles]

00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,857
"No, no, no. I, I couldn't possibly.
'Stay peachy, Atlanta.'"

Hey, are you going to Battle of the Bands?

94
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,113
‐ Yeah. Teddy and Kieran are performing.

95
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,784
They do heavy metal covers of
prescription drug side effects.

96
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,953
They're called "Pharmaceutakill."

97
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,624
‐ [chuckles] That's... random.
Uh, well, I was supposed to go with Mia,

98
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,793
but now she's going on a date with Victor,
or whatever.

99
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,254
‐ What? She is?

100
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,549
‐ Uh, yeah.
Why are you so pressed about it?

101
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:02,010
‐ No, I'm not. I just don't know
what she sees in that kid.

102
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,847
‐ Well, he's hot,

103
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,349
he's kind, he's smart,
he's good at sports,

104
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,143
great skin, his eyes twinkle,
he smells good,

105
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,270
and I bet he's nice to animals.

106
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,729
‐ I'm nice to animals.

107
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,065
What kind of psychopath
isn't nice to animals?

108
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,403
‐ Well, regardless, tonight's the night
it all begins for them.

109
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,281
Next thing you know,
they'll fall in love and get married,

110
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,992
and have a slew of gorgeous,
bilingual babies.

111
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,743
‐ Well, maybe we should double.

112
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,912
We go together. They go together.

113
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,999
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah. Why not?

114
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,462
‐ Yeah. Yeah, I'd, I'd love to. Humph.

115
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,423
I knew this would be my year.

116
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,134
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

117
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,556
‐ I have the ultimate plan to win
Lake's heart, and brain,

118
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,683
and if I'm lucky,
all of her other organs, too.

119
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,102
Check it out. Battle of the Bands.
I'm performing.

120
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,313
‐ You're in a band?
‐ No, no, I'm a DJ,

121
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,984
which is even better,
because a DJ makes music into more music.

122
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,527
‐ I didn't know you were a DJ.

123
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,654
‐ Well, there's a lot of things
you don't know about me, Victor.

124
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,324
I sponsor a manatee named Jessica,
I'm a meme in Japan,

125
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,159
I make my own shampoos.

126
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,286
Damn it.
I just spoiled your birthday gift.

127
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,787
[Victor chuckles]

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,415
‐ Have you ever performed before?

129
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,542
‐ Not in front of people
who aren't my mom, no.

130
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,961
But I've been practicing for months,
and I'm definitely ready.

131
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,172
All that's left to do
is to figure out my look.

132
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,548
‐ You're getting a haircut?

133
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,468
‐ No, I just got one. My DJ disguise.

134
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,220
Like Daft Punk,

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,264
or, uh, Deadmau5, or Mrs. Doubtfire.

136
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,809
‐ Mrs. Doubtfire wasn't‐‐
‐ Not a DJ, but such a good disguise.

137
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,771
‐ Well, I can't wait to see
what you land on.

138
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,482
I'll be there with Mia.

139
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,692
On a date. [chuckles]

140
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,988
‐ [laughs]: Yes! All right!
Well, you can't spell "stud" without...

141
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,867
...you.

You caught on fast.
‐ Thanks.

146
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,465
I had fun. Except for this music.

147
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:07,010
Five hours of nonstop
easy listening is actually...

148

not so easy to listen to.

If I hear one more gentle song
about a girl forgiving her dad,

151

I will lose my mind.

people drink coffee to wake up.

153
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,901
‐ Yeah. Well, Sarah's not here,
so if you have your phone,

154
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,445
I could connect it to the speakers
and play something.

155
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,698
