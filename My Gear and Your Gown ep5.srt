How are you? Where are you?

00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,559
I'm okay.

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,679
Where are you? I'm coming to see you.

7
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,999
No.

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,880
You don't have to tutor me anymore.

What about Itt?

28
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,799
No.

29
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,840
How can you not know their whereabouts?
You're in the same club.

30
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:50,239
They're your friends.
Aren't you supposed to know?

31
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,119
I saw them.

32
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,319
-What did you see?
-I saw Itt asking for permission to quit.

33
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,960
What? He's quitting the club?

34
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,130
No. He is quitting school.

35
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,640
What?

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,599
Are you sure? Itt is quitting?

37
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,520
-It's true.
-Is Pure quitting school too?

38
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,119
What are we going to do
with the club then?

39
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,570
Right.

40
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,010
What are we going to do?

41
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,359
-Oh.
-What about...?

42
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,221
Hey, hey. Let's calm down, guys.

43
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,342
Take it easy.

44
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,520
Let's go somewhere quiet.

45
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,000
-Let's eat.
-I'm hungry.

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,760
-Come on.
-Let's eat.

47
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:35,840
What is going on?

48
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,439
What's next, man?

49
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,159
Itt and I broke up.

50
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,280
But do you know where he is, right?

51
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,800
I know.

52
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,679
Can you take me to see him then?

53
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
No, I don't want to go there again.

54
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,560
Talking about it gives me the creeps.

55
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,959
Why? What happened to him?

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,919
Pai...

57
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,800
...the battery on my phone died.

58
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,040
I just came to tell you
that I will be waiting for you out front.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
Thank you, Uncle Dong.

60
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,120
Do you have your own chauffeur?

61
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,039
Please, Pang, tell me where he is.

63
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,839
Then, give me a ride home.

64
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:47,919
And I will tell you.

65
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
All right.

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,000
My glass is empty.

67
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,519
What was that sound?

68
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,399
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

69
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,640
Oh!

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,279
Hey! Who are you?

71
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,599
How did you get into my house?

72
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,000
The door was unlocked, so I...

74
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,319
I'm a friend of Pure's.

75
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,440
Is he home?

76
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,640
Oh.

77
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
Is your son home?

78
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,599
Is he?

79
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,640
I don't think so.

80
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,719
Waan.

81
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,399
Pure.

82
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,399
What are you doing here?

83
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,639
It's good to practice safe sex.

84
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,680
If I did,
I wouldn't be stressing out right now.

85
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,440
It was your decision.

86
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,759
There's no one else to blame.

87
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,040
Yes.

88
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,839
I know that.

89
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,840
You haven't come to school for days.

90
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
But you're still in uniform.

91
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,530
Don't tell me
that you haven't left your house.

92
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,639
What I do is my business.

93
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,410
What are you doing here?

94
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,090
I came to check and see
if you were still alive.

95
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,879
You haven't answered
any of my texts or calls.

96
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,359
You disappeared.

97
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,680
You're acting like you're my girlfriend.

98
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,639
A friend can also care about you.

99
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,359
You care about me?

100
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,839
My mother has been with me my whole life.

101
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,719
She doesn't even care.

102
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,440
Anyway, did you tell her about that?

103
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,639
What's the point of telling her?

104
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,360
She doesn't even know
that I haven't been going to school.

105
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,719
She only cares when she gives me condoms.

106
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
She's probably just scared
that I will get someone pregnant.

107
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,359
Don't tell me that your mother
buys condoms for you.

108
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,639
Yes.

109
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Man...

110
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,119
That's cool.

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,280
So, why didn't you use them then?

112
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
Have you met a mother
who raises her son by giving him condoms?

113
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,520
I don't want to use hers.

114
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,160
So you rather look at her with disdain
and be nervous about it later?

115
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,400
She isn't your mother.

116
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,879
You wouldn't understand.

117
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,920
I don't think you behaving stupidly...

118
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,879
...because of your first love.

119
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,239
I think it's because of your family.

120
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,520
It doesn't matter now.

121
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,800
I did something stupid,
and now my life is about to fall apart.

122
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,920
There's nothing I can do to fix it.

123
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes. It will fall apart
if you keep being stupid.

124
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,160
I know.

125
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,200
What on earth are you doing?

126
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,599
Come with me.

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
Where are we going?

128
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,000
Just come with me. Don't ask.

129
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,320
Where? I'm not going.

130
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
-Don't ask. Come with me.
-Hey!

131
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,519
Waan! Where are you taking me?

132
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:54,399
-Come on. Just come with me.
-No, I'm not going. Waan!

133
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,359
Let me go. Let go!

134
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,599
Even if you are positive,
it doesn't change anything.

135
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,239
Because right, now you're acting
like you're already infected.

136
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,359
And if the results are negative,
you can finally stop being stupid.

137
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
Well...

138
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,879
The test result came back negative.

139
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,320
You are clean.

140
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,639
You are clean.

141
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,600
-Hey, you are clean!
-Yes!

142
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,719
-I'm going to live!
-You are clean!

143
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,799
I'm so happy!

144
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,320
-I'm going to live!
-You are clean!

145
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,879
There, I told you.

146
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,521
That dude got it from someone else.

147
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:05,681
Besides, you're not the only person
in the world who sleeps around.

148
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,440
You're right.

149
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,960
That isn't something
you should be happy about.

150
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,720
If you keep behaving this way,

151
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,759
one day, you might actually get sick.

152
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,461
I won't do it again, Doctor.

153
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,742
I regret what I have done.

154
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,360
I'm so happy, man!

155
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,061
Man!

156
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:32,520
You're lucky
to have an open-minded boyfriend.

157
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,320
-No, Doctor.
-He isn't my boyfriend.

158
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,440
-He isn't my boyfriend.
-He isn't my boyfriend.

159
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,879
-We're friends.
-We're friends.

160
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,039
I only came here to keep him company.

161
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:42,120
-We're just friends.
-Come on, Doctor.

162
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,840
Just looking at his face
gives me the creeps.

163
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
I just can't.

164
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,279
Underline that, Doctor.

165
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,919
It's impossible. I've got goosebumps.

166
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,080
Come on. Look at your face.

167
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,839
Like I would want you.

168
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,639
-He's in the friend zone.
-Yes, the friend zone.

169
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,719
I'm telling you.

170
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,360
-What are you looking at?
-No, what are you looking at?

171
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,759
Stop looking at me.

172
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,160
Thank you so much.

173
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,639
We're friends. It's no big deal.

174
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,119
Are you ready to go back to school?

175
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,999
I don't even play basketball
when you weren't around.

176
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,280
Sure.

177
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
I'll go back.

178
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,560
I've got heaps of girls waiting for me.

179
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,280
Do you have a crush on me?

180
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,520
You said that you didn't want
to use your mom's condoms.

181
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,359
Thanks, but I don't need them.

182
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
Haven't you learned your lesson?

183
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,440
Of course, I have.

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,479
No more ego.

185
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll use them
no matter who they belong to.

186
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,120
Let me tell you this.

187
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,560
From now on, no glove, no love.

188
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,040
Waan...

189
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What?

190
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,759
Don't you feel disgusted?

191
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
Why should I?

192
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,359
You're not infecting me with HIV.

193
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,639
I mean...

194
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,320
...that you don't...

195
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,400
...despise...

196
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,479
Well...

197
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,239
...my mom's behavior?

198
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,960
Why should I?

199
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,200
It's your life.

200
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,080
Isn't it already enough
that you're nice to me?

201
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
Well...

202
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,160
Okay, good.

203
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,160
It would be nice
if the others thought the same too.

204
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,919
Who do you mean?

205
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:16,560
I mean Itt.

206
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,039
Keep going.

207
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,170
It's all good. Keep going.

208
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,320
More.

209
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,520
Keep going.

210
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,760
You're wearing the earring now?

211
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,730
Yes.

212
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,760
I think that Pang
still has feelings for you.

213
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,560
She's just upset
that you're not going to school.

214
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,800
Come back to school.

215
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,800
Your mom wanted you
to study engineering, didn't she?

216
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
She's not here anymore.

217
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,080
You still have Pang.

218
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,599
Once she knew that I hit rock bottom...

219
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,761
...she stopped hanging out
with me right away.

220
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,802
I also regret the time I wasted on her.

221
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,119
You chose this.

222
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,960
You chose to hit rock bottom,

223
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,301
to not go to school,

224
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,311
and to work as a parking attendant.

225
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,800
What do you know?

226
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,650
My dad is going to sell the house
and start a new life with his new wife.

227
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,039
I have to work and save up money...

228
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,520
...so that I can buy the house back
for my mom and I.

229
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,199
Well, have you thought it through?

230
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,760
Yes!

231
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,730
Quit thinking for me.

232
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,839
Even though I'm not going to school,
I can still earn money on my own.

233
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,440
I'm not a rich kid like you,
who lives in a palace...

234
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,970
...and looks down on others.

235
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,799
How much do you earn including tips?

236
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,901
It's my business.

237
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,850
How much does your house cost?

238
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,319
Stay out of it.

239
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,519
Let's suppose that you can earn
a hundred thousand baht a year.

240
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,560
Your house costs five million baht.
So you'd have to work for 50 years?

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,161
If you become an engineer,

242
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,279
just think about how much more
you'll be able to earn.

243
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,410
You just have to study for a few years,

244
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,839
and you'll get your house back way sooner.

245
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,199
Which one is better?

246
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:57,039
You're the one who told me
that I only have one life,

247
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,319
so I should do what I want to do.

248
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:01,280
Is this what you want to do?

249
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,079
What do you want from me?

250
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,960
I want you to come back to school.

251
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,039
Come to your tutoring session tomorrow.

252
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,599
I'll wait for you at home.

253
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,040
Do you want to get hit by a car again?

254
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,170
You knew about it?

255
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,839
Of course, I did.

256
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,640
You and my mom were in the same hospital.

257
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:53,519
Then why did you act
like you were mad at me?

258
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,960
I thought you were mad at me
because I didn't answer your calls.

259
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,119
I don't know why I was mad at you.

260
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,520
Even though you didn't do anything wrong.

261
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:08,281
But I'll definitely be mad at you
if you don't come to our session tomorrow.

262
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,640
You're an idiot.

263
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,160
It's okay.

264
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,599
I'm here with you.

265
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,440
Itt...

266
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,261
We only just cremated Mom,

267
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,460
but you already brought
your new wife home?

268
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,000
Itt!

269
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,679
This is my house!

270
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,200
I can bring anyone I want.

271
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,040
This is my mom's house!

272
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,560
(What is the monthly salary
for an engineer?)

273
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,560
I need to be alone.

274
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
Who are you looking for?

275
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm here to see Pai.

276
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,360
Please come in.

277
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,199
Okay.

278
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,159
Yes?

279
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,440
Your friend's waiting downstairs.

280
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
Thank you.

281
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,320
Pai is in the living room.

282
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,080
Hello, Pai.

283
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,040
Your house is beautiful.

284
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,800
How did you know where I live?

285
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:34,679
Your driver told me.

286
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,000
Are you going to stand there?

287
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,720
Come sit here.

288
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,359
Do you need anything?

289
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,320
It's about Itt.

290
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,759
Well, I've thought about it.

291
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,720
There might be something
I can do to help you.

292
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,040
He's your close friend.

293
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,921
Do you mean that I'm his friend...

294
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,120
-...and that he's your boyfriend?
-Ex-boyfriend.

295
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,761
Can you help me by getting back together
with him then?

296
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,841
I think it will motivate him
to go back to school.

297
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Okay.

298
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,800
But I'll do it in exchange...

299
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,279
...for you dating me.

300
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,359
What?

301
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,799
I know that you like me,

302
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:44,159
and Itt is your excuse to approach me.

303
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,520
I like you, too.

304
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,639
If you feel guilty...

305
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,681
...then I will get back with him...

306
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,761
...and encourage him to go back to school.

307
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,919
But after that, you have to date me, okay?

308
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,560
What?

309
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,159
Pai...

310
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,359
What the heck is this?

311
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,960
There's nothing going on between us.

312
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,319
There will be.

313
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,781
Why did you say that?

314
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,640
To make things clear.

315
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,400
Itt, I'm sorry,

316
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,560
but it's over between us.

317
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,480
I can start seeing someone else.

318
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,000
I get it now.

319
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,359
Where are you going?

320
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,560
Don't complicate things.

321
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,039
What do you mean? I don't understand.

322
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,919
So, you don't like me?

323
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,759
No, I approached you...

324
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,799
...because I really wanted you
to help him,

325
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:54,560
but you've just made things worse.

326
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,439
So, this is all my misunderstanding?

327
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,839
I'm sorry then.

328
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,240
Hold on.

329
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,960
Can you talk to Itt?

330
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,040
I feel guilty for causing the fight
between you two.

331
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,680
But now that I know you don't like me,

332
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,880
I think I've already wasted
too much of my time.

333
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to see either of you anymore.

334
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,319
Itt, listen to me.

335
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,800
What's your problem with Itt?

336
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,760
Do you guys still think of me
as your friend?

337
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,880
I saw Ittikorn's math score,
and I'm very happy with it.

338
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,301
The room will belong to Bishop Club
per the agreement.

339
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:18,320
Okay.

340
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,840
