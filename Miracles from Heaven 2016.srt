There is a common phrase,
"No pain, no gain."

that our insurance premiums
are paid up, too.

and we can get a helmet,
and we can get insurance.

But there's one thing that we need
that can't be seen,

and it can't be bought.

00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,453
-(GIGGLES)
- We have enough dogs, Anna.

160
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,997
- Too late. It's already been sent.
-(SIGHS)

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,373
Express mail.

162
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,917
Hey, how do you like this?

163
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,420
- Love. (CHUCKLES)
- Me, too.

164
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,716
I think I'm gonna spend a lot of time there,

165
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,594
enjoying baguettes
and freshly-ground espresso.

166
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,763
Hey, let's do that together.

167
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,473
Paris would be a good mother-daughter trip.

168
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,684
- Oh, count me in. I would love it.
-(ANNA CHUCKLES)

169
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,895
I love you, Anna.

170
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,146
I love you, too.

171
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,692
Sleep tight, ladybug.

172
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,235
Okay, good night.

173
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,820
Good night.

174
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,449
CHRISTY: Okay, honey.

175
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,993
It's okay, it's okay. Oh!

176
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,745
-(RETCHING)
- Oh, sweetie.

177
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh, my gosh.

178
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,790
- Oh, Lord.
-(PANTING AND RETCHING)

179
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:42,249
CHRISTY: Oh, my baby.

180
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,627
Oh, sweetie.

181
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,420
Do you think it was something
from the barbecue?

182
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,547
We all ate the same things.

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,301
You know, maybe you should run her
by Dr. Sponder's in the morning.

184
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,386
(ANNA PANTING)

185
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,182
- Okay?
- I'm okay.

186
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,683
There you go.

187
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,185
Watch your feet there.

188
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,438
I need to be better for the aquarium.

189
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,731
You will be, honey.

190
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,774
Okay.

191
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,275
Let's get you to bed.

192
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,985
I'm gonna sit with you.

193
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,112
(SIGHS)

194
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,204
Hey.

195
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,414
Why are you still up?

196
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,209
- Is it about Anna?
- Mmm.

197
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,461
Anna's gonna be okay.

198
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,466
It's probably just a bug.

199
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,844
The doctor will give us somethin' for it.

200
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,180
I just feel anxious.

201
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,682
About what?

202
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,601
About everything.
The kids, the house, your business.

203
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,354
- The kids? Come on, the kids are fine.
- Hmm.

204
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,690
Well, my business is gonna work.

205
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,235
Oh, babe, you say that like it's absolute.

206
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,738
Now, this may take a while,

207
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,657
but it'll be okay.

208
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,119
It'll be okay.

209
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,837
(SIGHS)

210
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,256
It's a good life, Christy Beam.

211
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,383
-(LAUGHS)
-it's a good...

212
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,635
It's a good life, Kevin Beam.

213
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,687
CHRISTY: I hope this gastroenterologist
can get to the bottom of this.

214
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,189
I checked him out online.

215
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,358
He's supposed to be one
of the best in Fort Worth.

216
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,027
Well, good. He better be.

217
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,862
He's the third guy we've seen.

218
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,114
- I want to get this figured out.
- Mmm-hmm.

219
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,283
How's your book, ladybug?

220
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,506
DR. DORSI: Mmm-hmm.

221
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,383
(TYPING)

222
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,228
Well, everything looks okay.

223
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,646
- It does?
- Yeah, I've gone through

224
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,732
her entire chart and all
of Dr. Sponder's notes,

225
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,359
and the X-ray doesn't show anything.

226
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,361
Dr. Dorsi, she's in constant pain.

227
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,113
I mean, this little girl
has been throwing up for weeks.

228
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,199
She hasn't kept anything down.

229
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,909
Her little tummy's all bloated

230
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,079
and she's been on, well, Xifaxan,
she's been on Augmentin,

231
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,747
-four different antibiotics.
- Look, look, that's why

232
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,791
I'm ruling out anything that's bacterial.

233
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,293
I don't think it's viral.

234
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:34,588
Ms. Beam, I think your daughter
is lactose intolerant.

235
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,259
What?

236
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,719
- You think she's lactose intolerant?
- Christy.

237
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,097
- Like, allergic to milk?
- DR. DORSI: Ms. Beam.

238
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,600
Considering what y'all have been through,
I would think this is really good news. Huh?

239
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:47,935
This is easily treatable.

240
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,270
She can't have pizza?

241
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,646
It's not just pizza, sweetheart.

242
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,606
She can't have any dairy.

243
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,817
- She can have cheese-less pizza.
- Who would want that?

244
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,656
Well, um, if Anna can't have pizza,
then I won't have it either.

245
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,534
- KEVIN: Hmm.
- Well, Abbie, that's a great idea.

246
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,369
I'm in.

247
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,496
Me, too.

248
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,789
Ever?

249
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,292
We're not gonna have pizza ever?

250
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,043
Well, until Anna's better.

251
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,464
Well, my body's still growing.

252
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,466
- Wrong answer, genius.
- Abbie.

253
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,634
It's okay, Adelynn.

254
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,012
You're only six. No pressure.

255
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,317
All right, me, too.

256
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,693
- Look at that.
- Yeah, that was hard.

257
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,320
Let's hear it for you, ladybug.

258
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,821
(ALL LAUGHING)

259
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,574
Okay. Here's to you
gettin' well soon, sweetheart.

260
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,328
ANNA: Mommy.

261
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,496
Mommy?

262
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,498
Mommy!

263
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,084
Mommy.

264
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:55,961
Kevin!

265
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,338
Mommy!

266
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,631
I'm coming!

267
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,133
- I'm coming, baby, I'm coming.
- Mommy. (CRYING)

268
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,259
I'm coming.

269
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,261
- Oh, no, Anna.
- Mommy, it hurts!

270
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,804
No. Kevin.

271
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,431
(PANTING)

272
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,724
I'm coming. What is it?

273
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,684
- Come here, baby. No.
- Mommy, it hurts!

274
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,311
- KEVIN: What is it?
-It hurts, Mommy!

275
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,188
- I think we need to take her to the hospital.
- It hurts!

276
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,689
- I'm gonna call Emmy to come over.
-It's okay, baby.

277
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,232
I'm gonna call Emmy.
We're gonna get you some help.

278
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,317
Hold on, hold on. Okay.

279
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,277
- Here we go. All right.
-(CRYING)

280
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,573
It's all right, honey. It's okay.

281
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,953
Come on. Okay. Okay.

282
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,748
- Okay.
-It hurts.

283
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,041
Open the door, honey.

284
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,417
CHRISTY: There you go.

285
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,211
KEVIN: You're gonna be okay.

286
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,670
- Hey.
- Hey. How is she?

287
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,339
- KEVIN: I know. I know, baby.
- Thank you so much.

288
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,382
EMMY: Oh, God.
CHRISTY: Thank you.

289
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,508
EMMY: You'd do it for me.

290
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,718
- All right, all right. Go, go, go.
- Thank you, my friend.

291
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:45,803
Here comes Mama.

292
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,012
Let me in, honey-baby.

293
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,097
Okay.

294
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,980
What do we got here?

295
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,232
-36-year-old male...
- Just hang on.

296
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,942
- What do we got?
- Chest pains.

297
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,860
2201. 2201, please.

298
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,195
Thank you.

299
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,197
I'll be with you in just a minute.

300
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,240
Hello.

301
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:10,077
...blind by then, of course,
but they teach her to do it as well,

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,079
so Mary is just twisting.
They would have this...

303
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,664
It won't be long now.

304
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,832
Okay.

305
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,918
Mom and Dad, you can relax. She's fine.

306
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,254
We got her fever down
and she's starting to respond

307
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,922
to some anti-nausea medicine I gave her.

308
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,924
- You're good to take her home.
- Wait.

309
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,009
Anti-nausea medicine, but for what?

310
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,054
Well, I think this is just
a severe case of acid reflux.

311
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,557
It's not. No, it's not.

312
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,101
I examined her throat
and it's very raw, but other than that,

313
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,936
-everything is fine.
- Hold on a minute.

314
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,814
- Everything is not fine, Doctor.
- Okay.

315
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,191
Maybe we can have
this conversation outside.

316
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,443
We can do that.

317
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:48,282
Doctor, this is our fourth time here.

318
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,492
This isn't acid reflux.

319
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,120
Her throat's raw 'cause she's been
throwing up for weeks.

320
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,123
Well, Mom, I'm the doctor,
and that's my diagnosis.

321
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,876
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have other patients I need to see.

322
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,629
Excuse me, this is not acid reflux.

323
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,590
She's not lactose intolerant.

324
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,717
There's something wrong with our little girl.

325
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,968
Mrs. Beam, you need to calm down.

326
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,428
No, you calm down!

327
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,388
You find me another doctor,
you run some more tests!

328
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,559
I'm not leavin' this hospital
until I know what's wrong with my daughter!

329
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,397
Okay.

330
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,112
KEVIN: Listen, let's make sure she's okay.

331
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,178
Mr. and Mrs. Beam, um, this is Dr. Burgi.

332
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,805
He's head of our Pediatrics.

333
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,724
MAN: (OVER <i>PA) Dr. O'Neil t0 the ER, please.</i>

334
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,267
<i>Dr. O'Neil t0 the ER.</i>

335
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,271
So, uh, we did a series of X-rays
and a sonogram,

336
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,564
and I'm sorry to tell you

337
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,610
that there appears to be
100% complete abdominal obstruction.

338
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,737
What is that?

339
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,991
Part of her, uh, intestines are twisted off.

340
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,868
Please.

341
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,291
So, I can tell you, emphatically,

342
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,087
that if we don't clear
that obstruction right now,

343
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,339
your daughter's gonna die.

344
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,217
We're gonna need to take her right now.

345
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,468
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,470
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm so sorry.

347
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,723
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,519
Okay.

349
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,648
MALE NURSE: BP 110/70.

350
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,941
FEMALE NURSE: Okay,
all the fluids are ready.

351
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,859
- Can you check the suction?
- MALE NURSE: Right. Suction's good.

352
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,361
FEMALE NURSE: Will you get me
the Tegaderm, please?

353
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,404
MALE NURSE: It's standing by.

354
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,739
Mr. Beam, will you step back?

355
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,991
Okay. Thank you.

356
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,576
FEMALE NURSE: Okay.

357
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,619
We'll need to insert this tube
into Annabel's nose

358
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,747
and then run it down into her stomach
to begin suctioning, okay?

359
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,583
So, Mrs. Beam, if you could step back.

360
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,294
- Mommy.
- Mr. Beam, if you could come

361
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,754
and hold her down
and help her keep her still,

362
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,214
that will make it easier, okay?

363
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,841
Sir, it's imperative
that we do this now, okay?

364
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,925
Okay. Okay. Okay.

365
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,302
Before we can give her
any anesthesia, all right?

366
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,553
- It's me.
- All right, sweetheart, here we go.

367
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,596
I'm right here with you, okay?

368
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,055
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

369
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,223
This is gonna make you...

370
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,601
It's gonna make you feel better, okay?

371
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,436
Okay, don't be scared, okay?

Heavenly Father,
we pray for the health and well-being

396
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:21,244
of Anna Beam and the entire Beam family,
especially these two...

397
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,917
Uh, so, Anna is okay.

398
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,378
Uh, she's in recovery.

399
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,091
But my findings weren't good.

400
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,969
Um, there were other obstructions
in the small bowel

401
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,890
that required extensive, um, dissection
to free them.

402
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:45,102
You... You cleared 'em all out, though, right?

403
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,022
I did. I did.

404
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,653
- But?
- Um...

405
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,783
Unfortunately, um, I'm afraid

406
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:04,830
that Annabel appears to have
a very severe intestinal motility disorder.

407
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,421
Are... Are you sure?

408
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,134
Yeah.

409
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,011
What is that, Kevin?

410
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,977
It's when her, um...

411
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,564
Her body can't process food.

412
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,489
Since the, um...

413
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,826
The intestines aren't able
to function properly,

414
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,580
what she eats and drinks tends to sit there.

415
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,416
But she'll be all right now, right?

416
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,878
I mean, she's sick,
but she'll get better, right?

417
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,680
There's no cure, is there?

418
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,684
Um, I'm sorry to say that presently there isn't.

419
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,231
So, is she restricted to tubal feeding?

420
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,525
In the short term.

421
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,487
Eventually she'll need a gastrostomy tube,

422
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,615
which aren't always successful
in the long term.

423
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:27,871
I did talk with my colleagues,
and there is a specialist, Samuel Nurko.

He's the country's foremost motility expert.

425
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,879
He's a pediatrician from Mexico
who's based out of Boston.

426
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,548
He might be able to help.

I don't want to give you false hope,
you know?

But people do come
from all over the world to see him, so...

429
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,269
Excuse me.

Hi, there. This is Christy Beam
calling from Burleson, Texas, again.

479
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:53,284
I just wanted to make sure
that Dr. Nurko had received my letter.

480

<i>Mrs. Beam, as I assured you
the last time you called,</i>

<i>we're making every effort,
but Dr. Nurko gets a lot of letters.</i>

482
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:00,291
I'm sure he does,

483
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,378
but there are specifics to Anna's condition
that I think that he would find...

484
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,671
<i>I really don't know if I'll get a chance</i>

485
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,964
<i>to ask him about the letter today.</i>

486
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,340
Okay, then I'll call again tomorrow.

Hi, Dr. Burgi, this is Christy Beam calling.
I just wanted to make sure.

Have you spoken to Dr. Nurko?

494

I just am wondering
why I haven't heard from him.

I've called him three times,

No.

No, I don't mean that.

505
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,891
So, I have to wait for someone to die

506
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,687
and just pray that Anna
doesn't go before then?

00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,788
PILOT: (OVER <i>PA) Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

634
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,623
<i>from the flight deck,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

635
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,293
<i>Our flight to Boston today will take
approximately three and a half hours,</i>

636
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,378
<i>so please sit back and relax.</i>

637
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:46,382
<i>The dawn is breaking</i>

638
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,471
<i>A light shining through</i>

639
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:56,726
<i>But I'm open, you're closed</i>

640
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:01,397
<i>Where I follow, you'll go</i>

641
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:09,030
<i>I worry I won't see your face</i>

642
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,408
<i>Light up again</i>

643
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:16,412
<i>Even the best fall down sometimes</i>

644
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,081
Thank you.

645
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,751
<i>Even the wrong words seem to rhyme</i>

646
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:24,962
Thank you, sir.

647
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,507
<i>Out of the doubt that fills my mind</i>

648
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,551
<i>I somehow find</i>

649
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:31,761
Okay.

650
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,347
<i>You and I collide...</i>

651
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,432
Okay.

652
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:39,435
I brought your book.

653
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,771
Here you go.

654
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

655
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,402
What doctor are you here to see?

656
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,321
Dr. Sam Nurko.

657
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,323
And what time is your appointment?

658
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:58,538
Well, I don't have an appointment.

659
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,458
My daughter is Annabel Beam.

660
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,377
That's her right there.

661
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,587
I'm Christy Beam.

662
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,005
I've probably called 100 times.

663
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,341
Anna's doctors have called,
they've written letters.

664
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,051
We're from Texas.

665
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,427
I'm sorry, ma'am.

666
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,888
The doctor can't see you
without an appointment.

667
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,394
Do you have kids of your own?

668
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:25,273
Because if you do,
you'll understand why I flew all this way

669
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,066
without an appointment.

670
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,859
Is Dr. Nurko available?

671
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but he's got a nine-month waiting list.

672
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,907
I know. We're on it.

673
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,075
Here.

674
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,868
It's all right here,

675
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,246
how sick Anna is.

676
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,708
She starts her day with Align/Culturelle
for digestive immune support.

677
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,501
At 9:00 a.m., she takes rifaximin,

678
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,254
an antibiotic for bacterial overgrowth
in the GI tract.

679
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,715
She takes hyoscyamine
for intestinal spasms.

680
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,217
At 12:30, she needs gabapentin for...

681
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,720
To regulate her intestinal nerves,

682
00:34:55,803 --> 00:35:00,182
and lately she can't make it more
than three to four hours without tramadol.

683
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,393
She's always in pain.

684
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,020
I'm so sorry.

685
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,731
I have to check in other patients.

686
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,149
Uh, Zach. Zach will...

687
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,734
Bye.

688
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,778
...um, be happy to explain
our patient policy to you...

689
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,530
Look, Anna's always played soccer.

690
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:17,867
When she was little,
we used to call her Monkey. (SOBBING)

691
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,789
Because she was forever
climbing on everything.

692
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,166
I'm sorry.

693
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,546
And then one day she got sick.

694
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:35,551
Out of nowhere, she just got sick.

695
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,054
(BREATH TREMBLING)
And nobody knew what it was.

696
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,056
And they told me,
"Oh, she's lactose intolerant."

697
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,265
"She has acid reflux."

698
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:42,475
"it's an infection."

699
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,102
And I knew it wasn't. I'm her mother.

700
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:49,899
And I knew, I just knew
it was something bad. (SNIFFLING)

701
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,903
I'm not sure Anna can wait much longer.

702
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,079
I am so sorry.

703
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,164
I want to help you, I really do,

704
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:09,418
but I've only had this job for two weeks
and I really need it.

705
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,588
I'm just doing what I'm told.

706
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,927
Of course. (SNIFFLES)

707
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,013
Of course, I'm sorry.

708
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,685
I'm just trying to help my little girl.

709
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,105
- Sorry.
- WOMAN: If something opens up

710
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:30,856
- I'll let you know.
- CHRISTY: Excuse me.

711
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,317
I'm so sorry.

712
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,610
CHRISTY: Come on.

713
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,864
ANNA: Are you okay, Mom?

714
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,282
Yes, baby.

715
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,794
(WOMAN LAUGHING)

716
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,798
You need to eat, Mom.

717
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,136
You can't let yourself get iron deficient.

718
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,304
Don't worry about me.

719
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,014
Here, take these.

720
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,271
- WAITER: Oh, God. Great.
-It's okay.

721
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,856
Now, this day's just gettin' better
and better, huh?

722
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,274
Thank you, sir.

723
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,192
I'll take the table.

724
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,819
Be my guest, your majesty.

725
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,947
No, I got it, I got it.

726
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,073
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

727
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,366
- Everything is fine.
- Thank you.

728
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,576
Sorry.

729
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,996
For what? Being human?

730
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,372
Don't mind him.

731
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:31,417
He don't have kids,
and he has no personality.

732
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,753
You know, when you got kids,
things get messy.

733
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:34,837
I have three.

734
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,130
See? So, you know.

735
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,591
You either roll with it or you get rolled on.

736
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,676
You get rolled on, you get flat.

737
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,052
(LAUGHS)

738
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,556
So, where y'all from? What you doin' here?

739
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,225
Oh, well, we're from Burleson, Texas,

740
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,270
and there's a doctor
at Children's Hospital we're tryin' to see.

741
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:59,403
Well, Boston is one
of the finest cities I know.

742
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,573
I mean, you ask me,
it is the finest city in the country.

743
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,867
But I might be a little biased
because I live here.

744
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,035
I mean, I'm here.

745
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,328
- Of course it is.
-(LAUGHS)

746
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,079
But, no, it's a gorgeous city.

747
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,165
- So, yeah.
- Well, good.

748
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,417
Well, maybe we should try
to do a tour while we're here

749
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,543
if we have time.

750
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,212
Yeah. Yeah.

751
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,508
You know...

752
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:24,887
I'm off tomorrow.

753
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,349
I mean, I could be your tour guide.

754
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,476
Would you like to see the city?

755
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,644
- Yeah.
- You know what?

756
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,312
We can't. We can't.

757
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,647
We don't have time, honey.

758
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,232
I don't know what
the schedule's gonna be and...

759
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:37,316
- But, Mom, I really want to go.
-It's...

760
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,901
- Well, we're just...
- Mom, please.

761
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,111
We're just hopin' to get
this call from this doctor.

762
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,321
- Mom, please.
- Right, right.

763
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,405
- You got a cell phone, right?
- Well...

764
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,574
- I have a cell phone, either way.
- I do have...

765
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:46,867
Of course I have a cell phone.

766
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,285
I mean, we don't have to go far.
I mean, I could...

767
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,578
But I could show you
a couple really cool places.

768
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:50,996
Well, I just need to be able to get right here

769
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,456
-if they call us and tell us...
- I'm a fast driver.

770
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,707
- You should see me drive.
- Mom, please.

771
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,875
Please.

772
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,252
You want to go, baby?

773
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,503
Yeah.

774
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,173
All right.

775
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,258
Okay.

776
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,596
(CHUCKLES) Then we're goin'.

777
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,682
Oh, I'm Angela Bradford.

778
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,684
I'm Anna. This is my mom, Christy.

779
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,644
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

780
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,312
Angela, you know, how about
you leave the guests alone

781
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,481
and help the rest of us get
some work done here?

782
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:18,524
These are now my new friends.

783
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,984
This is Anna and Christy.

784
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,194
- Welcome now.
- And they're gonna give me a huge tip

785
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,362
in a few minutes.

786
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,446
- Just kidding.
- I'm sure they don't want you

787
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,031
-to lose the job either.
- All right.

788
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,366
I got to take care of these customers.

789
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,034
We'll talk in a sec. I'll come back.

790
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,077
- CHRISTY: Okay.
- Bye.

791
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,203

953
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,713
Now, the good news.

954
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,507
Our center is one of the very, very few places

955
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:31,136
that's been granted permission by the FDA
to prescribe a drug

956
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:33,972
that can help Anna digest some foods.

957
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:36,641
If it's successful,
the distension in her stomach

958
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:40,520
would be reduced
and we could end the tubal feeding.

959
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,482
This would give her
the semblance of a normal life.

960
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:44,900
A normal life.

961
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,526
That would be wonderful, Doctor.

962
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:50,030
I mean, however,
there's potential side effects.

963
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,991
Headaches, diarrhea, swelling,

964
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:56,995
and some that are more dangerous,
like cardiac arrhythmia.

965
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:05,295
Because of that, I am required to see her
every six weeks for monitoring.

00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:06,588
(SIGHS)

967
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,518
I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't believe
it was worth the risk.

968
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:34,366
CHRISTY: $1,000 for plane tickets to Boston
every six weeks.

969
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:37,410
$2,000 more a month
to increase our yearly cap.

00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,871
All the non-covered procedures,
the new medication,

but there's no money in it.

980

Well, we'll figure it out.

981
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,061
No, no. You can't say that.
I hate when you say that!

982
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:04,396
Well, I'm sorry, babe, but I don't have

983
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:05,814

984

- I can't give you an answer, but...
- I need an answer!

985
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,526

that it's all just gonna be okay! I...

987

It's called faith, Christy!

988

00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:48,773
Okay? I'll open this place seven clays a week.

Mmm. Kevin put you up to this.

1001
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,750
Well, he's worried about you.

1002

Yeah.

1003

I'm a little worried about me, too.

1004

Well, Kevin told me
what those ladies said to you, and I...

1005
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:20,513
I have to say, I sure wish
that I could give everybody

a spiritual IQ test
before they walk in the door.

Well, I'm gonna have to try
and love 'em from home,

'cause I'm not going to church with 'em.

you stopped coming, is it?

to connect to God or walking away.

1109
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,128
So she needs to be closely monitored.

1110
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,839
I just want to make sure
she doesn't have any obstruction

1111
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,632
that requires surgery.

1112
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:33,261
Once the episode resolves, she can go home.

- Do you have a horse?
- No.

1117

two pigs, three cows, and some goats.

1118

Why do you want the cross with you?

1129
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:33,029
It's just, like, a reminder.

1130
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:35,531
Of what?

1131
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,492
That Jesus is with me.

1132

1133

Okay, Anna,
we are gonna roll you down the hall.

All right, now let's get you down gently.

-(BOTH LAUGH)

01:01:36,611 --> 01:01:39,113
She told me not to be afraid to die.

1168
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:47,997
Why'd she say... Why'd she say that?

1169
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,458
You're not going to die.

1170
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,793
Because she's not afraid.

1171

-(KEYBOARD CLACKING)

1738
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:41,422

with my system.

1739

- And the distension is bigger because...

Yes?

1741
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,512
I'm the new receptionist.

1742
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:56,645

1750
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,581
ADELYNNI Anna!

1751
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,090
Miracles are God.

1752
01:37:26,467 --> 01:37:29,553
And God is forgiveness.

1753
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:37,811
Why was Anna healed
when today around the world

1754
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:40,481
there are so many children suffering?

1755
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:44,610
I don't know the answer.

1756
01:37:46,403 --> 01:37:48,280
But after everything I've been through,

1757
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:49,823
I've realized

1758
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:54,578
I'm not alone.

1759
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:59,500
And whatever you may be going through,

1760
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:03,754
I am here to tell you, you are not alone.

1761
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:08,592
Miracles are God's way of letting us know

1762
01:38:10,010 --> 01:38:11,804
he's here.

1763
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:19,144
Thank you.

1764
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:26,318
WOMAN: Is it possible that Anna
wasn't as sick as you said she was?

1765
01:38:26,402 --> 01:38:28,570
- MAN: Is she serious?
- I'm sorry?

1766
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:30,406
Did you seriously just say that?

1767
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:32,408
- I want to know.
- I'm sure you can all understand

1768
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:33,826
this is a little hard to believe.

1769
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,412
CAROL: Why would they say that?
MAN: And there's a lot of people out there

1770
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:38,247
-that are just lookin' for publicity.
- That's right.

1771
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:40,165
- MAN: I can't believe this.
-(MURMURING)

1772
01:38:44,378 --> 01:38:45,963
BEN: I believe her.

1773
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,931
I saw Anna in the hospital.

1774
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:59,143
She was gravely ill.

1775
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:04,064
So much so that I wasn't sure
she was going to make it out.

1776
01:39:06,108 --> 01:39:09,069
I've never been a religious person.

1777
01:39:11,697 --> 01:39:13,907
But my beautiful daughter...

1778
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,703
My beautiful daughter

1779
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:20,581
died recently.

1780
01:39:21,999 --> 01:39:23,792
Her name was Haley.

1781
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,378
And she was 10.

1782
01:39:28,297 --> 01:39:29,882
- She had cancer.
-(CRYING)

1783
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,927
And she suffered a great deal.

1784
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,976
But the last few weeks
of her life were different.

1785
01:39:42,144 --> 01:39:43,562
She felt...

1786
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:45,481
She felt safe.

1787
01:39:47,733 --> 01:39:49,318
She felt loved.

1788
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,071
She felt...

1789
01:39:55,324 --> 01:39:57,075
She felt God.

1790
01:39:58,911 --> 01:40:03,582
And she felt that way
because Anna gave her faith.

1791
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:07,503
She gave her peace.

1792
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,215
So...

1793
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:15,886
I came here today

1794
01:40:15,969 --> 01:40:19,097
from Boston to thank Annabel.

1795
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:23,644
And to thank you

1796
01:40:25,187 --> 01:40:27,439

Thank you all very much for coming.

1800
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:05,310
If you'd like to join us weekly,

1801
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:06,562
-you can sign up in the back.
- Yeah, sure.

1802
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:08,230
Our deacons will take care of that.
Thank you.

1803
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:12,651
Ben.

1804
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:16,321
I am so sorry to hear about Haley.

1805
01:41:16,405 --> 01:41:17,573
Hey.

1806
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:19,741
How can I ever thank you?

1807
01:41:19,825 --> 01:41:22,160
- Oh, look at this.
- I can't believe you came.

1808
01:41:22,244 --> 01:41:23,579
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

1809
01:41:23,662 --> 01:41:25,455
- How are you?
- Good.

1810
01:41:25,539 --> 01:41:26,957
You look so good. That's a very cute dress.

1811

KEVIN: Here we go, the great pizza reunion.

- ADELYNN: Can we eat now?

1814
01:41:46,518 --> 01:41:47,894
I'm starving.

1815
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:50,105
Well, let's let your daddy say grace.

1816

You know what, baby?
Why don't you say it?

1817

Bow your heads, girls.

It was her idea not to eat pizza
until Anna got better.
