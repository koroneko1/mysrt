1
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,666
It's time, Wonder Boy. Time to shine.

2
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,458
Eyes on your mom.

3
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,541
Hey!

4
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,041
Don't run randomly!
Go to the second floor!

5
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,083
I've already registered,
go to the second floor!

6
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,166
Your grandson has hemolytic jaundice.

7
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,500
Since his mom's blood type
is different from his,

8
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:16,458
her antibodies cause
his bilirubin level to rise,

9
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,166
resulting in jaundice.

10
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,375
What does that mean?

11
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,541
The jaundice has affected his brain.

12
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,541
The part of his brain which controls
his muscles is permanently damaged.

13
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,500
To put it simply,

14
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,375
it's cerebral palsy.

15
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,250
Even if he survives,

16
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,833
I believe that it would be difficult
for him to walk or use chopsticks.

17
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,083
The only thing we can do now

18
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,250
is an exchange transfusion.

19
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,000
The question is…

20
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,000
-Do you want to go for it?
-Yes!

21
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,708
Do whatever it takes!

22
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,208
Due to his cerebral palsy,

23
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,166
his muscle tone and control
are worse than an ordinary person's.

24
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,625
For instance,

25
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,375
his fingers are showing signs of atrophy.

26
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,125
As for his lower limbs,

27
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,750
since he has very weak muscles,

28
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
based on my experience,

29
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,041
if he's still not walking at this age,

30
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,083
I believe that the chances
of him walking is very slim.

31
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,166
We also found
that due to his cerebral palsy,

32
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,375
Wa Wai is left
with 10 to 20% of his hearing,

33
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,291
leading to difficulty in communicating.

34
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,416
He must wear a hearing aid
as soon as possible.

35
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,375
Mr. Shui, one coke, please.

36
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,458
Sure.

37
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,833
There's no need, it's my treat.

38
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,166
Why him?

39
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,500
Why not them?

40
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
Here, two dollars.

41
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,875
Jeez, how long will she keep searching?

42
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,250
Hey, don't you have work to do?

43
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,000
Mrs. So said
that her son's hearing aid is gone.

44
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,291
She's searching for it.

45
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,875
Is your son mentally challenged,
or are you?

46
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,833
I'm already letting you bring him to work.

47
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,083
Now, I have to stop the machines for him.

48
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,375
We have a deadline.

49
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,875
You can search for it yourself!

50
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,208
Get back to work, all of you!

51
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,250
-You're all crazy!
-It's no use.

52
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,250
It's better to just buy a new one.

53
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,916
It's worth thousands of dollars.

54
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,458
Wa Wai?

55
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,458
Wa Wai!

56
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,916
Wa Wai!

57
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,666
Wa Wai!

58
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,833
Wa Wai!

59
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,416
Wa Wai!

60
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,083
Wa Wai!

61
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,583
Wa Wai!

62
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,416
Why are you here?

63
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
Who moved you here?

64
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,583
You can't walk,

65
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,500
but you can scream!

66
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
Why are you smiling?

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,208
What's so funny?

68
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,916
You think it's funny?

69
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,750
Walk now,

70
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,916
or let's die together!

71
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,083
Walk.

72
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,375
Walk!

73
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,416
Walk!

74
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:26,291
Show me that you can walk, okay?

75
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,625
I'm looking at you.

76
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm looking at you.

77
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,125
Walk to me.

78
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,166
No one treats you like an ordinary person.

79
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,041
So just be

80
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,333
an extraordinary person.

81
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,416
Yes, well done.

82
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,250
That's right, one more step.

83
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,250
What's your name, kid?

84
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,125
Shu Ah Ai.

85
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,000
No, "shu" means lose.

86
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,458
So.

87
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,083
Wa.

88
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,583
Wai.

89
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,250
So Wa Wai.

90
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,083
Show your grandpa your walk.
You're amazing.

91
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,583
Dad, Wa Wai is doing great.

92
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,000
Darling, I went to see the doctor.

93
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,583
He said that
Wa Wai's condition isn't hereditary.

94
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,708
He said our next child will be fine.

95
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,041
It's very tiring to raise another child.

96
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,958
Get one more job.

97
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,333
When we're old,

98
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,250
someone has to take care of Wa Wai.

99
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,166
Stop playing around. Hurry up.

100
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
Wa Wai!

101
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Wa Wai!

102
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,833
Kin Wai.

103
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,333
Where were you, little guy?

104
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,583
Both of you, hurry up.
I have tons of clothes to sew.

105
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,083
I must bring them to the factory too.

106
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,250
For your homework tonight--

107
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,041
Mom! I need to go to the toilet.

108
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,541
You're so fussy. Be quick.

109
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,250
Kin Wai.

110
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,333
What's your grade in memorization today?

111
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,250
I think you got a zero again.

112
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,875
Okay, tell me. What's this word?

113
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
I don't know.

114
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:11,875
What about this?

115
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,958
I don't know.

116
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,250
"Sports Association
for the Physically Disabled."

117
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,958
"Sports Association."

118
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,208
"Athletics team"?

119
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,041
"Athletics team"?

120
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,333
God of Fortune is here!

121
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
May you prosper, Mrs. Chan!
God of Fortune is here!

122
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,208
God of Fortune!

123
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,041
You're so smart. You can write now?

124
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,500
Nice writing!

125
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,416
Here are ten dollars for you.

126
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,875
Thank you, Mrs. Chan. Thank you!

127
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,416
Good boy!

128
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,541
Wa Wai! Mom wants you
to come back for dinner.

129
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,958
What are you doing?

130
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,750
Selling God of Fortune!

131
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,625
Kin Wai, we can get extra food tonight!

132
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,583
Great!

133
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,041
Hey, who allowed you
to sell God of Fortune here?

134
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,250
You can stay if we keep half of the cut.

135
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,416
What are you doing?

136
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,958
Don't move or I'll beat you up.

137
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,166
Mom, they're bullying Wa Wai.

138
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,500
What?

139
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,208
Wa Wai!

140
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,416
Hey! Stop running, you punk!

141
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,916
-Don't let me catch you!
-Wa Wai!

142
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,583
Come on! Run faster!

143
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,500
Hurry up! Catch him!

144
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,208
Go upstairs.

145
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,250
Hurry, outflank him!

146
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,333
On the left.

147
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,666
Wa Wai! Run faster!

148
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,541
Outflank him! Don't follow me!

149
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,458
Go! Up ahead!

150
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,125
Where are you going?

151
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,791
Damn! That retard is so fast!

152
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,916
Hurry! Don't let them catch you!

153
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,416
Wa Wai! Run faster!

154
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,125
-Run faster!
-Stay there!

155
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,416
Stop, you retard!

156
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,708
You bunch of brats!

157
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,583
Scram!

158
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,166
Let's go! Don't just stand there.

159
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,000
Wa Wai, did you get hurt?

160
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,958
Do you feel unwell?

161
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,125
We can get extra food tonight.

162
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,458
I came to register.

163
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,541
Wa Wai.

164
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,291
How old are you?

165
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,875
Thirteen years old.

166
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,000
He's too young then.

167
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,458
ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST BE
14 YEARS OLD AND ABOVE.

168
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,666
ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST BE…

169
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,208
He's already 14. Based on his nominal age.

170
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,166
Nominal age?

171
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,458
All right, ma'am. He's 13 now.

172
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,333
If I let him join,
he'll compete with 18 and 19-year-olds.

173
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,041
It's unfair for him too.

174
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,916
Look how long his limbs are.

175
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,583
He's probably taller
than those 18 and 19-year-olds.

176
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,791
He's still in puberty,
and he's already taller than you.

177
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,166
Come on, give him a chance.

178
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,208
Come back next year, ma'am.

179
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Wa Wai!

180
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,208
Where are you going?

181
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,958
Do your best to run to the finish line.

182
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,291
Look over there and keep running, go!

183
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,416
Wa Wai,

184
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,125
those 18 and 19-year-olds
aren't as tall as you.

185
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay! Get into position.

186
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,791
Let's go, Wa Wai.

187
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,541
Wa Wai! You finished the race!

188
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,125
Wa Wai!

189
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,833
Wa Wai! You finished the race.

190
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,000
-Come back! Wa Wai!
-Ma'am.

191
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,666
-Come back!
-Ma'am.

192
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,666
-Ma'am.
-Wa Wai!

193
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,666
He's your son?

194
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,666
Yes.

195
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm Fong, coach of
Hong Kong Para-Athletics Team.

196
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,750
I would like to invite your son
to join our training.

197
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,916
What?

198
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,250
Bring him here at 7 p.m. on Monday.

199
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,458
Wa Wai.

200
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,375
You're going to start training soon.

201
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,791
Listen to Coach Fong.

202
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,916
Don't be too shy to ask questions.

203
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,583
Don't give up easily, okay?

204
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,250
Did you hear me?

205
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,041
Can you do it?

206
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,250
Of course,

207
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,750
it's just running.

208
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,375
How hard can it be?

209
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,375
Seven more laps to go.

210
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,833
Keep running!

211
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,458
Get lost if you can't run.

212
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,208
Don't slow others down!

213
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,000
Coach Fong, are you sure about this kid?

214
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,541
-Let's get someone else.
-How are you feeling?

215
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,500
Are you tired? Have some water.

216
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,541
What's going on?

217
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,000
Go home if you want to rest.

218
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,208
Keep running.

219
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,041
Run.

220
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,583
Mrs. So,

221
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,250
if you're going to let me train your son,
please don't interfere.

222
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,125
Don't come here again.

223
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,083
Also, you're not an athlete.

224
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,625
Keep off the track.

225
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,708
Here, have some water.

226
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,541
Drink it slowly.

227
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,916
Let me tell you.

228
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,916
You don't take Coach Fong too seriously.

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,333
If he says ten laps,

230
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,708
just answer, "Sure!"

231
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,041
Then run two laps.

232
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,583
And walk for the rest.

233
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,791
By the way,

234
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,041
are you part
of the Physically Disabled Team too?

235
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,416
Coach Fong is my elder brother.

236
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,708
By the way,

237
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,458
why is he running
with a plastic bag on his head?

238
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,708
He's crazy.

239
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,125
He said it's as good
as high-altitude training.

240
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,166
He can train his cardiovascular function.

241
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
Rumor has it

242
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,708
that he used to have
100 m races with trains.

243
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,791
He really ran faster than a train.

244
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,875
That's why we call him Train Tung.

245
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,291
Don't be silly, it's not going to work.

246
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,291
What's he saying?

247
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,875
Who knows? Only Gai can understand him.

248
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,541
So we always need Gai
to translate for him.

249
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,458
All right! Okay, do whatever you want,
even if it kills you.

250
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,000
Whatever, suit yourself.

251
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,833
What does he want this time?

252
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:19,125
He said he came up with a quicker way
to pass the baton. What a joke.

253
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,583
-Hurry up.
-All right, I'm coming.

254
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,333
Okay, I'm here.

255
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,875
Come on, be quick.

256
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,791
Train Tung, train by yourself.

257
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,875
Gai and Keung. Run five laps first.

258
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,541
Then another lap
after a three-minute break.

259
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,625
Full speed for the last 200 m.
Repeat 3 times.

260
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,625
Train baton passing with me afterward.

261
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,708
Okay.

262
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,375
Wa Wai, run ten more laps tonight.

263
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,250
That's 20 in total.

264
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,000
I mean nonstop.
Do you know what nonstop means?

265
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,625
Sure.

266
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,208
Go on, then.

267
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,708
Hey!

268
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,708
I told you to run, not walk.

269
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,916
All right, that's a wrap!

270
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,166
The lights are off, but you're not.

271
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,208
You have eight more laps.

272
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,125
Don't go home until you finish them.

273
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,916
Run.

274
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,541
You know why I chose you?

275
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,666
That day, you showed very steady

276
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,875
and frequent strides.

277
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,000
I've never seen such a strong first-timer.

278
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,875
But I've only seen that once.

279
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,833
I've never seen that again on you.

280
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,541
Wa Wai, Coach Fong is tough on you

281
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,875
because he wants you to be good enough
to take his place.

282
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,291
In the last Paralympics,

283
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,875
he took Train Tung, Keung, and I
to run the 4x100 m relay.

284
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,541
Even with our usual practice time,

285
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,583
we could have pocketed a medal.

286
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,458
But Keung and I thought we crossed
the changeover box during baton passing

287
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,875
and lost some time.

288
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,875
We came fourth in the end with no medals.

289
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:43,125
It hit Coach Fong the hardest
as it was his last Paralympics.

290
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,666
Why did he stop running?

291
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,791
He hurt his back, and he's old.

292
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,541
But the three of us are over 30 years old.

293
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:55,083
This could be our last one too.

294
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,375
So,

295
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,833
we're counting on you this time.

296
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,083
Does it mean

297
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,333
we can win a gold medal if I run?

298
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,375
Who knows?

299
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,375
You're so slow, maybe a silver.

300
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,291
No way, I have to get a gold medal!

301
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,708
Yes, I have to get a gold medal!

302
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,333
His 100 m record is still over 15 seconds.

303
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,208
That's not a big problem,
we can help him make up for some time.

304
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,083
My biggest worry now is his balance. Look.

305
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:31,291
It means he can't run
the first and third bends.

306
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,708
So he must be second?

307
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,166
He's bad at baton passing,
so that's even riskier.

308
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,458
Hurry!

309
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,458
No, we'll be in trouble.

310
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,583
Why?

311
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,875
I have always run the anchor leg!

312
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,541
That's my decision and it's final.

313
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,958
Why should we always accommodate him?

314
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,250
We're a team.

315
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,958
It doesn't matter
who crosses the finish line.

316
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,166
It matters to me!

317
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:11,958
I quit!

318
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,125
-Let go of me!
-Are you done?

319
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,166
We're doomed if he runs the third leg.

320
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,666
But we still stand a chance
if he runs the anchor leg.

321
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,000
You want him to run fourth?

322
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,750
I'm quitting unless he runs
in under 15 seconds!

323
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,708
Carry on.

324
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,416
Yes.

325
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,750
Do it slowly.

326
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,291
Find your balance first.

327
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,458
Squat lower.

328
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,416
Do it slowly, find your balance first.

329
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,125
Can you do it or not?

330
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,250
Wa Wai?
What's with the bag over your head?

331
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:45,625
Wa Wai?

332
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,250
Why are you crying?

333
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,583
Have you been bullied?

334
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,958
Tell me.

335
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,625
I want…

336
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,125
I want to run faster.

337
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,958
I'm already working so hard.

338
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,916
Instead of crying hard, run hard.

339
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,166
Let's make it
less than 15 seconds together!

340
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,875
Faster!

341
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,041
A nice and juicy hamburger.

342
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,958
Wa Wai, you must eat more beef.

343
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,416
Build more muscles,

344
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,416
then you'll be able
to carry two Gills in the future.

345
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,208
Kin Wai, this is yours.

346
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:00,666
Yours has a slice of cheese.
Wa Wai's has none.

347
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,291
Hey, Wa Wai. Wait for me.

348
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,875
Dad, have some eggs.

349
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,583
Mom, have some eggs.

350
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,541
Wa Wai, have some eggs.

351
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,541
Hand!

352
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hey!

353
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,416
Young man.

354
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,000
Excuse me, please.

355
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,666
This place is mine.

356
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,583
How did it go?

357
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,000
Train Tung really never showed up.

358
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:55,708
It's up to him to run with us or run away.

359
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:59,000
But there are only three of us,
will you run again?

360
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,875
Call him and talk to him.

361
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,583
Are you insane?

362
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,958
He doesn't have a problem with Keung.

363
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,958
You call him.

364
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,750
Forget it, leave him be.

365
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,208
I'm not allowed inside.

366
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,791
You are allowed to, but you just won't.

367
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,083
It's full of mosquitoes here.

368
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,208
It's so annoying.

369
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,583
Do you know that you have a fan?

370
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,708
That silly boy Wa Wai

371
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,791
is putting a plastic bag over his head
just like you.

372
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:38,250
Are plastic bags used for that?

373
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,208
I thought a bag
is for carrying stuff only.

374
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,458
Do you want some?

375
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:43,375
It's good.

376
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,375
Shall we share it?

377
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:53,416
That silly boy was crying as he said,

378
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,583
"I wish I could run just as fast as him."

379
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,166
It must be cool

380
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,875
to be someone's idol.

381
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:45,250
Run!

382
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:47,666
Run!

383
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,666
I said run, laggard!

384
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,250
Run!

385
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,000
I said run, laggard!

386
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,291
Extend your hand!

387
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,833
Grab it!

388
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,250
Run!

389
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,666
Faster!

390
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,250
Look ahead! Run!

391
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,500
Run faster! Run!

392
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:10,750
Run!

393
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,916
14.57 seconds!

394
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,708
You did it!

395
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,458
Do your best, son.

396
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,041
I told all our relatives to watch

397
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,375
the live broadcast on television
and cheer for you.

398
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,916
There's no live broadcast
of the Paralympics in Hong Kong.

399
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,125
Really?

400
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,958
But when Lee Lai Shan
got her Olympic gold medal last month,

401
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,375
I watched her on television.

402
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,666
How can the Paralympics
compare to the Olympics?

403
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,333
We only get a few dozen thousand
if we win a medal in the Paralympics.

404
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,000
The government gave Lee Lai Shan
one million for her gold medal.

405
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,000
Why is the difference so big?

406
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,791
In this world, equal pay
for equal work doesn't exist.

407
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,791
I'll check in.
Stay right here and wait for me.

408
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:51,875
Wa Wai?

409
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,916
Mom, can you hear me?

410
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,208
Yes, I hear you.

411
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,208
I can only talk for five minutes.

412
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,125
What?

413
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,041
I'll speak faster then.

414
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,333
You flew over ten hours, are you tired?

415
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,916
Did you get some sleep?

416
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,541
Eat more beef, US beef is good.

417
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,333
Yes, there is a lot of beef here.

418
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:15,166
There's steak and hamburgers.

419
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,166
Everything is free.

420
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,208
Stuff yourself up then.

421
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,916
You need fuel for running.

422
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,916
But I don't want to run anymore.

423
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,166
You guys are not here.

424
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,458
I'm all alone.

425
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,333
How are you alone?

426
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,875
I'm watching you.

427
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,291
How?

428
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,416
Are you going to fly over here?

429
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,291
When you start running,

430
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,833
imagine me watching you
at the finish line.

431
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,041
It's just like what they always say.

432
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,583
Eyes on your mom, set, go!

433
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,708
What?

434
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,916
Eyes on your mom, set, go!

435
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,458
It's "on your mark,"

436
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,333
not "eyes on your mom."

437
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:00,000
By the way, where are Dad and Kin Wai?

438
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:04,541
Those two are sleeping like pigs.

439
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,958
Let me hear it.

440
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:08,708
Wait a moment.

441
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,250
Wait.

442
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:55,666
How is it now?

443
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,208
No, there's still no signal.

444
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,833
-How about this position?
-No.

445
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:04,458
Move it a bit, Hong.
There's still no signal!

446
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:05,791
And now?

447
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,291
Still no signal.

448
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,750
It's working! Don't move!

449
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
It's Wa Wai.

450
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,208
I want to pee.

451
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,500
Endure it for a bit.
The race will start soon.

452
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,916
Keung!

453
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,541
Don't be scared!
You have a chance, it's no time to fear!

454
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:16,958
Fearing is losing!

455
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,125
Run while you still can!

456
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:21,125
Keung! This is our last race.

457
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
Win a medal for me, okay?

458
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,250
Can you? Keung!

459
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes!

460
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,833
I can do it!

461
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,708
-Yes!
-Yes!

462
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,041
Faster!

463
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,041
Go!

464
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,041
Go!

465
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,166
Hand!

466
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,291
Run!

467
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,166
Run to the finish line!

468
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,916
Get up!

469
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,166
We won first place!

470
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,583
We won!

471
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,583
Get up!

472
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:16,791
Look!

473
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,208
First place!

474
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,458
First place!

475
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,708
First place!

476
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,333
-Here they come.
-It's So Wa Wai!

477
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:08,708
-They're back.
-Over here.

478
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,625
-Get off from here.
-Stop here.

479
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,041
Wa Wai!

480
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,500
Smile!

481
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:14,625
-Mom!
-Say a few words.

482
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,583
-Mom! I miss you so much!
-Wa Wai!

483
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,750
I miss you!

484
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,000
You were incredible.

485
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,416
Gosh, it's so heavy!

486
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,000
-How are you? Are you tired?
-So Wa Wai.

487
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,583
What it's like to win the first
Paralympics gold medal for Hong Kong?

488
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,708
What about Mrs. So?

489
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,416
So Wa Wai represented Hong Kong
at such a tender age.

490
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,750
With such good results,

491
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,041
how do you feel?

492
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,958
It's wonderful.

493
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,500
So, "Wonder Mom,"

494
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,958
what's your secret
to raising this "Wonder Boy"?

495
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,291
Just eat more beef.

496
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,791
As a mom of a Paralympic athlete,

497
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,333
what do you think the government
needs to improve on?

498
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,041
Equal pay for equal work.

499
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,791
What?

500
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:18,291
It's true.

501
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,208
I mean they're all Olympic gold medalists.

502
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:27,625
Why do Paralympians get
so much less than normal Olympians?

503
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,916
I think there should be
equal pay for equal work.

504
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,666
-Yes!
-Yes!

505
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,958
Well said!

506
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,875
Mom.

507
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,500
This is for you.

508
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,583
When I was little,

509
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,208
Grandpa always said

510
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,833
that when you married Dad,

511
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,208
you didn't have any gold jewelry.

512
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,500
So

513
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:31,416
I'm going to get lots and lots
of gold medals for you.

514
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:23,041
SO WA WAI'S MOM SUPPORTS HER SON

515
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,625
SHOULD HE BECOME
A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE

516
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:23,750
Did he win?

517
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,416
Wa Wai!

518
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,375
-At the 2004 Paralympics in Athens,
-Don't move.

519
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,041
So Wa Wai, our Wonder Boy,

520
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,916
won a gold medal in the 200 m men's
T36 classification for Hong Kong again,

521
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,791
breaking his own world record
at the same time.

522
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,875
Congratulations to the winners
from various fields

523
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:11,708
for receiving the 35th Hong Kong
Ten Outstanding Individuals Award.

524
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,375
Please come to the stage
for a group photo.

525
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,875
Thank you, our media partners.

526
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,166
Congratulations again to our winners.

527
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,041
Hello, Mrs. So.

528
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:38,375
-Hello.
-Hi.

529
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,708
-Did I startle you?
-No.

530
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:42,125
This is my business card.

531
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:45,583
Mr. Lau?

532
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,416
Just call me Victor.

533
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,666
My company specializes
in representing athletes.

534
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,333
We negotiate sponsorships for athletes.

535
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,666
Sometimes, we arrange
advertisement deals too.

536
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,750
Increasing one's popularity is secondary.

537
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,666
What's important is earning extra cash.

538
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,875
You know how hard life is
for Hong Kong athletes.

539
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,625
Mrs. So, the press is waiting.

540
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,208
Do the interview with Wa Wai.

541
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:10,375
All right.

542
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,791
I'll leave you to it.

543
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:20,000
Mr. Lau, how much can you make
from an advertisement?

544
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,791
It's hard to give an exact number.

545
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,458
But it's safe to say that it'll be more
than winning a gold medal.

546
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,750
Mrs. So?

547
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,250
Okay, I'll be right there.

548
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,583
Thank you in advance then.

549
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,333
Let's work together then.

550
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,291
Bye.

551
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,291
Bye.

552
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,041
-Bye.
-Bye.

553
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:45,125
The next Olympics will be held in Beijing.

554
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:49,541
To us Hong Kong athletes…

555
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:50,625
It's…

556
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:55,208
It's extremely meaningful.

557
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,291
Well…

558
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:02,083
I hope that I can run faster
when the time comes.

559
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:06,666
I hope that I can break my own record.

560
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:15,458
-Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone!
-Happy Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone!

561
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,958
-Coach Fong, what do you want to eat?
-Thank you, I'll help myself.

562
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,208
This beef is good.

563
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:32,291
Okay, thank you.

564
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:35,833
Gill, these are your favorite fish balls.
Eat more.

565
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,000
Thank you.

566
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,875
Thank you, you should eat too.

567
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,666
Coach Fong, for the next Paralympics,

568
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,666
I want to join the 100 m, 200 m,
and 400 m events.

569
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,000
Sure.

570
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:55,125
You agreed so easily, Coach Fong.

571
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,083
If Gai and Keung
weren't over the age limit,

572
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,875
I would let him
join the 4x100 m relay too.

573
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:04,125
Wa Wai, look at how much faith
your coach has in you.

574
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:07,041
No, I'm just spreading my bets evenly,
just like horse racing.

575
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,541
-Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
-Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

576
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:31,666
Hey.

577
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:38,708
Here.

578
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:01,250
You always wear flip-flops.

579
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:02,250
Your toes!

580
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,708
You don't cut your nails?

581
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,583
-That's not true.
-I'll cut your toenails! So Wa Wai!

582
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,750
So Wa Wai!

583
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,208
Want some mandarin oranges?

584
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,166
Wa Wai.

585
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,625
Let me ask you a brain teaser.

586
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,958
Why does Ming run faster than a train?

587
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,916
Because Ming runs really fast.

588
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,125
Wrong!

589
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,916
Because it's a toy train!

590
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:47,166
Why do you and Gill have the same answer?

591
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,708
Why can't you believe that Ming

592
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,916
can really run faster than a train?

593
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,041
You keep talking about Gill all the time.

594
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,833
Ask her out if you like her.

595
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,625
Don't say ridiculous things.

596
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,416
Don't you ever, ever

597
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:10,333
say this in front of her!

598
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:13,958
You can't fool me, kiddo.

599
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:17,375
The wind is high, and the sun is out.

600
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,833
It's perfect for asking a girl out.

601
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:22,958
Wa Wai, you're already a grown-up.

602
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:24,875
Go and ask.

603
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,166
I can't hear you.

604
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:33,625
Hey!

605
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:34,875
I can't hear you!

606
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,083
I can't hear you!

607
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,875
Wa Wai!

608
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:10,083
Faster!

609
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,083
Wa Wai!

610
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:34,916
You did it.

611
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:39,416
My son ran faster than a train! Wa Wai!

612
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:01,208
I have no idea how he got into a fight.

613
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,208
I…

614
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,416
Hi, Miss.
Where is the Orthopedics Department?

615
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,541
-Take the lift to the seventh floor.
-Thank you.

616
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:07,875
I have to go.

617
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,416
We'll sue him!

618
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,750
Darling, take me to a private hospital.

619
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,875
Get me a specialist to check my head.

620
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,000
Let that bastard pay for it.

621
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,208
You tripped yourself down the stairs.

622
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,625
Who are you suing?

623
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,916
Are lawyers free?

624
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:29,791
Are private doctors free?

625
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,875
Mr. So, how much have you got
in your pocket?

626
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,958
The doctor wants you to lie in bed
for two months.

627
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:44,333
If you twist your neck again,
you'll become paralyzed.

628
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,916
Mom, I just asked Keung.

629
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,166
He can recommend me
to the courier company he works for.

630
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:59,041
No way! You're training all day long.

631
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,708
And courier? Your legs won't last.

632
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,708
-Even better, I can treat it as training.
-No way.

633
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:06,416
I'll take another part-time job.

634
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,958
Kin Wai, stop playing basketball
after school for the next two months.

635
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,625
Take care of your dad.

636
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,708
Help him with going to the toilet.

637
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,416
I'm on the soccer team.

638
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:49,791
Hello, is this Victor?

639
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,416
Speaking. Who is calling?

640
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,166
I'm Mrs. So.

641
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:57,041
Can you find
some advertisements for Wa Wai?

642
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,166
Gosh, it's difficult to get those lately.

643
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,708
The Olympics are years away.

644
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,875
No one will get an athlete
for advertisements.

645
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:07,416
With your capabilities,
I'm sure you can find something.

646
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:09,541
You're too kind.

647
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:12,083
I'll try to ask around tomorrow.

648
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,375
Thank you.

649
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:16,083
I'll call again in a couple of days.

650
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:18,916
Sure, I'll let you know
if I have any news.

651
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,583
Get some rest, Mrs. So. Bye.

652
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:52,541
Here.

653
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:54,750
Take it.

654
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:57,125
Get the medals back with the money.

655
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:58,291
Take it.

656
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,833
Is it not enough?

657
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:11,791
Here.

658
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,791
I still have over 3,000 dollars
in the bank.

659
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,625
That's everything I have.

660
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,416
Take it!

661
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:23,208
Take it!

662
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:24,291
Take it!

663
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:25,708
Take it!

664
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,333
Do you know that your brother

665
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:31,791
won every medal with blood and sweat?

666
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,541
How can you sell them?

667
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:35,625
Aren't you embarrassed?

668
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:37,166
Yes, I'm a disgrace!

669
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,166
I'm a loser, unlike my elder brother!

670
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:41,541
Have you ever taken care of me?

671
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,416
Do you know what my favorite food is?

672
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,375
When we go out for Christmas dinner,

673
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:47,541
my steak is always missing
from my mixed grill.

674
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,583
My burgers are buns without patty!

675
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,750
I'm your son too.

676
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,875
My purpose is just to care for Wa Wai.

677
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,833
So I'm making money to care for him now!

678
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:06,833
Also,

679
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,958
I'm not on the basketball team.

680
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,666
I'm on the soccer team,

681
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:15,375
Mom.

682
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:40,541
Mom.

683
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:48,208
Keung's company is willing to hire me.

684
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,625
I told you not to worry about us.

685
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,500
No, Mom.

686
01:01:57,791 --> 01:01:59,916
I don't want to run anymore.

687
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,291
I want to go and earn money.

688
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:08,708
I've already been to the Paralympics
and won gold medals.

689
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:11,583
I have no regrets.

690
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:15,541
I don't want to see you working four jobs

691
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,000
and Kin Wai making money,

692
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:22,083
just so that I can continue running.

693
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,666
I don't want you all to suffer.

694
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,791
I'll suffer even more if you quit, Wa Wai.

695
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,250
People look up to you because you run.

696
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:40,041
But I'm the one looking down
on myself now.

697
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:52,958
All right, it'll be fine.

698
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,916
Don't worry, okay?

699
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,333
Breakfast is on the table.

700
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:21,833
Okay.

701
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,458
What the heck!
I waited for you for so long.

702
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,375
Stop eating and move!
It's already 3:30 p.m.

703
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:49,500
No, because I was--

704
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:51,083
Stop jabbering!

705
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:16,500
The Paralympic Committee called me.
They want you to be the torchbearer.

706
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,708
No, Coach Fong.

707
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,750
I'm not an athlete anymore.

708
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:25,708
I'm a courier now.

709
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,291
You're really not running anymore?

710
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,291
You'll be over 30 at the next Paralympics.

711
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,416
This might be your last chance.

712
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,500
Coach Fong.

713
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,125
My dad still can't go back to work.

714
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:47,041
I can earn around 7,000 dollars a month

715
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:50,625
with my job now.

716
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:56,250
After probation,
I'll get the 13th month's pay.

717
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,333
If I go back to running,

718
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:03,000
I only get 3,000 dollars
of government subsidy a month.

719
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:13,166
Earlier, the Olympic flame touched down
in Hong Kong from Ho Chi Minh City.

720
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,875
The torch relay in Hong Kong begins.

721
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:19,250
The first time Hong Kong took part
in the Olympic torch relay was in 1964

722
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:22,750
in the run-up
to the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

723
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:25,208
This is the city's
second Olympic torch relay.

724
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,166
At 8 a.m. this morning,

725
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,750
the Olympic torch relay began

726
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:31,750
at the piazza
of the Hong Kong Cultural Center.

727
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:35,958
Celebrities and athletes
will join hands for the relay.

728
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:39,416
The relay will last for eight hours,

729
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,083
passing throughout the city.

730
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:45,333
Crowds holding the national
and HKSAR flags have lined their route

731
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:49,958
while the torchbearers wave
at the crowd as they run.

732
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:51,625
What a spectacle.

733
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:55,833
Everyone wants to personally witness
the momentous Olympic torch relay.

734
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:17,291
COUNTING DOWN TOWARDS
2008 BEIJING OLYMPICS

735
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,791
HONG KONG TEAM STRIVES
FOR ANOTHER GROUNDBREAKING VICTORY

736
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,416
Hello, Victor. I'm Mrs. So.

737
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,791
Mrs. So? What's the matter?

738
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:34,541
Didn't you say
that you couldn't get an advertisement

739
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:36,333
because the Olympics is still far away?

740
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:39,500
The Beijing Olympics is coming.
Can you get him something?

741
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:43,166
Of course, but I heard
that Wa Wai has quit running.

742
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,125
In that case, it would be difficult,

743
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,750
unless he runs in Beijing.

744
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,583
He will! He never said he would quit.

745
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,916
Wa Wai! Run faster, slowpoke!

746
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:54,958
Wa Wai,

747
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,666
I got you some advertisement deals.

748
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,041
With the money, you can keep running.

749
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,083
What? Advertisements?

750
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:08,416
-Okay, our crew is ready.
-It's so cute.

751
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,166
You look really cute, it's very nice.

752
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,791
Can't you stop laughing?

753
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,875
You really look like him.

754
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:18,875
No, Mom.

755
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:22,416
I really can't do this sort of thing.

756
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,666
-You look good!
-I know, right?

757
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:29,000
Yes, you look like Wonder Boy
in the flesh.

758
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,541
The client will love it.

759
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:32,750
Really, the client will love it.

760
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,166
Hey, he's ready.

761
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,333
All right, Wa Wai. Let's have a rehearsal.

762
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,208
Mrs. So.

763
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,208
I've negotiated some sponsorships.

764
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:47,416
Shirts, trousers,
shoes, socks, and health drinks.

765
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,916
Sign here.
They'll send them to your house.

766
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,083
-Okay. Look this way, Wa Wai.
-They're free?

767
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,333
-That's what sponsorship means.
-It's all right.

768
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:02,250
Really? So generous?

769
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:04,166
It's not that they're generous.

770
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,916
It's because I'm competent.

771
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:19,541
You're really running today.

772
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,750
You're not being Wonder Boy.

773
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,500
How can you say that?

774
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:39,333
How was it?

775
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,208
How long did it take?

776
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:47,041
You're back to your time in Atlanta.

777
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,875
It's normal, you stopped training
for one and a half years.

778
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,250
You only have eight months
before the games in Beijing.

779
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,416
I know.

780
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,958
You need the adverts to keep running.

781
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:01,625
Hang in there.

782
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,666
Let's make up for the lost time.

783
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,916
You have a slow start,

784
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,291
so you can only catch up
with others after 50 m.

785
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,375
That's why 200 m
is the best distance for you.

786
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,166
Because you'll have time to catch up.

787
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,416
But there's another problem, your balance.

788
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,333
There are bends in the 200 m track.

789
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:25,750
You must begin practicing starting
on the outer track.

790
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:28,958
Run towards this line
and it'll turn into a straight track.

791
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:32,416
Even if it takes longer,
it lessens the curve of the bend.

792
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,875
-Our beverages have four new flavors.
-Take one and try it.

793
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:41,625
One, two.

794
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:42,625
Again.

795
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,750
Your slow start is your biggest weakness.

796
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,291
Since you wear a hearing aid,
you have a slow reaction.

797
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,208
You're the last to hear the shot.

798
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,291
One, two.

799
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,625
One, two, three, smile.

800
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:54,583
To get a better result,

801
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,125
we must focus on training how you start.

802
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,375
Are you So Wa Wai?

803
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,083
-I am.
-Gosh! You're so handsome!

804
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,291
You're so cute!

805
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:06,000
My fingers are too weak.

806
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,541
Train until you can.

807
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:09,583
You weren't a celebrity
before this either.

808
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:12,750
We must try new ways for you to catch up.

809
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,041
I will train your fingers too.

810
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,875
It's fine even if you can just be
0.1 seconds faster.

811
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,875
Again.

812
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,500
Higher, over here by my hand.

813
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,833
Can you see it?

814
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:27,875
Lower, take strides.

815
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,666
Can you do it higher? Over here.

816
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,625
Hurry up.

817
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,000
-Lower.
-Higher, over here.

818
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,625
Lower. Get up!

819
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:34,833
-Faster!
-Higher!

820
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,541
-Again!
-Faster!

821
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,208
Lower!

822
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,208
Higher!

823
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,750
Here.

824
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:50,875
Get up. Carry on.

825
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,333
I can't, I have to run.

826
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,416
Just shut up and do it.

827
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,000
Can we train now?

828
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,750
Do you want to fail the qualifiers?

829
01:11:58,666 --> 01:11:59,791
Fine.

830
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,666
He's coming.

831
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,125
Go and train first.

832
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,166
Mrs. So.

833
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,625
Victor, I said no more advertisements.

834
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,541
Wa Wai's time is even worse
than when he was in Atlanta.

835
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:22,833
He has to train hard now.

836
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,916
I negotiated these contracts
for you this week.

837
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,083
Take a look at this first.

838
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:35,500
We won't do them.

839
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,416
Look at the price first.

840
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:50,583
What are you still thinking about?

841
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,458
It's the most profitable time
for Wa Wai now.

842
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,333
Has he ever thought about
what he would do after retiring?

843
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:13,833
In Hong Kong,

844
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:17,458
after a normal athlete retires,
it would be hard to support himself,

845
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,666
let alone someone like Wa Wai.

846
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,375
Make him more money.

847
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:25,291
That's how you can really help as his mom.

848
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:27,708
There's a saying

849
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,208
that really suits athletes.

850
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,583
"Fame is fickle food."

851
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:37,541
It never lasts.

852
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,000
How can a champion

853
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,333
stink like a tramp?

854
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,500
Cut!

855
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,583
Very good. For this part…

856
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:54,041
It's going smoothly, isn't it?

857
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,875
I'm so sorry.

858
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:57,708
He got held up a little from training.

859
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:59,375
Five hours is a little?

860
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:02,125
Will you pay for our overtime?

861
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,500
Is he late for his races too?

862
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,000
I know,

863
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,166
but I need a rest too.

864
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,958
What's the matter? What's wrong?

865
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,666
The director…

866
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:19,875
He said…

867
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:23,125
He said that I spoke too well,
it doesn't sound like me.

868
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:27,500
He told me to stutter on purpose,
to sound like a spastic person.

869
01:14:27,583 --> 01:14:30,750
I want to know what's the rationale.

870
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,041
Just listen to the director.

871
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:34,375
Do as the director says.

872
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:35,666
Try to stutter.

873
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,583
-Don't speak too well and act stupid.
-He…

874
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,500
Speaking smoothly
isn't what you do, right?

875
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,875
Go and finish the shoot.

876
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,125
Come back.

877
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:14,833
Try again.

878
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:25,958
Use more force in your fingers.

879
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,250
Come back.

880
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:37,166
One more.

881
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,166
Hey!

882
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,291
What are you doing?

883
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:45,166
I want to run, not practice this thing!

884
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,541
Fine, forget it!

885
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:48,958
Forget it!

886
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,875
I'm trying to help!

887
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:54,125
But you just want it your way!

888
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:56,333
Are you going to keep wasting time?

889
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:59,750
I only know that my way
is to look forward,

890
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,958
not stare at this thing!

891
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:09,750
Yes, I know that I start slow.

892
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:13,958
But that's why I kept catching up
and charging forward.

893
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,875
It's just like my life.

894
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:18,666
I must catch up from behind!

895
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:36,916
Wa Wai.

896
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,875
The television interview Victor arranged
has been changed to tomorrow.

897
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,416
I have to train tomorrow.

898
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,791
Okay. I'll apply for leave
at the Sports Institute.

899
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,333
Apply for leave?

900
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,333
I don't have time anymore!

901
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,416
Okay.

902
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,833
I'll ask Victor to reschedule then.

903
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,541
You said I only need to do it once.

904
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:59,041
Why are there more and more?

905
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,500
You'll be done after these few.

906
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,333
Hang in there.

907
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,333
Mom, I just want to run.

908
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Wa Wai.

909
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:20,375
You can't run all your life.

910
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:23,166
After filming these ads,
you'll get a few hundred thousand.

911
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,458
Just run a bit less.

912
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:26,041
Run a bit less?

913
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:29,250
If I ran one lap less when I was little,

914
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,750
you would say that it won't do!

915
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:38,041
Now, everything is fine with you.

916
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,125
The key is with me.

917
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,166
Let's watch the replay.

918
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,791
Okay, watch the replay.

919
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,833
-Sir, can I borrow an outlet
-We're done here.

920
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:29,416
to charge my phone?

921
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,666
-Sure.
-Thank you.

922
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,958
This shot is okay. Prepare the next scene.

923
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,875
-All right.
-This shot is okay, switch scenes.

924
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,541
What happened? Did you find Wa Wai?

925
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,000
My phone is out of battery.

926
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,375
The next scene is his.

927
01:18:43,458 --> 01:18:44,791
Yes, okay.

928
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,166
-Mrs. So.
-Yes?

929
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,750
Talk to him.

930
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:50,291
If he doesn't come today,

931
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,416
they'll sue me.

932
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,041
You'll need to pay them too.

933
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,083
-Done.
-Okay.

934
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,958
Perhaps the traffic is bad.

935
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,750
When my phone gets charged,
I can find him.

936
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:02,791
You must find him.

937
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,625
Hurry. Help me out.

938
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:19,708
Fifty-eight times.

939
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:22,333
What 58 times?

940
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:25,083
Your mom called you 58 times.

941
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:30,375
Mrs. So is worried about you
and wants you to earn more money.

942
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:37,833
Or you can tell Victor
that I can stand in for you.

943
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:41,166
That's right.

944
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:48,166
There was once when he wanted me
to make a starting pose.

945
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:52,583
Then he told me to turn my head up.

946
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:55,458
Hang on, how could I turn?

947
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,875
-Also--
-Wa Wai!

948
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,708
Did I buy a phone for you
to listen to songs?

949
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,875
-Go, come on.
-Why didn't you pick up?

950
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,666
Don't run away!

951
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,708
We waited eight hours for you!

952
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,000
-Mrs. So--
-We have to compensate them back!

953
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:12,291
-Mrs. So, have some water first.
-Help me talk to him!

954
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,791
If he's not listening to you,
why would he listen to me?

955
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,958
He'll listen to his girlfriend.

956
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:20,083
Hey! Mind what you say!

957
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:23,125
You've liked her for so many years,
but you don't dare to tell her.

958
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,666
I'll tell her if you won't.

959
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,208
He has always treated you
as his girlfriend.

960
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,958
You've never had a boyfriend
in over a decade.

961
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:32,916
He's a good man,
why don't you consider him?

962
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,750
Mrs. So.

963
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,250
Wa Wai isn't the man of my dreams.

964
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,833
There are things

965
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:17,458
that I want to bury in my heart
and keep to myself.

966
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,166
Why must you dig it out?

967
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,583
I wanted to help you.

968
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:28,500
You don't want to help me.

969
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,666
You want to control me.

970
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,541
I want to help you find someone
to cut your toenails.

971
01:21:34,625 --> 01:21:37,083
I don't need anyone to cut my toenails.

972
01:21:37,166 --> 01:21:39,208
I'll cut them myself!

973
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,500
You'll do it yourself? Fine, do it.

974
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,666
Cut them now. Show me!

975
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:57,250
You won so many gold medals
in the past ten years.

976
01:21:57,333 --> 01:22:00,625
I told myself that my son is a genius.

977
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,041
My son is an extraordinary person.

978
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,708
But after this Paralympics,
can you still race?

979
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:10,708
Soon, nobody will remember
who So Wa Wai is.

980
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,500
After your dad and I are gone,
who will take care of you?

981
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:16,625
You'll end up getting subsidies
from the government.

982
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,458
I can go back to being a courier.

983
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:20,416
Your friend helped you out with that one.

984
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:22,708
Otherwise, who would hire you?

985
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,541
If I were him,
I would prefer a normal person.

986
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,666
You never treated me like a normal person.

987
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:39,666
Since I was little, you've treated me
like a handicapped person.

988
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,583
You had my brother
because I'm handicapped.

989
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,750
You let me run when I was little
because I'm handicapped.

990
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:50,500
You also accepted so many advertisements
because I'm handicapped.

991
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:58,375
Wa Wai, I know
that it's hard to be handicapped.

992
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:02,666
But being the mom
of a handicapped person is hard too.

993
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:05,291
Since the day you were born,

994
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,416
everyone blamed me.

995
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,125
When I sent you for training,

996
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:12,958
your dad asked me why I'm forcing you
to run in the Paralympics.

997
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:16,375
When you were little and couldn't walk,
I forced you to walk.

998
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,458
Everyone pointed their fingers at me
and scolded me,

999
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:21,791
"Your son is crying,
and you're still forcing him.

1000
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,416
Don't you have a heart?"

1001
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:25,750
Wa Wai,

1002
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:29,458
no one blames you for being handicapped.

1003
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,500
Everyone would only blame me.

1004
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:36,041
Wa Wai couldn't even walk
when he was little.

1005
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:40,666
Who would've thought
that he would be a world champion?

1006
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,541
If you're willing to believe,

1007
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,333
everything is possible.

1008
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:48,291
A slow starter can be a winner too.

1009
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,666
-I believe.
-I believe.

1010
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,875
Seon Bon Insurance.

1011
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,958
I bought some wine.

1012
01:24:55,666 --> 01:24:56,791
Coach Fong.

1013
01:24:57,291 --> 01:24:59,416
Bring it to Beijing and enjoy it slowly.

1014
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,625
You can just give it to me
at the airport tomorrow.

1015
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:04,166
I'm not going there tomorrow.

1016
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:05,791
What's the matter?

1017
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:09,458
Please take care of him for me.

1018
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,041
Wa Wai is all grown up.

1019
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,916
He doesn't need me to take care of him.

1020
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,125
Running on a track is simple.

1021
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:21,250
Forward is the only way to go,

1022
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:22,791
so you're never lost.

1023
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,125
But it's different in life.

1024
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,208
I think you're the one Wa Wai
needs the most now.

1025
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,208
Coach Fong.

1026
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:40,666
Do you believe that Wa Wai isn't ordinary?

1027
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:43,958
I believe in him.

1028
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:45,833
If he says he can,

1029
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,791
he can.

1030
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:52,041
Front-runner So Wa Wai
from Hong Kong had a disappointing race,

1031
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:55,250
coming in third with 12.38 seconds.

1032
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:03,708
The men's 400 m in T36 classification
is about to begin.

1033
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,708
All athletes have arrived
at the starting line.

1034
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:08,166
The crowd favorite, So Wa Wai,

1035
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,250
had a lackluster performance
in the 100 m race,

1036
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,375
only coming in third.

1037
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:16,250
Let's see if he can perform better today.

1038
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:44,083
The race begins,
everyone started very well.

1039
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:47,500
At lane four is
the assertive Zheng Hai Feng from China.

1040
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:51,875
He already overtook Ukraine's Viktor Buka
at the first 100 m bend.

1041
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:54,083
Russia is close behind him,

1042
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:57,208
while Hong Kong's So Wa Wai has been
lagging behind in the first 200 m.

1043
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:59,500
I wonder if he can catch up in the end.

1044
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,875
In the last 100 m,

1045
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:04,375
Zheng Hai Feng is winning by a mile.

1046
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:06,958
His time is 54.14 seconds.

1047
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:10,291
Ukraine takes the silver,
and Russia gets the bronze.

1048
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:22,541
So Wa Wai finished in sixth place.

1049
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:25,791
I believe that he's surprised
with his abysmal performance himself.

1050
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,250
As I told you,
the plastic bag doesn't work.

1051
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,916
Instead of crying hard, run hard.

1052
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:40,916
Don't worry,
it will be fine when I'm done.

1053
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:54,708
Don't be scared.

1054
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:56,500
You'll lose half the battle
if you're scared.

1055
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:59,666
I didn't just lose half the battle.

1056
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,125
I already lost two races.

1057
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:07,083
Exactly.

1058
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:08,833
What's left to fear then?

1059
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,083
-Mom.
-Yes?

1060
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:21,541
Do you know
why Ming runs faster than a train?

1061
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,583
It's because…

1062
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:31,500
He has a Wonder Mom.

1063
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,083
Save it.

1064
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,041
It's the Wonder Boy

1065
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,375
who made her the Wonder Mom.

1066
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,541
Wa Wai.

1067
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:57,375
You walk slower than others,

1068
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,583
but you run faster than them.

1069
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:03,583
Eyes on your mom.

1070
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:10,166
-Eyes on your mom.
-Eyes on your mom.

1071
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,125
-Eyes on your mom.
-Eyes on your mom.

1072
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,833
-Eyes on your mom!
-Eyes on your mom!

1073
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,458
-Eyes on your mom!
-Eyes on your mom!

1074
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:56,666
It's time, Wonder Boy.

1075
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,000
Time to shine.

1076
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,458
Wa Wai.

1077
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,791
Do you know when you look the coolest?

1078
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,791
When?

1079
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:55,583
-Wa Wai!
-Wa Wai!

1080
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:57,291
-Wa Wai!
-Wa Wai!

1081
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:20,208
SO WA WAI, LANE 7

1082
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:23,416
SO WA WAI, LANE 7

1083
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,625
When you start running,

1084
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:16,500
imagine me watching you
at the finish line.

1085
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,791
Walk!

1086
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:49,083
Wa Wai.

1087
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,208
You walk slower than others,

1088
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:54,166
but you run faster than them.

1089
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:57,791
I want to run faster.

1090
01:33:57,875 --> 01:33:59,583
I'll run with you from now on.

1091
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:05,250
Eyes on your mom.

1092
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,375
Faster!

1093
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,416
I know I can do it.

1094
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,708
Believe me, you'll like it.

1095
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:49,833
I'm going to get lots and lots
of gold medals for you.

1096
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:20,083
He's amazing!

1097
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:22,000
Wa Wai won, Grandpa. Cheers!

1098
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:30,541
Wa Wai!

1099
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:46,166
You won! Wa Wai, you're incredible!

1100
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:32,625
AT THE 2008 BEIJING PARALYMPICS
200 M T36 FINALS,

1101
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:36,500
SO WA WAI BROKE HIS OWN
WORLD RECORD AT 24.65 SECONDS.

1102
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:43,083
HE'S STILL THE CURRENT PARALYMPIC
RECORD HOLDER IN THIS CATEGORY.
