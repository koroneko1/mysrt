1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,399
I don't like you doing this here.

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,600
Where should we do it, then, Samu?

3
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,560
What if the cops catch us?

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,920
Why would the cops show up here?

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,320
We're three innocent schoolkids.

6
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,000
-Your mother's in jail because of this.
-Wrong.

7
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,799
She's in jail because some son of a bitch
sold us out.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,960
But this is different.
We're like family here.

9
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,879
Fine, but it stays here.

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,599
Not a word to anyone. OK? Anyone.

11
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,680
Relax, we know what we're doing.

12
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,000
Keep it up, Valerio.

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,479
I can't believe it!

14
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,719
Good. You finally learned how to cheat.

15
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,680
I don't cheat, sweetheart.

16
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,159
The thing is, I'm... one of a kind.

17
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,240
And I have great study buddies.

18
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,639
We go at it hard every afternoon...

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,199
and every night, too.

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
You're kidding, right?

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,759
No, I don't think so.

22
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,080
This is serious... very serious.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,159
B+

24
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,199
-No, it's his turn.
-Stop!

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,560
-Quiet. Which one was it?
-It tickles!

26
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,319
What? OK, potassium nitrate.

27
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,319
-What?
-Take something off.

28
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,960
What do you mean?
He got it right, didn't he?

29
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
-Yes, but he's wearing too much clothing.
-This girl learns fast.

30
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,159
-Not as fast as you.
-Oh, really? Not as fast as me?

31
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,680
Show some respect. I'm the teacher here.

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,639
I never thought
studying could be so much fun.

33
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,439
Do you realize you could even graduate
if you want to?

34
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
You could even go to university.

35
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,080
-For real.
-I don't know.

36
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,879
I never thought about my future.

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,680
In fact, it never occurred to me
I could have one.

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,319
Well, you could.

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,719
You're going to London, right?

40
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,840
King's College.

41
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
Why don't you join us?

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,120
No way! I don't have the grades

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,520
or the money to get
into a place like that.

44
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
Neither do I, but his mothers will...

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,600
-We got in with our connections.
-Yeah.

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
My mothers are friends with the dean.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
-Really?
-Yes.

48
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,480
I don't suppose they could...

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Well...

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,959
my mothers are vouching
for Cayetana because...

51
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,800
well, because she's my girlfriend.

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm not saying that we're not a couple...

53
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,079
but they know her better, longer.
They don't know who you are yet.

54
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,199
-So, I'm nobody, right?
-I didn't say that.

55
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,560
-No.
-You misunderstood.

56
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,160
-It's OK.
-I didn't mean that.

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,959
There's a word
for what you two have, but...

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,199
there's no word for this.

59
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't worry.
You've done enough for me.

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
Hey, it's fine.

61
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,160
Gin and tonic, please.

62
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,199
What's this blackout thing about?

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,519
A blackout, it's just that.

64
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,000
This Friday at midnight, 
it's lights out at the club.

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,079
That's it?

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,639
People dig the dark.

67
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,839
They can do what they want
without being seen.

68
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,639
You could fuck three guys 
right under Nadia's nose.

69
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,639
I'd be happy if you didn't say anything.
It's better for her.

70
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,160
It's better for her to live a lie?

71
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,959
If she finds out, she might break up
with me and forget all about New York.

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Why risk it?

73
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,680
That's what I'm thinking.
Why did you take that risk?

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
Why'd you kiss me?

75
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,519
Why do you think I did?

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,519
I'm with someone, too.
But my relationship is actually real.

77
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,480
Are you happy?

78
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,279
Yes.

79
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,839
Sure.

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,399
I see Nadia isn't the only one
living a lie.

81
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,360
It's on the house.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,639
Your hands are freezing.

83
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,439
It's OK. It's no big deal.

84
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,920
You didn't see your face.

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Ander...

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,279
Please don't say it's no big deal.

87
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,040
It is.

88
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Chemo's fucking me up...

89
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,839
and I'm scared.

90
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,399
And so are you.

91
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,879
Maybe we should stop acting
like it's no big deal.

92
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Lucrecia, do you have a minute?
It's about Columbia.

93
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,519
Take a seat.

94
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,800
I wanted to tell you that both of you got
the highest possible grade.

95
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,000
We have to ask you to make one last effort
so the jury can make a decision.

96
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,600
Next Wednesday,
you'll need to do an oral presentation

97
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
that goes into more detail
on the last topic you addressed.

98
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
So? Pretty, huh?

99
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,480
Hey! Wow!

100
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,279
It's the chemo.

101
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,360
I have cancer.

102
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,519
I'm sure you have lots of questions,
but that's what Wikipedia's for.

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,039
I get tired real quick.

104
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,440
I hated him.

105
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,720
I blamed him for my illness.

106
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,320
The champagne bottle broke.

107
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,559
The neck fell by the bathroom,
and I went to pick it up to throw it out.

108
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
Polo was there.

109
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,320
What are you talking about?

110
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,879
I couldn't hold back.

111
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,759
I stabbed him in the heart with the glass.

112
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,720
You're nuts. Why would you confess?

113
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,879
What's it matter?

114
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,759
I'm almost dead.

115
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,840
I won't let you destroy yourself
to protect someone.

116
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,759
How long has he been sick?

117
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,759
For months.

118
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,159
I found out recently, too.

119
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,759
What do the doctors say?

120
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,000
Not much.

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,039
His chemo's almost over,
and we'll see after that.

122
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,240
But he'll make it, right?

123
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Of course he will.

124
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,799
It's Ander.

125
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,720
He doesn't deserve this.

126
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,279
Not everyone gets what they deserve.

127
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,480
You knew, right?

128
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,279
Do you think I didn't want to tell you?

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,639
That I wanted to deal with this alone?

130
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,480
-So why didn't you?
-Ander asked me to keep it a secret.

131
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,159
And I thought, what was the point
of telling you?

132
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,279
You'd cure him?

133
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,720
Besides...

134
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,600
sometimes, the truth is...

135
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
useless.

136
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,200
Forgive me.

137
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,000
And thanks... for everything.

138
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,080
You're the best thing I've got, Samu.
And the only--

139
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,720
-Don't talk nonsense.
-No, I really mean it.

140
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
We've turned your house into a lab,
and you just grin and bear it.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,279
As soon as this batch is done,
I promise you it'll be over.

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,039
We'll close the business.

143
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,519
Then you and I will have
a very boring life.

144
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,159
I'd really like that.

145
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,240
We just found out.

146
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,679
What a bummer.

147
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,919
He's tired of hiding it.

148
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
It's taking longer than we expected.

149
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,279
And how are you doing? 

150
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,519
Never mind me. What matters now is him.

151
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,840
I try to get him to go out, have fun,
forget everything, but...

152
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,200
He's very lucky to have you by his side,
you know?

153
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,480
If you only knew.

154
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I know.

155
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,840
A word of advice.

156
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,159
If you want to keep your romance a secret,
you should be more discreet.

157
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,840
But relax, I won't say a word.

158
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,960
There's no secret romance, damn it. 
He's my sister's boyfriend.

159
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,080
Yeah... Heavy, huh?

160
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,919
Look, being cheated on
makes us... stronger.

161
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,879
See it that way.

162
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,320
I know because my boyfriend
cheated on me with your sister.

163
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,159
-When are you going to tell her?
-Never.

164
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,039
Nadia can't leave Malick.

165
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,039
-Why?
-She needs him to go to New York.

166
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,320
He'll be there next year too.

167
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,600
That's why my dad let her apply
for the grant.

168
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,279
If she found out he's using her
as a beard, she'd scrap the whole thing.

169
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
-The contract has arrived.
-Has it?

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
When will it be signed?

171
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,120
It's with the lawyers now.
It will take a few days.

172
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,519
The only thing is...

173
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,919
there's a clause
that allows Yeray to withdraw the funding

174
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:03,519
-at any time during the first five years.
-What?

175
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,879
He'll be pulling our strings 
the entire time.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,039
Five years?

177
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,159
-I'm going to tell that bastard off.
-No.

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,000
You won't say a word.

179
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,720
Now more than ever.

180
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,600
WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT, RIGHT?

181
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,279
Have fun.

182
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,080
Hi. I'm looking for--

183
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,840
this book.

184
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,960
Sorry, I've got it.

185
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Nadia... you know it's essential
for the presentation,

186
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,639
and it's not online.

187
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,600
Well, I've got it.

188
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,559
I need to ask you a question.

189
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,279
If you knew someone was being cheated on,
would you tell them?

190
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,639
I'm sorry.

191
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,679
I never apologized to you
for what happened.

192
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,600
Why now?

193
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Because... you never know
how much time we have left in this world.

194
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,519
And now that...

195
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,360
I'm starting something serious
with someone,

196
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,639
I understand you better than ever.

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,279
I always thought
you were cold and heartless...

198
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,799
until I helped break your heart
into a thousand pieces.

199
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm really sorry, Lu.

200
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,080
I'm done with the book.

201
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,399
-What's up?
-Nothing.

202
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,600
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

203
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,879
Or is someone else cheating?

204
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,360
No, no one.

205
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
Forget about it.

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
How are you?

207
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,600
Fine.

208
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,320
So...

209
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,960
are you training hard?
With the punching bag?

210
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,639
Do we have to speak in Morse code?

211
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,200
You've got to be kidding me.

212
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,399
You need to be careful here, honey.

213
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,519
You should've taken your own advice.

214
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,200
I don't trust a soul.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,600
What a sad life.
I don't want that for myself.

216
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,440
-Well, it's the one you're leading now.
-Yeah.

217
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,000
Until I get the money I need
to pay off the school.

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
Then, to hell with it.

219
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,799
You'll always need more.

220
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,279
Or do you think
once you've tasted seafood,

221
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
you can go back to eating canned sardines?

222
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,039
You should fucking know by now,

223
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,240
every shrimp I'll eat
will be paid for with my own work.

224
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,000
No hustling and no scumbags.

225
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,919
I'm done.

226
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,159
You can see the scumbags coming
a mile away.

227
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,639
It's the good guys,
the ones who look like angels...

228
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,279
Those are the ones
you have to look out for.

229
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,840
What the fuck's that mean?

230
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,879
What I mean...

231
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,600
is that our living room was bugged.

232
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
And all the “scumbags”
were taken down to the police station

233
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,879
or are sitting in jail.

234
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,159
All except one.

235
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,600
The little angel.

236
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,200
No... Samu would never do that to me.

237
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,080
-How do you know?
-Because he loves me.

238
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,440
Do you know what that means?

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
What if you could make sure?

240
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,919
Samu, I need to find out
who stabbed us in the back.

241
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,720
You can't imagine how badly I need that.

242
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,599
Didn't we want a boring life
with no trouble?

243
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,079
Are you with me or not?

244
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,000
The snitch must've been recorded
by the security cameras.

245
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,720
We had them everywhere,
but they were taken away.

246
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,319
The security company
might have a copy of everything.

247
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,039
But my mom doesn't know
which company we had.

248
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,039
The police seized everything.
Contracts, invoices...

249
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,720
Two months ago,
a camera broke, and I kept it.

250
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,599
It should have a sticker
with the company's details.

251
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,279
Why would they give you a copy?

252
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,519
Because everyone has a price.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
Look over there.

254
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,160
It's here.

255
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,279
Fuck, there's nothing on it.

256
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,200
You could try calling
all the security companies in the country

257
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,640
to see if you were clients.

258
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,480
But I think that's confidential.

259
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,519
I don't know. It's your call.

260
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,440
Wait a minute...

261
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,279
Maybe I don't have to.

262
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,200
Why are you here?

263
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,880
I came to...

264
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,559
see if I could do anything for you.

265
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,319
If you need money...

266
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,759
I could get the best doctors.

267
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,799
Which country do you think we live in?

268
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,319
I already have the best doctors...

269
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,200
and I don't need to be rich
or a charity case to get them.

270
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,160
Money's your answer to everything, huh?

271
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
I just want to help.

272
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
But I don't know how.

273
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,279
Do you have plans?
I'm bored out of my skull.

274
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,359
How much chemo's left?

275
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,759
I don't know.
The last session is next week.

276
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Then I'll get the results,
and they'll tell me if I'm done.

277
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,319
Right.

278
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,599
Are you really fucked up after?

279
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,160
Omar says I look like the girl
from The Exorcist.

280
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,119
How's it going with him?

281
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,119
This whole thing's a bummer.

282
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,599
Awful timing.

283
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,319
Well...

284
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,559
bad times are great for finding out
who'll stick with you.

285
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,799
Do you mean Cayetana?

286
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,960
And Valerio.

287
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,920
-You're cheating on her with Valerio?
-No! No cheating.

288
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,960
I swear.

289
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,480
But...

290
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,160
Well, the three of us are together.

291
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,079
Fuck.

292
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,200
You're getting laid more than anyone.

293
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,480
But it's not just about fucking.

294
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,480
There's something else.

295
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
I think it's going well.

296
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,400
I guess it's not very normal...

297
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,359
but... who cares about being normal...

298
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,000
if you can be happy.

299
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,599
Shit... You got all Zen,
and you're not even high.

300
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,480
Let me try that.

301
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,720
Just a little.

302
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,519
How does it work?

303
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,920
Badly. At first, it's always bad.

304
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,200
Holy fuck.

305
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:18,880
It's strong.

306
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,480
Do you like sushi?

307
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm not hungry.

308
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,759
No.

309
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,200
I was thinking
we could go on vacation to Japan.

310
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,680
A lot could happen between now and then.

311
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,759
Are you upset because of that kid
in your class?

312
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,759
I see.

313
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,599
I bought you something.

314
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,960
Stay the night.

315
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,119
Tonight and as many nights as you want.

316
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,920
Look at his eyes...

317
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,440
I love you guys a lot.

318
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,319
Seriously, I love you so much.

319
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,000
So, let's see...

320
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,880
You told Ander that we're together,
the three of us?

321
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,359
Correct.

322
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,960
Right... And if he tells someone,
what do we do?

323
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,039
It's no big deal.
We've all been called worse.

324
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,480
It felt good, saying it out loud.

325
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,200
That we're together.

326
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,920
Why should we stop...

327
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,599
when we're just getting started?

328
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,640
Why don't you come to London?

329
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,759
Huh, Curly Locks?

330
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,359
My mothers will be asking
a couple of favors already.

331
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,759
But they can ask for three.

332
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,680
One, two...

333
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,359
and three.

334
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,960
How will you convince them?

335
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,359
I don't know.

336
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,440
Right.

337
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,960
I know a girl who's very good
at making up crazy stories.

338
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,519
To be honest, it's kind of my superpower.

339
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Is it?

340
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,240
What if you show me more
of that superpower?

341
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,200
Like this?

342
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,440
I just can't resist...

343
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's all go into the pool!

344
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,599
What is he doing?

345
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,559
-Come on, guys!
-OK!

346
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,000
-In the pool!
-Let's go!

347
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:42,319
Should we do it in the water? Huh?

348
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,200
-Let's go!
-Wow!

349
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,200
Stop!

350
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,640
Stop!

351
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,240
Stop!

352
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,920
Look, a full moon!

353
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,319
What's all this?

354
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,279
Can I ask what you're doing?

355
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,759
Hi, Moms!

356
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,519
What's up? Back already?

357
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,839
What's wrong?

358
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,240
How are you?

359
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,759
-I think we know each other.
-Too well.

360
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,200
I've seen far too much of you.

361
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,440
This isn't what it looks like.

362
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,759
We were studying outside, and...

363
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,079
we just felt like--

364
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,079
-Shut up!
-OK, I'm leaving.

365
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,920
It's not that big of a deal.

366
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,880
Having an orgy at home?

367
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,599
Well... just three of us.

368
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,119
-That's not... an orgy, technically.
-Mom.

369
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,720
It's not just sex.

370
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,039
What?

371
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,240
We're dating. The three of us.

372
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,400
How can you be with two people
at the same time?

373
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,079
-Why not?
-What do you mean why not?

374
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,279
Have you ever seen that?

375
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,839
Do you think it's normal?

376
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,599
Didn't your parents say that
when you said you liked girls?

377
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,720
That's enough, Polo!
It's always a struggle with you.

378
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,559
Don't we have enough problems already? 
And now this?

379
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:55,599
Hey.

380
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,599
Hi.

381
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,319
It suits you.

382
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,279
Listen, if you need anything,
anything at all...

383
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,680
I won't shave my hair off
for moral support, but anything else...

384
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,519
Thanks.

385
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,559
I'm fed up with all the sad looks.
I don't know what's worse, chemo or pity.

386
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,160
Pity, for sure.

387
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,400
But it's not all bad.

388
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
Cancer has an upside too.

389
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,880
Really? Like what?

390
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,400
Well... I don't know.
I used to feel overwhelmed with life.

391
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,480
My future, my parents on top of me...

392
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,240
We think so much about the future,
we forget about the present.

393
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,440
I only do what I want now...
and I like it.

394
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,640
Sorry.

395
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,200
Another side effect 
is that I talk like a Buddhist master.

396
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,160
As if I had an MA in philosophy
and not a tumor.

397
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,039
I don't know about a master's,
but you're right.

398
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,200
SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.
CAN WE MEET?

399
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,240
Good morning.

400
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,400
Hey.

401
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,279
Are you OK?

402
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,839
Yeah, sure.

403
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,000
Just a bit nervous about the exams.

404
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,880
Do you maybe want...

405
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,000
to study with me tonight?

406
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm going to the club.

407
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,640
-Who with?
-Friends...

408
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,319
from class.

409
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,319
How's it going?

410
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,799
Fine.

411
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,839
Yeah?

412
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,279
Later.

413
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,039
See?

414
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,680
Told you, kiddo. Everyone has a price.
Some are cheaper than others.

415
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,160
I'll get the hard drive tonight.

416
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,599
You don't even know the guy.

417
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,359
That's why I'm meeting him at the club.

418
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,599
The blackout party.

419
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,799
You can do anything in the dark.

420
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,960
Anything?

421
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,039
-Except crochet.
-I'm going with you, just in case.

422
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,319
OK, Dad.

423
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Rebe, what would you do if you knew 
Samu was cheating on you?

424
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,480
-What?
-Where'd that come from?

425
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,440
I don't know. Intuition.

426
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,799
The only way to be sure
is to catch him red-handed.

427
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:01,960
You're nuts.

428
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,960
What's wrong?

429
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Is it because of last night?

430
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,480
No.

431
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well... maybe they're right.

432
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,119
I've been a problem my whole life.

433
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,839
That's my superpower.

434
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,559
We'll see...

435
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,960
Polo's mothers might be lesbians,
but they're older.

436
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,640
OK?

437
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,240
They don't get it.

438
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,319
I don't get it either, to be honest.

439
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
I'm not going to pretend
I'm modern, but...

440
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:46,359
girls don't dream of having
a white wedding with two grooms, you know?

441
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,440
It's not what we were taught.

442
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,119
I used to think...

443
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,480
that people were like halves
trying to make a whole.

444
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,440
Or like nuts and bolts.

445
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,960
All you had to do was find
the one that...

446
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,079
fit you perfectly.

447
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,880
But Polo and I didn't fit together before.

448
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,720
Then you showed up...

449
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,920
and now we fit together.

450
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,279
You're the piece that we were missing.

451
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,200
And, hell...

452
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,599
when you find love,
it sucks to have to let it go.

453
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,359
Guzmán, are you coming?

454
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,279
Omar wants me to go
so that I'm not alone all day.

455
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,839
What about your friend Polo?

456
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,079
I saw you last night.
You were having a blast.

457
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
Is that it?

458
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,039
We forget and just carry on
like nothing ever happened?

459
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,200
Maybe that's the problem.
I forgave you too soon.

460
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,279
The champagne bottle broke.

461
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,599
The neck fell by the bathroom,
and I went to pick it up.

462
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,240
And then?

463
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:19,880
Someone beat me to it.

464
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,400
Who?

465
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,160
Guzmán.

466
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
He picked it up
and went into the bathroom.

467
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,920
Did you see him yourself?

468
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,640
Guzmán?

469
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,720
Is that Yeray?

470
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,359
Yes.

471
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,559
Aren't you answering?

472
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,680
No. I'm breaking up with him after dinner.

473
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,799
What happened?

474
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,279
-Carla...
-What happened?

475
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
You want to know?

476
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,519
What we've been hiding from you for weeks?

477
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,559
Dad's practically been pimping me out
so that Yeray saves the winery.

478
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,480
It's the only reason I'm with him.
I don't love him and I never fucking will!

479
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,880
You knew?

480
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,319
You agreed to it?

481
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,880
Don't make the same mistake I made.

482
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,240
I also met a Yeray...

483
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,920
but I chose someone I loved.

484
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,559
And look at us now.

485
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,640
People outside our social status...

486
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,920
think we've made no sacrifices
to get here.

487
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
But they don't know

488
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,680
we're capable of doing whatever it takes
to avoid losing it.

489
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,599
Whatever it takes.

490
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,160
Learning to love that boy 

491
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,519
is easier than learning to live
with nothing.

492
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,559
Think about your future, honey.

493
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,960
About our future.

494
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,320
You're crazy, Valerio!

495
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
We can't deal at the club!

496
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,320
Remember when my mom
sold on someone else's turf?

497
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,840
We're not making enough at school.

498
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,760
Enough for what?

499
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,760
Life doesn't end when we graduate.
That's when it starts.

500
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,559
What the hell do you need that money for?

501
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,880
I need thousands of euros
within a month,

502
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,760
before the enrollment deadline
for good universities is up.

503
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,920
You too, right?

504
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,559
Or will you go back to public education?

505
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,800
What's up? We going?

506
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,119
Of course!

507
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,000
You see him?

508
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,000
No.

509
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,440
But there's still time until the blackout.

510
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,760
Why don't I talk to him?
I don't trust him.

511
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,960
Relax, Mike Tyson.
I'm the one who taught you how to box.

512
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,960
Be right back.

513
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,519
Your water, sir.

514
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,079
Easy. It's strong.

515
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:01,960
Why the fuck am I here?

516
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,400
You're having fun like everyone else.

517
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,199
Come on, loosen up.

518
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,159
Guzmán.

519
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,920
Are you not coming to the hospital
on Monday?

520
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
You have another pal to go with you.

521
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,440
Resentment is a luxury I can't afford.

522
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,280
Because I don't know
how much longer I have.

523
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,920
If it's only months,
you'd rather not see me again?

524
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,000
If you'd known how long Marina had left,
wouldn't you have forgotten

525
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,760
everything that annoyed you about her
to be by her side?

526
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
They say the key to success 
is turning your hobby into a job,

527
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,599
so, congrats.

528
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,320
It's a job... and also a secret.

529
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,880
Can you keep it?

530
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,199
I can make it worth the effort.

531
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,920
Wrong person. That's not my thing.

532
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,760
And what is your thing?

533
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,440
What do you need?

534
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,559
I just need to fall in love.

535
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,320
Boom! I have just the thing for that.

536
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,000
This is... happiness...

537
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,920
and love.

538
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,480
How are you?

539
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,679
It's fine, go home. Don't stay for me.

540
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,599
Will you be up when I get home?

541
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,639
I can't dance, let alone fuck.

542
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,199
That's not what I meant, but it's OK.

543
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,079
It's not OK.

544
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,159
We should admit that, too.

545
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
Listen...

546
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,519
I don't care if you see other people.

547
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,159
Why are you saying that?

548
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,400
It's not normal...

549
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,440
but I want you to be happy.

550
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,440
You're bitter because of me.

551
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,400
You think I like that?

552
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,320
No... I don't understand, Ander.

553
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,480
It's fine, forget it.

554
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,320
Watch this for me.
I'm going to the bathroom.

555
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Omar, throw this in the trash
without being seen.

556
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,440
-What?
-Trust me.

557
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,639
Go, damn it!

558
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
OK.

559
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,000
What's up?

560
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,239
I just...

561
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,760
I just remembered
that I lost your toothbrush.

562
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,280
Can you buy me a new one?

563
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,559
Of course.

564
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,800
No... Buy me thousands...

565
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,880
Millions of toothbrushes!

566
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,920
Sorry. The bathroom was as crowded
as the Tokyo metro.

567
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,760
-Another drink?
-Yes.

568
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,159
Shit.

569
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,320
-What's wrong?
-Where's my bag?

570
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,400
Shit!

571
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,679
Fucking hell!

572
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,039
I'm sorry, Rebe.

573
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,039
The one fucking favor I ask you!

574
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,519
Take this.

575
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,679
Do you want me?

576
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,119
What?

577
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,039
Do you want to fuck?

578
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,960
What about Ander?

579
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,880
Ander's not here.

580
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,159
Right on time.

581
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,639
Nadia!

582
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,719
Hi! Over here!

583
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,039
What're you doing here?

584
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,400
Great hair!

585
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,000
Shouldn't you be preparing
a presentation?

586
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,599
I should be, but I couldn't concentrate.

587
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,960
What about you?

588
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:46,960
Want a sip?

589
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,079
No.

590
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,119
Me? Same as always,
I just needed... to relax.

591
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,199
-You do seem a little tense.
-No!

592
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,920
Have you seen Malick?

593
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,519
Yes! He's downstairs...

594
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,719
dancing with the plebes.

595
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,320
-Thanks.
-Yup.

596
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:20,679
So nice to see you!
I thought you'd miss the blackout!

597
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,119
-How come you look so happy?
-Well... 

598
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,519
I'm about to have enough cash
to apply to a university in London!

599
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,000
What?

600
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,639
It's amazing what my family will do
to keep me as far away as possible.

601
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:36,679
You're coming with us? Yeah!

602
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,039
-Really? Awesome!
-That's great!

603
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,199
I couldn't let you get away.

604
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,400
Where were you?

605
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,800
I was looking for you!

606
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,400
Here.

607
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,400
Weren't you staying in?

608
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:10,119
Malick, is there anything I should know?

609
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,079
Is there another girl?

610
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,679
No! What're you talking about?

611
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,920
So we're good?

612
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,400
Of course.

613
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,519
I was going to tell you tomorrow,
my parents are coming.

614
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,280
They want to meet you.

615
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:29,199
-Why don't we go home now?
-No, wait.

616
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,519
It's time for the blackout.

617
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,440
So what?

618
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,760
...nine, eight, seven...

619
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,119
Samu, do you love me?

620
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,280
What?

621
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,480
...four, three, two...

622
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:43,119
Do you love me?

623
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,239
Of course I do.

624
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,360
I love you!

625
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,039
I love you too!

626
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,679
I had to make sure.

627
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,440
What's this?

628
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
It's called fluorescent paint.

629
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,360
My bag was soaked in it.

630
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,079
What's that?

631
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:56,599
Nadia!

632
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,920
The security cameras didn't work.

633
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,559
That kid wasn't a security guard,
and the hard drive was empty.

634
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,280
-Rebeka, listen to me, please.
-No, you listen to me!

635
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,840
Tell me one thing...

636
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,800
-Did you get close to me just for that?
-No.

637
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,639
Was it all a lie?

638
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,400
Hey.

639
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm sorry.

640
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,639
You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

641
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,199
Because I didn't want to give you
an excuse to leave the competition,

642
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,199
just when I'm about to win.

643
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,280
Do you think I'll go with him
to New York?

644
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,719
Listen... with a bit of luck...

645
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,360
you'll have guys coming
in and out of your life.

646
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,559
But an opportunity like this
only comes along once.

647
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,960
Plus, he used you.

648
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,639
Basically, you should use him too.

649
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,599
What he did hurts a lot.

650
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:40,840
Yeah, I know.

651
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,599
You had this idea of building
something amazing with him

652
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:48,039
and living happily ever after, but no.

653
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:54,239
And we both know he's not the boy
you're really in love with.

654
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,360
Nadia.

655
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,840
Speak of the devil...

656
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,599
I'll meet your parents...

657
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,480
but I can't promise
I'll be as good at lying...

658
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,960
cheating, and pretending
that I have feelings for someone.

659
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,840
This is taking too long.

660
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,280
What'd you say?

661
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:00,559
You did the right thing.

662
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,679
Hey...

663
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,920
You did what you had to do.

664
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,320
