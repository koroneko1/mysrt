1
00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:03,171
Griffin:
My dad bought an old hotel.

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,632
Now I'm stuck here
while my parents fix up
The Tremont.

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,384
(loudly):
You live at The Tremont?

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:09,636
Zoey:
Who's Savannah?

5
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,346
The ghost of a kid

6
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,306
who's supposedly been
haunting the hotel

7
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,808
for 30 years.

8
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,977
I said supposedly.

9
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,356
We saw a ghost
in The Tremont
last night.

10
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,858
‐(ghost screams)
‐(Topher screams)

11
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,360
I saw a ghost.

12
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,362
Tremont has a bunker?

13
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,571
Griffin:
Let's check it out.

14
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,116
Griffin, look.

15
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:34,035
Griffin: It's like
we stepped back in time.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,370
Harper:
She's alive, Griffin.

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,122
Time travel
is the only explanation.

18
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:39,457
Savannah?

19
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,919
Harper:
The Tremont
is completely safe.

20
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:44,087
Jess:
The Tremont is cursed!

21
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,216
Griffin:
Maybe we're messing
with things

22
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,843
that shouldn't be
messed with.

23
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:51,553
(gasps)

24
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:55,640
Harper: Savannah!
You said you were never
coming through the portal.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,309
I know.
Then I found this.

26
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,311
Looks like you're not done
time traveling either.

27
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,688
Griffin: Finally,
an adventure that
doesn't involve saving you.

28
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,189
So a ghost
that's not me.

29
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,441
It could be anyone.

30
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,109
Griffin:
There's only one way
to find out.

31
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,278
Harper:
Let's go.

32
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:09,779
Griffin:
As long as we're home
before dinner.

33
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:14,909
(intense music playing)

34
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:24,794
(woman humming "Amazing Grace")

35
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:44,022
(humming continues)

36
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:09,506
(humming continues)

37
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:16,471
(rocking chair creaking)

38
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,453
(humming stops)

39
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,705
(creaking stops)

40
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:50,964
(gasps)

41
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,299
Ben! You scared me.

42
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,844
Sorry. Uh, I was
looking for Griffin.
He in there?

43
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,722
No one is.

44
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:05,979
man:
Daisy, is that you?

45
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,272
‐He's coming.
‐Go!

46
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,398
Who‐‐

47
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,525
Woah.

48
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,239
What was that about?

49
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,742
It was all so strange...

50
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,702
like looking in a mirror.

51
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,745
How do you mean?

52
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,538
Didn't you see that girl?

53
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,500
We're nearly identical.
She could've been me.

54
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,836
How's that possible?

55
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,008
Sam, come back!

56
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,093
Where is he off to now?

57
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,970
Sam went tearing through
the field after some‐‐

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,055
Probably realized
his chores
are still waiting.

59
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,599
Pay him no mind.

60
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,186
That boy's head
is always somewhere else.

61
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:51,900
Let me give you a hand.

62
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,410
(tense music playing)

63
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:48,039
(theme music playing)

64
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,021
That man was
in the same chair

65
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,773
I saw rocking
by itself earlier.

66
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,233
That can't be
a coincidence.

67
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,985
Do you think we saw
a ghost back there?

68
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:19,612
I'm saying
he must be the ghost
haunting the hotel now,

69
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,489
the one who led us
into the past.

70
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,657
But why?

71
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,367
And what about the girl
on the porch?

72
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,202
She has to be
one of my relatives.

73
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,167
My family used to own
The Tremont,

74
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,460
back before it was
a hotel.

75
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,129
That explains
the resemblance.

76
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,547
But the man
in the rocking chair

77
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,299
was calling out
for somebody
named Daisy.

78
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:42,176
‐So that would make her your...
‐Harper: I'm not sure.

79
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,596
After my dad died,
my mom didn't talk
about it much.

80
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:47,181
All I really know
is that they met
on her last day of camp.

81
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,809
‐Oh, no!
‐What's wrong?

82
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,811
I have to get home.
The camp is opening today

83
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:53,897
and I'm supposed
to be helping everyone
get settled

84
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,356
into the bunkhouses.

85
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,358
Kind of wild you're gonna be
a camper there again.

86
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,943
Junior Counselor, actually.

87
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,029
This time I'll be the one
creeping kids out

88
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,697
with the legend of Moss Man.

89
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,699
And busting them
for pulling pranks.

90
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,075
I wouldn't go that far.

91
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,869
I mean, I am still me.

92
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,163
(lights crackling)

93
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,958
Well, guess this
is goodbye again.

94
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:17,879
Doesn't have to be.

95
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,423
There could be a clue
in 1962

96
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,799
about the man
in the rocking chair,

97
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,676
who he is and why he's
haunting the hotel.

98
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,638
If you come up with something,
send us a message.

99
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,515
Tree house again?
Like we did
with the coffee can?

100
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,059
We shouldn't chance it.

101
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,019
There's too many people
that know about that place.

102
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,020
What about the basement?

103
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,147
Under a floorboard or something?

104
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,733
Bottom of the stairs?

105
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,443
That works.

106
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,945
Sure you won't get in trouble
for snooping?

107
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,613
We don't wanna mess things up
for you back home.

108
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,949
Can't get in trouble
if you don't get caught.

109
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,870
I should get back too.

110
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,955
The twins probably think
a ghost grabbed me.

111
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,624
A ghost who wants
to melt off our faces?

112
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,212
‐I was kidding about that.
‐Uh‐huh. Sure you were.

113
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,256
(radio whirring)

114
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,893
Maybe it only
feels comfortable
rocking in front of kids.

115
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,187
It's a chair, Wyatt.
It doesn't have feelings.

116
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,522
He means the ghost.

117
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,524
And this one
definitely has feelings.

118
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,150
Big feelings.

119
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,443
Frustration mostly

120
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,029
because we can't figure out
what it's trying to tell us.

121
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,656
Tell me again
what you think you saw.

122
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,783
The chair started
to move...

123
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,119
Back and forth.
Real slow.

124
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,286
Wait. I thought
you two are done

125
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,455
with all this
supernatural stuff.

126
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,457
So did we!
But the ghost keeps
reaching out

127
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,625
to draw us back in.

128
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,544
It would be rude
not to listen.

129
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,795
Here's an idea.

130
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,757
Why don't you try
listening to your parents
for a change?

131
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,760
We mean it when we say
this place isn't haunted
by Savannah.

132
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,303
We know.
The mirror told us.

133
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,222
The mirror?

134
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,974
Wyatt: That's how
the ghost communicates.

135
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,517
Leaves messages
on the glass.

136
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,395
It wrote, "No,"
when we asked
if it was Savannah.

137
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,148
It was probably just Griffin
messing with you guys.

138
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,150
What about me?

139
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,360
Have you been pranking
Wyatt and Zoey again?

140
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,320
The mirror fogged up
and the message appeared.

141
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,156
No way Griffin could
pull that off.

142
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:09,407
Just get rid of it, Ben.

143
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,367
‐You can't!
‐We'll never know
what the ghost wants.

144
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,453
I think we'll all sleep better
with the mirror gone.

145
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:15,288
Besides,
all of this ghost hunting

146
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,998
has become
a huge distraction.

147
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,499
Your mom is right.

148
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,001
It's going to take
everyone pitching in

149
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,836
to get the hotel
finally reopened.

150
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,088
You two can start
by giving me a hand
downstairs.

151
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,090
‐But I‐‐
‐Sarah: That wasn't a request.

152
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,930
Maybe we shouldn't toss it.

153
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,808
Don't tell me you believe
all that ghost talk.

154
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,853
This old mirror might be
worth something.

155
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,272
Could put the money
toward the renovation.

156
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,857
Yeah,
every little bit helps.

157
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,778
But we can't leave it up here.
Too tempting for the twins.

158
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,154
Take it to the basement?

159
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,698
They're way too scared
to go down there.

160
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,539
Argh.
The screws are stripped.

161
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,710
We're gonna need
some serious tools.
Pliers, a drill.

162
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:04,504
I ever tell you
about the time

163
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,130
Grandpa tried
to teach me
how to use one?

164
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,465
Nope.

165
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,966
Went about as well
as you'd expect.

166
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,725
(ominous music)

167
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,070
Jess:
Is your brother
still on the couch?

168
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,448
Said something
about slime creatures

169
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,492
and an epic battle
for humanity.

170
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,327
Well, humanity
will have to wait.

171
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,204
It's his turn
to help fold.

172
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,665
‐I'll do it.
‐Help yourself.

173
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,585
So, was Dad into
all that stuff too?

174
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,963
You know,
monsters and ghosts.

175
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,714
Your dad? Please.

176
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,925
Couldn't pay him
to sit through a scary movie,

177
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,427
at least not without
squeezing the life
out of my hand.

178
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,012
Not sure where
Topher got it from.

179
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,431
Am I anything like Dad?

180
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,310
I'd say you're a good mix
of the both of us.

181
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,729
He had that same
quiet confidence,

182
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,108
but your stubborn streak?
Whew, that's all me.

183
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,778
I was named
after his mom, right?

184
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,405
Yup. Your Grandma Marie.

185
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:15,449
Wish you could've met her.

186
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,118
She had a big heart
just like your dad.

187
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,287
And her parents?
What were they like?

188
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,664
Why all the questions?

189
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,293
There's just a lot
I don't know
about our family.

190
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:26,878
Guess I never will.

191
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,882
You know, the thing
about Grandma Marie,

192
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:32,466
she saved everything.

193
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,635
Yeah, it took your dad
close to the three months

194
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,053
to clean out her house
after she passed.

195
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,601
This belonged to her.

196
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:45,062
‐No telling what's inside.
‐You've never opened it?

197
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,773
I think your dad
was saving it for you kids.

198
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,484
Guess now's
as good a time as any.

199
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:52,904
(phone chimes)

200
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,116
Ugh, sorry, baby,

201
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,452
Kirstin's not feeling well
and she needs me to close.

202
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:00,786
It's okay. You should go.

203
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,997
You know, I'm gonna take
your brother with me.

204
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,917
He can mop up the cafe
since he couldn't be
bothered to help fold.

205
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,501
‐Need anything?
‐I'll be fine.

206
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,170
You always are.

207
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,131
‐Strongest girl I know.
‐Learned from the best.

208
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:16,552
Okay.

209
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,160
Bunkhouses are
straight down this path

210
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,037
and the springs
are back there.

211
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,413
Can we swim any time?

212
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,041
No campers out here at night
without a counselor.

213
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,210
Well, I'm not afraid
of the dark.

214
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,920
Well, it's easy
to get turned around

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,129
when you don't know
these woods...

216
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,924
or what's in them.

217
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:57,718
In them?

218
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,514
Legend has it,
something lives out here.

219
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:03,975
Waiting...

220
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,852
‐watching.
‐(leaves rustling)

221
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:09,355
What was that?

222
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:12,900
Probably just the wind.

223
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,444
Stay here,
I'll go check it out.

224
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,242
(campers chattering)

225
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,105
(suspenseful music playing)

226
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,996
Up a little.

227
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,206
Down.

228
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,624
Lower.

229
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,709
That's too low.

230
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,795
You want it perfect,
right?

231
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,589
I'd settle for done.

232
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:20,134
Yup, uh,
that's gonna be
a problem

233
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,636
'cause these are
the last two rolls.

234
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,846
You checked the closet?

235
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,890
Yep. And we are
all out of paste.

236
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,100
‐Shocking.
‐I'll run to the store.

237
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,353
Oh, let me.
Could use a break.

238
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:31,771
When do we get a break?

239
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,606
You haven't exactly
been helping.

240
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,940
Uh, yes, I have!

241
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,150
All you've done
is stand there.

242
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,651
It's called supervising.

243
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,986
That's one word for it.

244
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,155
Have fun!

245
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,115
Well, I think
we've all earned a break.

246
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,534
‐Ice cream at Dunn's?
‐Dibs on the front!

247
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,952
Zoey:
You had it last time!

248
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,829
‐Wyatt: Called it first!
‐You comin', bud?

249
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,665
Um, I have a lot of homework
to finish.

250
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,000
Bring me back a shake?

251
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,252
Chocolate with
extra whipped cream?

252
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,837
It's a good guess.

253
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,297
That's what you order
every time.

254
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,132
Not exactly
a man of mystery, Griff.

255
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,641
(suspenseful music playing)

256
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,998
Hello?

257
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,252
Can you hear me?

258
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,390
(phone ringing)

259
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:56,564
Daisy's my great‐grandmother.

260
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,731
And the man
in the rocking chair,

261
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,608
that was her father,
Elijah Tremont.

262
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,735
So that's where
the hotel got its name.

263
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,613
Did your mom tell you
all this?

264
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,781
I found pictures...

265
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,326
in an old trunk
my dad kept in the garage.

266
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,828
You'll never believe
what else is inside.

267
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,371
Look.

268
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,832
A... bracelet?

269
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,125
My bracelet!

270
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,170
I was wearing it
when we went to 1930
this afternoon.

271
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,172
It must've fallen off.

272
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:23,883
Someone in my family found it
and kept it all this time.

273
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,050
Harper...

274
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,135
It's incredible to think

275
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,678
something of mine
was passed down

276
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,014
for generations
before I was even born.

277
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:32,224
Harper, how soon
can you get here?

278
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,100
Why?

279
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:34,768
Look.

280
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,113
Hey, Jess.

281
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,575
Hey! I was wondering
if I'd get a chance
to see you guys

282
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,452
before the big move
back to Chicago.

283
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,453
Change of plans.

284
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,079
We're staying
in Sulphur Springs!

285
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,123
‐You are?
‐We can't leave yet.

286
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,958
Things are
just getting good.

287
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:01,587
Well, I know two kids
who will be very excited
to hear that.

288
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,214
Topher's out back
bussing tables

289
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,548
if you wanna
tell him the news.

290
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,759
Wyatt:
Wait till we tell him
about the mirror.

291
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,387
Figured you'd finally
had enough of living
in a haunted hotel.

292
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,306
Ah, the only thing scary
about The Tremont

293
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,849
is how much work
it needs.

294
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,143
Once we fix one problem,
we find another.

295
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,479
Well, some might say
there's a reason for that.

296
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,814
Now you sound like
the twins.

297
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,650
People have been
telling stories

298
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,152
about seeing ghosts
around that place
for generations.

299
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,196
That's all they are.
Stories.

300
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,156
Urban legends
like Moss Man.

301
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,324
What if they're not?

302
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,831
I heard humming
coming from Griffin's room
earlier.

303
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,084
At least, I think I did.

304
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,962
Probably just left
some music playing.

305
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,089
No, it wasn't the radio.

306
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:49,134
It sounded like
"Amazing Grace."

307
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,803
A woman.

308
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,888
When I got to the door...

309
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,016
she stopped.

310
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,980
Nope. Uh‐uh. I would be looking
for a new place pronto.

311
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,357
We can't afford
somethin' else.

312
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,317
Opening the hotel
is our only option.

313
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,584
‐You ready?
‐Huh?

314
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,254
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,841
Where'd you get
this stuff from, anyway?

316
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,509
In that trunk
with the photos.

317
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,678
My grandmother really did
save everything.

318
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,888
This was
her wedding dress.

319
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,392
Relax,
no one's getting married.

320
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,185
The goal
is to blend in, right?

321
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,605
This was
the best I could do
on short notice.

322
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:45,065
Right.
So what's the plan?

323
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,444
Well, Elijah's ghost wants us
to go back to my family's farm.

324
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,029
We need to find out why.

325
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,073
All right. All set.

326
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,201
Here you go.

327
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,706
(radio whirring)

328
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,669
(woman humming)

329
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,712
Do you hear that?

330
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,593
It's coming from
over there.

331
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,680
(woman humming "Amazing Grace")

332
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,730
Maybe she's the reason
we had to come back.

333
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,112
Or whatever
she's looking for.

334
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,074
(continues humming)

335
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,878
Flashlights have been
passed out,

336
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,797
clues for the scavenger hunt
have been hidden,

337
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,299
and the birdhouses
are ready to be assembled.

338
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,843
I wish all the councilors
were as responsible as you.

339
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:56,595
Kids?

340
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,723
Take it outside
before something gets‐‐

341
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,353
Broken.

342
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,854
Sorry.
We‐‐ We'll clean it up.

343
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,982
It's almost time
for lights out.

344
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,276
Head back to the bunkhouses.
I'll take care of this.

345
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:14,238
I need to sweep up this glass
before someone gets hurt.

346
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,989
I'll get the broom.

347
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,783
Thanks, honey.
There's one in the basement.

348
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:43,976
(door opens)

349
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,761
(footsteps receding)

350
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,181
(door closes)

351
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,358
â™ª

352
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,240
Moss Man!

353
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,040
Griff, we're back.

354
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,585
Ugh, look at that!
All that work.

355
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,671
Urban legend, huh?

356
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,881
Oh, man!

357
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,050
It's starting.
Just like Topher said.

358
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,511
‐The ghost?
‐Has to be.

359
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,846
You used like
a gallon of paste
on that paper.

360
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,473
There's
no other explanation.

361
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,227
Mom and Dad are
really gonna regret
moving that mirror.

362
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,055
Daisy: They were
in the house, Papa.

363
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,808
It's not the first time
we've found people
wandering around.

364
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,601
This wasn't like before.

365
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,229
These...
These people were different.

366
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,315
Only one reason
somebody be looking around here.

367
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,485
The Springs.

368
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,321
Elijah:
Probably had the same notion
your mother did.

369
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,574
But we know
there's nothing special
about that water.

370
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,375
I'm gonna turn in.

371
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,879
Sam, make sure to help
your sister with the dishes.

372
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,088
Sam: Yes, sir.

373
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,140
You're right.

374
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,727
Those people aren't
like the others.

375
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,438
And I know why.

376
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,733
They're from outer space.

377
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:40,068
‐Finish your supper, Sam.
‐I've got proof.

378
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,657
‐Found this in the field.
‐My bracelet.

379
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,951
See? A star.

380
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,080
People don't just disappear
into thin air, Daisy.

381
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:54,458
Except somehow they did.

382
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,670
(floorboard creaking)

383
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:03,926
Harper, wait.

384
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,345
There she is.

385
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,353
(tense music playing)

386
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,317
(wailing)

387
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,237
Come on.

388
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,492
You saw, right?

389
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,243
The woman in the springs,
she just‐‐

390
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,662
Vanished.

391
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,580
And if she's a ghost...

392
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,748
We had it all wrong.

393
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:36,750
It was never Elijah
leading us back here.

394
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,794
It was her.

395
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,090
Who is she
and why did she
scream like that?

396
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,216
I don't know.

397
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,845
Griffin, wait! Look.

398
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,021
There's our answer.

399
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,065
Grace.

400
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,069
Daisy's mother,
my great‐great grandmother.

401
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,364
The ghost
of The Tremont.

402
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,624
Griffin:
Next time on "Secrets
of Sulphur Springs"...

403
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,709
Wyatt:
This is not normal.

404
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,585
‐How else do we explain it?
‐Zoey: Ghosts.

405
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,130
It feels like
there is something
in this place

406
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,589
and it wants us out.

407
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,425
Savannah:
Something was following me,
back in the woods,

408
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,301
a creature
all covered in moss.

409
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,595
And remember the plan,
as soon as Daisy's not around,

410
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,431
I step in,
pretend I'm her.

411
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,099
‐Daisy!
‐What is all this?

412
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,684
Trying to build
a time machine?

413
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,436
Do you believe
in time travel, Harry?

414
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,437
She found it!

415
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:39,938
Daisy found the portal.

416
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,107
‐Harper: Daisy!
‐Harper?
