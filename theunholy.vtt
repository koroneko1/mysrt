WEBVTT

01:01.713 --> 01:02.975
No.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.183
In the name of Christ,
our Lord,

01:36.357 --> 01:38.098
and Mary, queen of heaven,

01:38.272 --> 01:40.012
trap this corrupt soul.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.623
Contain her!

02:09.303 --> 02:10.869
GERRY:
Yeah, Max.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.697
: Gerry.I'll get you tomorrow.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.873
Party hard last night?What do you want?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.962
Cattle mutilations.
Small town, couple hours out.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.312
Pays 150.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.664
Cattle mutilations?
Well, that, for sure, that's--

02:22.838 --> 02:25.362
That's 200 bucks. Pays 150.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.324
You know, I wouldn't even
get out of bed for less than 6k

02:30.498 --> 02:32.630
when I worked for the Examiner. Yeah. Well, Gerry,

02:32.804 --> 02:35.067
you should try
getting your old job back.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.679
You know what, Max? I don't
wanna talk to you anymore,

02:37.853 --> 02:39.071
so send me the details.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.595
I'm gonna run home
and grab some crap.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.784
I don't know a lot about cows,
but doesn't look mutilated.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.003
Yeah? Check her
behind there.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.354
Right there.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.573
Might be the work of
some of those Satanists

03:02.747 --> 03:04.358
I keep hearing about,
you know, the--

03:04.532 --> 03:06.534
They put on these animal masks,
strip down,

03:06.708 --> 03:08.405
and they engage
in unholy orgies.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.844
Mr. Geary,
may I ask you a question?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.890
Yeah, sure.Do you have a son?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.674
Yeah.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.850
Sixteen?No, he's 15.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.463
You ever hear
of the band Metallica?

03:27.076 --> 03:29.252
Sorry, I, uh...

03:33.169 --> 03:35.127
Could have fooled me.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.217
HAGAN: Geary?Oh, jeez, here we go.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.349
Yeah?

03:39.523 --> 03:41.525
This is church property.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.179
Get that cow out of here.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.094
I'm-- I'm wicked sorry,
Father Hagan.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.096
Uh, it won't happen again,
I swear to God.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.141
You said that last week.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.840
This cow craps everywhere.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.234
I know. It's a mess. Sorry.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.410
Now, Geary.GEARY: You got it.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.718
I own the farm next door.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.851
I've been meaning
to mend that fence.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.853
You know what,
I-- I don't care.

04:05.027 --> 04:08.422
What I do care about
is my employer is not gonna pay

04:08.596 --> 04:10.337
for pictures
of that cow's ass.

04:12.295 --> 04:15.037
I-- I don't know what to say.Yeah, I know you don't.

04:28.529 --> 04:29.921
Did you hear that?

04:30.095 --> 04:31.314
Hear what?

04:33.011 --> 04:33.882
Mr. Fenn?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.536
What the hell?

05:40.122 --> 05:43.125
"February 31, 1845."

05:56.181 --> 05:58.009
Yeah, farmers used
to plant 'em in the fields,

05:58.183 --> 05:59.837
uh, for good luck.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.536
Man, never seen one
like that, though.

06:02.710 --> 06:03.624
GERRY:
God, that is creepy.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.242
"When the ancient talisman
was broken,

06:13.416 --> 06:16.463
mysterious cattle mutilations
began."

06:16.637 --> 06:18.856
This ain't broken.

06:21.511 --> 06:22.730
You-- You broke it.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.906
Let's not argue
about who broke what.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.386
You just got done
telling me my son--

06:26.560 --> 06:27.952
Or who mutilated what.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.346
Now we have a story.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.003
Come on, help me out, man.With what?

06:35.177 --> 06:37.875
We'll get a big picture of
that lovable mug in the article.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.747
Oh, no, I don't want a picture.Yeah, yeah.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.531
Come on.
Get down there by the thing.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.751
Like I found it?Yeah.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.230
All right.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.058
Yeah, that's good.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.497
GEARY: You like it?Better than a cow's ass.

06:50.671 --> 06:51.411
GEARY:
All right.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.505
GERRY:
Ah, where does a fella get
something to eat around here?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.210
GERRY:
This is a cool place.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.299
Is it always this busy?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
This?

07:12.257 --> 07:13.998
This is rush hour.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.661
And an unidentified vandal
broke a protective talisman.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.796
An unholy evil was released.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.974
An evil thirsty for blood.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.715
It began...

07:37.326 --> 07:40.285
It began by sucking
on a cow's ass.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.725
Good God, Fenn.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.293
You were gonna win a Pulitzer.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.600
Idiot.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.909
Oh, shit.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.362
Oh, shit.

08:24.808 --> 08:25.722
Shit.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.290
Hey!

08:53.315 --> 08:54.577
Hey.

09:41.102 --> 09:45.323
ALICE:
I pledge my soul to you.
I pledge my soul to you.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.459
I promise. I will.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.333
I will.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.945
Hey, are you okay?

09:58.119 --> 09:59.729
Thank you.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.093
HAGAN:
I'm coming.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.101
Alice.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.196
HAGAN:
Yeah. Dr. Gates,
it's an emergency.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
Please. As soon as you can.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.775
NATALIE:
How are you feeling?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.828
HAGAN:
This has never happened before.
Could--?

10:55.002 --> 10:56.786
Could she
have been sleepwalking?

10:56.960 --> 11:01.051
She seems fine. I can check in
again tomorrow after Mass.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.618
Hmm?

11:08.189 --> 11:12.672
So Alice, she lives
with Father Hagan?

11:12.846 --> 11:16.893
He's her uncle. He's raised her
since her parents died.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.374
That's-- The thing is...

11:22.246 --> 11:24.640
It's not possible. Alice has
never spoken a word in her life.

11:24.814 --> 11:25.902
She has
congenital cholesteatoma.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.817
Look, I get it.
You don't know me,

11:27.991 --> 11:29.384
and I made
a bad first impression,

11:32.387 --> 11:35.259
Okay. What's your
blood alcohol level?

11:35.433 --> 11:37.871
You are lucky
that Alice is okay.

11:38.045 --> 11:40.134
If anything
had happened to her,

11:40.308 --> 11:42.049
I would have made it
my own personal mission

11:42.223 --> 11:43.659
to see you locked up.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.402
Get in.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.851
This, uh,
the best place you got?

12:02.025 --> 12:03.810
This is the only place
we've got.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.685
Okay.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.470
Well, at least it's cheap.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.646
At least it's not jail.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.959
Hey, Gerry.Hey, I'm still in Banfield.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.700
Um, I got into a little bit
of an accident,

13:08.875 --> 13:11.355
so I, uh--
Story gonna be late.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.228
Forget it. Obscura.com ran a
cattle mutilation piece today.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.756
What if I have
another story? Um...

13:20.930 --> 13:23.454
Deaf-mute girl here,
connected to the church,

13:23.628 --> 13:25.500
she spontaneously talked.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.284
Religious angle.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.939
Okay, Gerry.Two hundred bucks.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.377
Pays 150. And bring pictures.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.554
Don't be such a cheap bastard. Mm-hmm.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.818
PARISHIONERS:
...you take away
the sins of the world.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.735
Lamb of God, you take away
the sins of the world.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.650
Grant us peace.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.043
Lord, I am not worthy

13:47.217 --> 13:48.784
that you should
enter under my roof,

13:48.958 --> 13:52.919
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.623
HAGAN:
Behold the Lamb of God.

14:01.797 --> 14:05.018
Behold him who takes away
the sins of the world.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.643
:
Alice...

16:16.279 --> 16:17.889
The Lady...

16:32.730 --> 16:34.950
The Lady has...

16:35.124 --> 16:37.170
an urgent message for all of us.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.916
She wants us
to come again tomorrow.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.052
She... She says...

16:53.229 --> 16:54.839
She says her name is Mary.

17:03.544 --> 17:08.723
Alice, these tests will allow us
to evaluate your hearing.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.768
Are you ready?

17:10.942 --> 17:13.771
I'm gonna play
a series of sounds for you...

17:13.945 --> 17:15.599
at different volumes.

17:23.346 --> 17:27.002
Now you're gonna
hear some words,

17:27.176 --> 17:30.527
and I'd like you to repeat them
back to me, okay?

17:30.701 --> 17:31.746
RECORDED VOICE:
Cat.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.921
Cat.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.532
Apple.

17:35.706 --> 17:36.490
Apple.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.362
Number five.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.277
Number five.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.539
Ocean.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.150
Ocean.

18:07.869 --> 18:11.220
MONICA: Slade here.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.788
Burning the midnight oil,
I see.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.572
I always thought
you worked too hard.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.617
Fenn.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.010
Monica. It's been a while.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.100
Not long enough.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.579
Listen, I have a story for you.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.539
Uh, something I think
the Examinerwill love.

18:25.713 --> 18:30.239
An occurrence.
A healing, possibly divine.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.546
I swear, it's the truth.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.983
You were never interested
in the truth.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.985
For you, it was all about fame.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.422
All right, look, I totally
get the skepticism. But--

18:39.596 --> 18:42.556
You still don't get it, do you?
You lied.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.862
You were caught
fabricating stories.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.038
You almost ruined
this paper's reputation.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.345
People lost their jobs
because of you.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.391
Next time you feel
the urge to call me, don't.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.397
Fuck.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.025
You think Mary
will cure me, Dad?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.375
Let's pray to her.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.252
Friends.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.515
Please. Please.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.300
Uh...

20:14.474 --> 20:18.042
I've asked Alice to stay inside.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.349
I'm-- Obviously,
we're very happy

20:20.523 --> 20:22.830
and grateful
that she's recovered,

20:23.004 --> 20:26.312
but I think this is all
a bit overwhelming for her.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.793
So nothing is
gonna happen today.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.233
If you could
all please go home,

20:34.407 --> 20:36.322
I'd appreciate it.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.237
Thank you.MAN: Look, there she is.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.326
Alice.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.116
HAGAN:
Alice.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.160
Thank you.

21:46.566 --> 21:47.697
Do you believe in miracles?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.443
Do you have faith in Mary?

21:55.836 --> 21:56.924
Yes.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.666
Then walk.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.103
I can't.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.629
Mary commands you to walk.

22:08.588 --> 22:09.763
But I can't.

22:13.897 --> 22:14.724
ALICE:
Believe.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.000
Hail Mary...

23:13.174 --> 23:15.524
ALL:
Full of Grace,
the Lord is with thee.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.745
Blessed art thou among women,

23:18.919 --> 23:21.182
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

23:21.356 --> 23:25.012
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

23:25.186 --> 23:28.798
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.728
NEWSCASTER:
Next up, a strange story
from our local news affiliate.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.862
FEMALE REPORTER:
The town of Banfield
in central Massachusetts.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.038
A paralyzed boy
named Toby Walsh

23:51.212 --> 23:54.215
claims he was healed by
an 18-year-old Alice Pagett.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.435
Images of a miracle
have gone viral.

23:56.609 --> 23:59.394
Bishop James Gyles
of the Boston Archdiocese

23:59.568 --> 24:02.963
has announced a press
conference this morning.

24:03.137 --> 24:07.010
1858, a French girl named
Bernadette Soubirous

24:07.184 --> 24:09.012
claimed to have had
a series of visitations

24:09.186 --> 24:10.971
from the Blessed Virgin
in a grotto

24:11.145 --> 24:13.190
outside the town of Lourdes.

24:13.364 --> 24:16.585
1917, Fátima, Portugal.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.980
Three shepherd children reported
apparitions of the Virgin Mary,

24:20.154 --> 24:22.765
followed by miracles,
prophesies.

24:25.246 --> 24:29.946
1981, Medjugorje, Bosnia.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.602
Six witnesses observed
a Marian apparition.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.952
Many claim that
the Holy Mother continues

24:36.126 --> 24:39.129
to visit this
shrine to this very day.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.698
The present.

24:42.872 --> 24:47.398
All three shrines draw millions
of faithful each year.

24:47.573 --> 24:50.924
In Lourdes alone,
over 5000 miraculous cures

24:51.098 --> 24:53.361
have been recorded.GERRY: Excuse me.

24:53.535 --> 24:57.191
Are you saying that Banfield
could become such a shrine?

24:57.365 --> 25:01.891
Well, first
we have to, uh, confirm

25:02.065 --> 25:04.633
that an actual miracle
has truly occurred.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.330
And that is why
Monsignor Delgarde here

25:06.505 --> 25:09.029
has been tasked by the Vatican

25:09.203 --> 25:11.466
to investigate
these, uh, alleged healings.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.946
Monsignor.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.995
In the 18th century,
Pope Benedict XIV

25:19.169 --> 25:20.910
laid out a procedure
to determine

25:21.084 --> 25:23.609
the veracity of a miracle.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.133
The main steps are:

25:26.307 --> 25:29.266
the illness must be incurable,

25:29.440 --> 25:32.139
the cure must be instantaneous,

25:32.313 --> 25:34.576
the cure must be complete.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.665
In my capacity as inquisitor,

25:36.839 --> 25:40.103
I intend to use all medical
science and technology available

25:40.277 --> 25:43.585
to disprove the alleged miracle

25:43.759 --> 25:45.369
and expose any deceit.

25:47.676 --> 25:51.375
If I fail, the miracle
is to be considered genuine.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.642
Meanwhile,
the church has installed

25:56.816 --> 25:59.514
a shelter over the site
to protect it from the elements

25:59.688 --> 26:01.603
and, uh, public intrusion.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.999
Yes. Yes, yes. Go ahead.

26:06.173 --> 26:09.089
When will we see
Alice Pagett and Toby Walsh?

26:09.263 --> 26:12.571
Well, the Walsh family has asked
for privacy at this time,

26:12.745 --> 26:14.834
and we intend
to respect their wishes.

26:15.008 --> 26:17.619
Uh, Miss Pagett, however,
has, uh, offered

26:17.793 --> 26:19.621
to speak with you
on her own accord.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.492
Alice, you don't have to go--

26:24.713 --> 26:26.889
You don't have to go in there
if you don't want to.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.065
It's okay, Dr. Gates.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.676
This is what the Lady wants.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.990
The lady you claim appeared
to you, is she the Virgin Mary?

26:41.164 --> 26:44.037
REPORTER 1:
And what exactly were her words?

26:44.211 --> 26:46.735
Do you have a history
of any mental illness?

26:46.909 --> 26:50.347
REPORTER 2:
Have you received any financial
incentives to make these claims?

26:53.307 --> 26:54.656
What does the lady look like?

26:57.485 --> 27:00.488
She's dressed
in flowing white robes.

27:00.662 --> 27:05.536
She glows like how the sun
shimmers on a hazy day.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.714
And how does she--
How does she speak to you?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.803
Is it a voice in your head?

27:10.977 --> 27:13.936
Alice, have you ever
used drugs before?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.635
When did--?
When did you first see her?

27:16.809 --> 27:19.594
Five nights ago, in the field.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.596
You were there.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.946
And what does Mary want?

27:26.383 --> 27:27.689
Our faith.

27:30.649 --> 27:34.522
I'm, uh-- I'm told
we'll have some privacy in here.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.697
Please.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.179
A little surprised
that, ahem,

27:39.353 --> 27:41.268
Father Hagan missed
the press conference.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.705
Uh, yes, well, uh,

27:43.879 --> 27:47.491
Father Hagan is unfortunately
not feeling well.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.103
I am sorry to hear that.
I imagine he is pretty excited

27:50.277 --> 27:52.409
about his church
becoming a shrine.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.063
Yet to be determined.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.459
Alice is speaking
perfectly,

27:58.633 --> 28:00.983
though she has never heard
any form of speech before.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.464
How do you explain that?There are various degrees

28:03.638 --> 28:05.292
of deafness, Mr. Fenn.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.773
Alice may have been
unconsciously hearing all along.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.818
Come on.Are you Catholic?

28:09.992 --> 28:12.255
I was raised Catholic.
Lapsed.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.431
Spiritually and professionally,
it would appear.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.478
My lack of faith
could be an advantage.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.610
Having
a neutral observer along

28:19.785 --> 28:23.049
to record the process
would be healthy.

28:23.223 --> 28:25.965
Now, you may find
someone more devout, but--

28:26.139 --> 28:28.402
But they'd be
accused of bias. Yeah.

28:28.576 --> 28:29.882
Give me the exclusive.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.059
Only I talk to Alice.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.844
I promise you
I will be fair.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.411
And if, for whatever reason,

28:37.585 --> 28:39.979
any of these miracles
turn to be false,

28:40.153 --> 28:42.285
then I personally
will take the hit.

28:42.459 --> 28:46.072
Alice certainly seems
more inclined to talk to you.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.596
Your Grace,
this man's reputation is--

28:48.770 --> 28:50.772
Yes, yes, I know, Vincent.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.863
Everyone deserves
a second chance, though.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.866
Even Mr. Fenn here.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.785
But they keep screamin'

31:14.960 --> 31:18.615
To filter out somehow

31:18.789 --> 31:20.400
Wanna leave...

31:20.574 --> 31:23.229
I asked if I could
join the church choir.

31:23.403 --> 31:26.188
All my life, I've been watching
them sing from the sidelines.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.147
You know the worst part
about being deaf?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.500
I said, you know
the worst part about being deaf?

31:33.674 --> 31:36.807
What's that?You can't listen to music.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.722
But you can feel it.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.638
You turn the volume way up
and play something really loud,

31:41.812 --> 31:46.600
like the "1812 Overture," heh,
you can feel the vibrations.

31:46.774 --> 31:48.297
Well, it's good to know
that you are

31:48.471 --> 31:50.256
just like
every other teenager.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.649
So any new favorites?

31:52.823 --> 31:54.173
I think I might be
into country.

31:54.347 --> 31:57.219
Oh, Alice, keep exploring.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.701
All right, I think
I got this all set up.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.966
Uh, what do you say we do
a couple real easy questions?

32:05.140 --> 32:06.359
How many are gonna watch?

32:07.969 --> 32:09.144
Well, that is--

32:09.318 --> 32:11.712
That is hard to say...

32:11.886 --> 32:13.627
but maybe millions.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.064
Mary wants to reach
as many people as possible.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.980
Well, we wanna
make Mary happy, don't we?

32:20.242 --> 32:21.461
Okay.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.508
There are...

32:25.682 --> 32:29.382
There are people out there that
don't believe in your miracles.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.862
How would you respond
to those folks?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.691
Seeing is believing.

32:34.865 --> 32:37.868
And why do you think
Mary chose you?

32:38.043 --> 32:41.002
Because she gives voice
to the voiceless,

32:41.176 --> 32:44.701
and I've been silent
for a really long time.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.442
I prayed so hard to her,

32:46.616 --> 32:49.010
I yearned to be healed
and she answered.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.927
I opened myself up to Mary

32:53.101 --> 32:54.973
and welcomed her in.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.975
And she heard me, Mr. Fenn.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.716
More than that, she listened.

32:59.890 --> 33:00.717
All my life,

33:00.891 --> 33:02.502
people barely looked at me,

33:02.676 --> 33:04.634
like I was invisible.

33:04.808 --> 33:08.334
But now when I walk into
the room, everybody listens.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.034
You understand
what that's like.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.212
People used to listen to you.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.998
They used to hang
on your every word.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.653
You had so much power,
but now it's gone.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.439
Wait, wait, Alice, how do you--?Mary told me.

33:28.876 --> 33:32.401
She looked at you in the field
and saw someone who needed her.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.751
A soul yearning for her touch.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.582
You and the Lady want
the same thing, Mr. Fenn.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.280
Spread her word.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.805
Seize this chance.

33:44.979 --> 33:47.199
Spread her word and be rewarded.

33:47.373 --> 33:50.724
HAGAN:
Alice, you have any idea
what I did with my book?

33:50.898 --> 33:52.073
I can't--

33:57.774 --> 34:00.038
Alice, I'd like to have a word

34:00.212 --> 34:01.517
with Mr. Fenn
in private, please.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.529
Uh, Gyles authorized me
to be here.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.618
You just wanna
take advantage of her.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.273
And I won't let--

34:26.368 --> 34:28.762
I won't let you use her.

34:33.593 --> 34:34.811
Emphysema?

34:36.552 --> 34:39.077
My-- My grandmother
had emphysema.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.297
You think that's a good idea?

34:52.177 --> 34:54.266
Father Hagan, your niece,

34:54.440 --> 34:56.181
she is a remarkable young woman.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.705
She has a gift.

34:58.879 --> 35:01.229
Now, imagine...

35:01.403 --> 35:03.405
Imagine what the people
would think

35:03.579 --> 35:06.756
if they were able to actually
see God's work in action?

35:08.367 --> 35:11.326
Don't talk to me about God.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.981
You'd sell your soul
for a story, and you know it.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.244
I-- I guess I don't understand

35:16.418 --> 35:18.116
what is wrong
with doing some good

35:18.290 --> 35:20.118
and maybe a few people
profiting from it.

35:20.292 --> 35:23.686
Like you and your church.
Everybody wins.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.864
Everybody.

35:28.038 --> 35:31.303
The bishop thinks a shrine
would be wonderful for Banfield.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.654
Maybe.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.047
I'm not sure it would
be wonderful for Alice.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.270
When God builds a church,

35:42.444 --> 35:44.620
the devil builds
a chapel next door.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.191
I never thought
that I would hear

35:50.365 --> 35:52.280
a Catholic priest
quote Martin Luther.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.850
Mr. Fenn...

35:57.024 --> 36:00.854
we are in an eternal battle
between good and evil.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.727
Wherever God goes,
the unholy follows.

36:04.901 --> 36:08.470
The girl who saw
the Virgin Mary at Lourdes...

36:08.644 --> 36:11.038
the world
treated her like a freak.

36:11.212 --> 36:15.695
She lived out the rest of her
life locked away in a convent.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.828
In Fátima, three children
saw the Virgin Mary.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.527
Two of them were dead
by the end of the year.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.750
Miracles, Mr. Fenn.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.405
Miracles.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.931
They're strong acts of faith,

36:35.105 --> 36:38.152
and there is nothing
that Satan likes more

36:38.326 --> 36:40.589
than to corrupt our faith.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.057
:
Well, our town was founded
in the early 19th century

37:14.232 --> 37:15.798
by Catholic farmers.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.844
The earliest mention
in our records is found

37:18.018 --> 37:20.455
in the county assessor's
almanac of 1852.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.762
He refers to it as Banefield,

37:22.936 --> 37:25.025
a place of strange
and terrible wonders.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.157
:
Wonders? What does that mean?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.247
LIBRARIAN:
Well, it could've
been anything.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.466
A two-headed calf,
a black goat.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.122
Back then, people saw
the devil behind every tree.

38:11.767 --> 38:14.857
GERRY:
"There are various degrees
of deafness.

38:15.031 --> 38:18.296
Alice may have unconsciously
been hearing all along."

38:18.470 --> 38:19.514
Those are your words.

38:22.561 --> 38:25.215
I entered a seminary
when I was 19.

38:26.565 --> 38:28.523
The Jesuits.

38:28.697 --> 38:32.701
While still a novice,
I disproved a case of stigmata.

38:32.875 --> 38:36.966
Caught the attention
of the Holy See.

38:37.140 --> 38:41.971
I have read several libraries'
worth on the supernatural,

38:42.145 --> 38:46.367
investigated half a dozen
cases of alleged miracles.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.151
Proved them all false.

38:50.066 --> 38:53.505
Oh, you know damn well
I didn't cook this up.

38:53.679 --> 38:56.464
It wouldn't be the first time.

38:56.638 --> 38:59.162
You know,
there's this part in the Bible

38:59.337 --> 39:03.906
about forgiving sins,
kind of a major plot point.

39:04.080 --> 39:08.346
If the sinner confesses
his sins and truly repents.

39:13.525 --> 39:14.569
Anything you care to tell me?

39:15.962 --> 39:16.919
No.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.280
That was very good, Alice.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.371
That was-- That was excellent.

39:33.545 --> 39:36.112
Next, we should try "Mary--"

39:36.286 --> 39:37.897
"Mary of--"

39:39.551 --> 39:40.726
"Promi--"

39:48.603 --> 39:49.778
Oh!

39:49.952 --> 39:51.476
Ouch!

39:58.700 --> 40:00.572
Do you have faith in her?I...

40:00.746 --> 40:02.574
Do you pledge to serve her

40:02.748 --> 40:04.358
with all your heart and soul?Yes.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.450
Yeah. I need an ambulance
at Church of Our Lady.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.669
Father Hagan collapsed.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.517
Oh.

40:37.478 --> 40:38.697
I can breathe.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.745
I can breathe.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.057
Alice, I can breathe.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.986
NATALIE:
Father Hagan's
most recent physical.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.510
You'll see the mass
in the left lower lung field,

41:09.684 --> 41:12.731
causing complete collapse
in the lower left lobe.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.689
They gave him six months tops.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.302
Father Hagan's lungs today.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.522
GERRY:Wait...

41:21.696 --> 41:23.306
are you saying
that he's healed?

41:25.178 --> 41:27.006
Apparently so.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.052
What about the kid, Toby Walsh?
Are results in for him?

41:30.226 --> 41:32.054
Boston Children's Hospital
diagnosed him

41:32.228 --> 41:34.187
as suffering
from muscular dystrophy.

41:34.361 --> 41:35.188
No cure.

41:35.362 --> 41:38.234
While impossible...

41:38.408 --> 41:41.150
Toby's afflictions
have completely disappeared.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.678
All right, let me make sure
I got this straight,

41:46.852 --> 41:48.462
that I'm not missing something.

41:48.636 --> 41:49.985
There are
three main requirements

41:50.159 --> 41:51.987
to be considered a miracle.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.424
The illness must be incurable,

41:54.599 --> 41:57.079
the cure must be instantaneous

41:57.253 --> 41:59.865
and the cure must be complete.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.257
Correct?

42:03.999 --> 42:05.131
Oh, come on.

42:07.046 --> 42:09.135
This is the real deal.
This is genuine.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.922
It certainly
appears that way, Mr. Fenn.

42:14.096 --> 42:17.796
NEWSCASTER:
The main requirements for a
genuine miracle have been met.

42:17.970 --> 42:19.928
The Pope has decreed
that the field

42:20.102 --> 42:22.714
where the Virgin Mary appeared
is a holy shrine.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.454
GERRY:
What does Alice mean to you?

42:24.629 --> 42:27.109
Alice is my hero.

42:27.283 --> 42:29.895
I felt invisible,
just like she did.

42:30.069 --> 42:31.940
But now, seeing
what she's become,

42:32.114 --> 42:35.335
she inspires me. She's holy. You can tell.

42:35.509 --> 42:37.685
She's gonna be bigger
than Taylor Swift. I know it.

42:37.859 --> 42:39.034
Nothing ever happens
in Banfield.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.646
No. This-- This is huge, right?

42:41.820 --> 42:43.256
GERRY: Where you going? Anywhere but here.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.562
GERRY:
Aren't you happy
about the miracles?

42:44.736 --> 42:46.302
No, sir, I am not.

42:46.476 --> 42:50.524
I like when God stays
where he belongs.

42:50.698 --> 42:54.397
Up there. When he comes
down here, bad things happen.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.052
Floods, plagues of locusts.

42:57.226 --> 43:00.273
The Old Testament God
is wrathful.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.710
What if something
pisses him off?

43:02.884 --> 43:06.975
The impact to the economy of
Banfield cannot be overstated.

43:07.149 --> 43:09.282
In Europe, the shrines
at Lourdes and Fátima

43:09.456 --> 43:11.850
each attract
6 million tourists a year.

43:20.380 --> 43:23.209
Monica, I'm a little surprised
to be hearing from you.

43:23.383 --> 43:25.777
Yeah, well, I talked
it over with management.

43:25.951 --> 43:28.257
We decided ten years
was long enough.

43:28.431 --> 43:29.824
You paid your dues.

43:31.739 --> 43:34.046
Well, as tempting
as that sounds, I pass.

43:34.220 --> 43:36.614
What? I want a desk, Monica.

43:36.788 --> 43:39.138
Special Sections...

43:40.748 --> 43:42.750
You're out of your bloody mind.

43:42.924 --> 43:45.797
I'm fielding calls
from Chicago, New York, D.C.

43:45.971 --> 43:48.669
Every major Catholic demographic
on this planet

43:48.843 --> 43:50.845
is eating this up.

43:51.019 --> 43:53.152
I have exclusive access
to Alice Pagett.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.502
You wanna talk to Alice,
you have to go through me.

43:55.676 --> 43:57.417
No story without Alice,

43:57.591 --> 44:01.073
which means no story
without Gerry Fenn.

44:04.206 --> 44:06.687
I'll get back to you. I'm sure you will.

44:17.698 --> 44:19.482
Who's back?

44:19.657 --> 44:21.093
That guy's back.

44:22.747 --> 44:24.531
I'm gonna need new headshots!

44:29.362 --> 44:31.103
This is my home.

44:31.277 --> 44:33.235
I've never lived
anywhere else.

44:35.368 --> 44:37.892
But my uncle felt I'd be
better off at the diocese.

44:39.589 --> 44:41.983
I'm sorry, Alice.
It sucks.

44:42.157 --> 44:43.245
I get it.

44:44.899 --> 44:46.901
Where is your uncle,
anyway?

44:47.075 --> 44:50.078
He has some work
at the church.

44:50.252 --> 44:53.255
I just don't know
what he's gonna do without me.

44:53.429 --> 44:55.736
Like, who's gonna catch him
if he tries to smoke?

44:58.260 --> 45:00.523
I don't know for certain,
but I think he'll be okay.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.742
He's a big boy.

45:03.657 --> 45:08.053
Hey... think of it as
a new adventure you're going on.

45:08.227 --> 45:11.752
And in honor of that,
I made you something.

45:14.624 --> 45:15.974
A mix.

45:16.148 --> 45:19.499
Now, please remember
that I'm an old dude,

45:19.673 --> 45:22.067
so you're gonna have
to put up with some classics.

45:22.241 --> 45:24.460
The Beatles,
Zeppelin, The Stones,

45:24.634 --> 45:26.245
Eagles, some Tupac.

45:26.419 --> 45:27.899
But I also tried
to figure out

45:28.073 --> 45:29.509
what the kids
listen to these days.

45:29.683 --> 45:30.945
So you get
some Billie Eilish,

45:31.119 --> 45:32.773
Rufus Wainwright,
Smashing Pumpkins.

45:34.906 --> 45:36.821
It's just really important
that you know

45:36.995 --> 45:40.389
that there is a whole big world
out there besides, uh, country.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.957
Thanks.

45:46.004 --> 45:48.310
You know, you're not as big
a jerk as everybody thinks.

45:50.617 --> 45:51.661
Okay. Thank you.

45:57.319 --> 46:00.801
The Lady is happy
with you, Mr. Fenn.

46:00.975 --> 46:02.760
All these people praying to her,

46:02.934 --> 46:05.501
believing in her
because of you.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.943
Well, you tell the Lady
she's welcome.

47:51.172 --> 47:53.566
WAITRESS:
From the lady.

47:53.740 --> 47:54.959
The lady?

48:01.922 --> 48:03.619
Different lady.

48:06.318 --> 48:08.842
Why'd you do it?What?

48:09.016 --> 48:10.670
Why'd you fabricate
all those stories?

48:14.543 --> 48:16.284
The truth?Yeah.

48:17.590 --> 48:18.983
Fame.

48:23.683 --> 48:25.206
When you are on top of the world

48:25.380 --> 48:26.991
and those lights are on you...

48:28.427 --> 48:29.602
it is...

48:31.125 --> 48:32.605
It's like a drug,

48:32.779 --> 48:34.041
and it's intoxicating.

48:34.215 --> 48:36.783
And I got caught up in it...

48:38.219 --> 48:40.569
and I thought
I was untouchable.

48:40.743 --> 48:42.354
Pride before the fall.

48:42.528 --> 48:45.487
Does everyone
quote the Bible around here?

48:45.661 --> 48:48.577
Banfield's always been
a place of faith.

48:48.751 --> 48:50.231
Faith, yeah.Mm-hmm.

48:50.405 --> 48:52.886
Faith and superstition.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.496
You know, the first day
I was here,

48:54.670 --> 48:57.369
my farmer friend and I,
we found a kern doll.

48:57.543 --> 48:59.937
A kern baby.Baby, yeah.

49:00.111 --> 49:01.503
Fields are full of them.Yeah.

49:01.677 --> 49:04.680
But according to my farmer
friend, not like this one.

49:04.854 --> 49:07.509
This one was
wrapped up in a chain,

49:07.683 --> 49:10.556
and the chain was stamped
with an impossible date,

49:10.730 --> 49:12.645
February 31st.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.779
What?

49:16.954 --> 49:19.652
Uh, um...What?

49:22.307 --> 49:25.005
Kern babies
are good luck, right?

49:25.179 --> 49:27.660
Yeah.But they also believe

49:27.834 --> 49:31.011
that you could trap
bad things in them, and so...

49:33.753 --> 49:36.625
You know, they would
wrap it up in a chain

49:36.799 --> 49:40.716
and they would put
an impossible date

49:40.890 --> 49:44.329
on that kern baby,
like February 31st.

49:44.503 --> 49:46.461
And they hoped that

49:46.635 --> 49:49.160
that would just keep
that spirit trapped forever.

49:54.469 --> 49:56.950
So how is Toby Walsh doing?

49:57.124 --> 49:58.821
Actually, he made
the school soccer team.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.521
So it's a real miracle.

50:02.695 --> 50:05.567
Wait a minute. I thought doctors
didn't believe in miracles.

50:05.741 --> 50:07.961
Science and God
are not mutually exclusive.

50:08.135 --> 50:09.615
I could tell you stories.

50:10.877 --> 50:12.052
Fenn?

50:25.326 --> 50:27.850
I've seen this place before.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.287
Pequod Creek?

50:30.940 --> 50:32.507
We used to come here
Easter Sunday

50:32.681 --> 50:35.119
for the church picnics
until they sold it off.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.340
Wait, this was church property?Yeah.

50:39.514 --> 50:42.996
Church owned most of Banfield
ever since Our Lady was built.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.564
When? When was that?

50:45.738 --> 50:46.913
Mid-1800s.

50:47.087 --> 50:48.610
1845?

50:50.699 --> 50:51.961
How did you know that?

51:17.422 --> 51:18.684
Fenn?

51:22.209 --> 51:23.254
What's wrong?

51:29.129 --> 51:30.565
I need to speak to Hagan.

51:30.739 --> 51:32.045
Something happened here.

51:32.219 --> 51:34.178
Something connected
to the church.

52:04.643 --> 52:06.862
Confession is from 7 to 8.

52:07.036 --> 52:08.821
WOMAN:
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

52:10.823 --> 52:12.041
May the Lord be in your heart

52:12.216 --> 52:14.566
and help you confess your sins.

52:14.740 --> 52:17.917
It's been, oh, some while
since my last confession.

52:18.091 --> 52:20.311
Uh-huh. Go on.

52:20.485 --> 52:22.574
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain,

52:22.748 --> 52:26.099
been covetous,
had impure thoughts...

52:26.273 --> 52:28.884
destroyed many lives,

52:29.058 --> 52:31.974
led many souls
into perdition...

52:32.149 --> 52:34.716
and now I've come for you.

52:34.890 --> 52:36.675
Say three Hail Marys and--

52:36.849 --> 52:39.721
I healed you.

52:39.895 --> 52:42.898
Instead of faith,
you repaid me with doubt.

52:43.072 --> 52:45.249
And what did it gain you?

52:45.423 --> 52:50.297
You discovered the truth
at the expense of your life.

52:50.471 --> 52:55.346
And do you actually believe
you can stop me?

52:55.520 --> 52:59.480
Shall I tell you what happened
to those who have tried?

52:59.654 --> 53:04.093
I stripped the flesh
from their bones.

53:04.268 --> 53:06.487
I slit their windpipes

53:06.661 --> 53:09.795
and watched the breath
slowly leak out.

53:13.581 --> 53:15.801
Satan. He gave me the power

53:15.975 --> 53:18.456
to perform miracles.No! No!

53:18.630 --> 53:22.590
Pray for your sweet
blessed Mary to save you.

53:22.764 --> 53:24.897
Jesus--Let's see who's stronger,

53:25.071 --> 53:27.639
her or me!

54:06.243 --> 54:08.462
No, please... Aah!

54:38.840 --> 54:39.711
Father Hagan?

54:53.246 --> 54:54.378
Father Hagan?

55:08.566 --> 55:10.089
Father Hagan?

55:40.380 --> 55:42.469
I don't get it.

55:42.643 --> 55:46.865
Why would Hagan kill himself?
He had just been healed.

55:47.039 --> 55:49.128
Who knows
what demons plagued him?

55:50.825 --> 55:52.131
This will, of course,
be reported

55:52.305 --> 55:55.047
as a tragic accident.

55:55.221 --> 55:56.918
As I'm sure
you can appreciate,

55:57.092 --> 55:59.791
suicide is somewhat frowned
upon in our profession.

55:59.965 --> 56:03.098
So I must ask for
your discretion in this matter.

56:03.272 --> 56:06.014
Father Hagan was
the shepherd of this community.

56:07.886 --> 56:09.670
You can appreciate
the damage it would do

56:09.844 --> 56:11.498
now that Banfield
has been reborn.

56:14.240 --> 56:15.763
Let me ask you something.

56:17.722 --> 56:19.767
When you turn on the news,
what do you see?

56:19.941 --> 56:23.945
War, famine, disease,
suffering, hate.

56:24.119 --> 56:25.469
The devil is winning, Mr. Fenn.

56:27.122 --> 56:29.081
Faith is the only thing

56:29.255 --> 56:32.258
that stands
between us and perdition.

56:33.433 --> 56:35.696
And this place, this shrine,

56:35.870 --> 56:38.743
will help
strengthen our faith...

56:38.917 --> 56:40.222
thanks to you.

56:42.268 --> 56:43.878
None of it...

56:44.052 --> 56:46.490
would've been
possible without you.

57:11.863 --> 57:15.214
My uncle loved me
and cared for me.

57:15.388 --> 57:17.477
He was the only family I had.

57:23.657 --> 57:25.398
You know what, this is...

57:25.572 --> 57:28.706
This is dumb. We can do
this some other time. Um...

57:30.229 --> 57:31.360
No, uh...

57:32.666 --> 57:34.189
Mary relieved his suffering

57:34.363 --> 57:37.932
before calling him
to his eternal reward.

57:38.106 --> 57:40.195
She wants us
to continue her work.

57:47.681 --> 57:48.856
Okay.

57:54.209 --> 57:55.341
You know...

57:57.169 --> 57:58.997
your uncle believed

57:59.171 --> 58:03.305
that wherever God went,
the devil was close behind.

58:05.133 --> 58:06.744
Do you think that--?

58:09.442 --> 58:12.445
Do you think there could be
other forces at play here?

58:12.619 --> 58:14.621
Mary would
never let that happen.

58:18.190 --> 58:20.714
Don't doubt her, Mr. Fenn.

58:22.324 --> 58:24.065
She is the Blessed Virgin.

58:24.239 --> 58:25.414
The mother of God.

58:25.589 --> 58:27.373
Her love for us
is so deep it burns.

58:27.547 --> 58:28.766
She--

58:33.422 --> 58:35.555
Mary is speaking
to me right now.

58:39.211 --> 58:43.171
She says, "Doubt weakens faith.

58:46.044 --> 58:48.655
Doubt leads to damnation."

1:00:03.077 --> 1:00:06.559
Blurry vision, wobbly knees.

1:00:06.733 --> 1:00:09.954
No doctor could find
what was wrong with me.

1:00:10.128 --> 1:00:12.739
But one look at Alice,
and I was cured.

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:16.525
Shut up.

1:00:19.311 --> 1:00:23.054
She is the Blessed Virgin.
The mother of God.

1:00:23.228 --> 1:00:26.100
Her love for us
is so deep it burns. She--

1:00:42.856 --> 1:00:44.771
It burns. She--

1:01:10.188 --> 1:01:11.929
:
I will save you.

1:01:17.499 --> 1:01:19.545
Doubt leads to damnation.

1:01:20.938 --> 1:01:22.374
Natalie.

1:01:22.548 --> 1:01:24.202
Hey.

1:01:24.376 --> 1:01:25.899
I don't understand.

1:01:26.073 --> 1:01:27.727
Father Hagan wouldn't
have done this.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:30.338
I don't think he did.

1:01:30.512 --> 1:01:33.298
Do you know where
the church records are kept?

1:01:33.472 --> 1:01:35.604
Yeah, it's-- It's in the back.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:38.172
I need to see the files.

1:01:38.346 --> 1:01:41.610
Uh, the funeral's
about to start.

1:01:44.048 --> 1:01:44.918
All right.

1:02:04.677 --> 1:02:07.114
We gather here today...

1:02:07.288 --> 1:02:10.378
to pay our respects
to Father William Hagan.

1:02:40.887 --> 1:02:44.761
Do you have any idea what
we're looking for down here?

1:02:44.935 --> 1:02:47.938
Anything related to 1845.

1:02:52.246 --> 1:02:55.728
Behold, I will tell you
a mystery.

1:02:55.902 --> 1:02:58.165
We shall not all fall asleep...

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.474
but we will be changed
in an instant.

1:03:20.622 --> 1:03:22.015
Natalie...

1:03:23.277 --> 1:03:24.670
look at this.

1:03:27.281 --> 1:03:29.675
Uh, in Latin.

1:03:31.111 --> 1:03:33.113
Oh, God, okay.

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:35.376
Med school
had a Latin requirement.

1:03:37.378 --> 1:03:38.771
Testamentum...

1:03:38.945 --> 1:03:41.905
Testament of Father Prescott.

1:03:50.130 --> 1:03:52.785
"Concerning the witch
and the bride of Satan."

1:03:54.265 --> 1:03:56.833
Mary Elnor.

1:03:57.007 --> 1:03:59.357
DELGARDE:
For the trumpet will sound,

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:02.490
the dead will be raised...

1:04:02.664 --> 1:04:04.101
incorruptible...

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:08.235
and we shall be changed.

1:04:08.409 --> 1:04:10.847
NATALIE:
Mary performed miracles.

1:04:11.021 --> 1:04:12.587
She could heal the sick.

1:04:12.761 --> 1:04:15.068
Jesus, this is...No, no, keep-- Keep reading.

1:04:17.375 --> 1:04:19.203
NATALIE:
She claimed the Virgin Mary

1:04:19.377 --> 1:04:21.509
was speaking through her.

1:04:21.683 --> 1:04:24.730
She would heal you if
you pledged your soul to her.

1:04:24.904 --> 1:04:28.125
Anyone who challenged her
met tragic ends.

1:04:29.822 --> 1:04:32.303
Finally,
the town fought back.

1:04:32.477 --> 1:04:34.783
Mary was captured
and submerged

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:38.352
in the icy waters of--Pequod Creek.

1:04:38.526 --> 1:04:40.659
Mary confessed
to serving Satan.

1:04:40.833 --> 1:04:47.013
As punishment, a mask
was nailed onto Mary's face...

1:04:47.187 --> 1:04:50.451
in the image
of the Blessed Virgin.

1:04:54.455 --> 1:04:56.066
NATALIE:
Mary was hanged
by an ancient oak

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:58.633
in the shadow of the church.

1:04:58.807 --> 1:05:00.200
In the name
of Christ, our Lord...

1:05:00.374 --> 1:05:01.898
NATALIE:
Her body was burned,

1:05:02.072 --> 1:05:03.595
her ashes and her soul
imprisoned

1:05:03.769 --> 1:05:06.598
inside a kern baby.Contain her!

1:05:13.431 --> 1:05:16.042
We command the soul
of William Hagan.

1:05:16.216 --> 1:05:17.870
:
Alice...

1:05:18.044 --> 1:05:19.567
In the sight of this world...

1:05:22.135 --> 1:05:23.136
he is now dead.

1:05:29.534 --> 1:05:31.014
Mary has spoken to me.

1:05:34.408 --> 1:05:37.150
Tonight is the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:40.153
To celebrate,

1:05:40.327 --> 1:05:43.113
Mary wants us
to hold a service at the shrine.

1:05:46.594 --> 1:05:50.642
NATALIE:
After Mary's death,
her miracles were extinguished.

1:05:52.209 --> 1:05:56.082
Those she had healed
all relapsed.

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:58.650
Jesus. Father Hagan
must have found this book.

1:05:58.824 --> 1:06:02.088
He discovered the truth.
That's why Mary killed him.

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:05.309
Hagan believed that...

1:06:05.483 --> 1:06:08.965
wherever God goes,
the unholy follows.

1:06:09.139 --> 1:06:11.315
These miracles,
they are not God.

1:06:11.489 --> 1:06:14.405
Join us at this service. It's Mary Elnor...

1:06:14.579 --> 1:06:16.624
Pray to Mary. ...posing as the Virgin Mary.

1:06:16.798 --> 1:06:19.584
Open your heart to her. Doing the devil's work.

1:06:19.758 --> 1:06:22.891
She brings an urgent message
to share with the entire world,

1:06:23.066 --> 1:06:24.763
if you believe in her.

1:06:24.937 --> 1:06:27.461
ALL:
I believe! I believe!

1:06:27.635 --> 1:06:31.552
I believe!
I believe! I believe...

1:06:40.735 --> 1:06:41.475
Natalie.

1:06:47.655 --> 1:06:48.743
What?

1:07:05.717 --> 1:07:07.197
Fenn?

1:07:22.777 --> 1:07:24.823
Run!

1:07:27.695 --> 1:07:28.914
GERRY:
Go!

1:07:35.355 --> 1:07:36.574
NATALIE:
We need to warn Alice.

1:07:38.097 --> 1:07:39.359
Alice, did you have a vision?

1:07:39.533 --> 1:07:41.318
Alice, please, please.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.276
What do you have to say
to the people--?

1:07:43.450 --> 1:07:45.148
Not right now.
Please, please, please.

1:07:45.322 --> 1:07:47.193
Back away.Alice, a couple more questions.

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:49.804
Not right now.

1:07:49.978 --> 1:07:52.677
WOMAN:
Alice, will she be healed?

1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:15.047
Now is not a good time, Monica. You got a deal.

1:08:15.221 --> 1:08:16.875
The Special Section desk
is yours,

1:08:17.049 --> 1:08:18.529
but I want you
in the office today.

1:08:18.703 --> 1:08:19.878
I want your interviews
with Alice,

1:08:20.052 --> 1:08:21.009
and I want access to her.

1:08:21.184 --> 1:08:22.750
The story, no, I, uh--

1:08:22.924 --> 1:08:24.535
Listen to me,
I got it all wrong.

1:08:24.709 --> 1:08:26.841
Wait, what is this?
Did you get a better offer?

1:08:27.015 --> 1:08:30.236
No, you are not listening.
All right? We need to kill it.

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:32.673
Fenn, you're back.

1:08:32.847 --> 1:08:34.806
This is your last chance.
You've got it all.

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:38.375
Look, I know you. You would
sell your soul for a story.

1:08:38.549 --> 1:08:41.160
I'm pretty sure I already did.

1:08:45.164 --> 1:08:46.339
We gotta hurry.

1:08:54.869 --> 1:08:56.654
Alice is in the convent.

1:09:04.096 --> 1:09:05.489
SECRETARY:
Sir, he's in a meeting.

1:09:05.663 --> 1:09:07.839
Mr. Fenn.

1:09:08.013 --> 1:09:11.234
Before he died, Father Hagan
discovered the truth.

1:09:11.408 --> 1:09:14.976
Here, 175 years ago. 1845.

1:09:15.151 --> 1:09:16.848
A woman named Mary Elnor

1:09:17.022 --> 1:09:19.938
performed exactly
the same healings as Alice.

1:09:20.112 --> 1:09:24.029
But the source of her power
wasn't divine. It was satanic.

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:27.250
I know all about this, Mr. Fenn.

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:29.339
As soon as
the first miracle was reported,

1:09:29.513 --> 1:09:31.558
I had my staff
research Banfield.

1:09:31.732 --> 1:09:33.995
Mary Elnor's confession
is preserved

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:35.954
in the diocese archives.

1:09:36.128 --> 1:09:38.609
Why was I not
informed about this?

1:09:38.783 --> 1:09:41.307
Informed about what?

1:09:41.481 --> 1:09:44.049
An ugly occurrence
of vigilante justice

1:09:44.223 --> 1:09:46.747
that happened almost
two centuries ago?

1:09:46.921 --> 1:09:48.271
Mary killed him.

1:09:48.445 --> 1:09:51.709
Father Hagan
committed suicide, Mr. Fenn.

1:09:51.883 --> 1:09:53.058
Bullshit.

1:09:54.842 --> 1:09:57.367
She will kill anyone
that tries to stop her.

1:09:57.541 --> 1:09:59.891
What do you
expect me to do, hmm?

1:10:00.065 --> 1:10:01.936
Call off the service?

1:10:02.110 --> 1:10:04.200
What service?

1:10:04.374 --> 1:10:05.984
The Lady spoke through Alice.

1:10:06.158 --> 1:10:08.465
She asked for a service
to be held at the shrine

1:10:08.639 --> 1:10:10.945
to celebrate the Feast
of the Immaculate Conception.

1:10:11.119 --> 1:10:13.034
Absolutely not.
You cannot go through with this.

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:16.124
She will claim the souls
of everyone who believes her.

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:20.259
Why? Why do you do this
to yourself, Mr. Fenn, hm?

1:10:20.433 --> 1:10:22.609
You have it all.

1:10:22.783 --> 1:10:26.874
Why do you want to blow up
your career all over again?

1:10:27.048 --> 1:10:29.007
Because it's the truth.

1:10:29.181 --> 1:10:32.663
And make no mistake about it,
I will tell the world.

1:10:32.837 --> 1:10:34.447
And who would believe you?

1:10:37.058 --> 1:10:40.540
No, the sisters won't let me
in to see her. Bishop's orders.

1:10:40.714 --> 1:10:42.238
Look, I am in
the diocese archives,

1:10:42.412 --> 1:10:44.936
and I think
I found something here.

1:10:45.110 --> 1:10:48.374
Uh, listen to this.
Mary's final confession.

1:10:48.548 --> 1:10:50.376
She was pregnant.

1:10:50.550 --> 1:10:53.379
Before she was captured,
Mary gave birth to a son.

1:10:53.553 --> 1:10:55.773
And that infant was claimed
by a local landowner.

1:10:55.947 --> 1:10:59.124
Um, all right, his name...

1:10:59.298 --> 1:11:00.865
Jesus.

1:11:01.039 --> 1:11:02.649
His name is Nicholas Pagett.

1:11:02.823 --> 1:11:04.085
Pagett?

1:11:05.348 --> 1:11:06.871
Yeah, Alice...

1:11:07.045 --> 1:11:08.525
Alice is Mary's descendant.

1:11:08.699 --> 1:11:10.135
And Mary made a pact
with the devil

1:11:10.309 --> 1:11:13.138
for eternal life and power.

1:11:13.312 --> 1:11:15.227
Um...

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:21.364
"I live through my children."

1:11:22.974 --> 1:11:24.758
Alice.

1:11:24.932 --> 1:11:26.847
She's gonna live
again through Alice.

1:11:27.021 --> 1:11:29.763
You're breaking up, Fenn. Hello?

1:12:59.462 --> 1:13:02.682
Now? Now do you believe me?

1:13:02.856 --> 1:13:05.250
Alice is Mary's descendant.

1:13:05.424 --> 1:13:07.557
Mary's pact with the devil.

1:13:07.731 --> 1:13:10.821
"I will live
through my children."

1:13:10.995 --> 1:13:12.910
Mary can only live
through her own bloodline.

1:13:14.912 --> 1:13:17.480
Alice is in danger.Everyone is in danger.

1:13:17.654 --> 1:13:19.220
Tonight's service.

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:23.311
All those people
praying to Mary,

1:13:23.486 --> 1:13:26.010
feeding her with their faith.

1:13:26.184 --> 1:13:28.882
Faith in evil empowers evil.

1:13:50.121 --> 1:13:52.079
Ah, gentlemen.

1:13:54.517 --> 1:13:57.476
I'd like you
to keep an eye out for this man.

1:13:58.608 --> 1:14:00.697
His name's Gerald Fenn.

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:02.916
He's a troublemaker.

1:14:03.090 --> 1:14:06.529
We don't want any,
uh, unnecessary incidents. Okay?

1:14:06.703 --> 1:14:07.704
Yes, sir.Understood.

1:14:07.878 --> 1:14:09.096
Thank you.

1:14:22.501 --> 1:14:25.504
NATALIE:
The bishop has Alice sequestered
till after the service.

1:14:25.678 --> 1:14:27.375
DELGARDE:
By then it will be too late.

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:29.116
According to the satanic rites,

1:14:29.290 --> 1:14:31.379
Mary will perform a mockery
of the Holy Trinity.

1:14:31.554 --> 1:14:34.774
She will call on the faithful
to pledge devotion three times.

1:14:34.948 --> 1:14:37.690
The third time,
she will take their souls

1:14:37.864 --> 1:14:40.214
and condemn them
to an eternity in hell.

1:14:50.442 --> 1:14:53.271
So after the choir
finishes the Angelus,

1:14:53.445 --> 1:14:55.012
I'll perform the supplications

1:14:55.186 --> 1:14:57.884
and the responsorial psalm,
and then you come up...

1:14:58.058 --> 1:15:00.496
:
Alice, it's time.

1:15:00.670 --> 1:15:02.889
You okay?

1:15:03.063 --> 1:15:05.588
Alice, you listening?

1:15:05.762 --> 1:15:07.459
Okay.

1:15:57.248 --> 1:15:59.032
My queen and my mother,

1:15:59.206 --> 1:16:01.905
I give myself entirely to you.

1:16:02.079 --> 1:16:04.864
And to show
my devotion to you...

1:16:05.038 --> 1:16:07.606
I consecrate to you this day

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:12.611
my eyes, my ears,
my mouth, my heart,

1:16:12.785 --> 1:16:15.527
my whole being without reserve.

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:19.052
Wherefore, good mother,
as I am your own,

1:16:19.226 --> 1:16:23.709
keep me and guard me
as your property and possession.

1:16:23.883 --> 1:16:24.884
Amen.

1:16:25.058 --> 1:16:26.364
ALL:
Amen.

1:16:33.371 --> 1:16:34.633
Let us pray.

1:16:37.549 --> 1:16:39.551
DELGARDE:
This ritual is our last hope.

1:16:39.725 --> 1:16:41.248
I will use the kern baby,

1:16:41.422 --> 1:16:43.816
imprison her soul
like they did in the past.

1:16:43.990 --> 1:16:46.340
It's my fault.

1:16:46.514 --> 1:16:49.735
I broke that thing.
I released Mary. I--

1:16:49.909 --> 1:16:51.345
I was trying to beef up

1:16:51.519 --> 1:16:53.347
what I thought
was a ridiculous story.

1:16:53.521 --> 1:16:56.699
You never told me that.I-- I tried. I wanted to--

1:16:56.873 --> 1:17:00.964
God always offers
an opportunity for redemption.

1:17:01.138 --> 1:17:05.838
He often chooses a sinner
to serve his divine purpose.

1:17:06.012 --> 1:17:08.188
Wait, are you saying
that God chose me?

1:17:08.362 --> 1:17:11.322
I'm saying our Lord works
in mysterious ways.

1:17:13.367 --> 1:17:16.414
Some more mysterious
than others.

1:17:16.588 --> 1:17:19.896
This calls
for the blessing of a bishop...

1:17:20.070 --> 1:17:24.248
or, in a pinch, a monsignor.

1:17:24.422 --> 1:17:28.774
Next, the wax
must be sealed by holy fire.

1:17:28.948 --> 1:17:31.864
This flame signifies
the presence of the living God.

1:17:54.191 --> 1:17:55.409
DELGARDE:
Get back.

1:18:02.808 --> 1:18:04.592
Oh, no!

1:18:04.767 --> 1:18:07.944
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:26.223
Oh, we can't stop Mary
without Delgarde.

1:18:26.397 --> 1:18:28.399
Look at all these people
praying to her.

1:18:28.573 --> 1:18:31.097
She's feeding off their faith,
growing stronger.

1:18:32.838 --> 1:18:33.883
What destroys faith?

1:18:36.102 --> 1:18:37.190
Doubt.

1:18:37.364 --> 1:18:38.278
Doubt weakens faith.

1:18:38.452 --> 1:18:39.627
Doubt leads to damnation.

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:43.631
If we can get those people
to stop believing in Mary,

1:18:43.806 --> 1:18:45.155
we can take away her power.

1:18:47.331 --> 1:18:51.248
God, the father of heaven,
have mercy on us.

1:18:51.422 --> 1:18:54.294
Lord, have mercy.ALL: Lord, have mercy.

1:18:54.468 --> 1:18:58.211
God, the son, the redeemer,
have mercy on us.

1:18:58.385 --> 1:19:01.388
Christ, have mercy.ALL: Christ, have mercy.

1:19:01.562 --> 1:19:05.131
God, the holy spirit,
have mercy on us.

1:19:05.305 --> 1:19:07.743
Lord, have mercy.ALL: Lord, have mercy.

1:19:07.917 --> 1:19:09.657
Amen.ALL: Amen.

1:19:13.444 --> 1:19:14.706
WOMAN 1:
Alice!

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:17.100
WOMAN 2:
Alice!

1:19:17.274 --> 1:19:19.363
MAN: Alice!WOMAN 3: Alice. Bless us.

1:19:27.632 --> 1:19:30.548
She wants you
to pledge your faith to her.

1:19:30.722 --> 1:19:33.159
Let her into your hearts.
Pray to her.

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:36.119
Pray to our Lady of Banfield.

1:19:41.646 --> 1:19:42.473
Hail, Mary.

1:19:44.257 --> 1:19:46.782
You are the undying spirit.

1:19:46.956 --> 1:19:49.741
The eternal, the all-powerful.

1:19:51.134 --> 1:19:53.527
Hail, Mary of Banfield.

1:19:53.701 --> 1:19:55.399
ALL:
Hail, Mary of Banfield.

1:19:55.573 --> 1:19:57.749
We pledge our hearts to you.

1:19:57.923 --> 1:20:00.273
We vow our everlasting devotion.

1:20:01.884 --> 1:20:04.625
Our souls are at your mercy.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:06.932
Hail, Mary of Banfield.

1:20:07.106 --> 1:20:09.282
ALL:
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:09.456 --> 1:20:11.719
In one voice we call to you.

1:20:11.894 --> 1:20:13.243
Come to us.

1:20:13.417 --> 1:20:16.376
Heal our pain,
relieve our suffering.

1:20:16.550 --> 1:20:17.943
Lead us!

1:20:18.117 --> 1:20:19.815
:
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:19.989 --> 1:20:22.121
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:22.295 --> 1:20:24.820
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:24.994 --> 1:20:26.038
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:26.212 --> 1:20:28.824
Hail, Mary of Banfield!

1:20:28.998 --> 1:20:31.696
:
Now, Alice. Now is the time.

1:20:35.656 --> 1:20:38.659
Do you offer your souls to Mary?

1:20:38.834 --> 1:20:40.096
ALL:
Yes!

1:20:41.662 --> 1:20:43.012
It's all a lie.

1:20:45.884 --> 1:20:47.886
I faked the miracles.

1:20:48.060 --> 1:20:49.757
Fenn.GERRY: Listen to me.

1:20:49.932 --> 1:20:52.369
Do you offer your souls to Mary?

1:20:52.543 --> 1:20:53.979
ALL:
Yes!

1:20:55.502 --> 1:20:56.852
Come on.

1:20:58.114 --> 1:21:00.029
Alice! Alice!

1:21:00.203 --> 1:21:02.248
MARY:
One more time, Alice.

1:21:05.773 --> 1:21:09.299
Do you offer your souls to--

1:21:11.431 --> 1:21:15.348
Alice! Mary is not
who you think she is.

1:21:15.522 --> 1:21:17.785
She is deceiving you.

1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:19.787
The miracles are false.CROWD: Boo!

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:24.705
There's no Mary.
There never was.

1:21:26.882 --> 1:21:27.970
No!

1:21:31.843 --> 1:21:32.931
Let him speak.

1:21:38.806 --> 1:21:40.025
Let him be.

1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:43.289
Go ahead, Mr. Fenn.

1:21:45.204 --> 1:21:47.815
I fabricated the entire story.
I made it up.

1:21:49.643 --> 1:21:50.949
MARY:
Lies!

1:21:52.908 --> 1:21:55.171
Mary healed me.

1:21:55.345 --> 1:21:58.652
Alice, I am so sorry.

1:22:00.567 --> 1:22:02.830
Your illness,
it resolved on its own.

1:22:03.005 --> 1:22:05.224
She cured my boy.

1:22:07.618 --> 1:22:09.098
It's called the placebo effect.

1:22:11.143 --> 1:22:12.971
Your boy...

1:22:13.145 --> 1:22:15.495
Your boy believed he could walk.

1:22:15.669 --> 1:22:16.801
And he did.

1:22:17.933 --> 1:22:20.936
Father Hagan raised you.

1:22:21.110 --> 1:22:22.720
He loved you.

1:22:22.894 --> 1:22:24.809
He was your family.

1:22:24.983 --> 1:22:26.854
She killed him.

1:22:27.029 --> 1:22:29.074
I am Mary.

1:22:29.248 --> 1:22:32.643
You prayed to me,
and I listened.

1:22:32.817 --> 1:22:34.036
Father Hagan...

1:22:38.692 --> 1:22:40.868
You asked me to hush it up,
to cover it up, and I did.

1:22:41.043 --> 1:22:42.740
You can't believe this man.

1:22:42.914 --> 1:22:44.829
He's a blasphemer.

1:22:45.003 --> 1:22:46.657
An atheist.

1:22:46.831 --> 1:22:49.877
Mary has been using you.

1:22:50.052 --> 1:22:51.270
Trust me.

1:22:51.444 --> 1:22:53.446
I need you to trust me.

1:22:54.795 --> 1:22:55.840
Fight her!

1:22:58.930 --> 1:23:00.453
It was all me.

1:23:02.586 --> 1:23:04.762
I made it all up for a story.

1:23:09.593 --> 1:23:12.422
Just... let me
ask you something.

1:23:12.596 --> 1:23:15.903
Tell me, what is easier
for you to believe, that--

1:23:16.078 --> 1:23:18.906
That an unscrupulous journalist
created a hoax or that--

1:23:20.473 --> 1:23:23.128
Or that God himself

1:23:23.302 --> 1:23:25.826
reached down and touched...

1:23:38.448 --> 1:23:41.190
Alice. Trust me.

1:23:41.364 --> 1:23:44.019
You have to stop these people
from believing in her.

1:23:45.977 --> 1:23:50.808
Fight her.MARY: Alice, listen to me.

1:23:50.982 --> 1:23:53.506
Finish the prayer.

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:57.293
They must pledge
their souls to me

1:23:57.467 --> 1:24:02.515
or you will never speak again.

1:24:04.561 --> 1:24:06.432
Mr. Fenn is telling the truth.

1:24:06.606 --> 1:24:08.130
What?

1:24:13.831 --> 1:24:14.875
Mary isn't real.

1:24:17.052 --> 1:24:18.575
Son of a bitch.

1:24:23.754 --> 1:24:24.668
WOMAN:
She lied!

1:24:29.847 --> 1:24:31.588
MAN 1:
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

1:24:31.762 --> 1:24:33.329
MAN 2:
It's all a fake!

1:25:03.576 --> 1:25:05.274
My legs!SOPHIA: Toby!

1:25:05.448 --> 1:25:06.971
I can't move my legs.DAN: Toby!

1:25:11.497 --> 1:25:12.542
SECURITY:
Move! Get out!

1:26:10.730 --> 1:26:12.079
What in God's name?

1:27:08.048 --> 1:27:09.659
Fenn!

1:27:13.837 --> 1:27:15.578
No!

1:27:44.694 --> 1:27:46.565
Alice was your only descendent.

1:27:50.134 --> 1:27:51.527
You will never live again.

1:28:15.290 --> 1:28:17.292
Alice. Alice.

1:28:32.524 --> 1:28:33.699
All right, look.

1:28:36.223 --> 1:28:38.748
We both know that
I'm not really good at this.

1:28:40.402 --> 1:28:45.232
But, Alice, she, uh...

1:28:45.407 --> 1:28:48.192
She sacrificed herself for me.

1:28:55.025 --> 1:28:57.375
Please, God.

1:28:57.549 --> 1:29:00.378
Just... Just let her live.

1:29:01.423 --> 1:29:02.380
Please.

1:29:15.785 --> 1:29:17.656
Hey! Hi.

1:29:28.406 --> 1:29:30.452
You can't hear me?

1:29:34.107 --> 1:29:37.546
I have never said anything
worth hearing my whole life.

1:29:42.464 --> 1:29:43.987
Thank you.

1:30:53.926 --> 1:30:55.537
He, um...

1:30:55.711 --> 1:30:58.670
He was a good man, Alice.

1:30:58.844 --> 1:31:02.718
I have no doubt
that he is watching over you.

1:31:06.330 --> 1:31:07.374
How do I know?

1:31:09.202 --> 1:31:10.247
Faith.

1:31:17.559 --> 1:31:18.603
I've been practicing.

1:31:21.388 --> 1:31:24.043
Well, I heard the, uh--
The local paper's hiring.

1:31:25.915 --> 1:31:27.612
Pretty sure
no one's gonna hire me

1:31:30.180 --> 1:31:32.443
Well, I didn't say anything
about journalism.

1:31:32.617 --> 1:31:34.489
It's more like
local zoning laws

1:31:34.663 --> 1:31:36.273
and the Farmers' Almanac.

1:31:38.318 --> 1:31:40.146
You can think about it.Okay.

1:31:42.192 --> 1:31:43.149
Hey.

1:31:44.934 --> 1:31:46.892
There was no pulse.

1:31:47.066 --> 1:31:50.200
She wasn't breathing.
She was gone.

1:31:52.463 --> 1:31:54.465
Maybe God was present after all.
