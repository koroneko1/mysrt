1
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,375
Butr,

2
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,583
wanna dive into the TV?

3
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,083
Yes. Well done.

4
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,708
Come on, Butr!

5
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,333
You wanna fight?

6
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,375
-You wanna fight?
-You wanna fight?

7
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,875
Splash!

8
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,416
Draw a circle first.

9
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,541
Slowly…

10
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,750
Good job.

11
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,375
This one doesn't look good.
Try again.

12
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,333
Yuke, don't plug in the cell phone here.

13
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,750
Its radiation can affect
your brain while sleeping.

14
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,625
We haven't slept yet.

15
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,041
Don't forget to put it away
before you sleep. It's harmful.

16
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,541
Yes, Mr. Daddy.

17
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,666
Papi is Daddy's son.

18
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,375
You smart-mouth.

19
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,916
Why don't we drive a car like others?

20
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,250
It's fine.

21
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,833
Your dad's car is so cool. Can I try?

22
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,666
Quick! Get on!

23
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,083
Are you guys sure?

24
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,875
Let's go!

25
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,458
I heard this morning that the same-sex
marriage bill is about to be passed.

26
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,958
Really?

27
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,375
Great. Everything will be easier.

28
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,833
Except me. I'm not easy.

29
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,125
You always come back to yourself.

30
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,791
Shall we register our marriage?

31
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:20,916
Sure!

32
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
I'm so glad, you know?

33
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,291
Butr will finally become
my adopted son as well.

34
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,916
I'm so excited.

35
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,791
Me too.

36
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,500
So glad and excited.

37
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,125
It's like we're getting married again.

38
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,416
Do you think about having a child?

39
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,041
He lost a tooth.

40
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,541
You've just lost the first baby tooth?

41
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,291
You've become a big boy now!
Did it hurt?

42
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:21,958
It's all right.

43
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,166
Yuke,

44
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,000
the school sent us an invitation to join
the Mother's Day event this Monday.

45
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,708
They send this kind of letter
to students' houses these days?

46
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,208
But I have no mother.

47
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,541
Well, I'll go for you.

48
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,708
They invited 'Mother', not 'Father'.

49
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,375
That's true.

50
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,166
But you have two fathers.

51
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,916
You have Papi and Daddy.

52
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,916
You love Papi.

53
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,500
Papi also loves you.

54
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,500
You love Daddy. Daddy loves you too.

55
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,750
And that's even more special than others.

56
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,166
Not many people have two fathers, right?

57
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,125
-Yes, Mom?
-Is that Grandma?

58
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,916
I wanna see her.

59
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,583
They didn't register their marriage.

60
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,833
When the girl's family
didn't let Tul register as father,

61
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,750
it turns out
that he has no right to his son.

62
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,750
As Dad said,

63
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,791
if the DNA profiling
proves his fatherhood,

64
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,416
it may help in some way.

65
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,166
How about consulting a lawyer?
I'll ask Phoon to help.

66
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,458
Okay, If the bill is passed,

67
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,041
you'd better get it done
to prevent problems.

68
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,458
I am concerned.

69
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,750
How about Butr? Is he fine?

70
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,708
Yes, Mom.

71
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,958
If it's passed, everything will be okay.

72
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,166
I'll take Butr to visit you then.

73
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,416
And don't think too much. Tell Dad, too.

74
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,416
Okay, I'll try.

75
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,791
Take care of yourself.

76
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,791
I will.

77
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:39,250
A mother possesses great kindness

78
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:46,500
She takes care of us
Since we're babies

79
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,166
She stays around

80
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:59,291
Singing lullabies until we fall asleep

81
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:06,125
From little to grown-up
She has nurtured us

82
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:12,750
She works tirelessly to show us
Her pure and true love

83
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,583
We have become who we are

84
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:25,458
Because of none other
Than the mother's milk

85
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,916
WE LOVE MOM

86
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,666
You came on behalf of your wife,
didn't you?

87
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,166
So did I.

88
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,250
My wife just gave birth
to a new child yesterday.

89
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,250
That's why she isn't here.

90
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,833
I see.

91
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42,625
His mom must be busy, huh?

92
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:49,541
Well, his mother left when he was a baby.

93
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,541
Oh... I'm sorry to hear that.

94
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,083
It's all right.

95
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,000
Did you finish your lunch, my handsome?

96
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,916
I'll come to pick you up
after the afternoon class.

97
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,541
What is this stain?

98
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,083
Butr, why don't you put
your mother on the card?

99
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,875
But you put two fathers.

100
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,041
It's a card for the Mother's Day.

101
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,833
Because I'm more special than anyone.

102
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,833
How? I don’t talk to boys who brag.

103
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,041
I'm not bragging.

104
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,166
Everyone, stand up.

105
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:53,708
Thank you, teacher.

106
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,833
Hey, Butr. Let's play soccer this evening.

107
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,833
He can't play soccer.

108
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,750
The other day he missed every kick.
So funny.

109
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,750
Really?

110
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,500
Well, Butr! I heard you have
two fathers. Is that true?

111
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,250
Really? Without a mother,
how were you born?

112
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,583
Or your dad is a fag.

113
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,833
Let me go.

114
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,375
No way.

115
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,791
Does he know he was adopted
from an orphanage?

116
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,791
Not really.

117
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,083
We haven't seriously talked
about this with him.

118
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,208
We try to be both father
and mother to him.

119
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,291
I understand.

120
00:15:54,916 --> 00:16:00,500
But I'd like both of you to be careful
about what you tell your kid.

121
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,458
And please tell him to be calmer.

122
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,333
And for those kids,
we will discipline them.

123
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,166
I hope you don't mind.

124
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,250
But I do.

125
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,666
You know physical abuse is a crime.
That boy physically abused my son.

126
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,541
Mr. Sakchai, please calm down.

127
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,666
All of them are still kids.

128
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,166
I must apologize for my son.

129
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,333
Do you think your apology is enough?

130
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,375
Your son bullied my kid. That's terrible.

131
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,875
We have apologized!

132
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,166
Your son is also wrong.

133
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,666
And do you think
about apologizing in any way?

134
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,750
You must punish that boy anyway.

135
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,541
I wonder how that kid was raised.

136
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,083
As they say, gays are easily aggressive.

137
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,000
They want to have a child,
but don't know how to raise him properly.

138
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,125
Hey!

139
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,250
Mind your words.

140
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,708
Yuke!

141
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,291
Yuke…

142
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,208
You see?

143
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,291
I didn't even finish my sentence,
and he got aggressive.

144
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,750
It's solely their child's fault.

145
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,458
If that child has
to grow up with these gays,

146
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
what kind of person will he become?

147
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,583
And what kind of person are you?

148
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,416
You have a child, but please
learn how to be a good father.

149
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,625
Your son made fun of my kid first.

150
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,583
He was just kidding like any other child.

151
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,666
Who knows your son is…

152
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,166
abnormal?

153
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,041
Actually, you have to blame yourselves

154
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,833
for being abnormal
and adopting an abnormal kid.

155
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,333
That's why everything
is even more abnormal.

156
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,208
I think that the abnormal ones
are those who think others are abnormal.

157
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,916
Hey!

158
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
You're a teacher! How could you say that?

159
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,750
You should be neutral.

160
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,041
And how did you say that?

161
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,416
You should be a role model for your kid.

162
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,083
Watch your mouth,

163
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,250
or I'll take action on you too.

164
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,583
Being a father is easy.

165
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,041
Anyone could say he's a good father.

166
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,583
I hope you succeed in raising your kid.

167
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,291
Butr,

168
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,125
What's the matter?

169
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,208
You can tell Papi and Daddy.

170
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,250
What does my mom look like?
I want to have a mother.

171
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,416
Butr, listen to me.

172
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,166
It's not only you in the world
who doesn't have a mother.

173
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,625
I don't either.

174
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,166
My mother passed away.

175
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:48,916
And there are so many
who lost their mother since birth.

176
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,416
But they know
what their mother looks like,

177
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,000
unlike me.

178
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,416
I have no mother,
and I even have two fathers.

179
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,250
Don't you want to have Papi and Daddy?

180
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,750
Do you want to live with someone else
who has never taken care of you?

181
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:11,916
No, I love Papi and Daddy.

182
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,833
I don't wanna go anywhere.

183
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,500
Daddy and Papi love you so much, too.

184
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,708
Can you play soccer?

185
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,291
Well, quite a bit.

186
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,333
Can you teach me tomorrow?

187
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
Fine, but maybe on Saturday.

188
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,250
Come get it. Here it is.

189
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,041
Hello.

190
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,708
This is Ms. Rattiya, the director of the
Children's Rights Protection Organization.

191
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,458
To save time, let's get to the point.

192
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,250
I was informed by Mr. Sakchai

193
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:59,208
that an adopted child in this house has
been raised in an environment that's...

194
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,708
So I am concerned,

195
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,833
and afraid that the kid
will feel different.

196
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,833
He may feel unhappy,

197
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:16,750
and become aggressive or even depressed.

198
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,208
Well, Ms. Rattiya.

199
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,833
I think Mr. Sakchai is too prejudiced.

200
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,666
Some children are born from love,
others from just sexual desire.

201
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,041
But, that's not so important
as long as they grow up in a warm family.

202
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,083
How could you indicate
which family is warm?

203
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,458
Because we didn't adopt him from desire.

204
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,666
My boyfriend and I adopted him
because of our love.

205
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,166
I'm confident that our love is no less

206
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,000
than that of any male-female couple.

207
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,500
Yes,

208
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,541
and the same-sex marriage bill
is about to be passed.

209
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,583
I believe that this bill will make
society more open to our relationship,

210
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,291
and have a better understanding
of our son and family.

211
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,083
I understand.

212
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,250
But even if you are accepted by the law,
the society may not be that open.

213
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,958
Children are brought up
by their society, not by the law.

214
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,750
Many people, including myself,
appreciate your love.

215
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
But when we talk about family,

216
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,166
we can't speak just for the sake
of an individual.

217
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,000
Whether they're adopted or not,

218
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:38,125
they should have the right to grow up in
the same environment as ordinary people.

219
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,750
And what about his real mother?

220
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,291
We have no idea.

221
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,583
We just know that
he was abandoned at the orphanage

222
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,958
when he was just a few days old.

223
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:59,875
And the orphanage hasn't heard
from his mother since then.

224
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:06,125
Fortunately, I applied
for an adoption at the time.

225
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,541
I brought him after my qualifications
were approved.

226
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,958
Considering your house,
I don't doubt your qualifications.

227
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,916
But you probably don't want your son

228
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,708
to have a shortcoming
and feel isolated, do you?

229
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,083
Do you mind if I talk with your son?

230
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,125
And do you mind if I do?

231
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,166
How can we trust you?

232
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,958
What's your son's name?

233
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,333
Your house is cozy, Butr.

234
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,500
Who do you live with?

235
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,708
Just Papi, Daddy, and me.

236
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:01,000
I see. And what do Papi and Daddy mean?

237
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,625
Father.

238
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,208
And what's the difference
between Papi and Daddy?

239
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,041
Papi is Daddy's son,

240
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,666
because Daddy often reprimands Papi.

241
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,500
Do you have a mother?

242
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,541
No… I don't.

243
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:32,083
So we are the same.

244
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,833
And do you have Papi and Daddy?

245
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,583
I don't have a Papi and Daddy either.

246
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't have a father.

247
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,375
Poor you!

248
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,291
What's the difference
between a mother and a father?

249
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:05,416
A father and mother are what
we have had since we were born.

250
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,458
How were we born?

251
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,375
I have two fathers.

252
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:18,416
And how are they related?

253
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:22,583
My friends say my fathers are queers.

254
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,916
There is no right or wrong
way to raise a child.

255
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,750
But there is absolutely no easy way.

256
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,208
I understand.

257
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,375
I kind of hate her.

258
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,583
Butr will have school holidays next week.

259
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,125
How about taking a trip?

260
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,208
-Where do you wanna go?
-I wanna go to a beach.

261
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,625
Let's go…

262
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,708
to a beach

263
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,291
What is this?

264
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:44,833
Thank you very much.

265
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,125
Thank you very much. Thank you.

266
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,291
Yes, thank you.

267
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,625
Butr!

268
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,166
What are you doing?

269
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:34,083
Let's go boating.

270
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,416
Papi, stop here.

271
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,000
Why?

272
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,583
I'm a big boy now.

273
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,791
I'm afraid my friends
will call me a little baby.

274
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,875
What's the matter with him?

275
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,875
If I'd driven more carefully,

276
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,500
we wouldn't have lost our son.

277
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,041
It was just an accident, Tiw.

278
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,458
No one ever wanted it to happen.

279
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,125
I just wish it was just a dream

280
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,708
and I would wake up soon.

281
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,833
It's been more than a year, Nan.

282
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,083
Hello.

283
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,666
Nan, someone's calling you.

284
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,416
Just a moment, please.

285
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,000
Hello.

286
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:30,041
I'm sorry.

287
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,625
You don't need to say sorry to me.

288
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,750
You didn't leave me at the orphanage.

289
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,625
I was in the final year at university.

290
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,500
And because I got pregnant,
I had to drop out.

291
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,625
That man didn't even care.
He didn't take any responsibility.

292
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:54,500
I didn't even dare to tell my parents.

293
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,208
I was so scared and not ready then.

294
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:14,958
And how is he now?

295
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:21,000
Now he has good fathers,

296
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,625
but every kid needs a mother.

297
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,458
I'm sorry. It could be my karma.

298
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,125
I had a new baby boy,

299
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,416
but he's gone.

300
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,500
Would you like to see him?

301
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,708
Rattiya is really meddlesome.

302
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:10,541
So much.

303
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,041
Just ignore her.

304
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:14,791
He is your son by law anyway.

305
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:20,000
But that woman might be his birth mother.

306
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,291
But we've raised him.

307
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:25,625
If she takes legal action against us,

308
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,083
we will win by all means
because she abandoned him.

309
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,666
By law, yes.

310
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:36,166
But law cannot be applied to everything,

311
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,166
especially when it comes to feelings.

312
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,791
Then don't let her see our son.

313
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,750
That might be the way.

314
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:52,583
Anyway, we should go tomorrow
and see what they have to say.

315
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,666
I'm sorry.

316
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,708
I know I was a bad mother.

317
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:28,125
Actually, just knowing that he is happy,
I'm already glad.

318
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,375
But now that I know he wants
to have a mother, I feel so guilty.

319
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,125
Knowing he wants to see me,

320
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,250
I feel even worse.

321
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:55,833
I just want to see him and make up
for what I did.

322
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,166
Without a mother, Butr is already pitiful.

323
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:04,125
Do you want him to know
that his own mother abandoned him?

324
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,875
You left him,

325
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:12,000
and now you wanna see him
when you want.

326
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,833
Don't you think
you're a little too selfish?

327
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:24,166
I must apologize
for my wife's selfishness.

328
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,500
But I believe your beloved son
somehow wants to see his own mother.

329
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,041
Mr. Phoon, Mr. Yuke,

330
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:46,791
though Butr is Mr. Phoon's
adopted son by law,

331
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:52,958
or even if the same-sex marriage
bill is passed;

332
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,250
a same-sex couple
can't have a baby by nature.

333
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,625
It is obvious that your son
is having a problem.

334
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:09,916
If you really love your son,
you should give him a chance.

335
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,458
Perhaps the boy
doesn't want something special,

336
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,708
just the same things as his friends.

337
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,958
What's next?

338
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,041
Phoon…

339
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,333
Just let him spend time with his mom,

340
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,208
a week or two,

341
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,458
then come back to stay with you.

342
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:43,083
I believe it will help fulfill
what he longs for.

343
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,666
This is clearly selfish.

344
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,625
You'd better be more generous.

345
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,041
And this is your son we're talking about.

346
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,750
He just wants to have a mother.

347
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,583
Not every orphan is lucky
enough to find his birth mother.

348
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:13,750
And how could I be sure you
won't abandon him again?

349
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:23,666
Losing my little kid
is more than enough already.

350
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,958
I just want to see him

351
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,875
to make up for what I had done.

352
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:44,458
How would you explain how he was born?

353
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:49,708
He will learn from school when it's time.
And he'll understand.

354
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,333
And how would you describe
your relationship?

355
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,666
Being homosexual is not wrong.

356
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:10,083
But if there are choices,

357
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,416
I believe no one
would want a kid to be gay.

358
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,833
I think, deep inside,
you are also afraid, aren't you?

359
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,666
Yes?

360
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,416
Yes, yes. I'll be there.

361
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,625
You don't need to come.

362
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,166
I'm all right.

363
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,000
Your friend told me you fell down.

364
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,791
I was just dancing as usual.

365
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,416
Falling down when dancing is normal.

366
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,166
You have to be more careful.

367
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:11,500
No wonder why Mom left.

368
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:13,750
Yes,

369
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,541
I was too late.

370
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,875
Unlike both of you.

371
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,875
He is just worried about you.

372
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,708
Take good care of yourself, though.

373
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:28,375
It's like you're not accustomed to me.

374
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,416
I raised you.

375
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,541
Sometimes, being accustomed is harmful.

376
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,458
It makes us unprepared.

377
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,666
Just use protection.

378
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,000
You're over 30 now.

379
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm not talking about that.

380
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:48,208
I know, you're talking about Butr.

381
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:55,583
I'm sorry for what I am.

382
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:02,250
I feel guilty about you and also your mom.

383
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:10,291
I'm sorry for being the main reason
that you became like me.

384
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,833
But what can I do?

385
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:19,000
I've tried not to chitchat with Butr,

386
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,833
because I know you're afraid. So am I.

387
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:35,125
Go… I'm going to sleep.

388
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,750
Just go.

389
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,708
Goodnight, Dad.

390
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,583
Turn off the light.

391
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,750
Thank you.

392
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:45,875
I did it for my son.

393
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,500
He's easygoing, isn't he?

394
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,000
Of course. He wants to have a mother.

395
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,750
I meant to make you feel okay

396
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:16,916
that our son is friendly
and can understand things easily.

397
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,750
I hope so,

398
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:26,791
because I'm not sure
if I'm right or wrong.

399
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:41,000
At first, I didn't agree
with you letting them in.

400
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,666
But when I see him smile,

401
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,416
my prejudice is gone.

402
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,000
Because we are his fathers.

403
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,208
Butr,

404
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:27,750
let's take a shower together.

405
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:31,250
No, I'm grown now!

406
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,208
What's the matter?

407
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,458
Butr might come in.

408
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,166
He's sleeping.

409
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,750
Don't you notice
that he's acting strangely?

410
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:48,416
Is that because of that family?

411
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:53,291
He's been strange
since we came back from the beach.

412
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:58,291
He doesn't let us go into the school
or have a shower with him.

413
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,500
Are you too worried?

414
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:11,791
Kids at this age normally think
they are grown up.

415
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:15,541
Exactly. The more he grows,
the more careful we have to be.

416
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,083
We'll be in trouble if he comes in.

417
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,791
Last time, he found the lube in the bag.

418
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,208
I'm worried.

419
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:30,458
He just gets naughtier as he grows up.

420
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:41,041
But I'm certainly naughtier.

421
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,208
Shall we try to behave
like we are friends?

422
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,750
He probably understands
we are his fathers.

423
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,958
But he doesn't understand
our relationship.

424
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:58,458
What do you mean?

425
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,166
Like…

426
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,333
if we behave like friends or brothers,

427
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
it might be easier
for him to understand us.

428
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,333
What about the registration?

429
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,958
I'm also worried about this.

430
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:25,250
If we register our marriage,
society will know.

431
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,125
Butr's official documents will
be visible for the rest of his life.

432
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,583
I think we'd better postpone it.

433
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,000
It's not too late to do it
after we consider it carefully.

434
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,000
Also,

435
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:46,208
same-sex love is not all about
marriage registration.

436
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,375
It's more important
to understand each other.

437
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,916
There are a lot of normal couples
who don't register their marriage.

438
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,583
Like Tul and his girlfriend?

439
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:05,458
The girl's family took the kid away

440
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,333
and doesn't even allow Tul
to register himself as father.

441
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,708
Now Tul has no right to his son
and wastes time suing his girlfriend,

442
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,583
even though they're a normal couple.

443
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:35,333
Right now only you have the right to Butr.

444
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,250
If something unexpected happened,

445
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,375
I would become someone
without a legal relationship to Butr.

446
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:43,750
I understand,

447
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,291
but… Yuke!

448
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:48,875
Yuke!

449
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:21,791
What are you doing?

450
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,250
Don't you have your own?

451
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,833
Butr touched mine first.

452
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,250
Butr touched mine, too.

453
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,500
Mine too.

454
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,083
Can I stay here?

455
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,000
You said you wanted
to have a mother, didn't you?

456
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,458
I wanna have a mother,

457
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:55,250
but I don't want to leave Papi and Daddy.

458
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,500
If I did something wrong, I'm sorry.

459
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,458
Phoon…

460
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:11,083
Papi, help me.

461
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,166
Phoon... No.

462
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:24,250
You become stubborn again.
Why is it so hard to please you?

463
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,541
We've tried to be both father
and mother for you,

464
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,500
but you still wanna have a mother.

465
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,541
You found you own mother,
but you don't wanna go with her.

466
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:38,666
What should I do to please you?

467
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,375
I'm sorry.

468
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,041
I'm guilty.

469
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,125
I don't want anything.

470
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,708
I don't wanna go.

471
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,125
Are you sure you wanna do this?

472
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,666
You're hurting our family.

473
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:21,625
All of us will only regret it.

474
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,083
I don't want to confuse him.

475
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,375
I know it hurts to heal the wound,

476
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,500
but it's better than waiting
until it's too late.

477
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,083
Well said!

478
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,708
-Don't you love him?
-I do.

479
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,250
I don't want him to be a problem child.

480
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,875
A problem child, or your problem?

481
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:51,458
What do you mean?

482
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,833
I'm acting for our son

483
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:57,000
and trying to sustain our family.

484
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,791
For him or for yourself?

485
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:02,166
And most importantly,

486
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,500
this is our family.

487
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,833
Aren't you afraid
that he’ll become gay like us?

488
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:14,291
Don't put your weakness on him.

489
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,000
I won't let him go anywhere.

490
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:20,666
But he is my son.

491
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,583
That's right.

492
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:32,083
Butr is a son only to you.

493
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:40,666
What about my love for Butr?
Is it nothing to you?

494
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,583
Daddy doesn't love me now?

495
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,666
He does.

496
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:17,541
But probably too much.

497
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,625
What do you mean?
Too much? I don't understand.

498
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,416
Let's sleep.

499
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,666
You have to get up early tomorrow.

500
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:46,041
I don't want to sleep
if I have to wake up and leave.

501
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:50,500
I've never slept anywhere else
without Papi and Daddy.

502
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:54,541
I'm scared. I know I'll miss you.

503
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,458
So am I.

504
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,833
Shall we run away and live with grandma?

505
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,541
How were we born?

506
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:29,208
We were born from the love
of a man and a woman.

507
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:34,541
And when they have a baby,
they become father and mother.

508
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,083
So, you have two fathers, don't you?

509
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,208
Or your dad is a fag?

510
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,458
What do you like to eat, Butr?

511
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,125
I like fried chicken.

512
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:59,041
Good. I'm good at frying chicken.

513
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:03,750
Your Papi and Daddy told me
you wanted to play soccer.

514
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,166
How about getting some soccer uniforms?

515
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,416
And how about learning soccer
with Uncle Tiw?

516
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,250
He was a soccer player at school.

517
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,041
Really?

518
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,583
Yes.

519
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,250
But today, let's go
to the countryside first.

520
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,666
Okay.

521
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,625
What?

522
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,041
Are you pregnant?

523
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,125
How did you come in?

524
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:32,708
Why didn't you ask for permission?

525
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:40,458
You put your nose in our business
without asking for permission, too.

526
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,500
That's because I felt sympathetic.

527
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:47,625
You didn't have to.

528
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,000
Just don't see us as abnormal ones.
That's enough.

529
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,708
I just tried to solve the problem instead.

530
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:08,375
I insist that I truly understand him.

531
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,708
You don't have to understand everything,

532
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,166
especially others' business.

533
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,875
You try to be a looking glass
reflecting others' sufferings,

534
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,458
but never look at your meddling self.

535
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,958
Daddy is busy.

536
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,791
I love you, too.

537
01:02:41,708 --> 01:02:42,750
Sweet dreams.

538
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,333
Is that Butr?

539
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,416
How is he?

540
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,375
You said he is your son.

541
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,083
Call him if you want to know.

542
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,791
-You missed!
-Tag him!

543
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,041
Help me.

544
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:26,541
Help.

545
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,208
Here's your backpack.

546
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,875
Good boy. Let's go.

547
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:18,541
Butr, don't your Papi and Daddy
bring you here these days?

548
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,541
My mom brought me!
Her boyfriend drove for me.

549
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,541
Haven't you taken a shower yet, Tiw?

550
01:04:44,916 --> 01:04:46,041
Neither have you.

551
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:52,791
Are you okay?

552
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,500
I miss our son.

553
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,750
I miss him too.

554
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:22,041
But we're still lucky that we have Butr.

555
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:25,708
Hello.

556
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,750
What? It's due in two days, isn't it?

557
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:40,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

558
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:41,875
I thought it's Wednesday.

559
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,708
I'll send it to you this evening.

560
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:18,166
Mr. Phoon,
Did you sign it in the wrong place?

561
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,750
This is for the other board member.

562
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,833
Oh, I'm really sorry.

563
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,708
Can you get me a new one?

564
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,208
Yes.

565
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:34,000
Thank you.

566
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:59,041
Hello.

567
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,583
Yes, Mr. Phoon.

568
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,625
How is Butr doing?

569
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,833
He's fine.

570
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,583
He is well-adjusted.

571
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,833
He's at school now.

572
01:08:10,583 --> 01:08:12,250
Do you want to talk with him?

573
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,750
I'll tell him
to call you back this evening.

574
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,541
That's fine.

575
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:19,625
Thank you.

576
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:43,791
THE BIBLE OF X

577
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,041
Hey class,
do you know what next Monday is?

578
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,500
It's Father's Day.

579
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:54,375
That's correct.

580
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:58,875
So today, let's make a card
for Father's day.

581
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:00,916
Here you are.

582
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,250
Yours.

583
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,083
Good.

584
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:06,833
And yours.

585
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:08,708
That's right.

586
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:09,875
This is yours.

587
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,750
Here you go.

588
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:16,375
Go ahead.

589
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,333
Yes.

590
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:11,458
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected.

591
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:56,708
Butr,

592
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:00,000
I'll be right back.

593
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,791
What's wrong, Nan?

594
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:27,791
Nothing.

595
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:31,000
I just want to use the toilet.

596
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,833
Hey! Who was it?

597
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,083
I told you. A child is not like a puppy
that can be replaced.

598
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,500
But he's my son.

599
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:20,041
He's just curious like other boys.

600
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,958
If we teach and give him some time,
he might be better.

601
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:27,250
I have no idea
how that gay couple raised him.

602
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,875
So, do you still want
to register our marriage?

603
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,375
Nothing would change.

604
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:26,416
It will neither make me
become a true father

605
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,500
nor make you a good father.

606
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:31,833
Wait.

607
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,208
What do you mean?

608
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:38,250
Everything I've done has been for our son.

609
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:41,166
If you're so scared,

610
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,541
you shouldn't have adopted him
in the first place.

611
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,583
And what about this?

612
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:55,791
The invitation letter for Father's Day.

613
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,666
Why is it in the trash?

614
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,416
I was afraid that when you see it,

615
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:20,041
you would miss him
and wanna join the activity.

616
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,125
I just realized

617
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,375
that you're such a coward.

618
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:04,083
Missing him means
that we love him so much.

619
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,875
Letting him go with his mother

620
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,458
doesn't mean we're no longer his fathers.

621
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,500
Phoon! Phoon!

622
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:30,083
Phoon!

623
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,708
Phoon! Please don't.

624
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:34,083
Phoon! Stop! Don't act like this!

625
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:35,791
Phoon! Stop!

626
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:36,916
Phoon!

627
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:39,291
Phoon…

628
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,625
It was my fault.

629
01:22:01,916 --> 01:22:03,791
I made everything worse.

630
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,000
I never wanted to let him go.

631
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,916
But… I was scared.

632
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:48,291
It's the parents' responsibility
to raise their child,

633
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,208
not to choose.

634
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:05,833
Why didn't you bring me to my senses?

635
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,625
Do I have the right to?

636
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:25,291
I'm afraid you will say
he is your son again.

637
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:30,416
You know, I didn't dare to talk
about him again since then.

638
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,958
I'm sorry.

639
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,208
I am a coward.

640
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,791
I'm selfish.

641
01:23:57,916 --> 01:24:04,750
I don't care about
marriage registration now.

642
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:11,708
I realized that possession

643
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:16,625
is less important than
having a chance to take care of him.

644
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,333
I miss him.

645
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,375
So do I.

646
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,291
You know?
He was so sad that night.

647
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:55,750
He thought we didn't love him.

648
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:03,208
He even asked me to run away with him.

649
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,541
I feel like I ruined everything.

650
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,333
I'm sorry.

651
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:30,000
I'm ashamed.

652
01:25:34,458 --> 01:25:38,375
I don't even dare to see him.

653
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:46,791
We're still fine.

654
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:52,041
You are still his father by law.

655
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,083
Perhaps,

656
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,291
let's just be who we are

657
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,625
and let him be who he is.

658
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,041
That's enough.

659
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:18,625
I don't believe it's impossible for us to
take care of him on our own.

660
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:09,375
Butr…

661
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:14,833
It's been more than a week.
Are you happy to have me?

662
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:17,916
It's good.

663
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:23,583
Do you love me?

664
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:30,250
I don't know.

665
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:10,500
No love can replace another.

666
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,875
None.

667
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:25,166
I have two fathers.

668
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:29,291
How are Papi and Daddy
related to each other?

669
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:33,375
My friends said my fathers are queers.

670
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:35,958
It's nonsense.

671
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:40,000
Both of them are the ones
who love you the most.

672
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:42,750
How much do you love them?

673
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,333
The most in the world.

674
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,166
Why is that?

675
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,750
I don't know, but it's so much.

676
01:28:50,916 --> 01:28:52,041
Good.

677
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,875
I believe you can't imagine
how much you'll love your mom.

678
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:03,333
But for Papi and Daddy,
you don't need to imagine at all.

679
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:08,416
You can see and feel it every second.

680
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:11,291
You're luckier than I am, you know.

681
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:14,333
I grew up in an orphanage.

682
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:17,000
What does orphan mean?

683
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:22,458
It means a child without a mom and dad.

684
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:27,958
Ever since I could remember,
I had to admit that I have neither.

685
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:30,750
And what did you do?

686
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:36,916
It might be too difficult
for a kid like you.

687
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:42,375
But if you love what you have,
you'll have what you love.

688
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:14,625
Who… always see you through
When you are sad?

689
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:21,708
Who... always comfort you?

690
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:28,541
Who… love you
More than anything?

691
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:35,875
Their love is bigger than
The earth and sky

692
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:43,875
If the world was a pen
And the sky was paper

693
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:49,000
And the ocean was ink

694
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:53,041
Those wouldn't be
Enough to declare their love

695
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:59,250
Who… love you
As much as their lives?

696
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:06,625
Who… are always kind to you?

697
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:13,416
Who… love you unconditionally

698
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:19,000
With no ill intent?
An everlasting love

699
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,916
Who…?
