1
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,250
Mommy.

2
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,041
Mommy.

3
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,833
What is it, Xiao Le?

4
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,625
Poke! Got you.

5
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,375
Silly boy.

6
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,541
You little rascal. Where are you?

7
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,750
I'm coming to get you.

8
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,708
Xiao Le.

9
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,291
Xiao Le, come here.

10
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,416
Did you do this?

11
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,875
Answer me. Did you do this?

12
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,541
-Yes.
-Don't you have paper to draw on?

13
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,250
Why must you draw on the walls?

14
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,208
It was an accident.

15
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,458
An accident?

16
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,458
How was this an accident?

17
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,708
Why don't you just admit it?

18
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,708
It's all right, ma'am. I can clean it.

19
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,625
Go get the cane.

20
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,666
Go.

21
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,500
You know we just repainted the house,

22
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:48,083
and I've told you so many times
to be careful with your crayons.

23
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,625
Why don't you ever listen?

24
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Put your hand out.

25
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,250
Sir, do you want to eat now?

26
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,375
What about ma'am?

27
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:36,958
She didn't eat.

28
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,250
Later.

29
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,291
Okay, sir.

30
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,291
What's wrong?

31
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,500
I recognize this piece.

32
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,458
You know me well.

33
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,833
I know something's wrong
when you play this one.

34
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,708
What happened?

35
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,708
Just feeling guilty.

36
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,541
I caned Xiao Le earlier.

37
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why?

38
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,291
He drew on the staircase walls.

39
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,166
We just had them painted--

40
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,166
I know.

41
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,125
Where is he now?

42
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,000
In his room. He's probably still awake.

43
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,583
I'll go tuck him in.

44
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,583
No, let me.

45
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,583
You better eat. It's late.

46
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,208
Not sleepy yet?

47
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,833
Patches is hungry. He wants a bone.

48
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,250
He wants a bone, huh?

49
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,750
Here. A bone.

50
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,375
Better now?

51
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,291
I want to hear a story.

52
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,333
Now?

53
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,875
Yes. Read me a story?

54
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,541
Which one?

55
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
Hansel and Gretel.

56
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,583
Again?

57
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,208
Aren't you bored of it? I certainly am.

58
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,291
Wait.

59
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
Read from this page.

60
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,916
From here?

61
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,458
Okay.

62
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,583
"And so, Hansel and Gretel discovered,

63
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,625
their stepmother wanted to abandon them
in the forest.

64
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,291
Hansel quietly sneaked out of the house,

65
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:44,916
and gathered as many white pebbles
as he could.

66
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:51,375
The next day, as Hansel walked
with his family deep into the woods,

67
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,291
he laid a trail of white pebbles
along the way,

68
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:01,250
so that they could find
their way back home."

69
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,125
Mommy, if you didn't want me anymore,

70
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,708
would you abandon me in a forest, too?

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,958
Maybe.

72
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,291
Of course not, silly.

73
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,916
Mommy will never leave you.

74
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,000
Shall we go to bed now?

75
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,625
Come on, lie down.

76
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,458
Hold still.

77
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,333
Your grandmother used to say

78
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,791
that a birthday is an occasion
for new clothes and new shoes.

79
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,208
Keep them closed.

80
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,666
They are.

81
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,875
No peeking.

82
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,791
Okay.

83
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,375
Guess what Mommy and Daddy got you
for your birthday.

84
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,291
A dog?

85
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,708
There you go. Happy birthday, baby.

86
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,875
-What shall we call him?
-Patches.

87
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,916
Patches? You've already got a Patches.

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,208
That's right. Pick another name.

89
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,000
How about Mozart?

90
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,541
Mozart? Like Mommy's favorite composer?

91
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,166
Okay, Mozart it is.

92
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,333
Hold on, boy. Mozart.

93
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,791
Mozart! Wait for me!

94
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,291
The party's at 3:00. Don't be late.

95
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,208
I just have this one meeting,
and then I'll be home.

96
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,875
I won't be late.

97
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,708
Mozart.

98
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Xiao Le, don't run.

99
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,458
Your shoes.

100
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,458
-Nora.
-Yes, ma'am.

101
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,041
I have a headache.
I'm going upstairs to take a nap.

102
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,416
-Okay. Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

103
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,833
Where's the birthday boy?

104
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,250
Ma'am? Are you looking for Xiao Le?

105
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,166
Yes.

106
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,041
-He's over there.
-Okay. Thank you.

107
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,458
Xiao Le.

108
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,500
Look how big you've gotten.
Do you remember me?

109
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,500
You've forgotten me already?

110
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,833
I took care of you when you were a baby.

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,625
Mozart, come back here.

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,875
-Nora.
-Yes, sir?

113
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:41,916
Is ma'am there?

114
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,916
She's upstairs, sir.

115
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,916
Please can you tell her I'll be late?

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,875
Yes, sir.

117
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:47,791
Where's Xiao Le?

118
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,750
Hold on, sir.

119
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,625
I think he's outside, sir.

120
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,250
Can I talk to him?

121
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,166
Yes, sir. I'm looking for him.

122
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,583
Mozart.

123
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,291
Xiao Le?

124
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,375
Mozart!

125
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,541
Papa wants to talk to you.

126
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,666
Papa, where are you?

127
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,166
I'm still in a meeting. I'm almost done--

128
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,666
Sing me Happy Birthday.

129
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,375
What?

130
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,541
Sing Happy Birthday for me.

131
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,208
Xiao Le, I can't right now.

132
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,250
Please?

133
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,291
Happy birthday to you...

134
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,541
Louder.

135
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,541
Happy birthday to you

136
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,500
Happy birthday, dear Xiao Le

137
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,833
Happy birthday to you

138
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,291
Again.

139
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,166
Xiao Le, I'll sing to you
once I'm home, okay?

140
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,291
One more time. Please.

141
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,041
Happy birthday to you

142
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,875
Happy birthday to you

143
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:18,958
Mozart!

144
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,666
Happy birthday, dear Xiao Le

145
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,250
Mozart.

146
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,458
Happy birthday to you

147
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,583
Mozart!

148
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,083
Mozart!

149
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,375
Hello?

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Xiao Le?

151
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,250
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

152
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,666
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

153
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,875
Patches will keep you company now.

154
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,791
Okay?

155
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,083
Coming.

156
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,208
I want to see Jia En.

157
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,291
Jia En.

158
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,833
Jia En?

159
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,000
Jia En.

160
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,875
Jia En.

161
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,500
Why are you doing this to yourself?

162
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,750
Come on. Get up.

163
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,333
Get up.

164
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,625
Come on.

165
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:50,458
I remember
when I found out I was pregnant,

166
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,458
I took the home pregnancy test
over and over.

167
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,541
Went through five of those test kits.

168
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,916
You know, just to make sure.

169
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,708
I miss him so much.

170
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,833
I still feel his presence

171
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,583
in every room,

172
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,125
every corner of the house.

173
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,125
I don't know how to let him go.

174
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,541
I was Xiao Le's nanny once.

175
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,583
I loved him very much, too.

176
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,416
I know his spirit lives on through you.

177
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,916
When I was just a baby,

178
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,250
my mother gave me away
to a family in Ipoh.

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,625
There was an old man there
who could see things.

180
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,583
He was a medium.

181
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,250
A spiritual advisor.

182
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,791
I was very close
to the neighbor's daughter.

183
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,500
One day, while she was playing outside,

184
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,333
she got run over by a car.

185
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,583
For weeks after the funeral,

186
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,583
I would wake up with a start
in the middle of the night.

187
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:40,333
I felt something shaking me,

188
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
tugging at my blanket.

189
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,875
Only the old man knew.

190
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,625
He told me

191
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,250
the spirit of the neighbor's daughter
had returned.

192
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,333
But her parents had moved out,
left the past behind.

193
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,458
They were gone for good.

194
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,458
So she didn't know where to go anymore.

195
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,375
What happened then?

196
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,958
The old man performed a ritual

197
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,958
to remind her that she was dead.

198
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,583
So her soul could journey on peacefully.

199
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,416
From that night on, I slept fine.

200
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,708
Nothing disturbed me anymore.

201
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,833
The soup's cold.

202
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,250
-Auntie.
-Yes?

203
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,541
Is the old man still there?

204
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,041
He passed away years ago.

205
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,541
But since then,
his oldest son has taken over.

206
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,791
He's here in Singapore now.

207
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,500
What if I don't want to send my son away?

208
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,250
What if I wanted to bring him back,

209
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,041
have him here by my side?

210
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,166
Could this man help me?

211
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,083
Are you sure this is what you want?

212
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,833
She loved her son very much.

213
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,208
And he was her only child.

214
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,166
Can't you have another child?

215
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,458
Her womb is very weak.

216
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,208
She's had two miscarriages before.

217
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,125
After she had Xiao Le,

218
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,583
the doctor told her she wouldn't be able
to have any more children.

219
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,416
The date and time of his birth.

220
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,625
And of his death, too.

221
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,375
If you want Master
to bring his spirit back,

222
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,041
you must do exactly as he tells you.

223
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,166
Don't question his methods. Just obey.

224
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,833
How will Master Chen find him?

225
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,875
I won't.

226
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,916
He will find me.

227
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,458
Wherever he is,

228
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,791
I will bring him back.

229
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,250
Sir, the car is here.

230
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,416
-Thank you.
-That's alright.

231
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,666
I'll be back by Thursday.

232
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,125
My itinerary's on the bedside table.

233
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,791
Yeah, I saw it.

234
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,916
Will you be okay?

235
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,583
-It's just five days. I'll be back--
-Don't worry. I'll be fine.

236
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,750
You better go. The taxi's waiting.

237
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,250
Jia En.

238
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,375
Jia En?

239
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:09,958
Is everything ready?

240
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,375
Yes. Come in.

241
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,958
Master Chen says he'll be here by 10:00.

242
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,625
The maid should be asleep by then.

243
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,041
-Is everything ready?
-Yes.

244
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,500
Ah Ling, we can get started.

245
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:06,625
Master, the boy's tombstone
has not been erected yet.

246
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,083
His grave is in front of the big tree.

247
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,000
It's the fourth one from the left.

248
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,250
Here's the map.

249
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,208
I'll go with you.

250
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,583
It's better if you stay here with me.

251
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,583
What are you going to do?

252
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,083
We have to perform certain rituals
at the grave.

253
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,208
In order to lead his spirit home,
we have to bring back a part of him.

254
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,291
A part of him?

255
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,750
-What do you mean?
-Tong.

256
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,791
Don't worry. Just wait here for us.

257
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:43,208
Keep some incense burning at the altar
until we come back.

258
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,333
Don't forget.

259
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,666
Hello?

260
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,125
Yes. Okay, got it.

261
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,375
They're back.

262
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Please come in.

263
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:58,875
They need to do this
in order to bring him back.

264
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,541
Remember, the finger
must always stay in the box.

265
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,333
Burn some incense every day.

266
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:20,625
At midnight,
give Xiao Le some of his favorite food.

267
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,791
The more you encourage him,
the stronger his spirit will be.

268
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:28,250
Remember, you have to do this
until you know his spirit is back.

269
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,958
How will I know when he's back?

270
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:36,458
You'll know.

271
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,541
Chicken wings. Your favorite.

272
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,958
I got it from the restaurant you like.

273
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,208
Mommy. Mommy.

274
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:11,791
Poke.

275
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,583
-Where were you last night?
-What do you mean?

276
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,875
I woke up during the night.
You weren't in bed.

277
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,250
Where were you?

278
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,166
In the study room.

279
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,708
Doing what?

280
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,083
Nothing.

281
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,208
Nora says you've been spending
a lot of time in there.

282
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,250
That's where the piano is.

283
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:22,416
You haven't played the piano since...

284
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,333
You lock yourself up in that room.

285
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,250
And you lock it up when you leave.

286
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:30,541
It's the only room I can go to
in this entire house...

287
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,875
where I can grieve.

288
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,833
Jia En,

289
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:46,750
I miss him too.

290
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,250
-I do, but we have to move on.
-Move on?

291
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,708
We can't spend
the rest of our lives like this!

292
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,083
If you wanna talk to someone--

293
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,416
You mean, a psychiatrist?

294
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,208
-Dr. Lim has helped you before.
-De Wei, I'm not crazy.

295
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:13,083
-I just need you to understand.
-Understand?

296
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,000
Isn't that all I've been doing
these past few months?

297
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll see you later.

298
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,208
Hello? Auntie?

299
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:56,583
The number you have dialed
is not available. Please try again--

300
00:32:56,666 --> 00:33:00,666
-Let's go. Mommy has to go home and cook.
-But I wanna play on the swing.

301
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,916
You want to play?

302
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,041
Ah Jian.

303
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,958
Hello? Auntie?

304
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,166
Jia En, is everything all right?

305
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,833
Where were you?
I've been trying to reach you.

306
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,916
I didn't have my phone with me.

307
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I need to see you.

308
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,083
I'm busy at the moment.

309
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,500
When will you be free?

310
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,500
Is something wrong?

311
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,041
Xiao Le?

312
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,416
This is where we left off.

313
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,166
Do you want me to read to you?

314
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:59,625
If you do,

315
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,208
give me a sign.

316
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,416
"The children waited for the moon to rise,

317
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,625
then they followed the trail of pebbles.

318
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:32,791
The trail led them back home,
safe and sound.

319
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,958
However,

320
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,791
they would not be safe for long..."

321
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,833
Come on, Xiao Le.

322
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,083
I know you can do it.

323
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,208
It's exactly as we left it.

324
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, ma'am.

325
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:49,666
But he's very, very sick. And so young.

326
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,625
It's okay, Nora.

327
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,500
We'll arrange for a flight
for you to go back and...

328
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,791
You should go back and see him.

329
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,083
Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am.

330
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,166
Will you be all right, ma'am?

331
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,500
Don't worry. I'm going to be fine.

332
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,375
Oh, no.

333
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,333
I'm sorry, Xiao Le.

334
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,916
I overslept.

335
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,833
Mommy will be early tomorrow night.

336
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,291
Okay?

337
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,208
-Your name is Anna?
-Yes, ma'am.

338
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:37,708
It says here you're Cambodian.
Where did you learn to speak Mandarin?

339
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:40,000
My previous employer
couldn't speak English.

340
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,708
So I picked up some Mandarin.

341
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:43,625
Can you cook?

342
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,208
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,666
-How about gardening?
-I can do that too, ma'am.

344
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,750
I love gardening and cooking.

345
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,750
I thought you said she liked to cook.

346
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,708
That's what she told me.

347
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,791
Maybe it tastes better than it looks.

348
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,333
Even he has reservations about her.

349
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,416
I think we should give her a chance.

350
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:41,083
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

351
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,000
What is it?

352
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,625
Perhaps it's time to move out.

353
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,833
No.

354
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,000
I found this nice, quiet place.
I can show you--

355
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,500
But I don't want to move.

356
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,250
-Why don't you want to move?
-Why do you want to move?

357
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,208
Because Xiao Le's gone.

358
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,333
-He's gone.
-No, he's not.

359
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:58,583
-No, he's not!
-What are you talking about?

360
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:09,958
De Wei,

361
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,833
I just don't want to move, okay?

362
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,291
Can't we just stay here?

363
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,208
Just like I used to play it.

364
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,000
Jia En,

365
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,375
I want to tell you something.

366
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,666
I will always love you.

367
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,250
No matter where I am,

368
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,583
or where you are,

369
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:16,375
my love will always be with you.

370
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:20,000
-Play it again.
-But I'm tired.

371
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,083
Play it again.

372
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,208
Okay.

373
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,208
Mom, where are you going?

374
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:43,833
Mom?

375
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
Mom?

376
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:04,916
Mom?

377
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,958
Xiao Le, don't do that.

378
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:00,000
Or I'll stop playing.

379
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,125
Xiao Le.

380
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,083
Xiao Le!

381
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:14,916
Xiao Le, stop it!

382
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,958
Xiao Le.

383
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,208
I know you're frustrated.

384
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,625
I know something's bothering you,

385
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,750
but this is not the way to behave.

386
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,750
Do you understand?

387
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,458
Xiao Le, are you listening to me?

388
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,166
This is not funny--

389
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,833
Ma'am, do you want me to clean this room?

390
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,583
No. I don't want you to enter this room.

391
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,750
Not ever.

392
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:26,541
Is that understood?

393
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,083
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:30,500
Why don't you go clean the other rooms?

395
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,750
I've already cleaned
all the other rooms, ma'am.

396
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,208
Then go clean your own room.

397
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:40,916
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:54,041
I want you to think about
what you did last night.

399
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,875
Think about it very carefully.

400
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
De Wei?

401
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
De Wei?

402
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:47,708
Where were you?

403
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,458
I should ask you that.

404
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,083
I just got back.

405
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:55,125
-Really?
-What do you mean?

406
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,375
I heard the car pull in half an hour ago,
and you say you just got back?

407
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:06,375
I was hungry.
I went to get something to eat.

408
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:16,791
Really?

409
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,416
Why would I lie to you?

410
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,375
Morning, ma'am.

411
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:43,916
Morning.

412
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,750
I'm gonna be late again tonight.

413
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,166
Hmm.

414
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,833
Anna.

415
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,458
-No dinner for me tonight.
-Yes, sir.

416
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,375
Are you mad at me?

417
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,375
No.

418
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:26,333
If you are, then let's talk about it.

419
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:28,416
You don't have to be like this.

420
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,083
What are you talking about?

421
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,041
You know what I'm talking about.

422
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,916
No, De Wei.

423
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:17,916
I'm tired.

424
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,541
Jia En. What are you doing?

425
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,541
Are you crazy?

426
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,625
What the hell are you doing?

427
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,875
Jia En!

428
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,291
Anna?

429
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,375
Anna.

430
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,791
Why haven't you cleared the table?

431
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,208
What's wrong?

432
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:00,291
It's nothing.

433
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,583
Tell me, what's wrong?

434
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,750
Nothing, ma'am.

435
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:07,500
Anna.

436
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,750
Last night, when I was asleep,

437
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,666
someone touched me.

438
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Touched you?

439
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:20,916
What do you mean?

440
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,625
Someone pushed my face into the pillow.

441
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,083
I couldn't see who it was.

442
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,541
What did he do?

443
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,166
What did he do to you?

444
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,166
He pulled down my pajamas,

445
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,083
and then,

446
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,208
he pulled down my underwear.

447
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,291
Sorry. Excuse me a moment.

448
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,916
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't answer my calls.

449
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,291
-I was in a meeting.
-What's going on, De Wei?

450
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,250
Is something going on
between you and Anna?

451
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,916
We'll talk about it when I get home.

452
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,958
I want to know now. I need to know now.

453
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:21,875
Listen, Jia En.

454
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:25,541
I'm going to call Dr. Lim.

455
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,291
I saw you leaving Anna's room
the other night.

456
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,541
I told you.

457
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,083
I went to the kitchen
to look for something to eat,

458
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,166
but I didn't know where anything was.

459
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,375
So I went to Anna's room
to see if she could make me something.

460
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:39,916
But she was asleep.

461
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,041
So I left.

462
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,041
Jia En.

463
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,208
This has gone far enough.

464
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,666
I've been trying my best to understand,

465
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:02,208
but you come in here, to my office,
embarrass me in front of my staff.

466
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:07,125
This has to stop.

467
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,000
Sorry. Please continue.

468
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,000
Why don't you shut up and eat?

469
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,083
Come on, eat.

470
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:29,916
Stupid dog.
Eat or I won't feed you anymore.

471
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,625
Just eat your food, stupid dog.

472
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:33,375
We have to take her down to the station
to record her statement.

473
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:34,666
Miss.

474
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,166
I'll pick you up later.

475
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,458
Miss.

476
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,833
Were you able to reach Master Chen?

477
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,333
He's not in Singapore.

478
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,875
He's at a mountainside retreat.

479
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,291
He'll only be back later this month.

480
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,208
I can't wait that long.

481
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:11,375
What happened?

482
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,458
That spirit in my house...

483
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:22,458
it's not my son.

484
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,875
I don't know what it is,

485
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:31,500
but I know it's not my son.

486
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:32,916
It's not Xiao Le.

487
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,791
Master Chen once taught me a ritual.

488
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,125
What kind of ritual?

489
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:52,500
A ritual that can identify the spirit
in your house.

490
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,958
What do I need to do?

491
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,750
I can come to your house and show you.

492
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,416
But your husband...

493
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,791
He's away on business.

494
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,166
All right.

495
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:18,541
We'll perform the ritual tomorrow night.

496
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,541
This will be the gateway.

497
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,625
The spirit will pass through here,

498
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,625
but as long as we stay within the circle,
we'll be okay.

499
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,958
Light these.

500
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:07,833
Sit down.

501
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:17,083
When the spirit passes
through the gateway,

502
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,625
you'll see its reflection in the mirror.

503
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:24,625
If it's Xiao Le,
it will be his face you see.

504
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,458
Let's try again.

505
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:14,333
Master Chen said he could only get here
the day after tomorrow.

506
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:18,125
He'll come here straight from the airport.

507
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,583
I'm gonna ask Anna to pack her things.

508
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,166
I'm sending her back to the agency.

509
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:28,708
Jia En,

510
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,625
it's better if you don't stay here
right now.

511
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:34,916
Go to a friend's house.

512
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:39,583
And what if that thing follows me there?

513
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,500
I'll be putting someone else in danger.

514
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,000
You do what you need to do.

515
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:50,458
Where are you going?

516
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,666
If that isn't my son in the grave,

517
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,541
I wanna know who it is.

518
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,208
Hello?

519
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:27,916
Hello, Anna. Is everything okay?

520
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:30,916
Yes, ma'am. I've already packed my things.

521
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,750
I'll be back in about an hour.

522
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,416
-Okay, ma'am.
-Bye.

523
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,250
One.

524
01:02:50,416 --> 01:02:51,416
Two.

525
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:57,666
Three.

526
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:05,750
His grave is in front of the big tree.

527
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,416
It's the fourth one from the left.

528
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:20,583
Four.

529
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,750
Hello.

530
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,666
Excuse me.

531
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:39,375
Could you tell me whose grave this is?

532
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:40,958
Which one?

533
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
That one.

534
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:51,375
Uncle, I really need to know
who's buried there.

535
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,958
My son is buried in the next grave.

536
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Please.

537
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:21,041
That grave is unmarked.

538
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:22,750
Who's buried there?

539
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,250
I don't know.

540
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,041
How could you not know?
You're the caretaker.

541
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,916
The people who brought him didn't tell me.

542
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,500
You must at least have a name.

543
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:39,041
No. I don't know his name.

544
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,000
How is that possible?

545
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,208
There must be some record of him.

546
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:46,208
The cemetery wouldn't let just anyone
bury their dead here.

547
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:49,708
Unless they approached you directly.

548
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,458
They paid you off, didn't they?

549
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,375
I barely make any money on this job.

550
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,208
I have six mouths to feed.
They'll starve to death.

551
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:06,708
Coming.

552
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,333
OUTGOING CALLS

553
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,083
AUNTIE

554
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:58,916
Hello?

555
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,458
Hello? Jia En?

556
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,250
Hello?

557
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:04,625
Ma'am?

558
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:15,000
Anna.

559
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,250
Anna.

560
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,041
-Anna.
-Ma'am?

561
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,208
Anna.

562
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,750
Anna.

563
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:42,916
Anna.

564
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,500
Anna.

565
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,000
Anna.

566
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,583
He was my son.

567
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:03,208
Several years older than Xiao Le.

568
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,375
Right from the day he was born,

569
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,166
we knew there was something
wrong with him.

570
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,250
When he was a child,

571
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:22,791
we thought he was just a little odd.

572
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,375
But the older he grew,
the more violent he became.

573
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,625
When he was a teenager,

574
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:37,375
he started attacking people.

575
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,791
One day,

576
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:49,750
my sister brought her daughter over
to our house.

577
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,083
My niece had a fever,

578
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:59,041
so we let her rest in the bedroom.

579
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:04,541
We were only away for ten minutes...

580
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:05,625
Mei Mei, we're back.

581
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,458
Sis...

582
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,458
I wasn't home when Ah Tam died.

583
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,500
That day,

584
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:44,833
my husband sent me out on an errand.

585
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,541
He gave Ah Tam some pills

586
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,000
so he would sleep.

587
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:12,875
It was the last time I saw my husband.

588
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,791
By the time I came back,

589
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:22,375
he had packed his things and left.

590
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,166
You killed your own son.

591
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:33,541
Master Chen tried to bring him back
several times,

592
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,666
but each time he failed.

593
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,083
Your son is lost.

594
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:43,083
He cannot find his way back.

595
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,375
However, there is a way.

596
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,458
He can follow another spirit home.

597
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:55,333
A soul that has just died.

598
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,208
With this soul to guide him,
your son can return.

599
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,875
You used Xiao Le to bring your son back.

600
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,625
My son's death...

601
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:11,125
Did you have anything to do with it?

602
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,208
No.

603
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,791
I loved Xiao Le. You know I loved him.

604
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,125
But the thing is,

605
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,500
when he died, I thought...

606
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,833
maybe there's a way for both of us
to find our sons.

607
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:32,625
You understand, don't you?

608
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:36,750
I wanted my son back, just like you do.

609
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:38,125
Jia En.

610
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,333
Jia En!

611
01:13:58,625 --> 01:13:59,625
Anna?

612
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:04,583
Anna?

613
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:34,750
Help me!

614
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:35,708
Come out.

615
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:37,250
Come on out.

616
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,583
No. He's upstairs.

617
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,333
Don't hide in there.

618
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,541
Stop it!

619
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,750
Tam, you listen to me.

620
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:00,750
You don't belong here. Please go away.

621
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,291
Leave us alone.

622
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:05,583
You don't belong here. Stop troubling us.

623
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:07,833
Enough. Enough!

624
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,583
Xiao Le?

625
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:37,583
Xiao Le?

626
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,708
Xiao Le.

627
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,708
Xiao Le?

628
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:27,750
Stop!

629
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,250
Xiao Le.

630
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:56,083
Ah Tam.

631
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,416
It's time to go home.

632
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:16,958
Jia En.

633
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,416
Please forgive me.

634
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:57,291
Xiao Le.

635
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:00,625
You're still here?

636
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,958
I never left.

637
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:09,958
No matter where I am,

638
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:12,750
or where you are,

639
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,125
my love will always be with you.

640
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,000
Mommy.

641
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:02,916
Jia En!

642
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:14,291
BELOVED SON

643
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:36,791
HANSEL AND GRETEL

644
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,250
So you can always find your way home.

645
01:20:58,291 --> 01:20:59,291
Xiao Le,

646
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,000
Mommy and Daddy will always love you.
