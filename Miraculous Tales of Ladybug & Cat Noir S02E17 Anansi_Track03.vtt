&lrm;<i>Tonight, the Grand Palais hosts the most</i>
&lrm;<i>eagerly awaited event of the year,</i>

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.980
&lrm;<i>the fashion show of Gabriel Agreste!</i>

&lrm;<i>the highly respected fashion critic.</i>

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.100
&lrm;Honestly, Marinette,
&lrm;it's perfect the way it is!

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.420
&lrm;Oh, Tikki, I don't know! I feel like
&lrm;it's the ugliest hat in the world!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.940
&lrm;And Adrien is meant to model it
&lrm;in front of everyone!

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.060
&lrm;He'll resent me for the rest of his life!
&lrm;I have zero talent!

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.180
&lrm;And everyone will find that out tonight!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.180
&lrm;You're a great designer, Marinette!
&lrm;Besides, if your hat was so ugly,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.020
&lrm;why did Gabriel Agreste handpick it
&lrm;for his fashion show?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.420
&lrm;What if people see that it's a synthetic
&lrm;pigeon feather and not a real one?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.660
&lrm;-They'll think it's lame.
&lrm;-You did the right thing, replacing it.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.340
&lrm;With his allergy, Adrien would be sneezing
&lrm;all the way down the catwalk!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.940
&lrm;You're right. Besides,
&lrm;I don't have time to make changes anyway.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.900
&lrm;The show begins in... Oh, no!
&lrm;I'm going to be late again! Quick, Tikki!

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.780
&lrm;<i>This is it! Here she comes,</i>

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.780
&lrm;<i>the international queen of fashion,</i>
&lrm;<i>director of</i>&lrm; Style Queen&lrm;<i> magazine,</i>

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.780
&lrm;<i>Audrey Bourgeois!</i>

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.740
&lrm;Anthony! Uh... André!
&lrm;Be a dear and fire the &lrm;<i>chauffeur</i>&lrm;.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.700
&lrm;I can't believe Gabriel
&lrm;allows his staff to drive like that!

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.420
&lrm;-Neither do I.
&lrm;-Yes, of course, Audrey dear!

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.100
&lrm;-Oh, no! It's Audrey Bourgeois!
&lrm;-Who?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.700
&lrm;Only the harshest fashion critic
&lrm;in the world!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.140
&lrm;I didn't know she was coming!

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.940
&lrm;What is this carpet? Is it fabric?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.140
&lrm;Why isn't the red carpet
&lrm;made out of marble, like I said?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.020
&lrm;You're fired!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.700
&lrm;Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.500
&lrm;She's gonna hate my hat for sure!

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.580
&lrm;I'm sure she won't!

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.940
&lrm;Come on, Marinette,
&lrm;Adrien is waiting for you!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.420
&lrm;Audrey,
&lrm;like the slogan of your magazine says,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900
&lrm;"If it's in good taste,
&lrm;it's in Style Queen".

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.940
&lrm;So, what's in good taste this year?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.220
&lrm;Judging by the way you're dressed,
&lrm;you obviously don't know, dear.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.380
&lrm;For your information,
&lrm;the trend this year is glitter.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.260
&lrm;Glitter? There's no glitter on my hat!
&lrm;This is a fashion disaster!

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.860
&lrm;As the editor of Style Queen,
&lrm;you spend a lot of time in New York.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.980
&lrm;It must be nice to be with your family
&lrm;for a change, here in Paris?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.980
&lrm;She's very happy to see me! By the way,
&lrm;Mom, I have a little something for you!

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.180
&lrm;-Clara! Uh... Chloé! What is this?
&lrm;-Um, it's a gift.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.460
&lrm;Huh! This wrapping paper is ridiculous.
&lrm;Utterly ridiculous. You're fired!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.060
&lrm;Darling, please, you can't fire Chloé!
&lrm;She's your daughter!

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.340
&lrm;How long are you planning to stay
&lrm;in Paris?

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.740
&lrm;The shortest possible time.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.620
&lrm;Thank you. This show just might be
&lrm;one of the most important

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.740
&lrm;in Agreste's career, as evidenced
&lrm;by Audrey Bourgeois' presence.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.700
&lrm;<i>Will the designer who never appears</i>
&lrm;<i>in public show up for the occasion?</i>

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.900
&lrm;<i>Stay tuned to find out! Don't be...</i>

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.820
&lrm;-Where are you going?
&lrm;-You heard Audrey Bourgeois.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.380
&lrm;I can't let Adrien model this hat!

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.820
&lrm;There's no glitter on it!
&lrm;Zero trend potential!

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.500
&lrm;Ah! There you are, Marinette.
&lrm;Everyone's waiting for you.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.820
&lrm;-But, actually, I...
&lrm;-The dressing rooms are that way.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.060
&lrm;-Hurry up. You're late.
&lrm;-Uh... OK!

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.900
&lrm;Whoa!

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.140
&lrm;Ah...

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.020
&lrm;What is this?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.060
&lrm;Uh...

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.060
&lrm;Mom, this is Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
&lrm;the loser! And this is a hat she made,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.980
&lrm;because she thinks she's a designer!
&lrm;She even signed it!

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.820
&lrm;I... It's not me, it's another Marinette!
&lrm;I was just bringing it to her.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.940
&lrm;Marinette, we have to go.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.620
&lrm;Hmm.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.340
&lrm;I feel awkward!

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.620
&lrm;That's probably
&lrm;because you look ridiculous.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.580
&lrm;[knock on door]

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.700
&lrm;-Hello, Marinette!
&lrm;-Oh! Uh... Hulla...

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.140
&lrm;-Oh, sorry!
&lrm;-No worries.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.900
&lrm;-Ouch! Sorry!
&lrm;-Ow!

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.300
&lrm;Oh, no!
&lrm;I hope it's not too hard to fix it!

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.980
&lrm;Oh, you know, it doesn't really matter.
&lrm;This hat is a complete failure anyway.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.220
&lrm;What? Not it's not!
&lrm;Why would you say that?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.300
&lrm;Because...

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.260
&lrm;The queen of fashion, Audrey Bourgeois,
&lrm;saw it and hated it!

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.620
&lrm;I'm sorry, Adrien. I really messed up.
&lrm;I'm a total no-talent!

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.060
&lrm;-Please don't put it on.
&lrm;-Marinette, everything will be fine.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.180
&lrm;Your hat looks great. I think
&lrm;it's awesome and so does my father,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.260
&lrm;otherwise he wouldn't have
&lrm;picked it for me. Look!

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.220
&lrm;See?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.700
&lrm;[giggles]

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.540
&lrm;-You've got that catwalk down!
&lrm;-Really? Thank you.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.460
&lrm;Ahem! We have to go.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.900
&lrm;Marinette! Yoohoo!

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.860
&lrm;-She looks nervous.
&lrm;-No doubt. It's her first fashion show,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.020
&lrm;with her first professional piece,
&lrm;not to mention Adrien's modelling it.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.060
&lrm;-I'm sure it'll go just great!
&lrm;-Mmm-hmm.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.220
&lrm;How dilapidated is this place!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.540
&lrm;And I have to share the front row
&lrm;with these lowlifes? Ridiculous!

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.980
&lrm;Utterly ridiculous!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.420
&lrm;Uh, sorry,
&lrm;but that seat is reserved for Marinette!

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.620
&lrm;-This Marinette girl, again?
&lrm;-Let me handle this, Mother!

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.900
&lrm;Hey, losers! Do you know who my mother is?
&lrm;She's Mrs Style Queen,

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.980
&lrm;the most powerful woman in fashion!

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.700
&lrm;This show is for her, OK? So get lost!

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.380
&lrm;Mrs Bourgeois,
&lrm;Mr Agreste has reserved a seat for you.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.740
&lrm;-Ah, finally!
&lrm;-In the second row.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.500
&lrm;What?
&lrm;My mother always sits in the front row.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.340
&lrm;-Not today.
&lrm;-This is unacceptable!

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.300
&lrm;Gabriel cannot do this to me!
&lrm;I'm the one who discovered him!

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.300
&lrm;Without me, he'd still be drawing
&lrm;his designs in his dismal, cramped studio!

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.940
&lrm;I can offer your seat to someone else
&lrm;if you don't want it.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.020
&lrm;How dare you? You're fired!

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.300
&lrm;I don't work for you, but Mr Agreste.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.660
&lrm;We'll see about that!

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.060
&lrm;[phone ringing]

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.300
&lrm;I'm sorry. It took some time, I know.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.020
&lrm;But, today, I can feel my prey
&lrm;has more malice in her

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.580
&lrm;than anyone I've ever akumatised before.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.700
&lrm;She will be my masterpiece.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.260
&lrm;[answer phone]
&lrm;<i>Please leave a message.</i>

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.420
&lrm;I assume from your expression
&lrm;that I am not "fired"?

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.220
&lrm;This is unacceptable! I will not view
&lrm;a fashion show from the second row! Ever!

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.460
&lrm;Tell me, my dear akumas,
&lrm;what will be the trend tonight?

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.220
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise this wonderfully vile queen!

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.980
&lrm;-Mom?
&lrm;-Audrey, dear?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.540
&lrm;Style Queen, I am Hawk Moth.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.620
&lrm;You've been refused a throne
&lrm;that is rightfully yours.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.460
&lrm;As queen of fashion, you will now be able
&lrm;to revenge those fashion disasters

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.060
&lrm;-who disrespected you!
&lrm;-They'll see who's Queen, Hawk Moth!

&lrm;[both gasp]

&lrm;All cool, girl?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.260
&lrm;A fashion show without the queen of style?
&lrm;Glitterally unacceptable!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.700
&lrm;Is this supposed to happen?
&lrm;I've never attended a fashion show before.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.820
&lrm;Where's that ungrateful Gabriel Agreste?

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.460
&lrm;-I demand that he kneels before me!
&lrm;-My father isn't here!

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.700
&lrm;Well, then,
&lrm;if fashion-disaster daddy isn't here,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.140
&lrm;I'll just have to settle
&lrm;for Agreste Junior!

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500
&lrm;You're fired!

&lrm;-But where is Marinette?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.380
&lrm;Hmm...

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.220
&lrm;-Fired!
&lrm;-Mom...

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.260
&lrm;Claudine? Uh... Chloé? I'm not Mom.
&lrm;I am Style Queen!

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.940
&lrm;-Do you want to be fired too?
&lrm;-No, no, I really don't, Style Queen!

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.260
&lrm;Er... besides,
&lrm;don't you need an assistant?

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.540
&lrm;Hmm...
&lrm;I did fire my last one this morning.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.980
&lrm;-She sure was useless! Utterly useless!
&lrm;-Fine, I'll take you on trial!

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.980
&lrm;Style Queen!

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.860
&lrm;What an atrocious suit!
&lrm;The bug look is so last year!

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.740
&lrm;But the yo-yo
&lrm;makes a strong comeback this year!

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.660
&lrm;You're a couple sizes too small
&lrm;to beat me, Ladybug!

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.180
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.740
&lrm;Mom! Uh, Style Queen! If you want to find
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste, I know where he lives.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.020
&lrm;You can take care of Ladybug later!
&lrm;She's worthless anyway!

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.620
&lrm;Hmm. It's not a completely idiotic idea.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.740
&lrm;Clothilde? Uh... Chloé?
&lrm;Where is Gabriel Agreste?

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.580
&lrm;-He usually never leaves his house!
&lrm;-Style Queen,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.460
&lrm;he's hidden safely somewhere!
&lrm;Ladybug is protecting him!

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.500
&lrm;-Pah! She can barely protect herself!
&lrm;-Seize Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.940
&lrm;If they can't save his son,
&lrm;then Gabriel Agreste will have to show up!

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.140
&lrm;Don't worry, Hawk Moth,
&lrm;you'll get your costume jewels!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.780
&lrm;Not again!

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.820
&lrm;Can't she stand still for two seconds?

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.140
&lrm;Please, Mom, stop!

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.300
&lrm;Keep this for me, sleeping beauty!

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.020
&lrm;Oh! You're not going to hurt my Adrikins,
&lrm;are you, Mom? Uh, Style Queen?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.780
&lrm;You want to join Agreste Junior, Kylie?
&lrm;Uh... Chloé? Just ask, and I'll fire you!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.340
&lrm;No, thanks.
&lrm;You're right, we don't care about him!

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.460
&lrm;Make yourself useful, assistant.
&lrm;Tell me if you see Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.900
&lrm;Yes, Style Queen.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.740
&lrm;What am I gonna do?

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.420
&lrm;Gabriel Agreste!
&lrm;If you refuse to show your face,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.620
&lrm;your son will soon be nothing
&lrm;but glitter in the wind!

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.980
&lrm;-Oh, it doesn't break! Adrikins, wake up!
&lrm;-Cat Noir, I don't know what you're doing,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.940
&lrm;but there's a witch of a villain
&lrm;running loose and I need you!

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.060
&lrm;Psst! Ladybug, hurry up!

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.860
&lrm;Adrikins is crumbling!

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.180
&lrm;-Did you see where the akuma landed?
&lrm;-It's in the rose she put on him!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.460
&lrm;-Where's Cat Noir?
&lrm;-I wish I knew.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.100
&lrm;You'd better come up with something fast.
&lrm;My mother is going to see you!

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.260
&lrm;It's really impossible to find
&lrm;qualified staff these days!

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.340
&lrm;You're fired!

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.660
&lrm;No!

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.740
&lrm;Ladybug,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.180
&lrm;hand over those awful earrings
&lrm;and let's get this over with!

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.180
&lrm;You still don't get it, huh,
&lrm;fashion victim? I am invincible!

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.180
&lrm;My power is only equalled
&lrm;by my sense of fashion!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.260
&lrm;I am invincible! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.820
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.220
&lrm;A mallet?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.700
&lrm;Haven't you got it already?
&lrm;You can't beat me!

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.220
&lrm;How could you defeat me?
&lrm;You can't even touch me! Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.020
&lrm;Of course!

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.740
&lrm;Let her go. She'll bring us Cat Noir!
&lrm;I need both of their Miraculous anyway!

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.100
&lrm;Master Fu! Cat Noir has disappeared!
&lrm;I can't beat Style Queen without him!

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.020
&lrm;-And the Lucky Charm told me to come here!
&lrm;-Don't worry, Cat Noir is fine.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.940
&lrm;Well, what's he doing, then?
&lrm;Why isn't he helping me?

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.420
&lrm;-He's just lost his Miraculous.
&lrm;-What? He's just lost his Miraculous?

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.580
&lrm;This is a disaster!

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.420
&lrm;That tomcat's really got himself
&lrm;stuck up in a tree this time.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.540
&lrm;-Let me guess, you're Cat Noir's kwami.
&lrm;-Yes, he tends to copy me a bit too much.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.460
&lrm;Yet, lately, he's been doing silly things!

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.940
&lrm;In 5,000 years, I've never experienced
&lrm;such an irresponsible Miraculous owner!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.580
&lrm;As a result, he's lost his ring,
&lrm;and it's just me able to help you out!

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.420
&lrm;No! It's out of the question, Plagg!

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.220
&lrm;You are way too dangerous
&lrm;without an owner!

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.540
&lrm;Dangerous? Me? How so?

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.700
&lrm;Does the disappearance of Atlantis
&lrm;ring a bell?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.900
&lrm;-I'd had too much cheese!
&lrm;-The Leaning Tower of Pisa?

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.860
&lrm;-I didn't see it!
&lrm;-Dinosaurs!

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.780
&lrm;Oh! Yeah, OK, I did go too far, there.
&lrm;But I was young!

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.940
&lrm;Neither Cat Noir nor Plagg
&lrm;can help you today.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.900
&lrm;Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
&lrm;Pick an ally you can trust

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.380
&lrm;to fight alongside you on this mission.
&lrm;Choose wisely.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.140
&lrm;Such powers are meant to serve
&lrm;the greater good.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.100
&lrm;Once the mission is over,
&lrm;you'll retrieve their Miraculous.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.540
&lrm;I need someone
&lrm;who can actually immobilise my opponent.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.420
&lrm;-Hmm.
&lrm;-Do you have someone in mind, Marinette?

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.180
&lrm;I know just the right person!

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.820
&lrm;Why, the red spotted cockroach
&lrm;is coming back!

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.100
&lrm;But she forgot
&lrm;her frightful feline in black!

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.580
&lrm;Cat Noir isn't here? Never mind!

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.620
&lrm;Catch Ladybug and make her tell you where
&lrm;he's hiding! I need both Miraculous, now!

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.500
&lrm;Alya! Don't get close to Style Queen!
&lrm;It's dangerous!

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.140
&lrm;It's hard to get the scoop
&lrm;when you're not involved, Ladybug!

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.340
&lrm;Well, I have a scoop for you.
&lrm;Alya Césaire,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.700
&lrm;here's the Miraculous of the bee
&lrm;which grants the power of subjection.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.140
&lrm;You will use it for the greater good.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.740
&lrm;Wow!

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.580
&lrm;Ladybug! You're out of fashion! Give up!

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.380
&lrm;Watch out!

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.980
&lrm;Where's Cat Noir? Oh, let me guess!

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.420
&lrm;He's hiding because he's ashamed
&lrm;of his outfit!

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.900
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.420
&lrm;-A tube of glue?
&lrm;-Glue this, Bug!

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.660
&lrm;You're always running away, Ladybug!

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.620
&lrm;Not this time!

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.780
&lrm;A glue diet? Ha! That's original!
&lrm;But I'm still going to...

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.140
&lrm;Oh!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.060
&lrm;Oh, what's the matter?
&lrm;Do you have indigestion?

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.660
&lrm;How dare you? I'm gonna squash you
&lrm;like the nasty bug you are!

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.660
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha! You're no match
&lrm;for Style Queen, my poor Ladybug.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.060
&lrm;Soon you'll be nothing but a bad memory,
&lrm;like shoulder pads!

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.660
&lrm;-Stay away from the ladybug!
&lrm;-Plagg!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.260
&lrm;My, my, what do we have here?
&lrm;A talking rat?

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.340
&lrm;Miaow! Style &lrm;<i>faux-pas</i>&lrm;!

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.060
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.100
&lrm;Better hurry and fix everything!

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.300
&lrm;Now I get why Master Fu
&lrm;didn't want to let you out!

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.620
&lrm;No!

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.820
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma!

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.900
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.940
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.300
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.900
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.060
&lrm;Adrikins!

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.340
&lrm;I was so scared!

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.420
&lrm;[she moans]

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.380
&lrm;What am I doing here? You're all fired!

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.340
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Pound it!

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.460
&lrm;-I hope Cat Noir finds his Miraculous.
&lrm;-Don't worry!

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.780
&lrm;I'll be on him like mould on cheese!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.020
&lrm;Oh, Mom, if you only knew
&lrm;what a great team we made!

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.820
&lrm;We fired a bunch of incompetents.
&lrm;It was awesome!

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.980
&lrm;We should really spend more time together.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.180
&lrm;-What if I went back to New York with you?
&lrm;-Don't be ridiculous, Casserole! Chloé!

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.540
&lrm;First I have to get back
&lrm;to Agreste's fashion show. And...

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.020
&lrm;The fashion show!
&lrm;My father will worry about me!

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.180
&lrm;It's on my way.
&lrm;I can give you a lift if you want.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.820
&lrm;Style Queen was my greatest masterpiece!
&lrm;How could she have failed?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.940
&lrm;How could I have failed?

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.740
&lrm;What should I do now?

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.500
&lrm;<i>Sir, you took a big risk,</i>
&lrm;<i>especially regarding Adrien.</i>

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.580
&lrm;If only I could tell Adrien
&lrm;why I'm doing this, he would understand.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.660
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug!

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.100
&lrm;For the lift, and also for saving my life!

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.380
&lrm;Uh... well... not a mall...
&lrm;I mean, not at all!

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.340
&lrm;[buzzing]

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.980
&lrm;I... I have to go! Bye!

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.140
&lrm;Marinette! Aren't you forgetting?

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.500
&lrm;You must bring the Miraculous
&lrm;back to Master Fu!

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.900
&lrm;But the magic ladybugs
&lrm;already brought it back, didn't they?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.980
&lrm;Wait. If they didn't,
&lrm;then I lost a Miraculous?

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.780
&lrm;I have to go back to the Eiffel Tower
&lrm;right now! Quick, Tikki!

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.940
&lrm;Marinette, there you are!

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.180
&lrm;We've been looking for you everywhere.
&lrm;Are you OK, sweetie?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.820
&lrm;Uh, I'm fine. Thanks to Ladybug,
&lrm;I'm no longer a glitter statue!

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.260
&lrm;What would we do without Ladybug?

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.460
&lrm;We'll finally watch the fashion show,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.460
&lrm;and witness the success of our daughter
&lrm;and her amazing hat!

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.860
