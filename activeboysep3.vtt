00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.730
It's out that the hot-tempered boy's house is here.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.780
You again?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.920
What enemies in a narrow road!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.000
What's up? Do you wanna go with me?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.730
No! I have my own foot, I can walk by myself.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.460
Thanks!

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.580
Well. I see I and you have some predestinations.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.380
Then, living near together, studying in the same school.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.050
I wanna offer you jointly going. That's all.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.620
Please keep down your mercy pretending, bro!

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.860
Anyway, my club won't surrender your team.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.410
I have my kindness to invite you to go with.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.300
But you don't want, it's up to you.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.610
What a clumsy guy! You forget your phone!

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.600
Thanks, sister!

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.840
I will see

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.220
How can those weak guys like you

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.240
win in the forthcoming basketball match?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.570
You can keep waiting and see

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.080
What a unlucky guy!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.080
Episode 3: Enemies in the narrow road

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.000
Long!!

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.290
Let's stand up and amswer me that

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.800
What is the mutation gene?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.600
Yes, teacher...

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.520
I give you 10s

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.700
10s start... 10 9 8... 1 time's up!

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.420
Zero point, sit down!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.290
What is the weird class like this? huh?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.580
Your friend get 0 point but you keep smiling?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.940
Huh? Happy? It's too happy, right?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.850
Do you believe that I give all of you the zero point?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.520
I haven't seen

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.980
such a hard-headed class like this before.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.730
Please give me the chance to be hard-headed, too.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.330
Concentrate on the board!

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.770
Because of you, doggy. You know but you don't remind me.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.930
Reminding what?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.640
You are dreaming about your love

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.770
How can I annoy you?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.200
Dreaming your eyes!

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920
Know but do not remind, I will remembe!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520
What? You keep it in minds?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.410
I...

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.120
You! You always keep caring about your love only.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.800
And our club, you let me take on it alone.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.760
Do you know?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.970
When did I leave our club?

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.600
Besides, don't worry about those young boys.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.210
Those young boys? We can win in a few minutes, a few minutes.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.570
Keep "win in a few minutes", son!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.900
Contempting the enemy is doing harm yourselves.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.820
Hey... ah!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.020
About the music club's leader

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.820
The Guy... Named Lam, right?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.700
Yes, that's right!

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.840
He's near my house.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.120
It seems like he has a really big determination.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.100
You should be happy, or else we play with the guys who don't have any strong-willed

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.040
Too boring.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.880
Damn you!

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.480
Lâm! Đăng!!

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.040
What are you two keeping talking about? huh?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.800
I have written for a long time, my hand has got tired now.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.260
And what are you always keeping talking?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.290
Have you done? Have you finished your topic?

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.300
If not, you can go out

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.540
Stay there until you will have done, then back to class.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.850
Stand up!

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.690
Go out and do horse stance for me.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.400
Quickly!

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.340
Because of you, dog!

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.780
Still kidding, still kidding, right?

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.530
Still hitting other bum?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.050
Other guys, focus on looking the board.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.490
Smile, what are you smiling about? What an always smiling class!

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.800
Is it funny that makes you smile?

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.330
Because of you, the dog.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.530
It"s you!

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.010
You talk the bullshit things and make the teacher let us out here.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.300
If you didn't overdream about the love

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.440
If you answered the question, the teacher wouldn't force us to go out here.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.120
What?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.770
You can't love then you feel jealous?

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.200
I can't love is wrong

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.240
But now I'm caring about...

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.220
Crazy!

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.200
Hey guys, It's only 2 classes, what makes you be like that?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.290
Did you go anywhere last night?

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.980
Rubbish!

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.600
Try to stand horsely like us, you will know immediately.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.130
But your teacher is truly difficult!

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.360
She is a nightmare!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.160
Ok, sit down.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.340
His little mother is calling, guys!

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.570
Oppa Dang, right?

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.340
There is a spider film at the cinema, too amazing!

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.060
I really wanna see it.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.730
Oh... I...

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.660
you what?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.300
Ow... Ok ok ok, I will go with you, I will go with you.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.260
Ok oppa, so we will meet on Thursday evening, please!

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.770
What are you smiling?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.780
I give up!

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.740
How can we do now?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.840
I don't know

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.200
When we are in the same house, close our eyelids on the same bed.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.280
Sometimes dream of the same thing.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.560
It seems... you are hiding me a thing?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.010
You seem too confusing?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.240
Oh... Nothing!

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.920
We are talking about when we practice the basketball.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.100
It's wrong, we are talking about...

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.140
Stop being bullshit, Quan!

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.890
The thing that we eat and then practice is too important?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.840
Ah... I thought other thing.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.040
Ok, back to your location and practice.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.330
Van, let's sing the song "Mot Nha" (One house)

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.730
Yes, "one house" please.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.920
When we are in the same house, close our eyelids on the same bed.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.120
Sometimes dream of the same thing, wake up at the same time.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.290
Very nice, guys!

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.010
You still  can keep your performance like that

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.360
Phong brother, do you buy us snacks?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.360
I forgot it.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.010
Here, money here! Hold it and go buy the snacks!

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.370
Thank you!

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.380
Who wants to eat snacks, follow me!

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:20.580
Lam

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.200
Yes

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.970
I wanna talk with you

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.020
Have I done somethings wrong?

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.130
Sit down, please.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.800
I have been told about the basketball match

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.600
How do you intend?

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.800
Huh? How can you know?

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.920
Quan told me.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.620
Whole of our school have known it already.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.210
This guy Quan, there is no funny things that he tells everywhere.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.410
Absolutely, they all will know, for sure.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.210
Answer my main question!

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.730
Yes

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.410
Well we can only do it

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.930
What is "can only do it"?

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.140
You see me as an ivisible man?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.920
Talk it, maybe I can help.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.840
That's not my mean

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.370
I am just afraid of annoying you.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.850
I have asked for your help for many times.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.180
In addition,...

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.130
If we wanna buld a team, we need a more person.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.920
About me, I haven't play it (basketball) for a long time.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.170
I am worrying.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.840
What is annoying?

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.160
I will be in those empty locations.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.000
About practicing, tonight...

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.360
In the schoolyard, we will jointly practice.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.040
Yes.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.600
So I need to annoy you again.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.690
No problem, we are brothers.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.450
Yes.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.610
Let's take a rest!

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.170
You are so strong!

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.880
Please let me relax for 10 minutes!

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.640
But do you wanna drink anything? I will go to buy

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.680
Yeah, Mirinda please.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.220
But It's not because I'm strong, just because you are old.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.250
Opps

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.850
Damn you, what do you want?

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.920
You're very good!

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.000
But you're still very young, boy!

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.410
Young your head!

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.880
Don't think that you're old than me a year old then you can do everything.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.770
Huh? What did I do?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.680
Basketball is used for throwing into the basket.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.840
Who tell you to sit there, because of you!

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.780
Stop being smooth-tongued like that

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.010
Don't think that you're old than me a year old then you can do everything.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.690
It seems... You really like violence right?

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.400
But I'm not.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.700
Or we can compet together

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.570
Alright, don't think that I'm scared you

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.120
In 5 minutes

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.570
Who can win higher point

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.020
is the winner, ok?

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.210
Ok!

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.570
If you can, come here and pick up the ball

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.700
Here, hey, what are you doing? give it here!
