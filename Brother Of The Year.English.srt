1
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,916
BUCKING BRONCO

2
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,791
Damn!

3
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,166
MIGHTY ELEPHANT

4
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,750
It's a Thai folk song.

5
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,416
-Okay?
-Yeah.

6
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,041
Excuse me.

7
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,583
Pick one.

8
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,916
Hurry.

9
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,625
BUFFALO BILL

10
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,916
Bottoms up!

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,291
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

12
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,416
More, more.

13
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,458
-Good? Okay?
-Okay?

14
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,708
FORCE OF THE TIGER

15
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,041
WOMANIZER

16
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,833
Bottoms up!

17
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,583
INFALLIBLE WOOD

18
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,291
Come in. Make yourself at home. Wait.

19
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,833
Just a sec.

20
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,416
Seriously, you live with your mom?

21
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,791
Yes.

22
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,583
Your mom or wife?

23
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,958
My mom.

24
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,666
That was my mom when she was young.

25
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,291
Where's she?

26
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,875
She's studying abroad.

27
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
Okay, I'll believe you.

28
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,916
The speaker's broken.

29
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,625
Here.

30
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,708
Too bad, right?

31
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,833
There'll be no intro.

32
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,500
We can get straight to the hook.

33
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,250
Holy shit!

34
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,083
We have to call our client
early in the morning.

35
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,791
I thought you'll be coming back on Sunday.

36
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,208
It's now Saturday past midnight,
so it's Sunday.

37
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,708
I see.

38
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,583
That is your mom?

39
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,250
That's my sister.

40
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,000
-Take it off.
-She's just borrowing it.

41
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,291
It's all right.

42
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,708
-Take it off.
-It's mine.

43
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,875
How can you let her wear it?

44
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,291
Who is she? Do you even know her name?

45
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,375
Seriously.

46
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,333
Do you?

47
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,666
What?

48
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,875
What's my name?

49
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,458
It's Aoy.

50
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,833
-What?
-What?

51
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,208
What's my name?

52
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,583
Kate.

53
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,666
Right?

54
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:05,833
Chompoo.

55
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,125
Ann?

56
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,250
No.

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,583
I've been gone for four years.

58
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,208
-Do you do this every day?
-Do what?

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,666
I told you not to bring girls back home.

60
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,666
Why not?

61
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,708
-It's my house too.
-Can't you start using your brain?

62
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,833
Can you?

63
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,791
-Instead of using only your balls.
-Hey, be nice.

64
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,500
Don't mess with the family jewels.

65
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,083
Fine.

66
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,958
-Jane, open it.
-No.

67
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,166
If you want to fool around, do it outside.

68
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,666
Do you understand?

69
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,833
What's with you?

70
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
What now? She already left.

71
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,166
If you don't care about me,
at least care about my friend.

72
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,291
If you do it again,
I'm gonna tell Muay for real.

73
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,333
Okay, fine.
Sorry, Mom. I won't do it again.

74
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,875
Please. I really won't do it again.

75
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,500
That's all.

76
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,208
Sleep outside tonight.

77
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,625
Coochie.

78
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,791
Jane.

79
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,958
It's not funny.

80
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm your older brother!

81
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,916
It's been ages
since anyone's called me that name.

82
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,458
But once Jane's back,
that name returns too.

83
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,291
I really hate that name.

84
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,125
Actually, my name's Chut.

85
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,250
When I was a kid,
I dreamt of having a younger brother.

86
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,958
Uncle, why are you late?

87
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,416
Hurry, Chut. Your mom is in labor.

88
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,291
Hold on tight.

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,416
Hey, John. Little John. My brother.

90
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,791
John doesn't fit the baby anymore.

91
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,916
She's a girl.

92
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,916
It felt like the whole world
was falling down.

93
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,166
Chut.

94
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,250
You're a big brother now.
Love your sister a lot, okay?

95
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,333
I was forgotten.

96
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,541
Everyone doted on Jane.

97
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,583
Uncle, take me to see Seng, please.

98
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,291
Chut, stop bothering me.

99
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,333
And when she got older,
her flawlessness and perfection

100
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,000
made me a total loser in everyone's eyes.

101
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
What’s with your grades, Chut?

102
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,416
Social Studies, math, computer, all Fs.

103
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,250
You even got an F in English.

104
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,666
You're a mixed race!

105
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,291
Are you collecting Fs?

106
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,208
Look here, straight As.

107
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,666
Of course, she's good at everything.

108
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,916
Your reputation has spread

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,791
-around...
-Great, keep it up.

110
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,541
...my brother.

111
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,958
Who would want to be your big brother?

112
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,125
Chut, get out of the way.
We only need a photo with Jane.

113
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,666
Oh, I'm here as her guardian.

114
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,208
Being a big loser of a brother,
what's the big deal?

115
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,750
Could you please move
to the left a little?

116
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,250
No, not that way.

117
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,208
I meant to your left.

118
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,041
A bit more.

119
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,291
More, more.

120
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,083
Perfect. Okay, say cheese.

121
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,333
Damn her.

122
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,875
Just wait, she's gonna get it.

123
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,458
The lowest point of my life was
when I let her play baseball with me.

124
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,041
Fireball!

125
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,666
Hey, Chut.

126
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,500
He's bleeding.
Does anyone have a handkerchief?

127
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,958
It'll be dirty.

128
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,083
This is better.

129
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,208
Laurier really is absorbent.

130
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,416
Is that a chin or a pussy?
It's got a pad stuck to it.

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,750
Pussy.

132
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,125
Hey, don't call him that.

133
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,166
Calling him Coochie is better.

134
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,125
That works.

135
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,250
Coochie. Coochie.

136
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,958
I woke up to a new name, Coochie,
which Jane gave me.

137
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,125
Coochie.

138
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Since when do the younger ones
name their older siblings?

139
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,500
I'm five years older than you!

140
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,083
Coochie, why don’t you
put the food in the bowl?

141
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm too lazy to wash it.

142
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,041
You're so lame even
in the smallest things.

143
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,833
I'm not surprised that your life
has always been lame.

144
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,583
So, all those who eat from a Baggie
are lame too.

145
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,416
Why don't you put
the seat down afterwards?

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,291
She's so fussy with me about everything.

147
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,125
I don't wanna touch your piss, understand?

148
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,333
-You won't. Just touch this.
-How's that not possible?

149
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,833
-I didn't piss on that.
-It must spray--

150
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,416
Do you think I peed like this?

151
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,958
Luckily, I was released from this torture,

152
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,583
when she got a scholarship
to study in Japan.

153
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,416
Coochie, I'm leaving now.

154
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,791
Sayonara.

155
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,791
Sayo-tempura.

156
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:26,791
The day she left to study abroad
was the day I had been dreaming of.

157
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,833
It was heaven!

158
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,000
Four years of total bachelorhood.

159
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,625
Four years.

160
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
Damn!

161
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,208
Why did it go so fast?

162
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,833
Goddamn it!

163
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,291
It's over.

164
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,375
So lame, loser, useless.

165
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,125
Every little girl's fantasy

166
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,041
is to have a big brother,
like the song, "The Best Big Brother."

167
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,208
That song...

168
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,791
So that I could play boyish games.

169
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,666
Just shoot it.

170
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,583
"Arsenal's in the lead."

171
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,958
-Be crazy about football like him.
-You're one point ahead, right?

172
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,666
If you score half a ball, then you win.

173
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,166
-Got it?
-Read the same comic books.

174
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,875
This, then this, and this.

175
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,291
Why do they read
from the back to the front?

176
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,708
Because it's the Japanese way.

177
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,791
-Only this side.
-Get to copy his cool moves.

178
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,666
Or even play baseball with him.

179
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
Fireball!

180
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,166
But having a big brother like Coochie...

181
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,416
Darn it, Jane!

182
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,625
That's mine, don't color on it.

183
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,041
-Can't I?
-No!

184
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,541
Give it back.

185
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,166
Darn it!

186
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,791
That singer is such a liar!

187
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,333
Think about it,
he's five years older than me.

188
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,333
Instead of helping me with homework,

189
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,166
-look.
-Chut.

190
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,333
This year, you have to study with Jane.

191
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,208
And please try to pass this time.
I'm tired of regrading you.

192
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,166
I'm so embarrassed

193
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,416
-to have a big brother like him.
-Loser.

194
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,708
I've been using Excel
ever since I was in fourth grade.

195
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,916
What, fatty? I'll poke you blind.

196
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,458
Miss? May I go to the toilet, please?

197
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,458
If I have to study
in the same class as him,

198
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,791
I'd rather skip class.

199
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,041
When I had to move to Bangkok to study,

200
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,875
Mom put a down payment
on this house for us.

201
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,666
Did you find it?

202
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,375
It's just the two of us.

203
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,958
Instead of the older one
taking care of his younger sibling...

204
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,500
-Here you go.
-...it's me who has to take care of him.

205
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,625
See.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,083
The light works.

207
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,208
Why are you lying there?

208
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,875
What a burden.

209
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,458
The only time Coochie wants
to be the big brother...

210
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,041
is when a guy likes me.

211
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,500
-I'm Bon.
-What Bon?

212
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,291
James Bond?

213
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,625
Bon Jovi?

214
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,041
Just Bon.

215
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,041
Why don't you look trustworthy?

216
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,500
Just Bon.

217
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,875
Are you hitting on my sister?

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,166
Sometimes, I wish I were an only child.

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,333
It's an owl, not a tiger.

220
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,041
You didn't have to scream that loud.

221
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,000
Is the owl your pet?

222
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,333
You should return it.

223
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,291
What now?

224
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,750
The owl.

225
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,416
My client moved abroad.
So, I have to take care of it for now.

226
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,833
So, are you an account executive
or a slave?

227
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,208
I've been trying to send it to them.

228
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,583
What's taking you so long?

229
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,416
I just said that I'm trying.

230
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,916
Why the fuss?

231
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,291
What do I eat it with?

232
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,625
Toast.

233
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,541
Go make your own toast.

234
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,916
Coochie...

235
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,541
No! Gross!

236
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,041
Gross, who's gonna eat after you?

237
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,750
-Gross?
-Yeah.

238
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,625
Gross.

239
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,875
So disgusting.

240
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,750
What?

241
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,250
Why are you all dressed up?

242
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,666
Meditation retreat?

243
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,875
I have a job interview.

244
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,208
Graduating abroad
isn't enough to get a job.

245
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,375
You gotta have style.

246
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,041
I'm off.

247
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,916
Yeah, yeah.

248
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
You're damn cool.

249
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,166
Hi.

250
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,625
I'm here for a job interview.

251
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,166
Please go inside and turn right.

252
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,458
Thanks.

253
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,625
Mr. Kaiwa.

254
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,583
She looks so young.

255
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,166
Will she be able to handle the job?

256
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:39,875
But I like this look.

257
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,583
She looks a bit Caucasian.

258
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,916
I think she understands us, Moji.

259
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,208
Shiruku, smell fresh for seven days.

260
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,083
What are your thoughts on this, Ms. Jane?

261
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:09,416
From the information on the internet,

262
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,375
more men are doing household chores.

263
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,541
I believe they also do their own laundry.

264
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,500
But no one has done

265
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,166
any marketing activities
targeted to this group.

266
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:28,583
But you probably have a missus
who does your laundry, right?

267
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,708
Missus?

268
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,666
I mean wife.

269
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,958
I'm still singer.

270
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,125
You meant single, right?

271
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,541
Single. Super single.

272
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,958
And how about you? Who does your laundry?

273
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,250
Catch!

274
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,958
I do it myself.

275
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,708
It's odd that a beautiful woman
like you is still single.

276
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,708
Or do you have any problems?

277
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,791
Ms. Jane.

278
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,666
Is there something wrong?

279
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,791
Nothing.

280
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,083
It burns.

281
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,333
-Burns?
-Burns.

282
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,291
Burns?

283
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,083
It means that reality hurts.

284
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,166
Well, then I apologize.

285
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,458
It's all right.

286
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,625
It's funny.

287
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,583
I think she's your dream partner.

288
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,875
One more question.

289
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,125
Ms. Jane, do you play baseball?

290
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,958
-What?
-It's our new employee initiation.

291
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,000
What's this feeling?

292
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:21,291
She's one woman who looks so charming
while holding a baseball bat.

293
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,333
Today, I'll show her how cool I am,

294
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,791
and make her my girl!

295
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,458
Are you sure you don't wanna change?

296
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,791
I won't hold back.

297
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,458
Throw it already. It's getting late.

298
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,208
You've got two strikes now.

299
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,750
There's a certain rhythm when swinging.

300
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,333
Think before swinging the bat.

301
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,333
Shit!

302
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,083
Shit!

303
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,833
Did you play often in Japan?

304
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,541
You're good.

305
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,041
When I was a kid,
I used to play with my brother.

306
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,041
I didn't know Thai kids play baseball.

307
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,125
Not really.

308
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,041
But my brother was crazy
about this comic book and played.

309
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,416
So, I was crazy about it too.

310
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,958
The comic book was Sayonara Home Run!

311
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,500
Ryo.

312
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,833
Baseball Thunderclap.

313
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,333
Fireball!

314
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:02,666
Hey, are you two
still trying to make home runs?

315
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,791
Go home.

316
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,291
You know the death moves too.

317
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,791
When I was a kid, I was obsessed.

318
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,458
How come you speak Thai so well?

319
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:55,666
Well, although I grew up in Japan,
my dad is Thai.

320
00:23:56,333 --> 00:24:00,083
But he died when I was young,

321
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,208
so he didn't have a chance to teach me.

322
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:07,458
I had to persevere
and practice on the karaoke.

323
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,166
Persevere.

324
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,291
That's a hard word.

325
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,875
What Thai song uses that word?

326
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,541
Number seven

327
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:20,708
Study hard, persevere

328
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,333
-Don't be lazy
-Oh, yeah!

329
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,833
All good kids

330
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:30,125
Must have ten responsibilities

331
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,833
Snow isn't as fair as this.

332
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,958
I can't believe that you know that song.

333
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,791
Why are you so dressed up?

334
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,791
I'm going to work.

335
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,791
I've been working for a month.
Haven't you noticed?

336
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:55,333
What's for breakfast?

337
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:56,791
There.

338
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,875
You have a meeting with a client today.

339
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,916
Aren't you in a rush?

340
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,916
If it's pouring like this,
my client won't be awake.

341
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,666
What's that?

342
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,041
Your presentation?

343
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,125
-May I see?
-Leave it alone.

344
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:12,916
Stop it.

345
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,541
Nosy.

346
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,250
I hope it sells.

347
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,208
For sure.

348
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,041
Look who you're talking to.

349
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,875
Are you really gonna pitch it like this?

350
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,666
Yeah, they're already different.

351
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,458
Baldy Kaiwa will buy it no matter what.

352
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,833
MUAY

353
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,583
Don't listen to Jane.
You know she hates me.

354
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:48,416
No.

355
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,625
So, what do you want, then?

356
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,708
Well, it's up to you, then.

357
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:55,916
No...

358
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,791
My phone's dying. I'll call you later.

359
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,375
Oops, bye.

360
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,208
Excuse me.

361
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,083
Could you take a look at this?

362
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,333
I'm not sure what I did wrong.

363
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:14,583
It says, "Error."

364
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:18,083
Actually, it's for your Shiruku work.

365
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,041
-What should I do?
-You'll break it. Relax.

366
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,791
That's not right.

367
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,208
Chill.

368
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,291
The paper's stuck here.

369
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,833
Go wait over there, okay?

370
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,000
Am I in the way?

371
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:43,916
Get up.

372
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm getting up.

373
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,208
Move back.

374
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,416
More.

375
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,791
Stand on this. Don't move.

376
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,583
Stand on it.

377
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,375
Yeah.

378
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,833
Don't move.

379
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:07,750
When it says, "Paper Jam,"
snatch it out of this slot.

380
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,041
-And then pull the paper out.
-I see.

381
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:14,416
-I said stand on the paper.
-I am.

382
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,291
Get up.

383
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,708
-You're an intern, right?
-Yeah.

384
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,541
-What's your name?
-Dear.

385
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,708
You're still a student.
Why are you dressed like that?

386
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,125
Why is it so short?

387
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,291
Do you have a hidden agenda?

388
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,958
You can't.

389
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,083
Dress properly. Are you going clubbing?

390
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,625
Let me be myself.

391
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,416
-But you're an intern.
-Don't look, then.

392
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,166
I'm not.

393
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,416
-Don't dress like this. Dress properly.
-You're looking at it.

394
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Okay.

395
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,625
And when it says, "Paper Jam,"
take it out like...

396
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,958
Pull it out like that. Simple.

397
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,708
Close it too.

398
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,208
See, you can't fix it either.

399
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,250
Wait.

400
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,916
Can I get off now?

401
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,416
Morning, Mr. Moji.

402
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
Good morning.

403
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,291
-Hello.
-Hello.

404
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,291
Come in. Have a seat.

405
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,708
-Mr. Moji.
-Yes?

406
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:41,333
Shiruku's new idea really hits home.

407
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,333
-Thank you.
-Targeting male customers.

408
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,875
This audience analysis

409
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,958
-has a lot of vision to it.
-Thank you.

410
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,708
Mr. Moji, you're my dream client.

411
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:53,833
Thank you very much.

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,291
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

413
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,291
Ms. Jane, welcome.

414
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:02,041
This is Ms. Jane, our new brand manager.

415
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,583
She's the one behind this idea.

416
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,458
-This idea?
-That's right.

417
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,958
Hello, everyone.

418
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,375
Mr. Saito assigned me
to be Mr. Moji's assistant.

419
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,958
I'll be taking over
the detergent account from Mr. Kaiwa,

420
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,500
who's taken over
the window cleaner account.

421
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,166
It's great to be a part of the team.

422
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:41,375
Mr. Chutchawin, you're Zono's
account executive, right?

423
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,041
It's Sono.

424
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:47,250
From the brief
that I received from Sirugu--

425
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,083
Hold on, I'm sorry.

426
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,833
It's Shiruku.

427
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,208
Could you also pronounce
our brand correctly?

428
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,541
Okay.

429
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,125
According to Shi-ru-ku's brief,

430
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,958
targeting its male customers,

431
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,666
we have three print ads
for you to choose from.

432
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,916
The first one, a new summer look.

433
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,416
"Convenient for mister, easy for missus."

434
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
The second one.

435
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,833
"Convenient for men, easy for women."

436
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,000
And the last one.

437
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,166
"Convenient for guys, easy for gals."

438
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:27,916
How is it?

439
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,666
I love all three of them.

440
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:41,583
They're all equally good.
It's so hard to choose.

441
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,125
Ms. Jane.

442
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,625
You might think that they're the same,
but they're really different.

443
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay.

444
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:52,625
If using synonyms makes them different,
then it's different.

445
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,208
Next time, you don't have to bother
with choices, then.

446
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,083
Just making a really good one
would be better, Coochie.

447
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,416
Who's that?

448
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:08,666
It's Mr. Chutchawin here.

449
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,708
Back home, we call him Coochie.

450
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,541
Coochie.

451
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:21,500
Oh, you're both from the same town?

452
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,833
We live in the same house.

453
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:29,125
Sometimes, we even share the same bed.

454
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:38,166
We're siblings.

455
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,916
-I see.
-I see.

456
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,041
Let's go inside.

457
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:51,541
Muay.

458
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,791
Jane.

459
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,958
Good morning, Moji.

460
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,083
Good morning.

461
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,583
We finally meet.

462
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,750
Jane always talks about you.

463
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,666
-Yeah.
-Close up for me too.

464
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,750
Sure.

465
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,916
This one will be picked up this evening.

466
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,541
-No problem.
-Thanks a lot.

467
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,291
-Thanks.
-No worries.

468
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,166
-Jane.
-Yes?

469
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:26,833
Well,

470
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,791
I...

471
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,541
want to formally introduce
myself to your brother.

472
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,000
What do you think?

473
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,916
But he already knows you.

474
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,166
But not as his sister's boyfriend.

475
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,416
You don't need to tell Coochie about us.

476
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,416
Why?

477
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,125
Or are you not confident in me?

478
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,291
It's not like that.

479
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,208
I don't want him to be involved.

480
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,416
Just let him be.

481
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,958
He'll find out when it's time.

482
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,791
But we're not doing anything wrong.

483
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,875
Love shouldn't be kept a secret.
If you wanna love, don't hide it.

484
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,791
Love shouldn't be kept a secret

485
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:08,375
If you wanna love, don't hide it

486
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,291
-Make it happen
-We have to make it happen, you know.

487
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,458
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

488
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,875
Oh, my, Moji.

489
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,333
You've been listening
to too many Thai songs.

490
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,625
THIS PERSON IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO INSIDE

491
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,583
Are you upset about anything?

492
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,833
In Japan, clovers have
a very good meaning.

493
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,416
But it also means having secrets...

494
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,833
that can't be said, untold.

495
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,291
-As for lavender...
-Another one.

496
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,458
You used to live in Japan.

497
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,583
Do you know its meaning?

498
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:02,083
It means I have doubts about you.

499
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,666
A whole bouquet.

500
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,291
As for this...

501
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,500
In Japan, there's no other meaning.

502
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,208
It's just our one-month anniversary.

503
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,791
Who's the slut now?

504
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,208
What about you? Skanky?

505
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:05,750
What?

506
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:09,416
I'm just saying
that you've been dressing sluttily.

507
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,708
Why?

508
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,083
What have you been up to?

509
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,166
Nothing.

510
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,166
Nothing.

511
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,500
Why the sharp voice?

512
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:21,666
Coochie.

513
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,416
Have you talked to Muay yet?

514
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,166
-Have you?
-No.

515
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,875
Why?

516
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:30,791
Haven't you seen it yet?

517
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,958
She ranted all over Facebook.

518
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,583
What rant?

519
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,208
"Someone like you isn't a limited edition.

520
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:42,875
Generic. A knock-off, fake,
rip-off, a sissy.

521
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,375
You dick!"

522
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,416
-Did she mention any names?
-No.

523
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,250
Just "#loserchut!"

524
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,708
#LOSERCHUT!!

525
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,333
-Damn Muay, she's--
-Hold it, Coochie.

526
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,291
Don't talk about her that way.

527
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:57,833
Good for her.

528
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,416
Reading it gives me satisfaction.

529
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,791
Muay deserves a better man.

530
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,916
You’re a bad business partner.

531
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,416
As a boyfriend, you're the worst.

532
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,208
And how is kissing in public
better than me?

533
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,333
Wait.

534
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,416
I pecked.

535
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,041
And I pecked my boyfriend.

536
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,750
-Your boyfriend?
-Boyfriend.

537
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,083
-You have a boyfriend.
-Boyfriend.

538
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,666
So? I have a boyfriend, and?

539
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,208
-Hello?
-Hello, Mom.

540
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:24,541
Yeah, what?

541
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,208
I have something to tell you.

542
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:29,291
-What is it?
-Your favorite child, Jane.

543
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,583
She may look all naïve.

544
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,875
But she's really slutty, you know.

545
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,333
She's got a boyfriend now.

546
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,208
-He's Japanese, too.
-What?

547
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,500
Why didn’t she tell me?

548
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,125
You won't approve, right?

549
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:43,708
Wow, she's gone international like me.

550
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,791
You're the one.

551
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,041
Stop bringing home random girls.

552
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,666
-Your sister has moved back.
-Come on, Mom.

553
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,125
She's worse than me.

554
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,541
There is a leaked clip of her.

555
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,708
What?

556
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,166
What clip?

557
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,458
Send it to me.

558
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,416
-Now!
-Okay.

559
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,666
Hello?

560
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,166
PORN CLIPS

561
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,208
Chut?

562
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,000
Have you sent it, yet?

563
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,333
I've sent it.

564
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,291
-Oh, Mom.
-Yeah?

565
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:21,000
-Don't tell her that I told you.
-Okay.

566
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,166
I have to go. I'll watch the clip.

567
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,500
What did you send Mom?

568
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,166
-What are you talking about?
-Here.

569
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,333
Let's watch it together.

570
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,333
I can't believe you tried
sending porn to Mom.

571
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,416
You sent priming instead of porn.

572
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,083
You're so retarded.

573
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:48,083
Make sure there aren't any real ones.

574
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,458
Ouch!

575
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:05,708
As for the clothes,
we've changed it to red

576
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:06,791
as commented.

577
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,666
But I still have one problem.

578
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,333
The location we used

579
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,333
has too much green in it.

580
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,916
It reminds us of our competitor,

581
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,958
the one we want to beat.

582
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,458
But it’s a yard.

583
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,500
Isn't it supposed to be green?

584
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,625
This is redoing the entire storyboard--

585
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,833
-What?
-Mr. Saito said

586
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,541
that the power of the brand's color
is essential.

587
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,833
-So, it's worth changing.
-What?

588
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,583
-Do you want a house without a yard?
-Okay.

589
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:54,583
We'll redo the storyboard
as soon as possible.

590
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Charging tigers!

591
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,250
-Yes!
-Yes!

592
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:04,500
Next, we'll have the production house
send the queues.

593
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,708
The next step, Mr. Gun,

594
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,541
you can have the production house
send the queues.

595
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,791
And if there are any other details,
I'll e-mail you directly, okay?

596
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,875
Okay.

597
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:19,291
It won't take more than a week.

598
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,333
How long will it take?

599
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,333
I said one week.

600
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,833
One week.

601
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,291
Jane.

602
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:31,875
What's with you?

603
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,833
-I'm standing right here.
-Just chill, Chut.

604
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,291
-About one week.
-I see.

605
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:39,833
Okay, Mr. Gun.

606
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:42,791
Do you have a parking ticket?
I'll stamp it for you.

607
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:52,666
Thanks.

608
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:55,291
-Excuse me, I have to go.
-I see.

609
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,583
Okay.

610
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,666
Geez, look at her.

611
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,583
We've already changed
the storyboard thrice.

612
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,458
They're the boss.

613
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:14,791
And their comments
are so damn stupid. Are they crazy?

614
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,833
The yard's supposed to be green.

615
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,083
How can everything be Shiruku red?

616
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,458
They should do laundry
in a Chinese shrine.

617
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,416
Calm down, Chut.

618
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:32,208
If they keep being stupid,
I'll sell this idea to their competitor.

619
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,083
Mr. Chut, you should resign from the team.

620
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,375
Mr. Moji, why are so serious?
I was just kidding.

621
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,833
Thais always joke around like this.

622
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,666
Japanese don't joke around, right?

623
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,541
Even so, this is really a sensitive issue.

624
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,666
If Mr. Saito finds out,
he won't be pleased.

625
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,500
But Mr. Saito doesn't know.

626
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,541
It's just between the two of us.

627
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,791
Are you going to tell Mr. Saito?

628
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,250
I don't have a choice.

629
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,708
It's our company's policy.

630
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:29,833
If you don't resign,
we'll have to dismiss your company.

631
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,708
Why so serious?

632
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,041
Is this what you want?

633
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,666
Be careful. The ending won't be pretty.

634
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,750
The end is the end. It has nothing to do
with being pretty or not.

635
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,916
Right?

636
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:45,583
Whatever.

637
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,000
You better watch out.
I'm gonna get you good.

638
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,916
What do you want me to watch out for?

639
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,750
I'm glad we're now on good terms.

640
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,583
Do you understand what I'm saying?

641
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,958
You make my blood boil!

642
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,333
Blood boil...

643
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,458
-Are you hot?
-What?

644
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,000
Do you want some water?

645
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,083
Is this what you want?

646
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:22,500
I don't think Jane will agree.

647
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,208
Mr. Chut, you know?

648
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,500
You were the guy
in front of the flower shop, right?

649
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,208
My apologies.

650
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:40,833
Actually, I've never liked you.

651
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,500
Don't make me hate you.

652
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:50,208
Because... I can get Jane
to break up with you.

653
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,125
So, what will it be, Moji?

654
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,083
Fine, then.

655
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,166
I'll keep this a secret.

656
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,916
That's it.

657
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,291
There's no need to be so stiff.

658
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,125
Okay. I'm going now.

659
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:26,541
You're gonna get it, tiger!

660
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,166
Moji.

661
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,083
You're worse than him.

662
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:45,166
You didn't punish that guy
because he's your girlfriend's brother?

663
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,500
I think...

664
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,666
you've been in Thailand for too long.

665
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,541
You've become passive.

666
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:58,583
You're not using all your potential.

667
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,166
In two months, there will be
a shuffling of positions.

668
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,958
You will have to go back to Japan...

669
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,166
to the head office.

670
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,708
Start over again.

671
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,250
Relearn our organization's
culture and ethics.

672
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:19,791
You must go back.

673
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,833
Moji, why did you defend him?

674
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:42,291
Don't tell me he told you
he'd make me break up with you.

675
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,500
How did you know?

676
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,958
That's so damn Coochie.

677
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,875
Does he even know what he's done?

678
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,625
What a demon!

679
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,666
But...

680
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,416
I'm relieved...

681
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,125
that Chut finally knows about us.

682
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:38,333
What are we going to do now?

683
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,208
What about the others?

684
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,666
Aren't they coming?

685
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,708
I didn't invite anyone else.

686
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:12,833
Why are you playing only with me?

687
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,291
When you move back,
you'll get to play with better people.

688
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,583
Think of it as a last farewell, then.

689
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,416
Okay.

690
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:32,666
In that case, if I win,
you'll have to take me out.

691
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,166
And if I win...

692
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:39,375
will you marry me?

693
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:46,791
Moji.

694
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,416
Don't do this, please.

695
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,833
If you win, I won't bother you.

696
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,291
I'll do anything you want.

697
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:00,958
It doesn't matter
whether it's been two months or two years.

698
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,791
If it's love, it's love.

699
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,083
Jane, what are you afraid of?

700
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,125
Couples who get married early
have an 80% failure rate.

701
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,500
But if we break up right now,
that'll be 100%.

702
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:20,000
Aren't you going to listen to me?

703
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,541
Fine, then.

704
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,708
If you want to play, then let's do it.

705
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,000
I once thought...

706
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:05,166
this is how I'd propose to you.

707
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:17,625
Thanks.

708
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,791
It's a very sweet proposal.

709
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,083
But...

710
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,583
I'm sorry, Moji.

711
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,458
Jane.

712
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,458
It burns.

713
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,625
RE: CHANGE OF POSITIONS WITHIN THE COMPANY

714
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,625
ATTENTION: SONO ADVERTISING CO., LTD.

715
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:28,708
Shiruku Thailand would like to notify
the shuffling of positions.

716
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:33,583
First, Mr. Mojikawa

717
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:36,958
is to be moved to the Marketing Department

718
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:39,791
at the head office in Japan.

719
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:46,041
Second, we request
Sono Advertising Company

720
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,000
to remove Mr. Chut
from being Shiruku's account executive.

721
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:54,958
To be effective immediately.

722
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,750
SINCERELY YOURS
MS. JENKWAN RIANSUWAN, BRAND MANAGER

723
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,750
MR. CHUTCHAWIN RIANSUWAN IS DISMISSED

724
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:22,708
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS TO ME, FOR REAL?

725
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:35,875
Hello?

726
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,208
Which Aey is this?

727
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,458
Oh, Aey Anyaporn.

728
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,500
About the quotation, right?

729
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,333
Sure. I'll send it to you.

730
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,666
Okay.

731
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,375
CHUT, THE TELEPHONE WIZARD.

732
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:51,208
HE CAN TALK TO A GHOST CALLER.

733
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:55,958
WHICH AEY IS HE TALKING TO NOW?

734
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,166
LAY OFF. HE'S GOT TIME.

735
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,666
MS. JANE'S REALLY CRUEL.

736
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,291
FIRING HER OWN BROTHER.

737
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:12,833
CHUTCHAWIN: I'M STILL IN THE GROUP!

738
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,125
Shit!

739
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,708
Shit!

740
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:33,166
Busy?

741
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,541
No.

742
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,541
It's watching a series or photocopying.

743
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,000
Do you wanna go clubbing?

744
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:40,708
My treat.

745
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:42,541
Okay.

746
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:43,708
Let's go.

747
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,125
This is fun.

748
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,000
I didn't think you're into these places.

749
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,208
Let's come again.

750
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:12,958
Sure.

751
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:17,833
Are you okay?

752
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:20,458
I'm okay.

753
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:25,875
Hey, you're drunk as a skunk.

754
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:27,333
If I slap you, it wouldn't hurt, right?

755
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:28,416
I'm not drunk.

756
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,583
If you don't believe me, try--

757
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,708
-How was it?
-It hurts.

758
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:42,916
My bad.

759
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,250
Are you sober, Coochie?

760
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,458
Don't call me that name.

761
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:52,666
I hate it.

762
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:57,458
Your sister is so pretty, you know.

763
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,083
But she's got such a sharp tongue.

764
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:02,916
When I see you two,
it's like you hate each other.

765
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Actually, I've never hated Jane.

766
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,750
But...

767
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:15,208
I hate myself when I'm with her.

768
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:19,541
Then, you should tell her that.

769
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:21,791
Tell her what?

770
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,041
Well, tell her,

771
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:29,458
"Jane, my dear, I don't hate you, sis.

772
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,416
I just hate myself when I'm with you.

773
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:34,916
I love you, sis."

774
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,583
-Like that.
-That makes me wanna puke.

775
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,208
No?

776
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,583
No way.

777
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,291
Do you have any siblings?

778
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:52,416
You're so damn lucky.

779
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:05,541
Hello.

780
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,583
This way.

781
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:29,666
Sorry for all the trouble.

782
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,208
You could've just left him at the bar.

783
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:35,291
The bar begged me to take him home.

784
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:43,958
He puked up all his guts.

785
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:45,791
He'll sleep well tonight.

786
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,000
Are you really gonna leave him like that?

787
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,583
Don't worry.

788
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,208
He'll wash it off when he wakes up.

789
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,416
Cutthroat.

790
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:09,041
You're not mad at Chut, are you?

791
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,208
Why?

792
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,833
Did he say something?

793
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:16,291
No.

794
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:20,208
He's upset with work, so he's complaining.

795
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,500
But I don't really get it.

796
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,416
When siblings fight,
does it have to be so dramatic?

797
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,833
You're an only child, right?

798
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,875
I'm lucky, right?

799
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,875
Can I ask you a question?

800
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:56,541
Why do you call him Coochie?

801
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:35,291
COOCHIE, DON'T FORGET
TO PICK ME UP FROM THE LASIK CLINIC!!

802
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:19,166
It's me, Moji.

803
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,458
Moji.

804
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,416
Yes?

805
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,333
Thanks for picking me up.

806
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:32,208
I told Coochie, but he probably forgot.

807
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,291
So, I have to bother you. Sorry.

808
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,958
Do you know you're really cute right now?

809
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:44,916
You look like Kamen Rider V8.

810
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,958
Do you know Skyrider?

811
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,083
They've got big bug eyes.

812
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:55,208
Moji, I'm not supposed to laugh.

813
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,041
-Let's go. I'll take you home.
-Wait a sec.

814
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:00,583
I...

815
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,583
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

816
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,333
I do love you.

817
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:10,333
But...

818
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,333
I'm worried about my family.

819
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,583
I'm worried about my mom, auntie,

820
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:18,916
the house, and Coochie.

821
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,541
Please say something.

822
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,958
Are you pouty?

823
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,541
I can't see anything.

824
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,583
I'm not mad at all.

825
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,500
-Really?
-Because I know

826
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,916
how it feels to be far away from family.

827
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,416
So, I've already decided

828
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:43,583
to leave Shiruku and find a new job here.

829
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,250
You don't have to do that for me.

830
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:54,291
Jane, I can live anywhere.

831
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,500
All I need is you.

832
00:58:58,083 --> 00:58:59,958
We don't have to get married right now.

833
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,458
Okay?

834
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:17,625
Don't touch it, you'll infect your eyes.

835
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,416
The doctor will scold you.

836
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,458
-Moji.
-Yeah?

837
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,666
How many kids do you want?

838
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,166
Four.

839
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,208
Maybe two?

840
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,750
The ring?

841
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,000
Well, I have it with me all the time.

842
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,250
I love you, Jane.

843
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:35,750
Your family's already here.

844
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,583
Chut said that he'll be representing
your mom.

845
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,958
You are Jane, right?

846
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:55,416
Ma'am.

847
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,500
You speak Thai very well.

848
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,166
My husband was Thai, that's why.

849
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:06,666
You and Chut can speak Thai with Mum.

850
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,166
She understands but doesn't speak it well.

851
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,750
I can speak, but you probably
won't understand.

852
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Chut and I are the same.

853
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,666
We're mixed race,
but we can't speak French.

854
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,958
Our dad went back when we were young.

855
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,083
You can just tell them that he left us.

856
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,083
Excuse me?

857
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,458
Mom was asking

858
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:56,416
-how many kids we're planning to have.
-I see.

859
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,958
These two are workaholics.

860
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:02,125
If they're gonna have kids,

861
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,750
-they'll have to pump a lot.
-Pump?

862
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:04,958
Pump.

863
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,083
Pump?

864
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,708
Pump! Pump! Pump!

865
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,083
Hey! Why did you step on my foot?

866
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,416
You'll have to give the kids hybrid names.

867
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,541
Like it could be either Thai or Japanese.

868
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,041
For example.

869
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,416
If the Japanese name is Tsubasa,

870
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,916
then we'll call him Surasak in Thai.

871
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,583
Sorry.

872
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,333
-Excuse me.
-That's enough, Coochie!

873
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,791
We can't eat it anymore.
It's now plum soup.

874
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,208
I'm so sorry.

875
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:12,041
All right, let's get to the point.

876
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,166
To marry Jane...

877
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,708
the dowry is ten million.

878
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,458
Coochie!

879
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,750
Baht, not Yen.

880
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,958
Is it normally this much?

881
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:31,791
-I can find it.
-Moji.

882
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,041
Don't listen to him.

883
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:35,791
Then you can't get married.

884
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,500
It's not a problem.

885
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,291
I'll do anything.

886
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,500
All right, then.

887
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,291
So it's settled.

888
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:49,916
Jane.

889
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:51,041
Jane.

890
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:58,125
Jane and I have planned

891
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,416
to get married next month.

892
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:02,625
We're in a rush.

893
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,250
But it should be possible.

894
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,750
We'll be leaving for Japan
one week after the wedding.

895
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:07,875
Your honeymoon?

896
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:09,083
No.

897
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:13,666
Jane decided to move
to Japan with me after the wedding.

898
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:19,541
Why don't I know about this?

899
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,166
-I've already told Mom.
-But she didn't tell me this.

900
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,666
I'm sorry.

901
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,291
I didn't know she'll be moving to Japan.

902
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,958
So, no more marriage.

903
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,416
-Chut.
-Sorry.

904
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,458
Chut.

905
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,083
-Let's go home.
-Chut.

906
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,583
-Let's go.
-Coochie.

907
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:40,750
Let's go.

908
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,125
-Can't we talk first?
-No.

909
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,416
No wedding. Let's go home.

910
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,041
Go.

911
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,416
You have no right
to stop me from getting married.

912
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,958
Why not? Mom said I was representing Dad.

913
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,125
I'm not allowing it.

914
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,625
You have no right.

915
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,708
I know why you're doing this!

916
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,083
You're upset with me and Moji
about work, right?

917
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:17,666
It's got nothing to do with that.

918
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,708
Moji's a loser.

919
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,333
What the hell.

920
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:24,000
He has to move. Why force you to move too?

921
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,625
Is he crazy?

922
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,541
If he wants to marry you, he has to quit.

923
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,458
Hey, Jane!

924
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,625
Think more about it.

925
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,166
It's only been a few months
and now wedding plans?

926
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,416
Are you out of your mind?

927
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,083
Moving to Japan.

928
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,958
How's it gonna last?

929
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,000
You're speechless.

930
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,375
You're not that confident in Moji either.

931
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,500
And you have to think about this.

932
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,041
How are you gonna live over there?

933
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,916
Who's gonna take care of the house?

934
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,166
What about the payments?

935
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:33,750
What now?

936
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,166
Did you not like what I said?

937
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:39,708
You've never done anything
with this house.

938
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:42,625
Me!

939
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,875
It's me that does it all!

940
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:48,750
The dishes, cleaning, laundry.
It's all me!

941
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:51,666
Coochie.

942
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,458
You're so damn selfish!

943
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,583
The reason I've said all this
is because I'm worried about you.

944
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:01,041
Really?

945
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:03,500
I don't think so.

946
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,208
I think you're afraid.

947
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:09,083
You're afraid of not having
your own slave,

948
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:11,166
paying the mortgage.

949
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,375
I'm done talking.

950
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:28,083
Do you know that, at first,
I turned down Moji?

951
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:33,708
Because I was worried...

952
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,750
about how you're going to live
when I'm gone.

953
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:41,416
Do you know what a burden you are?

954
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:44,583
This house.

955
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,208
You haven't even paid for half of it.

956
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,041
Whatever you paid, I'll pay you back.

957
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,708
And I'm gonna sell this house.

958
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,166
And you'll have to live somewhere else.

959
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,250
Don't run me off like some animal.

960
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:09,958
I'm your big brother.

961
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,250
And have you ever acted like one?

962
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,166
You can leave whenever,

963
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:26,416
but we can't live together anymore.

964
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:38,833
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

965
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,458
It's all right.

966
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,583
Let bygones be bygones.

967
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:47,041
I wasn't thinking
when I asked for the dowry.

968
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,583
When people love one another,

969
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:53,666
money shouldn't get in the way
of their feelings.

970
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:56,333
Thank you so much.

971
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,541
Thank you very much.

972
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:07,708
I'm really glad that we're
going to be the same family.

973
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,916
You don't have to worry about Chut.

974
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,458
He's got nothing to do with this anymore.

975
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:19,791
My mom gave me her blessing to marry Moji.

976
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:27,166
My first grandchild
will be as sweet as you.

977
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,541
Are you listening?

978
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,500
JANE

979
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,166
BLOCK THIS CONTACT

980
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,708
Forget it.

981
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,291
It's my wedding gown.

982
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:09,833
For my beautiful daughter-in-law.

983
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:19,041
We're now a family.

984
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:29,541
"Because my husband was Thai."

985
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,333
"Coochie, you have no right!"

986
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:42,416
One, nine, four, zero.

987
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,666
Welcome.

988
01:11:57,125 --> 01:12:00,416
They even play Cuban news
in the comfort room.

989
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,916
It’s awesome.

990
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,833
Try...

991
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:06,916
Wait!

992
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,291
What are you doing?

993
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,666
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

994
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,166
I don't think of you that way.

995
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,875
And all the dates we had together?

996
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,041
What do you think I had in mind?

997
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:34,791
So, you were fishing?

998
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,208
Were you thinking of getting a catch?

999
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,458
Is that it?

1000
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,000
Now what?

1001
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,625
Damn you.

1002
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:56,333
The place wasn't packed, right?

1003
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:57,666
No, it wasn't.

1004
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,125
That's good, so we can go back again.

1005
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:03,791
-Yummy.
-There wasn't a long wait.

1006
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,291
Yeah.

1007
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,208
It's past 2:00 p.m., I can't sell it.

1008
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,541
It's only two minutes after.

1009
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,666
I was here before 2:00,
but that guy was slow.

1010
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,083
I really can't sell it.

1011
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,083
Sir.

1012
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:14,958
I can't close the lid.

1013
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,833
All right, I'll...

1014
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:20,708
Chut.

1015
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,666
This is Mr. Watanyoo
from Thai Life Insurance.

1016
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,708
This is Chut, our top account executive.

1017
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,708
Chut will take care of your account.

1018
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,208
Hello, I'm Chut.

1019
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,958
Hi, I'm Watanyoo. Just call me Yoo.

1020
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,083
Okay.

1021
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,875
Be careful of your cup,
you might spill it.

1022
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:38,791
It's okay.

1023
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:40,458
Did you get wet?

1024
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:41,875
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1025
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:43,500
Get me some tissues.

1026
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,916
My apologies.

1027
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:47,458
Here.

1028
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:52,791
Tissues.

1029
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,791
I looked the other way
with Shiruku's case.

1030
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,333
When they pulled you off the team,

1031
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,000
I thought that was enough punishment.

1032
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:09,791
But what is this?

1033
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,041
You haven't even started your new project,

1034
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,666
and now I've caught you
drinking in the office.

1035
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,166
I'm really sorry.

1036
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,708
Take a week off.
We'll talk when you get back.

1037
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,458
What do you mean, "we will talk"?

1038
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:25,916
I'll be straight with you.

1039
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,000
I don't know which account
I should give you.

1040
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:33,208
When you return
and you still want to work here,

1041
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:37,666
I might have to reduce your salary
or demote you.

1042
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:42,208
Are you trying to get me to leave?

1043
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:45,416
Bingo.

1044
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,583
DAD CLEANS, MOM CARES.

1045
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:53,000
NEW LOOK. SUMMER FRAGRANCE.

1046
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,791
SHIRUKU

1047
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:11,083
Can't you help me?

1048
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,875
No one's called me back.

1049
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,541
What about your boss?

1050
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:16,583
Stupid.

1051
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,583
Who curses clients that often?

1052
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,166
I didn't kill anyone.

1053
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:27,416
Hold on. How did my getting fired
spread to your office?

1054
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:35,291
You better tell them that I quit,
I wasn't fired.

1055
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:37,916
Yeah. That's all.

1056
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,166
Dear.

1057
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:45,791
Yes?

1058
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:52,333
If you're free, please attend.

1059
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:54,708
You can go with Mr. Gun.

1060
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,958
For me?

1061
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,416
Congratulations.

1062
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,958
Thank you.

1063
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,541
How's Coochie doing?

1064
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:11,125
I haven't talked to him lately.

1065
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,166
He moved out to an apartment.

1066
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:19,833
I heard that will be his last week
in the office.

1067
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:27,833
Dear.

1068
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,916
Could you do me a favor?

1069
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:07,166
You got an invitation too?

1070
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:12,583
Are you going?

1071
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,291
It's far, Maha Sarakham Province.

1072
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,041
There isn't an airport either.

1073
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:22,916
You sound like you're not going.

1074
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,166
I'll go.

1075
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,375
Of course.

1076
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,958
It's my sister's wedding.

1077
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:43,041
I'm sending you my friend's contact.

1078
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:45,291
He's looking for an account executive.

1079
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:47,041
Take a look.

1080
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,833
Think of it as a farewell gift.

1081
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,166
Thank you.

1082
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:05,541
You're invited.

1083
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:06,791
What's your name?

1084
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,458
Dear-Raporn?

1085
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,125
Am I right?

1086
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:14,666
Kwan-Ruedear?

1087
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,958
Oh, Duang-Dear.

1088
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:21,083
This one for sure. Dear-Ratee.

1089
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:22,583
Right?

1090
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,125
I think you should attend.

1091
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,708
MAHA SARAKHAM

1092
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,666
THONGCHAI AUTO PARTS

1093
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:51,958
Wow, beautiful.

1094
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,666
You're as beautiful as I was
when I was young.

1095
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:58,875
Are you done?

1096
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:00,750
-Okay?
-So beautiful.

1097
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,208
Here, once more. Tighter.

1098
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,458
Thank you.

1099
01:21:04,708 --> 01:21:07,333
Why hasn't Coochie come back?

1100
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,833
He's not answering my calls.

1101
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:13,958
Please tell him that I miss him.

1102
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,000
I wanna drink beer with him.

1103
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:20,916
Watch your step.

1104
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,500
Jane, look at your mom.

1105
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:26,041
She's Moji's biggest fan.

1106
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:28,750
Look at the camera. That's great.

1107
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,750
Turn left. Then right.

1108
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,041
Like that.

1109
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,958
Quickly. Yes, like that.

1110
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,416
Closer to the groom.

1111
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,916
Yes, that's it.

1112
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:58,416
In and out, in and out

1113
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,833
I can't follow the game

1114
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,083
What's with this song? Bobbing in and out.

1115
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,041
The Ninja song.

1116
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:08,666
Is this the Japanese song
you wanna sing for them?

1117
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,583
I couldn't guess it on my own

1118
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:19,583
Will your brother come?

1119
01:22:25,416 --> 01:22:26,458
Eat up.

1120
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:30,416
Your aunt can start her own comedy club.

1121
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,083
What are you doing?

1122
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,833
Here, let me help.

1123
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,833
-It's hot.
-Thanks.

1124
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:38,291
-No worries.
-Be careful.

1125
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,958
-Let me help.
-Be careful.

1126
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,750
JENKWAN RIANSUWAN

1127
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,791
This is my old PE uniform.

1128
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,708
Do you see it?

1129
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,416
"Jenkwan."

1130
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:06,541
Is that a "C"?

1131
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:07,833
CHATCHAWIN

1132
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,208
Is that Chut's full name?

1133
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,666
You wore his hand-me-downs?

1134
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:13,750
Yes.

1135
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:18,708
Not only his uniforms,
but also all his old clothes.

1136
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,791
I see.

1137
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,416
"Convenient for guys, easy for gals."

1138
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,250
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

1139
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,541
COOCHIE, YOU BETTER COME TO MY WEDDING.

1140
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,458
Joe.

1141
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,208
This work's from last year.

1142
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,083
These are the awards I won.

1143
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:20,041
Our team is very lucky to get
one of Sono's top account executives.

1144
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:21,416
Yes, sir.

1145
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:25,791
As agreed, you can start immediately.

1146
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,416
Already?

1147
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,916
Of course. Why wait?

1148
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,208
Can you start tomorrow?

1149
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,875
Can I start next week?

1150
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,916
I have some business
to take care of at home.

1151
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:41,541
Too bad.

1152
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,833
What's brought you here, Riansuwan?

1153
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:57,208
Good evening, sir.

1154
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:59,666
-Can I go in?
-Sure.

1155
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:22,333
COOCHIE: I'M HERE HANGING OUT AT SCHOOL.

1156
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:23,708
COOCHIE: I'LL BE HOME LATER.

1157
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,000
JANE: WHERE ARE YOU?

1158
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,666
COOCHIE: ON YOUR RIGHT.

1159
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:46,625
There's Thai silk and a handbag in here.

1160
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:49,791
I want you to give it to Moji's mom.

1161
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:52,291
Here.

1162
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:01,541
I can give it to her tomorrow.

1163
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,125
What's the rush?

1164
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,291
Are you drinking again?

1165
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,208
It's not alcohol.

1166
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,625
It's just soda.

1167
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:49,791
Coochie.

1168
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:56,000
I'll be leaving for Kitakyushu next week.

1169
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:03,000
I don't want to leave
while we're still fighting like this.

1170
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,750
I'm sorry...

1171
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,250
for throwing you out of the house.

1172
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,458
You don't need to apologize.

1173
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:18,208
How are you?

1174
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:21,666
Have you been to any interviews, yet?

1175
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:25,958
I might look shabby, but I got an offer.

1176
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,416
I got a new job.

1177
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:41,083
You know,

1178
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,541
actually, I'm very afraid

1179
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:49,541
of marriage and moving to Japan.

1180
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:53,083
Especially when you disapproved of it.

1181
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:59,458
It's not that... I don't love Moji

1182
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:02,416
or afraid he might do something bad to me.

1183
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,041
But Japan...

1184
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:08,291
traveling and living there
are very different.

1185
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,708
Living there...

1186
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,125
is quite stressful.

1187
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:18,583
Are you saying...

1188
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,833
that I've been right all along?

1189
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,083
So much, I'm quite mad.

1190
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:33,250
Don't think too much.

1191
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:38,583
How about...

1192
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,208
you have my blessing to get married
and move there.

1193
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:48,958
Even though you don't need my blessing.

1194
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,500
Says who?

1195
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:56,125
No matter what, I need it.

1196
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,666
You represent Dad.

1197
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:10,541
Do you think Moji and I will last?

1198
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:18,916
Of course.

1199
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,708
Right?

1200
01:29:25,041 --> 01:29:28,458
If you follow the Four Truths of Buddhism,
you'll last.

1201
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,625
What?

1202
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,500
The Four Noble Truths.

1203
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,041
"Mercy, kindness, honesty,
and detachment."

1204
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:36,416
Wait a minute.

1205
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,083
Those are the States of the Mind.

1206
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,833
-Really?
-Yeah.

1207
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:49,750
MERCY, KINDNESS, HONESTY, DETACHMENT

1208
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:53,833
Are you trying to teach me
the Buddhist scriptures?

1209
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,875
You got them mixed up.

1210
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:02,125
It works, right?

1211
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:33,833
I'm gonna go now.

1212
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:44,458
Thanks anyway.

1213
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:46,708
For what?

1214
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:48,291
For coming to my wedding.

1215
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,333
Stop with the flowers.

1216
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:06,416
Stop arranging them for a sec?

1217
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:10,250
Help me carry this to the car.

1218
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:15,416
You're such an obstacle to my transition.

1219
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,583
You know there's no testosterone
left in me.

1220
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:35,250
I'll wait for you outside.

1221
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,166
Here.

1222
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:43,833
Is it necessary?

1223
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:45,083
Just take it.

1224
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,458
I wanna give you one.

1225
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,291
It’s probably leftovers.

1226
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,375
CHUTCHAWIN RIANSUWAN AND FAMILY

1227
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:55,833
What family?

1228
01:31:56,083 --> 01:31:57,166
Are you mocking me?

1229
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,833
If the young one marries first,
the older one will be a spinster.

1230
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:01,666
It's a trick.

1231
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:03,125
Okay.

1232
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,666
I'm going to the hotel now.

1233
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:09,375
You can meet up at 4:00 or 5:00 p.m.

1234
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,000
Come on, Jane. Let's go.

1235
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:19,666
Let's go.

1236
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,791
Oh, my god!

1237
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:48,291
JOE: I'VE ALREADY INTERVIEWED
YOUR BROTHER.

1238
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,166
JOE: DON'T WORRY, I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

1239
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,708
JOE: DON'T FORGET
TO TREAT ME A MEAL. HEHE.

1240
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,958
JANE AND MOJI'S WEDDING CEREMONY

1241
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:11,416
Hello.

1242
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:14,541
Thank you.

1243
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:16,250
-Your gift.
-Thank you.

1244
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,750
One, two...

1245
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,375
Be cheerful!

1246
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:24,666
Hey, Coochie.

1247
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:29,250
-Oh, Seng.
-It's been so long. What's up?

1248
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:30,375
Good, good.

1249
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:33,375
Let's go get tanked inside.
All or nothing.

1250
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,541
They're not serving alcohol, yet.

1251
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,791
Let's warm up somewhere else.

1252
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,791
Hey, why are you parking here?

1253
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:50,333
What the hell?

1254
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:58,541
Have you caught anything?

1255
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:01,958
I got two.

1256
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:03,750
Fish?

1257
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:05,166
Yeah.

1258
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:08,291
Can I buy it?

1259
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,416
The rod?

1260
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:11,583
Yeah.

1261
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:14,000
It's expensive.

1262
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:15,458
How much?

1263
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:17,083
Two.

1264
01:34:17,375 --> 01:34:18,416
Thousand?

1265
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,916
Yeah.

1266
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:23,041
-What?
-I'll throw in the bait too.

1267
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:25,750
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1268
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,958
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1269
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:30,416
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1270
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,291
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

1271
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:36,166
Thanks to the chairman of the ceremony.

1272
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:38,958
But the ceremony isn't over yet.

1273
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:41,291
According to Japanese tradition,

1274
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,958
the bride will read her letter
to her family.

1275
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,666
Put your hands together for Jane!

1276
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:59,833
Before I read my letter,
I'd like to tell everyone here

1277
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,458
even though we've been together
for a couple of months,

1278
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:04,416
I'm not pregnant.

1279
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,875
My letter to my family.

1280
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,833
I know that my family isn't perfect.

1281
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:29,500
When I was born, there was only my mom,

1282
01:35:30,375 --> 01:35:32,041
who's a bit stingy.

1283
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:36,416
And my aunt

1284
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:38,666
who remains single
and won't leave my mom's side.

1285
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,541
She got you too.

1286
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:42,791
Mom and Auntie are both strong women,

1287
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:47,458
raising two naughty kids
to be the adults we are today.

1288
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:51,208
I've never built a family before.

1289
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:54,541
I don't know how hard it'll be,

1290
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:57,958
but I think it must be very hard.

1291
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:07,833
By the time we catch any fish,

1292
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,458
I'll be eaten alive by the mosquitoes.

1293
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:14,875
Can I really ask you?

1294
01:36:15,375 --> 01:36:17,541
Don't you want to go--

1295
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:27,916
MOM

1296
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:30,041
Thank you, Mom.

1297
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:32,416
Every time I was in trouble,

1298
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:35,875
-Is Coochie really not coming?
-...Mom always helped me out.

1299
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,333
No matter which path I've chosen,

1300
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,541
Mom has always supported me.

1301
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,208
I should go.
My wife must be looking for me.

1302
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:44,958
Will you take my wedding gift?

1303
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,541
I don't know what happened
with the two of you.

1304
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,166
But...

1305
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:54,416
people only get married once, dude.

1306
01:36:57,791 --> 01:37:02,166
I might have to build my family
in a far-off place,

1307
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:06,916
but I want everyone here to know

1308
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:11,000
that you are my family.

1309
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:14,166
I will be my mom's daughter,

1310
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:16,541
my auntie's niece,

1311
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:19,708
and...

1312
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:30,541
Coochie.

1313
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:36,708
He's been an influence
ever since I was a kid.

1314
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:37,833
JENKWAN TAKAHASHI

1315
01:37:38,416 --> 01:37:41,083
I like reading Japanese comics
because of him.

1316
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:45,416
When I grew up,
I always liked Japanese stuff.

1317
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:47,416
I studied in Japan,

1318
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:51,708
and I even have a husband
that's half-Japanese.

1319
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:57,291
And now that I'm married,
I'm going to move to Japan.

1320
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:00,208
All of this

1321
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,458
is because of Coochie.

1322
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:05,583
And look.

1323
01:38:06,291 --> 01:38:08,375
It's his own sister's wedding,

1324
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:11,416
yet, I don't know where he is.

1325
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:19,291
Can I stop being his sister?

1326
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:25,875
But even if he might be
the lamest big brother...

1327
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:31,458
there's no way we can stop being siblings.

1328
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:40,583
I'll try to find Chut. I'll be back.

1329
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:08,083
Did you find him?

1330
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:11,458
I couldn't find him.

1331
01:39:29,416 --> 01:39:30,833
Holy shit!

1332
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:32,541
Eighty missed calls!

1333
01:39:32,791 --> 01:39:34,083
I'm dead!

1334
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:37,541
Coochie, dude. Hurry!

1335
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:41,708
TWO MISSED CALLS

1336
01:39:57,458 --> 01:39:58,458
Where have you been?

1337
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:01,666
Why didn't you go
to your sister's wedding?

1338
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:21,125
Here.

1339
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:24,291
Did you know
she left the house in Bangkok to you?

1340
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:26,708
And look what you did.

1341
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:37,333
Does this make you feel good?

1342
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,250
Giving me the house.

1343
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:51,208
Finding me a job!

1344
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:53,708
Will you ever stop looking down on me?

1345
01:40:55,125 --> 01:40:57,416
"Coochie can't find a job on his own."

1346
01:40:58,083 --> 01:40:59,083
Right?

1347
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:03,041
It's embarrassing.

1348
01:41:04,916 --> 01:41:07,375
Having my sister asking others for a job.

1349
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:14,416
You're better than me.
Better at everything.

1350
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,458
Everyone knows.

1351
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:19,541
You don't have to try so hard.

1352
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:23,000
Yeah.

1353
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:24,541
I suck.

1354
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:28,041
I'm a loser, I know.

1355
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:30,833
So what?

1356
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:36,708
When you're gone,

1357
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,291
it'll be my problem
if I sleep on the streets.

1358
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:40,333
Chut.

1359
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:42,208
Jane's just trying to help.

1360
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:44,750
-She's worried about--
-I'm talking to my sister, not you.

1361
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:45,916
Coochie.

1362
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:49,000
That gift for his mom.

1363
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:51,791
Why?

1364
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:55,583
Are you afraid I'll give her
something crappy?

1365
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:02,916
We all have to attend your wedding,
or else you'd lose face?

1366
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,583
I'm not really wanted there, right?

1367
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,583
I know you've never been proud of me.

1368
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:16,958
I know.

1369
01:42:18,333 --> 01:42:20,458
Having a brother like me.

1370
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:22,000
Is it very embarrassing?

1371
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:29,666
If so...

1372
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,083
we don't have to be siblings anymore.

1373
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:36,958
That's all.

1374
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,666
Should I go after him?

1375
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:56,583
It's okay.

1376
01:42:56,666 --> 01:42:57,791
It's okay.

1377
01:44:33,458 --> 01:44:35,166
Hello.

1378
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:43,583
Once I got settled here,

1379
01:44:44,041 --> 01:44:46,208
Japan really isn't that stressful.

1380
01:44:46,291 --> 01:44:47,791
Honey, I'm home.

1381
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,375
Welcome back.

1382
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,333
Bon appétit.

1383
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:54,291
-Please eat up.
-Thank you.

1384
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:57,916
I'm off.

1385
01:44:59,666 --> 01:45:01,791
It wasn't that easy at first.

1386
01:45:01,875 --> 01:45:03,750
Some Thai dessert?

1387
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:04,916
Thai dessert?

1388
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,416
-Sticky rice.
-Sticky rice.

1389
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:08,833
-Rice.
-Rice.

1390
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:12,125
It gradually got better.

1391
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:21,875
I'm home.

1392
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:25,416
-Let me help.
-It's all right.

1393
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:27,500
How are you, little one?

1394
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:38,291
-Hello!
-Hello!

1395
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,541
I got you a mobile.

1396
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,166
It makes noise too.

1397
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:46,208
My family gradually got bigger.

1398
01:45:46,291 --> 01:45:50,791
If you think about it,
it's almost perfect.

1399
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:08,666
Cheers.

1400
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:14,416
-Okay?
-Yes.

1401
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:21,750
We have to use this, don't we?

1402
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:26,708
-Here, do this first.
-And it won't...

1403
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:43,458
-Like this is good.
-Good.

1404
01:46:43,541 --> 01:46:44,708
-That's enough.
-It's faded...

1405
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:47,791
-Hello.
-Hello, Ms. Dear.

1406
01:46:49,833 --> 01:46:51,875
Please come wait inside.

1407
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:53,208
Yes, Ms. Dear?

1408
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:01,791
How are you, Ms. Dear?

1409
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:05,833
Chut, how long has it been
since we last met?

1410
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:07,625
Jane's wedding, right?

1411
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:09,500
-Yes.
-What do you mean yes?

1412
01:47:09,708 --> 01:47:11,083
You didn't even make it.

1413
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:14,291
Hey, perfect timing.

1414
01:47:14,416 --> 01:47:16,750
I'll be going to Japan for work.

1415
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:19,541
Which city is she in?
I might meet up with her.

1416
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:23,458
Some city. I've never been there.

1417
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:25,416
Some city?

1418
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:33,041
Nothing.

1419
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:37,916
Seriously, have you ever visited Jane?

1420
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:40,875
Don't you want to visit your nephew?

1421
01:47:41,541 --> 01:47:43,541
How long has it been?

1422
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,791
When was the last time you saw her?

1423
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:47,916
Wow, Chut.

1424
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:53,416
I must say you really are a lame brother.

1425
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:54,541
What?

1426
01:47:55,583 --> 01:48:00,083
I think Jane would like to see
her big brother.

1427
01:48:09,208 --> 01:48:11,458
When the bat hit him,

1428
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:14,708
can you believe
that I didn't even know myself?

1429
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:17,708
-It was funny at first.
-Chut.

1430
01:48:18,708 --> 01:48:20,875
-Chut!
-But after he didn't wake up,

1431
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:23,875
-I was frightened. A part of me thought,
-Chut!

1432
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:26,500
"How would it be if he really died?"

1433
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:28,291
Everyone shut up!

1434
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:30,208
Call an ambulance.

1435
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:38,750
Thinking back, he only busted his chin.

1436
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,458
But that day,

1437
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:46,833
I cried all the way from school
to the hospital.

1438
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:49,125
Chut, wake up.

1439
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,791
It was the most tragic moment in my life.

1440
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,166
Wake up, Chut.

1441
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:55,916
He's like a burrito.

1442
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:08,791
I'm jealous of people with siblings.

1443
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:51,458
SO AWESOME

1444
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:01,875
COOCHIE

1445
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:12,916
YOU CAN DO IT, COOCHIE, FIGHT ON!

1446
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:20,291
SUPER COOCHIE FIREBALL!!

1447
01:50:35,583 --> 01:50:37,041
CHATCHAWIN RIANSUWAN AND FAMILY

1448
01:50:45,583 --> 01:50:48,458
JENKWAN RIANSUWAN
MOJIKAWA TAKAHASHI

1449
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:59,916
"DON'T GET TOO DRUNK.
YOU HAVE TO SEND ME OFF TONIGHT."

1450
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:13,458
Mom.

1451
01:51:13,708 --> 01:51:15,708
-Auntie.
-Moji.

1452
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:17,500
How are you, son?

1453
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,833
-I miss you.
-I miss you, too.

1454
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:21,083
My turn.

1455
01:51:21,166 --> 01:51:23,291
-How are you, Auntie?
-I'm great.

1456
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:27,541
Say hello to Grandma.

1457
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:30,166
Let me see. Who is this?

1458
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:34,958
-She's got pretty eyes.
-Jane.

1459
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:37,125
Look who's here.

1460
01:51:38,916 --> 01:51:40,916
Oh, my beautiful grandson.

1461
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,916
Who's this? Who's this?

1462
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:54,541
Come to Grandma.

1463
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,291
Come on, baby.

1464
01:51:57,125 --> 01:51:58,041
Jane.

1465
01:51:58,458 --> 01:51:59,666
I'll take care of it.

1466
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:01,625
You stay here.

1467
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:22,958
Let's see. Go see your uncle.

1468
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:24,958
Hey, Coochie, try holding your niece.

1469
01:52:25,958 --> 01:52:28,750
-I don’t know how, Mom.
-Come on. Give it a try.

1470
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:31,166
Give it a try.

1471
01:52:33,875 --> 01:52:36,041
Say hello to your uncle.

1472
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,791
Look at her face.

1473
01:52:40,708 --> 01:52:42,166
She's not gonna hurt, right?

1474
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:48,833
Don't cry.

1475
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:52,875
She's still looking at her uncle.

1476
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:57,291
She must really love him.

1477
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:59,125
She must love him, doesn't she?

1478
01:53:02,166 --> 01:53:04,708
Mommy, I'm home!

1479
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:08,625
Hello, Grandma.

1480
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:11,208
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

1481
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:12,333
Ryo-chan.

1482
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:16,041
That is Uncle Coochie.

1483
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:18,083
Say hello to him.

1484
01:53:19,208 --> 01:53:21,916
Hello, Uncle.

1485
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:29,750
-That's great.
-That's great.

1486
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:33,041
JENKWAN RIANSUWAN

1487
01:53:44,583 --> 01:53:45,625
Come here.

1488
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:57,083
Ryo-chan, right?

1489
01:53:58,125 --> 01:53:59,208
Right?

1490
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:03,291
You're a big brother now.

1491
01:54:13,291 --> 01:54:14,916
You have to love your sister a lot.

1492
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:17,208
Okay?

1493
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,333
Mommy.

1494
01:54:37,166 --> 01:54:39,750
What did Uncle say?

1495
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:07,625
Fireball!

1496
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:14,833
Come on.

1497
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:25,083
Yay, I caught it.

1498
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,083
Scene 58.

1499
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:23,583
Take...

1500
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:25,791
-Cut.
-Cut five. Take three.

1501
01:57:26,125 --> 01:57:27,083
Action.

1502
01:57:38,458 --> 01:57:39,458
Cut.

1503
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:41,541
Chut didn't see me, right?

1504
01:57:42,458 --> 01:57:43,916
He didn't know it's you.

1505
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:47,208
Jane.

1506
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:49,166
I got phlegm.

1507
01:57:53,125 --> 01:57:54,083
Ouch!

1508
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:55,791
Ouch!

1509
01:57:55,958 --> 01:57:58,625
-I'm sorry. Oh, my god!
-She got my eye.

1510
01:57:58,708 --> 01:57:59,666
Sorry.

1511
01:57:59,750 --> 01:58:01,666
Coochie, next week...

1512
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:04,958
I forgot the city's name.

1513
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:06,083
Kitakyushu.

1514
01:58:06,166 --> 01:58:07,583
Kitakyushu.

1515
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:08,666
Action.

1516
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:10,666
Next week...

1517
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:13,833
I'll be moving to Katakoshi.

1518
01:58:16,166 --> 01:58:18,041
She's just making up names.

1519
01:58:18,458 --> 01:58:19,541
Dear-Raporn?

1520
01:58:19,875 --> 01:58:21,791
Kwan-Ruedear? Dear-Ratee?

1521
01:58:22,583 --> 01:58:23,791
Dear-Thikamporn?

1522
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:26,208
Dairy queen?
Oh, Dear who lives in Rangsit?

1523
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:27,958
Action.

1524
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:36,666
For example,

1525
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:39,583
a name like...

1526
01:58:40,166 --> 01:58:41,458
Tsubasa or something.

1527
01:58:43,708 --> 01:58:45,041
Tsubasa or something.

1528
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:50,375
There are bones.

1529
01:58:52,916 --> 01:58:54,458
Oh no! There're bones?

1530
01:59:05,416 --> 01:59:08,583
Is this the Japanese song
you're going to sing for them?

1531
01:59:08,666 --> 01:59:09,833
Yeah!

1532
01:59:09,916 --> 01:59:11,208
Whatever.

1533
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:15,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1534
01:59:16,291 --> 01:59:17,458
I do.

1535
01:59:23,125 --> 01:59:24,791
I forgot my lines.

1536
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:29,166
Damn it. What's next?

1537
01:59:29,708 --> 01:59:31,500
I was wondering why
you were scratching so long.

1538
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:34,750
-I couldn't think.
-Scene 42, cut 4, take 2.
