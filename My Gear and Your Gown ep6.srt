00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,921
Why?

4
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,190
Because I won't do it again.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
Ball didn't do it last time.

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,800
Come on. I won't do it again.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,960
Right.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,960
Hey!

9
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,200
Itt!

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,760
Be careful, man!

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Sorry.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,319
Come on, Itt. Join us.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,920
Itt, listen to me first.

14
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,599
Hold on.

15
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,200
Itt, wait for me.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,640
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,080
I know you care about Pang.

18
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,959
I understand you,
but you still have to study with me.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,000
If you don't leave, I will.

20
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,720

36
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,839
So what's your problem with Itt?

37
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,279
Nothing.

38
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,600
Do you still see me as your friend?

39
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,320
He is angry at me.

40
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,810
-Where are you taking me?
-Just walk.

41
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,279
What's going on between you two?

42
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,839
Stay out of it.

43
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,200
Do you guys still think of me
as your friend?

44
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,250
Itt, there's nothing going on
between me and Pang.

45
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,161
I don't know why she did that.

46
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,519
But I've never thought...

47
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,680
...and will never think of your girlfriend
that way.

48
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,181
Yes, I know that.

49
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,302
What?

50
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,040
She likes rich people.

51
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,821
And you are rich.

52
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,382
I guess she wanted to have you.

53
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,341
You knew?

54
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,471
Yes.

55
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,680
You knew this,
but you're still mad at him?

56
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,159
You can hate me.

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,480
But don't forget that I am useful to you.

58
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,880
I can help you
get into engineering school.

59
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, that's why I went to your house.

60
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,981
Hold on.

61
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,902
Itt, I'm confused.

62
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,600
So you knew.

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,720
You're not mad.
You'll go to school as usual.

64
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,080
But when he asks to tutor you,
why do you make that face?

65
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,440
Well, I...

66
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,640
I...

67
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,720
I don't know how to start with him.

68
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Come on, man.

69
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,600
What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
The whole thing is my fault.

71
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm mad at myself because I need him
to do everything for me.

72
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:28,799
Even though he didn't do anything wrong,
he still tried to make it up to me.

73
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,880
I'm mad...

74
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,479
...that I let Pang mess with him.

75
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,039
And I'm mad...

76
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,640
...that I don't know
how to start a conversation with him.

77
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,760
Man.

78
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,800
Itt, you big oaf.

79
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,520
You're as dense as a brick.

80
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,239
I can't believe you.

81
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,519
Come on, Itt.

82
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,000
You just don't know how to approach him.

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,400
Do you have any idea
how much you've messed with his head?

84
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,719
-What?
-Yes.

85
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:09,760
A good kid like him
ran away from his parents...

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
...to make it up to you.

87
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,119
-Really?
-Really.

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Well, I don't like to be misunderstood.

89
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Right.

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Either way, you're still guilty.

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,679
What are you saying?

92
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,720
That friend of yours told Pang
to make up to me.

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,719
You knew about that?

94
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:33,880
Yes.

95
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,400
I just pressured her a little
and she told me.

96
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,840
I understand, but I won't forgive you.

98
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,559
Then, what do you want me to do?

99
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,439
Tutor me again.

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,919
I knew it.

101
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,599
Either way, I'm still smarter than you.

102
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,640
Oh, you little...

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,560
No, no, wait.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,159
Whoa.

105
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,021
Pai's sure got a mouth on him.

106
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,121
But it's the truth, man.

107
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,581
Oh!

108
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,661
Hey.

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,439
A nerd on the outside,
a bad boy on the inside.

110
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,560
All right, all right.

111
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
Very well.

112
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
Now that you two have made up...

113
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,200
...let me see you hug.

114
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,279
-Yes.
-You've made up, right?

115
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,559
-Come on.
-Show me.

116
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,119
What are you smiling at?

117
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,759
-Yes.
-Man.

118
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,280
Come on. Show me.

119
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:41,839
Wow, wow, wow.

120
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
Wow.

121
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,119
Wait for it.

122
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,250
All right, all right.

123
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,800
-This is funny.
-Good for you.

124
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
-Good for you.
-Whatever.

125
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,839
Hey, wait.

126
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,959
I think it's too quiet.

127
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,290
How about some music?

128
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,079
-I got it.
-There you go.

129
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,359
Let's see, Itt's taste in music.

130
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,920
Let me guess, EDM?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
Bring it on, man.

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,359
Definitely, EDM.

133
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,410
Now!

134
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,999
-Whoa...
-Whoa...

135
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,400
This is nice, man. It has a good vibe.

136
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,199
Give me a hug too.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,799
-Well...
-I'm happy they made up.

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,799
Do you like this song?

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes.

140
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,560
Look at them.

141
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,880
I know.

142
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,839
My friends are happy. I am happy.

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,239
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,319
I know.

145
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,290
The weather is nice.

146
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,400
It is.

147
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,040
What are you saying about me?

148
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,719
-What?
-I heard you.

149
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,639
I saw you talking.

150
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,080
-I haven't finished.
-Give me a smile.

151
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,760
Give me a smile.

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,440
Give me a smile.

153
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,199
-Cute.
-All right, enough.

154
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,439
-Let's go home.
-Right.

155
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,280
I still remember the first day
I moved here.

156
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,160
Mom said I would have plenty of space
to run around.

157
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,319
Back then, we lived in an apartment.

158
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,370
It was so cramped.

159
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,400
But, honestly, it was kind of warm.

160
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,360
Your mother was a brilliant woman.

161
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,160
Yes, she was brilliant.

162
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,400
She worked so hard to get this house.

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,520
Which is why I have to hold on
to this house.

164
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,880
Because it belongs to my mother and me.

165
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,440
You can do it.

166
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,079
I can, if you help me.

167
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
I will help you.

168
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,040
How's that?

169
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,719
Am I good at choosing friends?

170
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,839
Am I as smart as you now?

171
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,160
I got you.

172
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:40,199
All right.

173
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,840
-Good night, man.
-Night.

174
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,359
Hey, do we have any homework?

175
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,560
I already finished mine.

176
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
Did you do your homework yet?

177
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,560
I haven't done mine yet.

178
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,599
Why's that?

179
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,400
Hey, can I copy your homework?

180
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
I know you were...

181
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,719
-...busy playing video games.
-Yes, I was busy playing video games.

182
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm addicted to video games.

183
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
I completely forgot about my homework.

184
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
-Hey, Waan!
-Oh!

185
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,040
-Come at me, man.
-Guys!

186
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
I'm here!

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,319
-Dude!
-Come here.

188
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,520
-Let's go.
-Go.

189
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,520
I'll get you.

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
(Longlao School Grade 12 Room 1
Counselor: Mr. Panuwat Im-aimsuk)

191
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,639
All right.

192
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,639
First question.

193
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,559
The sugar component of DNA
is called what?

194
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
A sugar called deoxyribose.

195
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,080
That's correct. Okay.

196
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
What are the bonds
between nitrogenous bases...

197
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,520
...in DNA called?

198
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,639
-Go ahead.
-Hydrogen bonds.

199
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,800
That's correct. Okay.

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,280

(Exit Ticket)

202
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,400
Write down the notes.

203
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Come on.

204
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
Where are we?

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Page three.

206
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,600
Paragraph two.

207
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,439
The players on our team are small.

208
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,319
We have to use our speed.

209
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,600
-Come here first.
-Suppose you pass the ball here.

210
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,839
-The goalkeeper is here.
-That's right.

211
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,280
This one passes the ball.

212
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,761
Suppose this one comes forward.

213
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,560
This one moves up and passes the ball.

(Bishop/Knight Club)

215
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,839
Take a look at this.

216
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,039
This one.

217
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,040
Look at the question.

218
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,319
And try to solve this one.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,160
Let me try.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,839
I'm working on it.

221
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,199
I'm paying attention.

222
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,280
That's it.

223
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,959
Come here.

224
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,839
I can fight back.

225
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,000
-What?
-Come here.

226
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,200
Look at the question.
Do I really have to explain it?

227
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,600
That's a polynomial equation.
Now, what is a linear equation?

228
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,439
That's it.

229
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,239
-Continue your lesson.
-All right. Just hold on.

230
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,959
Look at the chemical equation of...

231
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,800
When burned in oxygen,

232
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,839
how should you write the product
of this chemical reaction?

233
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,400
Equilibrium...

234
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
What?

235
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
Stop.

236
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,440
My teacher gave us so much homework.

237
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,200
Dude, my classes are way harder
than yours. One, two, three.

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,999
I have three subjects.

239
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,200
-Really?
-My brain hurts already.

240
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
Yes.

241
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
You fell asleep.

242
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,200
Just go home and do it.

243
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
Sure, I will.

244
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,239

245
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,719
-Hello.
-Hello.

246
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,839
See you.

247
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,080
-See you.
-Bye.

248
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,560
-Get home safely.
-Do your homework.

249
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,639
-I will.
-I will.

250
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,839
Yes, dad.

251
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,439
I'll copy yours
if I forget to do it, okay?

252
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
How bossy.

253
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,879
Dude, I have to finish my homework.
How boring.

254
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,959
So do I. Relax.

255
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,919
No rush. Just chill out.

256
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,881
-You always do, Itt.
-I want to be smart like you, Waan.

257
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,741
-Let's go.
-I'll pay a taxi fare for you.

258
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,581
Okay.

259
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,799
I need to brag about this.

260
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,679
Look at how proficient I am.

261
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,199
I can't read it.

262
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,319
These are my cumulative scores.

263
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,280
I've requested all of them
from all of my teachers.

264
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,199
What a liar. They told you before,
but you didn't write them down.

265
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,570
My point is...

266
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,199
...that I passed all my subjects.

267
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,399
Aren't I smart?

268
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,399
Right.

269
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,570
What?

270
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,119
But if you want to get
into the faculty of engineering,

271
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,599
you have to be smarter.

272
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,719
What?

273
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,941
You need to reach their entry score.

274
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:25,381
Passing the exam isn't enough,

275
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,312
especially if you want
to get into your chosen university.

276
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm aware of that.

277
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,199
-You're such a downer.
-Don't be so hard on him.

278
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,810
He'll start his tutoring sessions
at university next week.

279
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,200
He'll humiliate himself
if I'm not hard on him.

280
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,560
What you said is completely true.
I totally agree.

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,800
Did you just slip?

282
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,439
-Easy, dude. I'm your friend.
-Okay.

283
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,519
Okay.

284
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,400
It's true,
and you need more tutoring sessions.

285
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,680
I already have a session every day.

286
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,490
I think that it should be two hours a day.

287
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,810
Darn, I can barely handle an hour.

288
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,360
His brain will explode.

289
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,520
Definitely.

290
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:13,520
I'm sorry, dude.

291
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
Fun time is over.

292
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,199
Shut your mouth.

293
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,280
What?

294
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
Did I say it wrong?

295
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,359
I don't care.

296
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,359
My scores are good.

297
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,399
Lucky you're sitting across from me.

298
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,080
Do you think that you're so great?

299
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,520
Look at my friend here.

300
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,970
Let's show them.

301
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,970
I'm ready.

302
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,199
-Yellow.
-Color.

303
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,359
-Mango.
-Fruit.

304
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,439
Turtle.

305
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,519
Mutant ninja.

306
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,000
-What's next?
-Knife.

307
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,040
Samurai.

308
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,080
So?

309
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,250
We're good, right?

310
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,639
You look stunned.

311
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,239
Speechless.

312
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,600
Pai, I think
that I should find you some pearls.

313
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,279
Why?

314
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,879
To cast pearls before swine.

315
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,730
He won't make it.

316
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,439
Find the colorful ones.

317
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,600
Sure.

318
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,919
He's sleeping like a log.

319
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,040
He is.

320
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,879
Oh!

321
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,119
That hurts.

322
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,360
Is he waking up?

323
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,840
What?

324
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,570
Who said that they were going
to pay attention?

325
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,199
Sorry.

326
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,080
Go and freshen up yourself.

327
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,839
Okay.

328
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,120
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,570
Can you guys go home late tonight?

330
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,399
Sure.

331
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,080
You have to finish this book.

332
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,360
Look at him.

333
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,760
He's so sleepy.

334
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,599
Are you okay?

335
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,880
Unbelievable.

336
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,759
Poor him.

337
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,800
-So?
-Let's go.

338
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Pai, we're going.

339
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,519
-Okay.
-See you.

340
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,970
-Bye.
-Guys.

341
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,679
Can you tell the teacher
that we'll be in this room until late?

342
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,239
Sure.

343
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,760
-See you.
-See you.

344
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,330
-Bye.
-Bye.

345
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm back.

346
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,199
Let's continue.

347
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,280
-Continue?
-Yes.

348
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay.

349
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,400
Where are all the teachers?

350
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,570
Dude, just leave a note.

351
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:22,759
(Bishop guys
will use the room until late.)

352
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,919
Wow.

353
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,120
Matched.

354
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,719
What?

355
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,199
Hot stuff.

356
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,320
She's in the school.

357
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,639
She's only 100 meters away.

358
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,719
Let's go.

359
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,400
To where?

360
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,599
To keep me company.

361
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,050
If I don't like her...

362
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,359
...you're welcome to have her.

363
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,159
-Really?
-Yes.

364
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,199
Let's go.

365
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,520
Let's go.

366
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,239
Close the door.

367
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,320
(Bishop guys will use the room until late.
We'll lock up ourselves. Witsanu.)

368
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,279
Let's start.

369
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:11,439
There are three types of arithmetic mean.

370
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,320
The first one is the one
with distributed frequency.

371
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,719
The second is the one
without distributed frequency.

372
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,279
Okay.

373
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,999
Use this formula for the one
with distributed frequency.

374
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,679
Fx is the frequency...

375
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,040
...and Xi is the middle point.

376
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,639
The third one is weighted arithmetic mean.

377
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:35,120
You use this X = A + I.

378
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,679
And this parentheses.

379
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,800
Hey.

380
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,720
Yes.

381
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,839
Some expressions
equal the maximum value.

382
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,360
A is the middle point,
and the median average...

383
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,999
...is...

384
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,040
...the middle number.

385
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,800
We call it Med or Median.

386
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
Do you understand?

387
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,719
Hey.

388
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,560
(Knight Club)

389
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,439
(Every problem has a solution.)

390
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,760
Wake up, Itt.

391
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,279
It's already 10 PM.

392
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,080
Go home.

393
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Okay.

394
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Let's go home.

395
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,239
Come on.

396
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Darn.

397
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,679
It's locked from the outside.

398
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Darn.

399
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,800
So what do we do now?

400
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,400
You tell me.

401
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,600
I don't want to tell my parents.

402
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,080
I don't want to get in trouble.

403
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,000
Then tell them that you're sleeping
at your friend's place tonight.

404
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,320
What about you?

405
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,439
No one cares about me.

406
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,919
Okay.

407
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,199
How about we continue?

408
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
You sound so depressing.

409
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,640
All right. Let's do it.

410
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,880
I can barely keep my eyes open,
so I'll lie down and listen to you.

411
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,959
(Every problem has a solution.)

412
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,879
We're looking for the median average.

413
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,560
We call it Med.

414
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,839
There are two types,
with and without distributed frequency.

415
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,080
The formula is M + 1/2.

416
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,441
For the median
with distributed frequency,

417
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:50,081
you have to create
the cumulative frequency...

418
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,521
...and find the position of the median,

419
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:54,919
which equals N/2
in order to identify class interval...

420
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,199
...and find the Med value.

421
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
What?

422
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,279
What are you doing?

423
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,279
You were sleeping,
so I took off your glasses.

424
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,640
Where is my earring?

425
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,080
Did you leave it somewhere?

426
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,999
No.

427
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,359
Is it a real diamond or something?

428
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,840
Why are you so upset?

429
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,320
No.

430
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
I'll buy you a new one.

431
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,239
No.

432
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,320
It's the one that you and I...

433
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,199
What?

434
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's just say it's important to me.

435
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,600
I need it back.

436
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,880
Hey, kids.

437
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,400
What are you doing here?

438
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,639
We spent the night here.

439
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,600
It's good you got here so early.

440
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,359
What's going on?

441
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,320
Pantoon...

442
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:31,199
...what are you doing here?

443
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,199
You're here early.

444
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:40,800
I have a morning shift.

445
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,959
What is it?

446
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,919
They...

447
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,720
We have a tutoring session.

448
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,600
We made an appointment
to come here early.

449
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:51,999
Yes.

450
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Okay.

451
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,159
That's good.

452
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,279
Now that you're here, Pantoon,
I want to talk to you.

453
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Okay.

454
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,120
I saw Ittikorn's math score,
and I'm very happy about it.

455
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,080
Okay.

456
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,280
I knew it. You're the smartest student.

457
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,199
So, of course, you'd be able
to help someone who's struggling like him.

458
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,280
You can rest assured
that you didn't do this for free.

459
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,560
The room will belong to Bishop Club,
per the agreement.

460
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,080
Okay.

(Next week on My Gear and Your Gown)

463
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Did you find it?

464
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,320
Are you sure
that you lost your earring here?

465
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,279
Yes.

466
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,360
I heard that you disappeared last night.

467
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,679
Move our things out of this room.

468
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,600
Tell me what you want.

469
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,561
I'll do anything for you.

470
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you expect me to believe you?
