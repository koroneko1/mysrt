1
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,200
Every school has a story.

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
It is said that

3
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,520
the school library

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,320
houses more than just books.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Although it is a harbor of knowledge,

6
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,880
it may also conceal some secrets.

7
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,920
And, one day,

8
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
you may get a chance to read them.

9
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,640
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

10
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,640
Once upon a time,

11
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,320
there was a girl

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,320
who wished for a friend who would understand her,

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
one who would stay by her side like a true friend would do.

14
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
JARIYA SUETRONG, PRINCIPAL

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
STUDENT RECORDS 1972

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,720
I saw them threatening another student.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,080
STUDENT TRANSFER REQUEST

18
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,200
Kaew and her friends tried to give their cheat sheet to her.

19
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
I heard Kaew say

20
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,480
that she should write down the right answers

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
and share them during the exam

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,840
or Kaew would get her.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,040
Get her?

24
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,720
She looked terrified. Her arms were bruised from being squeezed.

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
It seemed serious, so I came to tell you.

27
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you very much for telling me.

28
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
After this,

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,200
I'll properly consider those students' punishment.

30
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
Excuse me, Madam Principal.

31
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,840
I need to show you something urgently.

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,440
FAMILY BELIEVES TEACHER WAS ABDUCTED, KILLED

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,360
Saiparn, you may go, dear.

34
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
Goodbye.

35
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,960
Hey, have you seen Saiparn?

36
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,920
-Hey, have you seen Saiparn? -No, I haven't.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Hey. Have you seen Saiparn?

38
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,280
Kaew, I don't see her anywhere.

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Maybe she's already run home.

40
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,920
Look inside again.

41
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Saiparn.

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,240
Saiparn.

43
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,160
Well, well,

44
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,720
you sure wasted my time, Saiparn.

45
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
-Let me go! -Such a snitch, aren't you?

46
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
This is the library.

47
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,560
Be quiet in here.

48
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,680
If you must be so loud, please go outside.

49
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't wanna be here anyway.

50
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Are you hurt?

51
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm fine, miss.

52
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,480
All right, then.

53
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
NARIN PINTONGKAM, LIBRARIAN

54
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,360
Um…

55
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
What is it, dear?

56
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,600
Shall I help you arrange the books?

57
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Start with that pile behind you, then. Put it in the other room for me.

58
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Yes, miss.

59
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Thanks, dear.

60
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,560
CHECKOUTS AND RETURNS

61
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

62
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:38,160
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

63
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,800
It's getting late. You can finish this tomorrow.

64
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't mind, miss. I can stay.

65
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,880
POTASSIUM CYANIDE

66
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't you get lonely all alone in the library?

67
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,080
Not at all.

68
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,640
But it's nice that you're here to help today.

69
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
FAMILY BELIEVES TEACHER WAS ABDUCTED, KILLED

70
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
Miss.

71
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Is that our school in the news?

72
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,800
Yes, it is.

73
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,080
His family told the police that he'd gone to work as usual that day,

74
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,080
but he never came home in the evening.

75
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,560
Many teachers said that the last place he visited

76
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,720
was probably this room.

77
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,480
Then people started speculating that he might have died or gone missing.

78
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,920
Actually, this rumor made some people scared of using the library.

79
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Do you think

80
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
that teacher

81
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
died in this room?

82
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
Does that frighten you?

83
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
I've been here for so long,

84
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,280
and I haven't seen anything scary.

85
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,520
People keep spreading rumors of strange things, though.

86
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,160
Haven't you heard any tales about this school?

87
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
No, I haven't.

88
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
I just transferred here.

89
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,160
So what happened here?

90
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,160
They say that 20 years ago,

91
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
a female student named Ploypoom

92
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,640
was bullied by her classmates and locked up in the toilets.

93
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
And no one knew.

94
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,800
She endured that torment in there for three months

95
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,840
until she decided to kill herself

96
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,640
in the toilets upstairs,

97
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,720
right above this library.

98
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,400
Before she died,

99
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,120
she recorded her intense pain and torment

100
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,440
in a book.

101
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
A book?

102
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Friends

103
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
were all she wanted…

104
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,240
but they ended up killing her.

105
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,240
It's so tragic

106
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,720
for a defenseless person to die from bullying.

107
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,240
It must be some sort of hidden pain you can't tell anyone about.

108
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
But sometimes,

109
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,560
it's about who you choose to tell.

110
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,080
Don't let that happen to you.

111
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,280
If you have any problems, you can tell me.

112
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
Think of me as a friend.

113
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
Let me help you.

114
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
It's all right.

115
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
What is that? It smells so strong.

116
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,920
A kind of chemical

117
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
used to preserve tissue, I think.

118
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,560
Lately, the science department has used lots of it.

119
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,760
But how come I could smell this at the library?

120
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,760
Well…

121
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
Uncle Daeng.

122
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,960
Yes, miss?

123
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,640
ACCEPTING NEW STUDENTS

124
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Do you have a moment?

125
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,040
Yes, miss.

126
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,920
Can you look at this ceiling?

127
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,680
There's a hole, so there's water leaking out.

128
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Of course, miss.

129
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,320
KUNAKORN GIRLS' SCHOOL

130
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,160
Twenty years ago,

131
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,760
on the last day of the semester, a female student named Ploypoom

132
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,080
was bullied by her classmates

133
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
and locked up in the toilets upstairs,

134
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,040
right above this library.

135
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
Hey. What?

136
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Come here.

137
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Go inside.

138
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Get inside, Saiparn. Come here.

139
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
You almost got us expelled.

140
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
Sorry to disappoint you,

141
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,480
but I'm not going anywhere.

142
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,520
I'll keep you company

143
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,520
for a very long time.

144
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Quit being a bitch, Kaew.

145
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,240
Just own up to your mistakes.

146
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
Don't preach at me!

147
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
How dare you stick your nose in my business?

148
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,360
I'll stay away from you guys from now on.

149
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
You stay away from me too.

150
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Step aside.

151
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
I told you to back off.

152
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,920
Stay here and repent, Saiparn.

153
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Nosy bitch!

154
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,560
Let's go!

155
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,840
Kaew!

156
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Kaew!

157
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Kaew, let me go!

158
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,840
Kaew! You--

159
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Saiparn!

160
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,400
They did that to you?

161
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Why didn't you tell anyone?

162
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
I can help you.

163
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,400
It's okay, miss.

164
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,080
You wouldn't be able to help anyway.

165
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Nosy bitch!

166
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,120
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

167
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,160
Before she died,

168
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,080
she recorded her intense pain

169
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,640
and torment…

170
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,040
THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF

171
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,200
…in a book.

172
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,320
THERE WAS A SHEPHERD BOY WHO LIKED TO FOOL…

173
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,280
THE VILLAGERS RAN OUT TO CHASE THE WOLVES AWAY, BUT…

174
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
THE BOY CRIED FOR HELP AND LOST HIS VOICE…

175
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,400
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

176
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,560
THE MOUSE GNAWED RIGHT THROUGH THE ROPE AND SAVED THE LION'S LIFE.

177
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,800
"In a lonely, desolate land,

178
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,120
there lived a girl."

179
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,760
IN A LONELY, DESOLATE LAND, THERE LIVED A GIRL.

180
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,760
EVERYONE ELSE TURNED HER INTO A LOVER OF SOLITUDE.

181
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,640
"Everyone else turned her into a lover of solitude."

182
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
"They forced her to be

183
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,880
where nobody wanted to be."

184
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,360
MEET US IN THE TOILETS. WE GOT YOU A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

185
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,280
FROM SUDA.

186
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Ploypoom.

187
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,040
This is a Western dessert.

188
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,400
Maybe you've never had one…

189
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
AESOP'S FABLES

190
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,160
…so we got it for you

191
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,280
as a birthday gift.

192
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,080
"One day,

193
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,640
someone came forward, destroyed that land,

194
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,120
and gave her something called 'friendship.'"

195
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,360
Close your eyes and make a wish.

196
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,120
Do you like it, Ploypoom?

197
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,480
Just like the lion and the dead mouse

198
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
in your story.

199
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
Where do you think you're going?

200
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,600
Stay in here with your dead mouse!

201
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
No!

202
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,880
Open the door!

203
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,440
"But then she discovered

204
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,640
that having friends like those was the worst gift in life."

205
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
"They were like vipers

206
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,640
that would bite their helper

207
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,000
and destroy the trust she had in them."

208
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
Let me out.

209
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
She endured that torment in there for three months…

210
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,920
"Friends… who never valued me."

211
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,360
"Friends…

212
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
who looked down on me."

213
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
"Friends…

214
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
who wanted me dead."

215
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,640
"Friends?"

216
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,320
"With friends like you, I'd rather have none."

217
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,960
THE BIRTHDAY GIFTS THAT THIS WORTHLESS…

218
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,000
WITH FRIENDS LIKE YOU, I'D RATHER HAVE NONE.

219
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
"The moral of the story is

220
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,800
even if you're mightier than a lion,

221
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,440
when you become a rotten corpse,

222
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
you're just food for the mice."

223
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,680
"Your dead bodies are the birthday gifts

224
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,600
that your worthless, mouse-like friend

225
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,720
wants the most."

226
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,480
LIBRARY

227
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Excuse me, miss.

228
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,560
Can I ask about Ploypoom, the girl you talked about the other day?

229
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,160
The girl who was bullied to death?

230
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Yes.

231
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I want to know

232
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,280
what happened to her bullies after that.

233
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
I heard

234
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,280
that they were arrested

235
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,880
and extensively interrogated.

236
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,440
After that,

237
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,120
they killed each other in the cell.

238
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,480
Rumor has it

239
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
that they died

240
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,000
just like Ploypoom wished for in her book.

241
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,520
Does that mean whatever gets written in the book

242
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,160
will come true?

243
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,880
I believe

244
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,000
that these school tales are true.

245
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
If they weren't true,

246
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
nobody would have written about them.

247
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,800
Why are you so interested in this all of a sudden?

248
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,920
I'm just curious

249
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,840
about what happened at this school.

250
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
SHE HELPED THEM CHEAT…

251
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,000
THEY BETRAYED HER.

252
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,800
"GOOD FRIENDS TAKE YOU TO HEAVEN. BAD ONES DRAG YOU TO HELL."

253
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Saiparn.

254
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,680
KUNAKORN GIRLS' SCHOOL

255
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,080
Rumor has it that they died

256
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,760
just like Ploypoom wished for in her book.

257
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,440
Does that mean whatever gets written in the book

258
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,160
will come true?

259
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,440
I believe

260
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,480
that these school tales are true.

261
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,640
ONCE, AT A BORING GIRLS' SCHOOL,

262
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,800
A GIRL COULDN'T STAND SEEING INJUSTICE HAPPENING IN FRONT OF HER,

263
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
SO SHE DECIDED TO INTERVENE.

264
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
Students, please thank the teacher.

265
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,120
-Thank you, teacher. -Thank you, teacher.

266
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,840
UNITED WE STAND

267
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,600
Saiparn. What's your hurry, bitch?

268
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,640
What are you hiding?

269
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,360
-Give it to me. Get her. -Give it back, Kaew!

270
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,920
Stay still.

271
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,240
-Let go! -Will you stay still?

272
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,240
Don't move.

273
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,360
Let go of me.

274
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
Jeez, stop moving.

275
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,200
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!

276
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,960
"Kaew, I hate you."

277
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,400
"When will you just die?"

278
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,080
"Evil bitches like you

279
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,840
won't die in peace!"

280
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,120
Aw, Saiparn.

281
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,680
You hate me so much, but all you can do is write in this silly ghost book.

282
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,600
You really believe this nonsense?

283
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,040
Poor Saiparn.

284
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,680
Apart from being a snitch,

285
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
are you delusional too, you lunatic?

286
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,840
Everyone, look at this nutcase.

287
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,520
She has no friends,

288
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,800
so she has to befriend a ghost.

289
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
-Let go! -Hey!

290
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,080
-You crazy bitch! Hold her! -What the hell are you doing?

291
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,280
-Stay still! -Get off me!

292
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
-Come here! -Let go!

293
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
-Will you just stay still? -Stop.

294
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,160
You bitch!

295
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,480
-Come here. -Hold her still.

296
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,200
Let go of me!

297
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,160
-Hold her still. -Sit down.

298
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,520
-Hey. Stay still. -Let me go!

299
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,440
Stay still.

300
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
-Stay still. -Kaew.

301
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,240
What are you doing?

302
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,640
Kaew!

303
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,840
This is payback, stupid!

304
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,880
Kaew!

305
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
If any one of you tells a teacher,

306
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
you're fucked!

307
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,400
Go!

308
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
Go!

309
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,600
Let's go, girls.

310
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,400
Kill her.

311
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,120
Kill her.

312
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,040
"When will you just die?"

313
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
Kill her.

314
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,520
"Evil bitches like you

315
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
won't die in peace!"

316
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,040
Kill her.

317
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,240
She must die.

318
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Kill her.

319
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,400
-She deserves it. -Kill her.

320
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,240
Kaew.

321
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Kaew, what is it?

322
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm sorry.

323
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm sorry, Saiparn.

324
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,520
-Kaew! -I'm sorry.

325
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,120
Kaew!

326
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,920
Kaew!

327
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,040
Kaew!

328
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,320
-What happened to Kaew? -Kaew!

329
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,040
Kaew!

330
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Wake up, Kaew!

331
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,680
Kaew, wake up!

332
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,600
-Kaew! -No.

333
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,040
How did this happen?
Kaew!

334
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Kaew!

335
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,360
Kaew!

336
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
Kaew! Wake up!

337
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,680
Kaew!

338
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,040
YOU MADE THIS SCHOOL WORSE!

339
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,640
Kaew, I hate you.

340
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,360
Evil bitches like you won't die in peace! I hope you hurt 100 times more than me!

341
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,240
"Karma's a bitch, and then you die."

342
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,080
Shit, where is it?

THIS BOOK'S WHISPERS SHOWED ME THAT HE DESERVES…

347
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,240
Miss.

348
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
You've read my story, haven't you?

349
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,400
A young woman who just graduated…

350
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,840
was determined to be a good teacher.

351
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
But she ended up being isolated

352
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,080
because her colleagues didn't like her.

353
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,960
She was slandered

354
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,480
day after day…

355
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,680
until…

356
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,560
NARIN PINTONGKAM, LIBRARIAN

357
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,400
…she met a male teacher…

358
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
who offered her friendship.

359
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,080
She thought she had found a true friend.

360
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
-Stay still. -But he assaulted her.

361
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,240
He hurt her body

362
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,720
and her soul.

363
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
She wanted to die…

364
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
but she couldn't.

365
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,480
The moral of the story is…

366
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,680
that the one who deserved to die

367
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,800
was that bastard.

368
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,120
I wrote that the son of a bitch died here.

369
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,160
Isn't it great, Saiparn?

370
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,080
Didn't he deserve it?

371
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Why do you look so upset, Saiparn?

372
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,360
You hated that girl so much, you wanted her to die, right?

373
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,920
But I didn't want Kaew to die.

374
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,720
What happened to you and the others who wrote in that book?

375
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
I had to trade my body

376
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,680
and my soul

377
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
for the wish I wrote in the book.

378
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,960
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

379
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
I'm glad

380
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,000
you decided to write down your wish

381
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,840
and leave it to someone you trust.

382
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,280
If you have any problems,

383
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,400
I can help you.

384
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,240
It's what you wanted!

385
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,640
I never wanted it to turn out like this.

386
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,200
You lying bitch!

387
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,080
I know you wanted revenge! You wanted her dead!

388
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,160
Karma's a bitch,

389
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,840
and then you die.

390
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,240
We just helped you fulfill your wish…

391
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,520
and made it come true, that's all.

392
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,280
A hundred times more pain.

393
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
You must die!

394
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,240
Let's stay friends forever, Saiparn.

395
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
No. I'm scared. No.

396
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,160
In the end,

397
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,720
that girl got her wish…

398
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,640
2022

399
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
…and found friends who would stay by her side

400
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,360
forever.

401
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,360
THE BOOK OF CORPSES

402
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,600
Give this book a try. It's worth it.
