4
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:19,648
My mom…

5
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:21,169
is inviting you to come over.

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:24,071
I don’t mind at all no matter what your house looks like.

7
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,373
Na Chiang Dao.

8
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,250
The last name of the ancient monarch of the North.

9
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,520
Dr. Fah, I like him a lot.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,808
When will you two become boyfriends?

11
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:32,515
Hey, Prince.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,879
Coming to Knot’s party too?

13
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,600
I just wanted someone here to know whom Prince is talking to.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,745
I’m not trying to steal Prince.

15
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:41,877
Because someone like him needs a guy who has time for him.

16
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:43,927
When we both go home one day,

17
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,799
I might not have time to take care of you.

18
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:10,438
What?

19
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,789
I forgot my umbrella?

20
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,000
I knew you’d forget it.

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,270
When did you become so thoughtful?

22
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:30,981
After I met you.

23
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,656
If I’m noting thoughtful,

24
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,195
you will not stop nagging at me.

25
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,283
Are you complimenting or picking on me?

26
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,417
Complimenting, of course.

27
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,228
I bought this umbrella in Chiang Mai downtown.

28
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,003
I knew I’d need it.

29
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:50,613
Just didn’t know I’d need it this soon.

30
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,448
Well, It’s been pouring lately.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,612
I didn’t mean it like that.

32
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:04,860
I meant I didn’t know I’d get to use it with someone I care about so soon.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,036
Let’s go already.

34
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,512
Before it’s getting heavier.

35
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,685
Hey! Slow down.

36
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,436
Wait for me.

37
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,741
Thank you for walking me home.

38
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,552
I should get inside.

39
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:39,719
Hold on.

40
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,455
I walked you home.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,321
How about you give me a reward?

42
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,016
What reward?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
Well…

44
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,200
Like what we did in the car.

45
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,587
Every time I think about it,

46
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:01,934
I get so excited.

47
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:06,306
Close your eyes.

48
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:08,397
I knew you wouldn’t agree to it easily.

49
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,336
What?

50
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,880
Why so easy?

51
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,960
Do you want your reward or not?

52
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,266
I do.

53
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,091
Ouch!

54
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:38,483
Excited enough?

55
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:40,139
I’m leaving now.

56
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:41,939
Bye.

57
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,739
Thank you for walking me.

58
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:45,631
You don’t have to do it every day.

59
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:47,799
Why not?

60
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:49,348
You don’t want to see me?

61
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,525
It’s not that.

62
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:54,400
I don’t want to bother you.

63
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,186
Because you have to wake up earlier.

64
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:04,075
Seeing you one minute longer makes me happy.

65
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,479
Besides,

66
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:09,805
I’m here to get my reward.

67
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,804
What reward now?

68
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,080
This.

69
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,283
What are you doing?

70
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,800
Getting my reward.

71
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:29,290
I now have enough energy to work all day.

72
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:32,375
Just go already.

73
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,635
He looks happy.

74
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:48,079
Well, well.

75
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,547
What a sweet morning.

76
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,448
This is school, not a lavender field.

77
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,243
Be more shameful, will you?

78
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,784
You, cheesy doctor!

79
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:56,760
Right.

80
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,960
Yayah, waiting for someone?

81
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:04,010
I’m waiting for you, Teacher.

82
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,726
My dad asked me to give these snacks to the children.

83
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:08,843
Thank you so much.

84
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,755
Please tell the village chief I said thank you.

85
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,492
How do you feel?

86
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,753
About the snacks?

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,237
I’m so thankful.

88
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,594
Not that.

89
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:24,087
I mean getting kissed by Dr. Fah.

90
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,087
I saw everything.

91
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,190
Since you returned from Bangkok, you guys have been lovey-dovey.

92
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:32,133
Are you two boyfriends already?

93
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:33,250
Not yet.

94
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,299
What?

95
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,184
You two aren’t boyfriends yet?

96
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:40,600
You guys will leave this mountain in three days!

97
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:43,557
Why hasn’t Dr. Fah asked you to be this boyfriend yet?

98
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,200
I haven’t got a chance to say it.

99
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,440
I feel like things are going fast.

100
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,620
And I just knew his family was of royal descent.

101
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:54,574
I think we need more time to get to know each other.

102
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:58,715
I know you’re waiting for him to say it.

103
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:03,600
He’s probably finding the right moment in these three days to say it.

104
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:08,610
Dress up nicely for that in the meantime.

105
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,668
Dress up what, Yayah?

106
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:11,561
Nonsense.

107
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,070
Let’s do this.

108
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,884
I’ll help you plan your confession moment.

109
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,107
Make it grand.

110
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:23,069
You rappel from a chopper with a big flower bouquet in your hand.

111
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,987
How does that sound?

112
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:24,758
Does it wow you?

113
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:25,439
Yeah, wow.

114
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,605
Wow, what an absurd idea.

115
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,258
Rappel from a chopper?

116
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,521
How on earth could you come up with that?

117
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,020
You don’t like it?

118
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,872
Hello, Dao.

119
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,187
This is Fah.

120
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,663
I…

121
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,865
got something to ask.

122
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,845
I…

123
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:47,793
I mean Mesa is making a confession to someone he likes.

124
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:49,825
Any advice?

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Wow! Kuafah who has flirted with tons of girls is asking me this question?

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,883
It’s different.

127
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:00,000
I’ve never seriously hit on anyone.

128
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,120
(You just talked about yourself.)

129
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,658
No.

130
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,560
I mean Mesa.

131
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,851
Forget it.

132
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:13,681
What’s your advice anyway?

133
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,772
Be honest and clear.

134
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:18,642
Be honest and clear?

135
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,434
How?

136
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,320
Suddenly say it while walking together?

137
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,592
(That’s too blunt.)

138
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:25,978
Come on.

139
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,828
Take the person on a date first.

140
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:30,264
To somewhere nice.

141
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:34,360
At the right moment, hand out a present.

142
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,648
Then make the confession.

143
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,440
That’s pretty honest.

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
(I wish you…)

145
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:44,004
(I mean I wish Mesa good luck.)

146
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,042
Hopefully.

147
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,790
Thank you.

148
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,055
Moonbahte the stone and that’s it.

149
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:23,820
What are you doing here?

151
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,320
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,843
I brought the stone here to moonbahte it.

153
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:38,498
I thought I’d do it for my brother before I leave the mountain.

154
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,284
I’m here to make necklaces for the children too.

155
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:44,949
Yeah?

156
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,334
What a coincidence.

157
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:52,370
Should we do it together?

158
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,160
The moon tonight is more beautiful than that night.

159
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:03,457
What night?

160
00:11:05,484 --> 00:11:06,533
That…

161
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,663
That night.

162
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:10,022
The night you helped me make the necklace.

163
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,234
The moon is gorgeous.

164
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,479
The stones must be getting so much charm.

165
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:21,657
Besides, I’m sitting next to you.

166
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,367
When you wear it, you’ll think of me.

167
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,681
You said you’re doing this for your brother.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes, I’m doing it for my brother.

169
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:41,520
He’ll think of me when he wears it.

170
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,815
Ah!

171
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,926
Yeah?

172
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:58,022
You know it’s cold.

173
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,367
Why didn’t you bring your warm clothes?

174
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,458
I hurried out and forgot.

175
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:17,767
Here.

176
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,439
Thank you.

177
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,566
Ever since I lived here,

178
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,000
I haven’t got to explore the mountain yet.

179
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,000
I work so much that I don’t have time to get around.

180
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,217
Without knowing it,

181
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:55,141
it’s time to go home.

182
00:12:58,219 --> 00:13:00,809
There are still things I want to do here.

183
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,289
I want to cook on the mountain.

184
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,003
I want to grow vegetables.

185
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,056
I want to try building a house up here.

186
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,115
And…

187
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,073
There’s one thing I want to do the most.

188
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,141
I want to have a date with you up here on the mountain.

189
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:33,431
What?

190
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:41,548
Tomorrow will be the last day we’re here.

191
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:47,650
I just want to have a date with you where we first met.

192
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,300
Up here on this mount.

193
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,514
Will you go on a date with me?

194
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,098
Yes.

195
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,130
I will.

196
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:46,240
You’re looking good in this outfit.

197
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,108
We thank you so much for taking care of the villagers’ health.

198
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,021
Bad news.

199
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:55,344
The villagers are having bad diarrhea.

200
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,703
They’re having a stomachache.

201
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:57,718
Come take a look.

202
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:32,910
Wow!

203
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,472
This is more beautiful than I imagined.

204
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:38,493
What?

205
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,733
It’s your first time here too?

206
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,523
I’m just like you.

207
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:47,739
I always work.

208
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,883
I don’t have time to explore.

209
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,142
Then I’m gonna take you on an extremely fun trip.

210
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:57,924
Come here.

211
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,545
Hey!

212
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,723
What is this?

213
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:01,829
What are you doing?

214
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:04,146
Hey!

215
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,812
No.

216
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:30,734
These are pretty.

217
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,062
Hey.

218
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,572
Let me show you a magic trick.

219
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,073
Ta-da!

220
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,721
Hey, when did you pick it up?

221
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:54,416
So cute.

222
00:16:57,612 --> 00:16:58,607
This is easy.

223
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,566
Let’s go.

224
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,569
Wait. I’m coming.

225
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:43,519
You’re looking good in this outfit.

226
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,268
What are you saying?

227
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:50,254
I wore Yayah’s outfit before.

228
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,064
They are similar.

229
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,844
I didn’t get a clear look at you back then.

230
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,493
Because…

231
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,360
I was on top of you.

232
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,657
On top, my foot!

233
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,622
Let’s go.

234
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,182
The villagers are waiting for us.

235
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:13,339
The locals are so nice.

236
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:17,523
They threw us a welcoming party.

237
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,211
Now we’re leaving.

238
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,662
They’re throwing a farewell party for us again.

239
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:26,540
I’m starting to get why you love it here.

240
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,261
Come on.

241
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,234
On my first days here,

242
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:15,462
I always counted down the day I would get to leave.

243
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:19,384
But after I got to know everyone,

244
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,513
after I got to live here,

245
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,282
I wanted to be a better person.

246
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:29,776
Surprisingly, I don’t want to leave anymore.

247
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:32,245
When there’s a chance,

248
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:34,334
I hope we get to meet again.

249
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:40,812
Thank you so much for having me all this time.

250
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,182
Anything else you want to add, Dr. Fah?

251
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,460
What is it?

252
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,782
If you want to say anything to anyone in particular, do it now.

253
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,611
Everyone is waiting to hear it.

254
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:10,462
Well…

255
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:15,462
My speech for everyone has ended.

256
00:20:15,907 --> 00:20:18,651
I should keep the rest personal.

257
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:21,384
This is not fun at all.

258
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:25,126
Thank you.

259
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,245
Doctor, would you like to try this?

260
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,049
What is it?

261
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,437
Raw Beef Spicy Salad.

262
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:39,798
I think I’ll pass.

263
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:41,616
But thank you so much.

264
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:42,501
Doctor.

265
00:20:45,135 --> 00:20:50,182
We thank you so much for taking care of the villagers’ health.

266
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,358
We all wish you good luck in life.

267
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,058
Thank you very much.

268
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,406
Please enjoy the party.

269
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,767
Teacher Prince, are you leaving?

270
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:04,862
When I’m away, don’t be naughty, Wee-ah.

271
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:11,070
Teacher Prince.

272
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,462
Will you go for a walk with me?

273
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:18,189
Aw!

274
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,102
Can I borrow your teacher for a while?

275
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:24,001
You can take him.

276
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,724
Where are we going?

277
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:37,262
They say there’s a nice place for watching fireflies up there.

278
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:38,874
I’m taking you there.

279
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,822
Be careful here.

280
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:44,601
Don’t get lost in the woods like the last time.

281
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:50,022
I’ve studied the route.

282
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,540
I assure you we won’t get lost.

283
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:57,294
Why?

284
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,770
Don’t you trust me?

285
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:02,061
No.

286
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,078
You don’t trust me.

287
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,424
Then why are you holding my hand?

288
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,036
If you do something bad,

289
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,902
I’ll crush your hand till it’s broken.

290
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,375
Crush till it’s broken?

291
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:23,584
How strong.

292
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,908
I’m so scared.

293
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,977
Fah!

294
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:26,884
Fah!

295
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:27,982
Bad news.

296
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:31,622
The villagers are having bad diarrhea.

297
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,857
They’re having a stomachache.

298
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:34,299
Come take a look.

299
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:40,910
Ouch! My stomach hurts.

300
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,782
From what I checked,

301
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:46,320
I think they’re having food poisoning.

302
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:48,902
Probably the Raw Beef Salad.

303
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,363
Did you eat it, Doctor?

304
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:51,773
No, I didn’t.

305
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,817
I was afraid of food poisoning.

306
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,742
We should find out who ate it.

307
00:22:57,896 --> 00:22:59,091
Everyone was at risk.

308
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,385
That’s right.

309
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:06,312
Please help take those who have serious symptoms to the health center.

310
00:23:08,602 --> 00:23:09,433
Help each other.

311
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,937
If you can, proceed to the health center.

312
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:14,628
Are you okay?

313
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,453
The doctor is coming.

314
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:21,920
You’ll get better soon.

315
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,262
The doctor is coming for you.

316
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:24,366
Where is the pain?

317
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:26,044
You’ll be given this first.

318
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:27,844
Please give the meds to these three patients.

319
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:30,607
How is this patient doing?

320
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:32,979
What do we do?

321
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:42,489
You’re getting better.

322
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:48,019
Take these medicines home and get some rest.

323
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,058
Yes. Thank you so much.

324
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:06,360
Sorry. I fell asleep.

325
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:09,222
Did you get any sleep at all?

326
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,462
It’s good you got to rest.

327
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:18,068
I always work the night shift like this. I am used to it.

328
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:26,686
Are you two traveling with me to Chiang Mai?

329
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:29,141
What?

330
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,816
Your volunteer time is up.

331
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:36,828
We don’t want to keep bothering you.

332
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,759
So I’m asking if you want to travel with me.

333
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,685
Not today, I guess.

334
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:48,935
The villagers are still sick.

335
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,262
When they are fully recovered, I will go myself.

336
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,367
Right.

337
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:55,062
I will stay and help him.

338
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,140
Thank you very much.

339
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:01,595
I’m going to run an errand in Chiang Mai then.

340
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,493
Sure. Thank you so much.

341
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,449
You’re going home later than scheduled.

342
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,062
Will your mom be worried?

343
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,655
She will complain if I leave you behind.

344
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:26,168
That means your mom is starting to warm up to me, yes?

345
00:25:26,168 --> 00:25:29,887
That means my mom teaches me to be nice.

346
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,879
Come on.

347
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,338
If you’re worried about me, just admit it.

348
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,077
Let’s eat.

349
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,862
Uncle Phang made us grilled pork and sticky rice.

350
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:48,950
You go ahead.

351
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:50,238
I need to do prescriptions.

352
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,342
I told you

353
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,775
you can take care of others but don’t forget to take care of yourself too.

354
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:55,405
Your hand is burning hot.

355
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:56,414
Are you sick?

356
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:57,746
This is not okay.

357
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,440
Why don’t you tell me you’re sick?

358
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:36,061
Teacher Prince.

359
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:37,466
Hey.

360
00:26:38,636 --> 00:26:39,526
Let’s eat.

361
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,906
Uncle Phang made us grilled pork and sticky rice.

362
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,532
You go ahead.

363
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:47,847
I need to do prescriptions.

364
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,603
Eat first.

365
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:00,902
You haven’t eaten anything since the morning.

366
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,323
Hold on.

367
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:08,215
Here.

368
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:12,486
I told you

369
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:16,041
you can take care of others but don’t forget to take care of yourself too.

370
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,540
Why should I take care of myself

371
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:28,283
when I have you to do it?

372
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,826
What are you saying?

373
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:34,014
Eat it yourself.

374
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:35,756
What?

375
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,323
What should I do?

376
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,806
I haven’t eaten anything all day.

377
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,162
I’m starving

378
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,382
I’ve got my hands full.

379
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,481
What should I do?

380
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,069
You!

381
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,923
Ouch! My stomach hurts.

382
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:49,898
I think I’m having gastritis.

383
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:50,979
Here.

384
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,709
Acting like a child.

385
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:58,352
Thank you.

386
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:11,566
So…

387
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,016
Everyone is getting better.

388
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,758
What a relief.

389
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,322
Right.

390
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:22,643
Should we continue what we left off?

391
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:25,009
What is it?

392
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:32,483
If we take a right turn here, we will reach the place to watch the fireflies.

393
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:36,986
Is it okay with you if we stop by for a little while?

394
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:39,920
Yes,

395
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:41,356
it is.

396
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:42,979
Come on.

397
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:49,870
Hey.

398
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,493
Your hand is burning hot.

399
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,338
Maybe because the weather is hot.

400
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,091
No.

401
00:28:58,247 --> 00:28:59,643
The weather isn’t hot.

402
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,088
Are you sick?

403
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:02,742
No.

404
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,983
I’m doing okay.

405
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:07,873
Hey.

406
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,136
This is not okay.

407
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,863
Gosh!

408
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:15,591
You’re burning up.

409
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:17,411
Why don’t you tell me you’re sick?

410
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:21,478
Come on. Let’s get back.

411
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:24,986
Can you walk?

412
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:43,236
I’m sorry.

413
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,619
I didn’t know it’d be this bad.

414
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:49,700
Of course, it’s bad.

415
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:51,929
You are burning up.

416
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,091
Next time,

417
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:57,163
if you feel sick, let me know immediately.

418
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:03,189
You complain about me, but you don’t take care of yourself either.

419
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,144
I really want to spank you.

420
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,553
I’m sorry.

421
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:18,290
Get some rest.

422
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,991
I’ll take care of you.

423
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:30,506
Prince is sick?

424
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,872
Yes.

425
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,897
What is it?

426
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:35,804
JJ asked me to come fetch you.

427
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,603
There are more people having stomachaches.

428
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:40,379
But I have to…

429
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,368
You go.

430
00:30:41,511 --> 00:30:42,686
I will watch Teacher Prince here.

431
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,563
Hurry back when you’re done.

432
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,251
Okay.

433
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:49,953
Hey,

434
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:52,163
I’ll be right back.

435
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:55,324
Just go.

436
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,493
I will get some sleep.

437
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:08,423
Please take care of him.

438
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,279
Just go.

439
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:18,458
Damn it, Fah.

440
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,621
Seeing you now reminds me of the old you.

441
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,768
How?

442
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:30,309
Workaholic.

443
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,132
All he did was work.

444
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:33,626
He didn’t even eat.

445
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,107
He barely went out to see his friends.

446
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,016
He didn’t have time for his ex either.

447
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:45,247
But

448
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:48,293
it’s in the past.

449
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:49,905
He’s better now.

450
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:55,039
Sorry, I keep talking.

451
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,603
You should get some rest.

452
00:32:06,553 --> 00:32:09,603
[Huen Soontaree Vechanont]

453
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:17,579
Hi.

454
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:18,324
Hello, ma’am.

455
00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:20,068
Hi, village chief.

456
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,003
Is this Sincere?

457
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,503
That’s right.

458
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:27,168
You’ve grown to be a handsome man.

459
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:30,089
Sincere, this is the village chief

460
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:32,452
who is taking care of Prince up on the mountain.

461
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:34,713
Hello.

462
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,907
Teacher Prince is very nice.

463
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:41,655
He takes care of the children and everyone so well.

464
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,504
Really?

465
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:47,323
Recommending him to you is a great idea, isn’t it?

466
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,844
How is he doing?

467
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:53,004
He’s doing fine.

468
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:55,431
He should be back in a couple of days.

469
00:32:55,684 --> 00:33:01,083
The villagers are having diarrhea, so Teacher Prince stays on and helps out.

470
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:03,921
Have you been doing well?

471
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:04,891
I have.

472
00:33:06,543 --> 00:33:08,114
What about you, chief? Are you doing well?

473
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:09,484
I am.

474
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,265
Prince, are you okay?

475
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:16,407
What’s going on?

476
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,375
I have no clue.

477
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,436
His body is so cold.

478
00:33:19,825 --> 00:33:20,836
He’s shivering.

479
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:21,825
Let me see.

480
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,126
Hey.

481
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,032
Can you hear me?

482
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:27,548
I can.

483
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,479
Do you have a headache?

484
00:33:30,181 --> 00:33:31,402
Do you feel like puking?

485
00:33:32,863 --> 00:33:33,781
A little.

486
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,422
I wanted to throw up just now.

487
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:38,250
But it wouldn’t come out.

488
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,551
No.

489
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:47,300
Fah!

490
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,153
Fah, where are you going?

491
00:33:59,119 --> 00:33:59,804
Hey,

492
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,398
why are you back here?

493
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:03,785
To get the medicines.

494
00:34:04,863 --> 00:34:06,233
What medicines?

495
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:09,722
If you’re looking for antibiotics, I moved them outside.

496
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:13,010
No.

497
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:24,443
I’m looking for medicines for malaria.

498
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,974
So Teacher Prince is…

499
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:36,501
If he doesn't get cured now, he can be dead.

500
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:38,620
We have no choice.

501
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,982
I’ll carry you down the mountain.

502
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,327
Look at him.

503
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,283
Let me take care of him.

504
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,668
We can clearly see here you can’t take care of him.

505
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:14,386
Hey, why are you back here?

506
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:16,857
To get the medicines.

507
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,391
What medicines?

508
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,746
If you’re looking for antibiotics, I moved them outside.

509
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:26,331
No.

510
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,626
I’m looking for medicines for malaria.

511
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,399
Mosquito-borne disease?

512
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:45,814
So Teacher Prince is…

513
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:47,504
Yes.

514
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,441
If he doesn't get cured now,

515
00:35:52,187 --> 00:35:53,666
he can be dead.

516
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:08,026
My car broke down. I’m still fixing it, Doctor.

517
00:36:08,026 --> 00:36:11,266
Do we have any other cars?

518
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,074
I need to send Teacher Prince to treatment.

519
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:15,121
The village chief has one.

520
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:18,138
But he’s now in Chiang Mai downtown.

521
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:23,200
How do we contact people outside the village?

522
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,618
Hello.

523
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:30,145
Where are you?

524
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,393
Are you somewhere my heart belongs?

525
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:33,798
(That’s right.)

526
00:36:33,906 --> 00:36:35,906
(I’m right where your heart is at.)

527
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:38,410
(How are you doing over there?)

528
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:42,320
I’m doing fine but missing you so much.

529
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,134
Yayah!

530
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,345
Yayah!

531
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:45,986
What is it?

532
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:48,666
Can I borrow your walkie-talkie?

533
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:49,945
What is happening?

534
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:51,545
Teacher Prince is deadly sick.

535
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,050
What?

536
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,603
I’m contacting someone to send an ambulance here.

537
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:56,961
All right. Of course.

538
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:58,548
Tonnam, talk to you later.

539
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,088
Thank you so much.

540
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:13,172
Hi. Is anyone there?

541
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:15,603
Hello.

542
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:18,024
Can anyone hear me?

543
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,450
Hello.

544
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,285
You haven’t reached anyone down the mountain yet?

545
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:28,088
No.

546
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:31,494
I asked Yayah’s husband.

547
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:33,802
There’s no car in that village either.

548
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,041
Are you cold?

549
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:39,898
Let me get you a scarf.

550
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:56,024
This necklace

551
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,906
you haven’t given it to the children yet?

552
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:13,666
I lied.

553
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:18,468
I wasn’t going to give it to the children.

554
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,531
It’s for you but…

555
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:24,266
many things happened.

556
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,878
Well then…

557
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:38,501
Can I give it to you now?

558
00:38:40,714 --> 00:38:42,714
In case I’m away for treatment for so long.

559
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:53,794
Thank you.

560
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:57,039
Here.

561
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:17,107
Get well soon.

562
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,953
After your recovery, I have something for you as well.

563
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,531
Of course.

564
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,588
Get some sleep.

565
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,026
Uncle Phang should be done fixing his car by tomorrow morning.

566
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,036
Fah has been silent for two days.

567
00:40:07,582 --> 00:40:09,226
Don’t know if something happened to him.

568
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,055
Don’t worry.

569
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:12,438
Let’s do this.

570
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,035
If he doesn’t reach out by tomorrow,

571
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
I’ll take you to Chiang Mai to see him. Okay?

572
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:19,545
We don’t have to do that.

573
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,725
Just stay with me.

574
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:23,855
Eat then.

575
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:32,951
Good boy.

576
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,346
You’ll be rewarded when we’re in our room.

577
00:40:40,052 --> 00:40:40,992
Kluen!

578
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:42,332
What did you say?

579
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,060
Why are you turning red?

580
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:49,077
I’m not.

581
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,306
I meant I’d kiss you on the cheek.

582
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,048
What were you thinking?

583
00:40:58,157 --> 00:40:59,228
Nothing.

584
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:00,460
I didn’t think of anything.

585
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,870
Okay. You didn’t.

586
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,001
Let’s just eat.

587
00:41:11,106 --> 00:41:12,500
How is it going, Uncle Phang?

588
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,377
The rain is pouring.

589
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:18,159
For me to get it done, the rain must stop first

590
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:29,866
Hey.

591
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:30,877
Teacher.

592
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:41,070
We have no choice.

593
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I’ll carry you down the mountain.

594
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,403
Please bear with me a bit longer.

595
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,146
Can you really handle that?

596
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,543
I must.

597
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,327
I can’t let you stay like this.

598
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,964
It can take your life.

599
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,007
You trust me, don’t you?

600
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,506
I’m in your hand.

601
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:34,749
I’m sorry.

602
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,986
Are you all right?

603
00:42:37,078 --> 00:42:37,918
I am.

604
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,712
Does it really have to rain now?!

605
00:42:43,516 --> 00:42:44,346
Come on.

606
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:45,563
Let’s go.

607
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:52,906
I should walk so you don’t have to carry me.

608
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:54,064
Are you sure?

609
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:00,399
Hey!

610
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:02,590
Hey!

611
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:03,938
Prince!

612
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:05,974
Prince!

613
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,524
What’s happening to him?

614
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:10,372
He is having malaria.

615
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,129
He needs to go to a hospital now or he might die.

616
00:43:13,907 --> 00:43:14,838
Get in my car.

617
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:15,954
Now!

618
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,610
You’re nearly there.

619
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,388
Hold on.

620
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:29,346
Let us travel alone.

621
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:30,950
Why?

622
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,786
Do you need to ask?

623
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:34,262
Look at him.

624
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,969
Do you have any idea how fragile he is?

625
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:40,026
I never wish for him to get sick.

626
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:42,043
Enough.

627
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:44,354
Let me take care of him.

628
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:47,844
We can clearly see here you can’t take care of him.

629
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:53,605
Fah,

630
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:55,160
what are you doing here?

631
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:57,415
Aunt Cham’s condition is getting worse.

632
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:58,672
She throws up everything she eats.

633
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,859
Her grandchild is having the same symptoms.

634
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,336
I can’t go.

635
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:04,758
I’m sending Prince to a hospital.

636
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:06,092
No. You go.

637
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:11,211
I’ll be fine.

638
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,875
But the villagers might not be without you.

639
00:44:14,644 --> 00:44:17,367
(Because Buai can’t live without me.)

640
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,755
(But you can just fine, Fah.)

641
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:27,933
The Fah that I know always chooses work over me.

642
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:32,972
So no matter how many times we start over, you will choose work every time.

643
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
It’s your job after all.

644
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:42,920
Fah.

645
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:50,266
Please take care of him.

646
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:51,635
I will. You don’t need to tell me.

647
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:57,441
Hey!

648
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,112
(I said this before, didn’t I?)

649
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:06,159
(I climb the Himalayas to see someone waiting for me up there.)

650
00:45:06,276 --> 00:45:07,116
Fah.

651
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:10,377
- (Today, I realized…)
- Hey! Come on.

652
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:14,172
(The person up there is just me.)

653
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,209
(Me who never changes.)

654
00:45:23,906 --> 00:45:28,027
I will climb the Himalayas to see you once again.

655
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,021
Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul

656
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:56,596
Do you realize you slept the whole day?

657
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:57,425
So…

658
00:45:57,524 --> 00:45:58,685
Where is Dr. Fah?

659
00:45:58,685 --> 00:46:00,247
Dr. Fah left the mountain already.

660
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:02,063
He’s probably on his way back to Bangkok.

661
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:03,934
Do you still keep in touch with him?

662
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:07,137
I got his number from the village chief but it’s not reachable.

663
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:09,676
He might work hard and forget all about me by now.

664
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:10,712
What?

665
00:46:10,712 --> 00:46:12,635
Are you giving up already?

666
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:14,862
Life is that simple.

667
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:17,372
You don’t need reasons to like something.

668
00:46:17,372 --> 00:46:19,496
I just want Prince to be with a good guy.

669
00:46:19,496 --> 00:46:21,061
Someone who can really take care of him.

670
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:21,934
From now on

671
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:23,906
please take care of him.
