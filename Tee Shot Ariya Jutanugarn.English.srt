00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,958
It doesn't look fun to me.

329
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,458
Do you know who's the richest athlete
in the world?

330
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,708
Lionel Messi.

331
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,750
Do you know that in golf,

332
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,458
there are a dozen athletes
as rich as Messi?

333
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:14,916
How come?

334
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,375
Let's say, Usain Bolt,

335
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:24,416
he would train for four years
to race for ten seconds at the Olympics.

336
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:29,291
Those ten seconds will decide
how rich or poor he'll become.

337
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:34,041
But there are golf tournaments every week,
all year round.

338
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:38,416
So, you have a chance to win
on any week of the year.

339
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:45,625
Well, but who can win every week?
Even Tiger Woods wasn't even close.

340
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,250
Here's the thing.

341
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,750
In golf,
you don't have to always be number 1.

342
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,750
If you make the top ten
in every tournament,

343
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,666
you'll become the richest sportsperson
in this country.

344
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:02,458
Now tell me, if you have a daughter,
which sport do you want her to play?

345
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,166
Check, please.

346
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,666
Go back and prepare a scoop.

347
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,958
"The Jutanugarns are moving to America."

348
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,666
Moving to America...

349
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,750
-[phone ringing]
-Yes, Sport Channel.

350
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,750
TWO YEARS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT

351
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,208
The program is in the morning.

352
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,916
[Toh] Tae, a call for you.

353
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,458
I am on this line.

354
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,916
-Yes, right.
-[Toh] He'll call you back.

355
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,958
Okay.

356
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:54,250
If the sponsors are interested,
I'll call them back.

357
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:58,916
-So, I'll leave producers phone numbers.
-[female voice] Hello?

358
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,416
Tae, check the results.

359
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,000
Bye now.

360
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:06,291
[phones ringing]

361
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:12,625
Guys.

362
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,583
Look at this.

363
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,958
[narrator] Well, the madman
was proving everyone wrong.

364
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,666
Moving to the USA was pretty mad.

365
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:37,083
May became World No. 1, Girls' Junior.

366
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,791
Who could stop them now?

367
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:47,625
Of course, when you're famous,

368
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:51,541
opportunities and sponsors
line up at your doorstep.

369
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,208
2012, IMG HAS BECAME
THE JUTANUGARN SISTERS' AGENT

370
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,416
Let me introduce you here.

371
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,041
This is Joe,
and he will be your caddie from now.

372
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,833
JOE, ARIYA'S NEW CADDIE

373
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:04,083
And this is Winny.
He will be your manager.

374
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,083
WIN, ARIYA'S MANAGER

375
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,000
Let's try this.

376
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:12,916
Do exactly the same as before
and may God be with you.

377
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,750
She's so powerful. She can drive farther
than other girls of her age.

378
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,625
But the driver makes it hard
to control the direction.

379
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,958
Let her try the 3-wood instead.

380
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,458
She'll have more control, right?

381
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:33,375
[narrator] When your star is on the rise,
it only keeps rising.

382
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:37,333
But when does it reach a limit?
We have to keep watching.

383
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,125
Yui, can you submit the petition again?

384
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,333
I want May to play in the LPGA this year.

385
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,541
She's phenomenal.
It's in the news everywhere.

386
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:54,416
[Yui] You're in the US, not Thailand.
They won't bend the rules for you.

387
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,375
She has to be 18 to play in the tour.

388
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:01,625
Darn it.
The girl has talent. Why make her wait?

389
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,833
She's just one year short.
What's the big deal?

390
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:08,375
[Yui] Look, there's a tournament
in Europe.

391
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,041
Why don't you take her there?

392
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,500
MAY COMPETED IN...

393
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:17,583
May, the par-4 18th is a tough one.

394
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,708
SIS, HOW ARE YOU THERE?
IT'S SO BORING HERE

395
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,750
Hey!

396
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,833
MO JOINED THE LPGA TOUR AT THE AGE OF 18

397
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:37,375
SIS, HOW ARE YOU THERE?
IT'S SO BORING HERE

398
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,083
When I go back,
I will eat everything I want.

399
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,708
Fatty.

400
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:04,500
Sis.

401
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,083
The next match in Pattaya,

402
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:11,666
I want to win my first tournament
in Thailand.

403
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,458
TOURNAMENT

404
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,375
[narrator] As I said,

405
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:24,416
everything that goes up must come down.

406
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:29,958
She was on the verge of making history

407
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,250
by becoming the first Thai
to win an LPGA championship.

408
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,958
But this ball betrayed her.

409
00:41:54,583 --> 00:42:00,541
That fateful putt in Pattaya
would haunt May for a long time.

410
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:05,333
[Dad] You're not good enough for May
and for me too!

411
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:06,958
[Joe] I just want the best for May.

412
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,125
If you're not happy with me,
find another caddie!

413
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:13,541
[Dad] I'd like to thank all the sponsors
who've been supporting us.

414
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:17,500
Without the sponsors,
we wouldn't have come this far.

415
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,250
[screaming]

416
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:24,666
And a big thank you to the reporters
who've followed our journey.

417
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,916
Thank you so much. Thank you.

418
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,333
Hi, Uncle Nu.

419
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,583
Hi, May.

420
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,375
It's all right.

421
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,375
Keep trying.

422
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,750
-It'll be yours one day.
-Thanks.

423
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,583
This is Tae.

424
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,791
Hi.

425
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:51,916
Hi.

426
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,750
He's responsible for the golf scoop.

427
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,041
-He's been following your career.
-Thank you.

428
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:02,375
Uncle Nu, excuse me...

429
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,458
-I have to...
-Go on.

430
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,708
I understand you.

431
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,958
[spokesman]
All right, it's time to invite May.

432
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,500
Never give up.

433
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,166
I won't.

434
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,791
Goodbye.

435
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,250
Goodbye.

436
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,750
[applause]

437
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:28,250
[cameras clicking]

438
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:43,375
ONE WEEK AFTER THE TOURNAMENT

439
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:50,458
[Dad] You're terrible at putting

440
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,875
and chipping.

441
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,750
That's why I've always pushed you
to drive hard.

442
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,458
If you had followed my plan,

443
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,166
you would've been
the first Thai LPGA champion.

444
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,333
I...

445
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:13,125
I did what I thought was best
under the circumstance.

446
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,583
And it's over.
Why do you have to rub it in?

447
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,875
You're pigheaded.

448
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,958
You've stopped listening to me.

449
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,708
And your caddie, Joe.

450
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,333
He's not good enough for you.
I'll fire him.

451
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Dad.

452
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,291
It's my game. I'll choose my own caddie.

453
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,416
And Joe's been good to me.

454
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,791
Stop telling me what to do.

455
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,625
How dare you speak to me like that.

456
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,791
I've had your back all your life.

457
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,125
I've seen everything.
I made you what you are now.

458
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,291
Joe doesn't suit you anymore.

459
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,208
A caddie like that
will never get you near a trophy.

460
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:21,000
Is it because he's not good
or is it because he doesn't listen to you?

461
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,166
Stop dictating my life.

462
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,500
I'm not your little girl anymore.

463
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,875
I can decide for myself
what's good and what's not.

464
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,208
To tell you the truth...

465
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,625
I lost that match because of you.

466
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,583
If you hadn't bossed me around,
I would've scored.

467
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:45,791
[table thuds]

468
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,958
I am your father.

469
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,958
I created you.

470
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,958
You're here because of me.

471
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,833
You're my daughter.
You have to listen to me.

472
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,916
No.

473
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,458
From now on, I'll play the way I want.

474
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,666
You have no right to order me what to do.

475
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,916
You're not even a pro...

476
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:18,875
remember?

477
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,333
When you can play better than me,

478
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,333
then you can tell me how to play.

479
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,416
-Is everything all right?
-Fuck off!

480
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:14,958
[sighs]

481
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:35,041
-Miss, can I take these for you?
-Um, no.

482
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:37,875
I'm going to finish it.

483
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,625

-Of course.

-Take this.
-Thanks.

Mm. Where would you like to shoot
the photo for the scoop?

Hmm...

May, let me ask you something.

665

Why do you collect bottle caps?

666
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:23,416
Another egg noodle bowl, tom yum soup,
extra meat balls, and braised pork.

667
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,916
No veggies, no bean sprouts.
Make that two. Thank you.

668
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,333
I was reading the menu.

-A boy?

Watch your mouth, crazy girl.

Why are you dressed like this?

686
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,666
For a photo shoot,
at the 18th hole in Pattaya.

Now you both have to come with me.

Have you made peace with that cursed hole?

[Mo] Maybe it's for the best
the ball didn't go in.

699
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,666
If you had scored,

The life after you failed that putt.

704
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,708
[Dad] All they have to do
is practice, practice, and practice.

705
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,625
Practice the way I tell them to!

706
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,000
I know you've cut Mo some slack
when I'm not looking.

707
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,875
Now she's falling behind her sister!

708
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,541
May has become a much better player!

709
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:26,208
I'll do everything to push May
as far as possible.

710

If you think your approach
can help them improve,

you can take Mo, I give her to you!

at this hole.

When I recover...

718
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:07,541
I will become the world's no. 1.

719

And you...

720

Fatty. Wait until I show you my power.

Do you want to hurt another shoulder?

I'll have deep-fried snapper

to be your caddie at that time?

but the flight ball
is a little off target.

816
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,916
You are not her. You just think you are.

817
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:24,458
So, just get on with it...

818
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,083
and hit that ball.

819
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:45,000
[audience applauding]

820
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,291
[male announcer]
Wow. What a shot.

821
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:51,583
That's amazing.
That must be the shot of the year.

822
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:54,291
[female announcer]
Ha-ha, wow. I can't believe it.

823
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,791
[audience]
Aw.

824
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,000
[Tae]
Move left.

825
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:23,875
Set up properly.

826
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:31,583
[male announcer] Oh, wow.
What a beautiful smile from Thailand.

827
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,375
[camera shutter clicks]

828
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:41,000
[female announcer] Ariya's playing well
and will definitely make the cut.

829
01:18:42,875 --> 01:18:49,541
Welcome to the day three live coverage
of the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic.

830
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,208
May Ariya has narrowly made the cut.

831
01:18:53,291 --> 01:18:56,125
If she wants to beat
World No. 1 Kristen Lee,

832
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:59,416
she has to play her best golf.

833
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,583
[audience applauds, cheers]

834
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:10,583
[newsman]
A phenomenal performance from Ariya.

835
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,875
With this form,

836
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:15,750
she has a real chance to win it
on the last day.

837
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:24,041
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT

838
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,541
[May] Hi, this is May speaking.

839
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:31,750
May.

840
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,250
I want to ask you for a favor.

841
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,416
Can we meet?

842
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:37,708
Sure.

843
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,916
UNCLE LAO NOODLES

844
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,791
You want me to bring you to see your dad?

845
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,916
You're the only person he'll listen to.

846
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,791
I need to get over this.

847
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,000
If I can't get rid of this knot
in my heart...

848
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:07,958
I will never win anything.

849
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:13,625
You're just like your dad, you know that?

850
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,500
Do you have any idea
why he and I didn't talk for ten years?

851
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,500
We were once very close.

852
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:30,750
We came to Bangkok from the province
together.

853
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:35,666
But when we grew up,
our goals became different.

854
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,291
The day I realized that

855
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:44,791
he was using you two
to achieve his own goal...

856
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,708
I cut all ties with him.

857
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,125
In golf, the only person you have to beat
is yourself.

858
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:02,125
So, you have to go and see him yourself.

859
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,291
[female voice]
Five, four, three, two, we are live.

860
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:16,041
[news program's intro music plays]

861
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:20,375
Welcome to the final day of LPGA Tour
Yokohama Tire Classic 2016.

862
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,333
Today is the last day.

863
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:26,875
Ariya Jutanugarn will go head to head
with World No. 1 Kristen Lee.

864
01:21:26,958 --> 01:21:31,166
Will Ariya win
her first LPGA championship today?

865
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:40,458
[male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Kristen Lee.

866
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,000
[audience applauds, cheers]

867
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:44,500
And Ariya Jutanugarn.

868
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:46,333
[audience applauds, cheers]

869
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,583
[male announcer]
Hole 1, par-4.

870
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,125
Keep your eyes on the world's no. 1.

871
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:14,208
[male announcer]
She beautifully drives the ball

872
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:15,916
to the middle of the fairway.

873
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,125
Ariya is at the tee off
and is under a lot of pressure.

874
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,958
[man cheers]

875
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:36,000
[male announcer]
A brilliant first shot, straight and long.

876
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:39,166
The ball goes farther than Kristen's.
Superb.

877
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:49,208
[male announcer]
Kristen Lee's ball is in the bunker.

878
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,458
This putt line is tricky.

879
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:54,916
She has to sink this putt for par.

880
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,291
She missed. It's a bogey for Kristen Lee.

881
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:08,750
Wonderful. Ariya scores a birdie.

882
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:11,083
Yes! That's it.

883
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
After three holes,

884
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:18,666
Ariya is leading Kristen Lee
by one stroke.

885
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:22,166
[male announcer] It's a chance for her
to make history for Thailand.

886
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,541
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT

887
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:02,500
Dad.

888
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,208
How are you doing?

889
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:26,458
[male announcer] She missed again.
The pressure is on Ariya.

890
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:30,750
The momentum has swung back
to Kristen Lee.

891
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:34,750
She turns the situation around
and now leads Ariya by three strokes.

892
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:48,291
[May] I'm concerned about your health.

893
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,583
You don't have to worry about my career.

894
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,875
I've had a lot of help lately.

895
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Many foreign coaches have advised me.

896
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,791
You came all the way here to tell me this.

897
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,833
Did you know...

898
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,083
When you left me...

899
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:22,791
Mo,

900
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,083
and Mom...

901
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,708
did you know how much we suffered?

902
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:35,500
You built everything.

903
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,833
And all of a sudden,
you walked away just like that.

904
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:49,666
How could you be so heartless?

905
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,541
[male announcer]
An absolutely important putt.

906
01:25:57,625 --> 01:26:00,708
She has to keep Kristen
from pulling ahead too far.

907
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:14,458
-[audience cheering]
-And Ariya's done it in a critical moment.

908
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:18,708
She's behind Kristen by two strokes.
It's still possible to catch up.

909
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:25,000
The Goddess of Victory
hasn't abandoned May.

910
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:32,291
Kristen Lee missed the putt,
and it's a bogey.

911
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,666
[male announcer]
Another birdie for May.

912
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,166
-Yeah!
-Woo!

913
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:45,583
[male announcer] Two birdies in a row
can turn the momentum in her favor.

914
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:47,791
She has a real chance to win it.

915
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,791
[audience applauds]

916
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:02,583
[male announcer] Ariya keeps making
birdies on the last nine holes.

917
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:09,458
We're now at the 17th hole.

918
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,583
If Ariya can save par,

919
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:14,291
she'll go into the last hole
with a one-stroke lead.

920
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:16,458
The championship is within her grasp now.

921
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:20,625
You won't achieve anything...

922
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,750
if you still have that mentality.

923
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,875
What a waste,
after I've taught you all my life.

924
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,916
[Dad] What happened in Pattaya
was just the beginning.

925
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:48,375
As long as you refuse to believe me...

926
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,750
it's hopeless

927
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,333
to dream of becoming the world's no. 1.

928
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:01,125
[male announcer]
Unbelievable.

929
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:03,750
Ariya dropped a stroke on the 17th.

930
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:06,416
Now the score is tied
with Kristen Lee at -14.

931
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,166
The championship will be decided
on the 18th hole.

932
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:48,500
[male announcer]
A wonderful first shot on the last hole

933
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:50,416
from the world's no. 1.

934
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,166
[Dad] Remember.

935
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,750
The winner is...

936
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:12,500
the one who drives the longest.

937
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,166
[male announcer] Ariya's drive is longer,
but the ball's in the rough.

938
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,041
A tough next shot for her.

939
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,666
Kristen Lee's approach

940
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,875
stopped in front of the green.

941
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,333
Five.

942
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:04,041
[male announcer] She picked this iron,
meaning she'll go for it.

943
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,416
But from the rough, it won't be easy.

944
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:11,791
-[audience] Aw.
-No. The ball landed in the bunker.

945
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:14,416
It's the same situation
as in the last hole

946
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,500
of Honda LPGA Tour Thailand in 2013.

947
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,583
[groan]

948
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:37,166
[male announcer]
It's Kristen's third shot.

949
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:39,291
She has all the advantages over Ariya.

950
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:49,708
Whoa, too strong.

951
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:56,958
The ball drifts beyond the hole
and down the slope.

952
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:59,458
It's not going to be
a walk in the park for Kristen.

953
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:01,125
[audience applauds]

954
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:04,416
Unbelievable.
Kristen Lee missed her third shot.

955
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:08,250
Now it's an opportunity for Ariya
and for all of Thailand.

956
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:19,041
[Dad] As long as you refuse to believe me,
it's hopeless

957
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:22,083
to dream of becoming the world's no. 1.

958
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:44,125
[May]
Thank you for taking me this far.

959
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:52,375
[May pants]

960
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:55,958
[pants]

961
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,625
But I won't stop here.

962
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,416
I will be the best in the world.

963
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:16,458
[audience applauds, cheers]

964
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:19,375
[male announcer]
A wonderful bunker shot.

965
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:23,666
May overcame the pressure and did it.

966
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,708
A decisive putt.

967
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:33,875
She has to save par with this putt
in order to remain in the competition.

968
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:06,500
[male announcer]
She missed.

969
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,583
Ariya has to save par now

970
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:12,333
to become the first Thai
to win an LPGA tour.

971
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:16,583
She'll write a new chapter
in the history of international golf.

972
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:44,625
[male announcer]
The most important putt in Ariya's life.

973
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:48,041
The shot that will make her a champion.

974
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:05,291
I know you can do it.

975
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,041

-[audience cheering]
-[male announcer] That's it!

977
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:43,208
Ariya Jutanugarn has won
the Yokohama Tire LPGA!

978
01:34:43,291 --> 01:34:45,416
Bravo!

979
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:50,166
She's the first Thai in history
to ever win an LPGA tournament.

980
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,291
Ariya Jutanugarn!

981
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:58,625
The journey has been long
and full of obstacles.

982
01:34:58,708 --> 01:35:01,041
But she finally did it today.

983
01:35:01,375 --> 01:35:05,375
She's brought pride
to the people of Thailand.

984
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:32,166
[Nu]
All right,

985
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:35,916
that was the amazing story
of May Ariya Jutanugarn.

986
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:38,666
As we all know,

987
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:41,375
that victory wasn't her highest point.

988
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,583
After the Yokohama Classic,

989
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:46,291
she would go on to win
many more tournaments

990
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:49,083
and eventually become no. 1 in the world,

991
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:51,125
full of pride.

992
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:55,458
But that's not exactly
what I want to tell you.

993
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,916
The real story is about

994
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:01,666
how we overcome our failure

995
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:06,333
and how we move on
from the lowest point in our lives.

996
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,666
Because we have to keep moving on.

997
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,250
May also keeps moving on,

998
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:15,000
no matter how disappointing or painful
her experience was.

999
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:19,833
Likewise, her sister,
Mo Moriya Jutanugarn,

1000
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:24,250
kept improving until she reached
the top ten in world rankings.

1001
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:29,750
This is the story of two Thai sisters
who became phenomena in the golf world.

1002
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,083
Now, you're curious,
how much truth is in this?

1003
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,500
Hall is real,

1004
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:40,458
and we hope he'd forgiven May
for extorting his money

1005
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:43,750
and that the boy who hated golf people...

1006
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:45,458
I hate golf people!

1007
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:48,666
would end up becoming a scientist.

1008
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,750
Tae is real.

1009
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,291
Well, sort of.

1010
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,625
Initially,
he didn't know anything about golf.

1011
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:00,416
But the story of May and Mo
became an inspiration

1012
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:04,458
that made him want to become
Thailand's no. 1 sports reporter,

1013
01:37:04,541 --> 01:37:08,000
which is impossible
because I'm still here.

1014
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:12,416
Finally, am I real?

1015
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:14,416
Well, just forget it.

1016
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,416
In fact, there's a genius
in every Thai family.

1017
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:25,083
How children can grow up
to become geniuses

1018
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:30,208
depends on how their parents
prepare, support, and groom them.

1019
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:32,750
No need to imitate the Jutanugarns' way.

1020
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,791
Find your own approach,

1021
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:36,833
commit to it,

1022
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:41,750
and never stop
until you've found your genius.
