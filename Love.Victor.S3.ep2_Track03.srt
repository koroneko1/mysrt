This is my son, Asher.

She's probably not religious like you,

so maybe that's why
it was easier for her.

- Victor... I really thought you
would get the hint by now,

but since me not answering
your texts didn't work,

and me not talking to you
at school didn't work,

00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,924
I'm gonna make this
as painfully clear as possible:

- I'm the jerk?

285
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,981

and I decided to stay with my boyfriend.

286
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,193
And I understand that sucks for you,
but we were really good friends,

287
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,779
and, and Benji's in rehab, and I, I could
just really use a friend right now.

- Benji's in rehab?

289
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,659
- [sighs] Shit. Why'd I say that?
- Probably because you're high right now.

290
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,495
- Look, you know what? It's okay.

291
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,623
Because Benji told me that I, I can
tell people I trust, and I trust you.

292
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:21,129
- Victor, admitting how I felt about you
was the bravest moment of my life.

293
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,132
After the wedding,
I went back home, and I waited for you.

294
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,428
All night, I stared out the window
waiting for you like a fool,

295
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,972
and I get that you chose Benji.

296
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,473
I'm not mad at you for that.

297
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,350
But then you decided
to just brush it all aside

298
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,353
by sending me jokey texts
and life updates.

299
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,439
I thought that we had a connection,

300
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,942
and you made me feel like
I was crazy for that.

301
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,402
If you can't see how hurtful that is,
