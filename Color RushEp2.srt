00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:04,767
(Hur Hyun Jun)

00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:15,046
(Color Rush, Episode 2)

4
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:21,686
At least, my breathing is better now.

5
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:24,027
Before, I felt like I was suffocating.

6
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:28,256
I don't like being touched by just anyone.

7
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:32,126
Then you should know that I'm more than that to you.

8
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,766
A mono and his probe.

9
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,906
That's what I am, aren't I?

10
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:48,717
I'm sorry to say this but...

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,187
You don't look like you're sorry.

12
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:58,287
Fine, I'm not sorry.

13
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,526
I never wanted to meet my probe.

14
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,026
It never crossed my mind and it never will.

15
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,127
Because it turned out to be me?

16
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,067
That isn't the case.

17
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,166
All I want is to live in peace.

18
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,737
Let go of me.

19
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,237
Are you all right?

20
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,877
You still need to rest.

21
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:24,647
Look at me.

22
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:27,886
I said, look not glare.

23
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,397
Do you want me to show you my face?

24
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:40,327
So that you can see colors.

25
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:42,037
I don't need this!

26
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:46,466
You're better off not getting involved with a mono.

27
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,776
- What's that? - Because...

28
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,506
monos have kidnapped probes,

29
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,177
killed those in their lives,

30
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,417
and have also killed probes...

31
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,686
to eat their flesh.

32
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,686
Oh, that.

33
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:05,727
Don't you get how serious this situation is?

34
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,827
No, not really.

35
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,126
I just like the movement of your eyes when you see colors.

36
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,297
Let's make a deal.

37
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:19,707
I'll teach you the colors of this world.

38
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,806
In return, you'll show me the colore moving of your eyes.

39
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,577
What do you say?

40
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:27,716
I'm not interested.

41
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:36,586
What are you doing next week?

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,857
Are you a mono?

43
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,197
- Yes. - I knew it.

44
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,336
We told the others that you fainted after seeing a ghost.

45
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,366
A ghost?

46
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,737
We figured it'd be better than everyone knowing you're a mono.

47
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,667
Then the old man Min Jae knows...

48
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,677
That's right.

49
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,507
It's the spirit of an old man that possesses Min Jae.

50
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,047
Some bullies accused Min Jae because they thought...

51
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,947
Min Jae was a mono last year.

52
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:05,547
Min Jae went,

53
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,086
"Don't you ride that motorcycle!"

54
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,156
to one of the guys.

55
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,586
Then to those standing beside and behind him, he went,

56
00:03:13,357 --> 00:03:14,757
"Don't you stare at that tree..."

57
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:16,827
"and don't you get on the back of that bike."

58
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:18,927
Like that.

59
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,697
It got them all worked up at the time,

60
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,966
but while riding the bike...

61
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,207
that very weekend, they collided...

62
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,906
with a truck at the intersection.

63
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,507
One ended up under the truck,

64
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,177
but one was nowhere to be seen.

65
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:36,547
Their friends and the police looked everywhere for him.

66
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:39,917
A little later, one of their friends fainted from shock.

67
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,987
It turns out that the one riding on the back...

68
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,327
flew straight into...

69
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,596
a tree.

70
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,197
His tongue was hanging long.

71
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:55,697
That's why our school doesn't have bullies anymore.

72
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,737
If anyone bothers you, the spirit of Min Jae's Grandpa...

73
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,806
I told you that isn't the case.

74
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,176
My grandpa has the ability to see the near future, that's all.

75
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:04,947
That's what he said.

76
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:09,077
How powerful can an old ghost be, right?

77
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,216
Still, if anyone annoys you,

78
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,486
we'll be there to fend them off.

79
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:15,957
Why though?

80
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,757
Because we're friends. Isn't it obvious?

81
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,367
Yeon Woo doesn't have any friends.

82
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,867
Shut it, will you?

83
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,236
- Wait, did your grandpa say that? - Yes.

84
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,577
I'm grateful for you guys not being judgmental,

85
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,606
but it's easier for me to be alone.

86
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,947
But still... Hey.

87
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:45,447
Leave him be.

88
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,057
Monos are known to be loners.

89
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,197
White, snowy white,

90
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,736
light gray, silver gray,

91
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:07,606
moonlit gray, cement gray,

92
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,276
dolphin gray, shark gray,

93
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,976
charcoal gray, and black.

94
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,887
Again, my world is in the shade of gray.

95
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:46,877
Aunt Yi Rang, this is urgent.

96
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:50,276
I need to transfer schools again. My probe goes to this school.

97
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,197
That's the color of the ocean.

98
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:11,466
The color of the ocean?

99
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,236
The oceans I saw were of a different color.

100
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,906
This is the color of that water.

101
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,827
(Missing Person)

102
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,226
(Yoo Yi Ri, mono)

103
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,096
This is the portrait of my mom that my dad drew before dying.

104
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,296
He said her lips are red.

105
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,106
Unfortunately,

106
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:22,176
I don't know the color of her sky-blue dress,

107
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:24,606
the color of her brown shoes,

108
00:07:27,476 --> 00:07:31,086
or what he meant by her lips being red.

109
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,986
I wish to see the colors used in this painting.

110
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,827
Mom said she couldn't forget the feeling of the color rush...

111
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,726
when she first met Dad.

112
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,137
She injured both her knees from falling to the ground,

113
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,336
but she still loved the rush.

114
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,976
That's probably when she first realized...

115
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,846
that she looked good in a sky-blue dress,

116
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,086
that she looked even nicer in brown shoes,

117
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,117
and that red lips suited her.

118
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:14,757
For the first time in my life today, I saw colors.

119
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,356
And I loved it.

120
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,237
The female mantis is eating the male mantis.

121
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,676
That is how it ends for male mantises...

122
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,706
who risk their lives trying to mate.

123
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,147
Female mantises...

124
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,217
eat male mantises during mating season.

125
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:40,087
Male mantises try to mate knowing they'll lose their lives.

126
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:44,487
Female mantises eat them entirely without leaving anything behind.

127
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,727
(Self-studying)

128
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,597
You must think your good looks give you a free pass for everything.

129
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,066
Arriving after the first class ends?

130
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,497
All right, I hear you.

131
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,536
- Yoo Han, take your seat. - Sure.

132
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,406
- Hurry up. - Got it.

133
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,347
Yeon Woo. Choi Yeon Woo.

134
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,387
I'm here.

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,887
Hey!

136
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,426
Choi Yeon Woo, look at me, will you?

137
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:28,967
What about your mask?

138
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,566
I still have it on.

139
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,076
Did you just poke me with that?

140
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,747
No, the art supply shop closed up early,

141
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,416
so I went by there this morning.

142
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,517
What for?

143
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:46,686
To buy this.

144
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:52,357
Even academic tutors give previews before getting the job.

145
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,526
I offered to teach you about colors...

146
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,997
without giving you one myself.

147
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,967
That's why... Ta-da.

148
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,897
Come on. Take it.

149
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:05,267
This is what is called a color chart.

150
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,776
Okay, now let me explain.

151
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:10,906
Everyone starts with the basics, right?

152
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,276
Come on.

153
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,117
Seriously?

154
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:27,686
Hey.

155
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,686
How are these different?

156
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:00,926
Let me teach you.

157
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:07,497
All right. The number three...

158
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,467
refers to this being the third card.

159
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,206
Y stands for the color yellow.

160
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,377
And GY stands for green yellow.

161
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:19,446
- I'm not interested. - R stands for red.

162
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,916
YR stands for yellow red which is also orange.

163
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,987
Y stands for the color yellow.

164
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,117
B is blue.

165
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,826
PB is purple blue which is also navy blue.

166
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:37,097
P is purple.

167
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:41,597
Lastly, RP is red purple.

168
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:32,847
You're up.

00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,857
That was a dirty trick you pulled. How could you take off your mask?

170
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,627
Hardly. I was going to put my mask back on,

171
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,257
but you looked before I could.

172
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:41,727
You'll pay for this.

173
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,337
Oh, sorry.

174
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,377
Does this still not intrigue you?

175
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:03,717
I want to see the colors.

176
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:12,826
No...

177
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,426
Yoo Han, take off your mask.

178
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,337
- I should take it off? - Right now!

179
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,467
I will if you want me to,

180
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,507
but only later.

181
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:34,916
No, show me right now.

182
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,316
You jerk.

183
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,026
You got your preview.

184
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,757
So should the tutoring continue?

185
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:09,117
