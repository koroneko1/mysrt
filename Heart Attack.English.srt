1
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,250
PEOPLE SHOULD GET AT LEAST
SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP A DAY

2
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,083
MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH

3
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,166
That’s stupid.

4
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,250
Humans can go without sleep
for at least two days.

5
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:42,916
Today

6
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,291
is my third day.

7
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,416
DAY THREE

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,541
See? I'm still okay.

9
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,458
I’m not dead,

10
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,166
but it's been three days.

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,916
My body is heating up a little.

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,208
Let it cool down a bit.

13
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,750
The last time was also like this.

14
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,916
Jae, wait a moment.

15
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,875
I just need another ten seconds.

16
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,166
Ten, nine,

17
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,416
eight, seven,

18
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,750
six, five,

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,083
four,

20
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,291
three,

21
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,416
two,

22
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,541
one.

23
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,416
Why are you here?

24
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,416
Yoon, you have four hours left.
The client has been calling non-stop.

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,041
-How many photos left?
-Seven.

26
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,833
Seven photos. How many minutes per photo?

27
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,083
I don't know.

28
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,125
Seven photos in four hours.

29
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,375
We won't make it.

30
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,916
Yoon. Should I call to postpone?

31
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,500
I can postpone it. It won't look bad.

32
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,750
I'm serious. I'll call him now.

33
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,833
Jae, don't.

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,541
-I accepted the job.
-No, Yoon.

35
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,666
I told him I would finish it in time.
I must keep my word.

36
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,708
He's putting too much pressure on you.
How many times have we fixed it?

37
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,416
-This isn't the first or the second time.
-That's not the point.

38
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,166
For real, do you think you can finish it?

39
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,208
I don’t know. I promised them,
so I must get it done.

40
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,500
-So, you won’t postpone, right?
-Right.

41
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,791
You'll make it, right?

42
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,208
-Yes.
-Okay.

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,708
Hey, stop being paranoid.

44
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,333
I'm about to unleash a new power.

45
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,708
What kind of power?

46
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,708
Is there anything to eat?

47
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,083
I don't know.

48
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,875
Jae doesn't know that my new power is
about

49
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,666
 to be unleashed in three seconds.

50
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,583
Three, two, one.

51
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,291
It's been 96 hours now.

52
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,625
Humans can actually go
without sleep for four days.

53
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,208
DAY FOUR

54
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,416
Jae, I'm done.

55
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,041
Jae, wake up.

56
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,541
Wake up.

57
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,458
-Okay.
-Wake up now.

58
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,583
-All right.
-Hurry up.

59
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,916
-Don't.
-Come on.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,166
Wake up.

61
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,916
Yoon.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,416
Your work is marvelous.

63
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,250
There’s not much time left.
My boss won’t change anything.

64
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,041
I think

65
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,208
it's okay, but it's still not enough.

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,416
But we did it according
to your instructions.

67
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:51,916
Yes.

68
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,416
I know. But...

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
it could look more elegant.

70
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,833
I believe it can look more elegant.

71
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,208
Let me ask you.

72
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,625
Are you happy with this?
Do you really like it?

73
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,125
How should it look then?

74
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,333
Listen. That's your job, not mine.

75
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,291
Otherwise, why would I hire you?
Am I right?

76
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,333
I’ll be back to have a look.
Make it quick.

77
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,041
Yoon...

78
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,833
Fuck.

79
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,583
I have one hour
to make these more elegant.

80
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,125
Paragon.

81
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,958
EmQuartier.

82
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,458
Emporium.

83
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,000
Yoon, are you almost done?

84
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,458
The print shop will give our slot away.

85
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,000
-Are you almost done?
-Just a bit more.

86
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,500
Yoon.

87
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,291
Stop it. It’s already perfect.

88
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,416
We are out of time.

89
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,708
They don’t look like
what I instructed at all.

90
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,083
-I...
-It's a lot better.

91
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,916
I love it. Print it now.

92
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,291
Good work.

93
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,750
If you ever quit working as a freelancer,
pay me a visit.

94
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,625
That felt so warm and romantic.

95
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,000
This time, it feels like I defused a bomb.

96
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,416
Excuse me.

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,375
Excuse me. Your food is here.

98
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,333
Jae, what’s the date today?

99
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,000
It's the 27th.

100
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,541
Something's wrong with your brain.

101
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,958
It’s my friend’s dad’s funeral.

102
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,166
Shit. Should I go?

103
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,666
-Should I?
-How did he die?

104
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,041
He...

105
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,708
He died of old age. That’s all.

106
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,916
That’s okay, right? It's not a sad death.
He didn't crash his car or anything.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,916
Give him an envelope
with 2,000 baht in it.

108
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,208
-Is that what's in your head?
-Yes.

109
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,375
He's my best friend's father.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,666
Do you even have a best friend?

111
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,041
Of course, Pongsathorn.

112
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,625
When was the last time you saw him?

113
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,208
I don’t know.

114
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,708
I forgot.

115
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,333
Your best friend.

116
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,416
You should ask him
if he sees you as his best friend.

117
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:27,791
Of course, he does.

118
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,958
Sure. But the deadline is 8 p.m.,
I already sent you the file.

119
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,416
You have five hours to finish it.

120
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,000
If you were me, would you go?

121
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,166
-See you.
-If I'm going to lie,

122
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,708
what should I say? Anything except
being sick or busy with work.

123
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,958
-So?
-I don't know. Your deadline is at 8 p.m.

124
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,916
-I should go. Five hours.
-Wait. Where are you going?

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,041
I'm going to the office.

126
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,833
Pongsathorn, I’m sorry.

127
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,583
Does this temple have Wi-Fi?

128
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
What the hell, Yoon?
What do you need it for?

129
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,958
I have to submit my work from here.

130
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,250
What the hell is wrong with you?

131
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,791
Don't get upset. I'm sorry.

132
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,458
-I really have to.
-I don't know. Ask the monk over there.

133
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,958
Hello, Sir.

134
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,166
Does this temple have Wi-Fi?

135
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,708
-You can use the one from my house.
-All right.

136
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,916
The server is

137
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,708
Kaewking Temple House 1 Wi-Fi.

138
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
-What's the password?
-The password is

139
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,166
-Indiansubcontinent79.
-How do you spell that?

140
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,125
I finished it in the taxi,

141
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,625
but I only just got Wi-Fi
and charged my battery.

142
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,291
I have uploaded it already.

143
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,500
You can check it.

144
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,500
Yes.

145
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,583
Pongsathorn.

146
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,791
Please don’t be sad.

147
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,916
Death is a part

148
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,958
of this planet's cycle of life.

149
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,291
If you are too busy to attend the funeral,

150
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,791
you shouldn't have come.

151
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,625
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,166
Yoon, I always have to call you
to collect your checks.

153
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,750
Do you want your money or not?

154
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,916
I’m sorry. I'm very busy.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,416
Here. Your checks are about to expire.

156
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,375
I see.

157
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,791
Thank you.

158
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,125
All done.

159
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,041
Wow. You've got many checks.

160
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,791
-It must be hard to keep hold of them all.
-Oh.

161
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,458
-Hello, Peng.
-Hello.

162
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,958
-How are you?
-I have been busy.

163
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,416
That's why there are so many.

164
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,875
How are you? I heard you stayed awake
for four days, right?

165
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,625
Actually, four and a half days.

166
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,583
Really?

167
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,583
I think with Jae’s type of work,
three days should be enough.

168
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,875
You are getting old now, you know.

169
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,750
You are right.

170
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,625
-It's...
-Hello, Peng.

171
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,416
Hello. You came at the perfect time.

172
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,625
Jerd, this is Yoon, your idol.

173
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,958
-Hello, Yoon.
-Hello.

174
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,375
Talk to him.
It's not easy to meet him in person.

175
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,083
I see. Yoon.

176
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,333
We often study your work in class.

177
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
You're my inspiration.

178
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,625
Wow. Thank you.

179
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,666
So,

180
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,083
is he working for you now?

181
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,250
Not yet.

182
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,041
I met him at a contest.

183
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,208
His work was good, so I recruited him.
I wanted to get to know him.

184
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,000
That sounds familiar.

185
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,083
You are right.

186
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,916
To be honest, when I met Jerd,

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,208
I thought of you.

188
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,958
He works hard like you.

189
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,583
His pimples gave it away.

190
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,625
Keep it up.
I might send some work your way.

191
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

192
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,750
Peng, I have to go.

193
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
-I've got work to finish.
-Sure.

194
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,625
Peng.

195
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,208
If you have any work for me, just send it.

196
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,291
-I’ve been wanting to work with you.
-Sure, I'll give you a call.

197
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,125
All right. Goodbye.

198
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,291
Wait, Yoon.

199
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,166
What's wrong with your neck?

200
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,625
Fuck.

201
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,833
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 2

202
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,208
What the hell are these dots?

203
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,750
Fuck.

204
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,708
My work rate has decreased by ten percent.

205
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,458
Damn it. Scratching myself
wastes a lot of time.

206
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, my god.

207
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,166
This is annoying.

208
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 2.5

209
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,416
Yes.

210
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,416
I’m not on the computer.

211
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,750
Okay.

212
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,625
How is the overall feedback?

213
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,625
Yes.

214
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,000
I see.

215
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,208
FULL SPEED SERVICE

216
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,166
Okay.

217
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,541
Do I need to

218
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,708
fix anything?

219
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,333
Okay.

220
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,666
Yes, I can write it down.

221
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,583
Okay. I'm ready.

222
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,666
I think you should

223
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,708
check on the other stuff first.

224
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,000
I will do it as soon as I get home.

225
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,833
Did you decide to go with the first draft?

226
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,541
What about the 15th draft that I did?

227
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,958
Six thousand seven hundred
and eighty-five baht.

228
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,750
Wait.

229
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,708
I need to call you back.

230
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,791
What's the name again?

231
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,500
Are you Mr. Assanai Srisiri?

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,875
Yes.

233
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,041
Six thousand seven hundred
and eighty-five baht, please.

234
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,958
Do you have health insurance?

235
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,541
No, I don’t.

236
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,166
It's 6,785 baht then, please.

237
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,541
This is 1,500 baht.

238
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,500
I already have paracetamol at home.

239
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,333
This is 3,285 baht.

240
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,875
This is 2,000 baht.

241
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,666
Damn it. That's everything.

242
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,041
I just got this check.

243
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,333
ASSANAI SRISIRI
SEVEN THOUSAND BAHT

244
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,791
Take before bedtime.

245
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,083
May cause drowsiness.

246
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,458
Shit. My 7,000 baht.

247
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,833
I better take it then.

248
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,500
-Jae.
-What's up?

249
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,958
Send June's photo to me now.

250
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,916
Her stomach is hard to retouch.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,458
-Now.
-Okay. Give me a second.

252
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,583
Hang on. I'm stamping it right now.

253
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,666
It's due at 9 a.m., right?

254
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,208
Damn you! Elephant tranquillizer!

255
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,666
Wait.

256
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,291
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 2.5

257
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,291
Shit.

258
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,458
It's spreading.

259
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,583
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 4

260
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,916
What's with the turtleneck?

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,875
Are you cold?

262
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,125
I'm using a MacBook.

263
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,041
Steve Jobs.

264
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,958
He died, you know.

265
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,875
Is it wrong to want to look cool?

266
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,125
Girls don't dig guys
who wear turtlenecks in summer.

267
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,958
-You got that shirt for free, too.
-Shut up.

268
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,666
I don’t know about anyone else,

269
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,458
but just so you know,

270
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,166
I won’t give you any work

271
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,750
if you are sick.

272
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,833
What's wrong with your finger?

273
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,708
Shit.

274
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,666
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 5

275
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,041
Was the thing on my neck just a warning?

276
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,625
SIMILAR PICTURES

277
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,958
Pyelonephritis.

278
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,041
Mosquito-borne tropical diseases.

279
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,541
Drug allergies.

280
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,375
May lead to death.

281
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,583
Shit.

282
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,666
What the hell is wrong with me?

283
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,708
PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE CHEAPER

284
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,166
"Public hospitals

285
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,833
are cheaper. They have better doctors.

286
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:27,958
You will definitely be cured.

287
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,708
Contact the Dermatology Institute."

288
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,375
WELCOME TO DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE

289
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,708
ADMITTING 300 PATIENTS PER DAY

290
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,583
At 6 a.m.?

291
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,791
But it could save 7,000 baht.

292
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,083
DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE

293
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,541
Excuse me. Where can I register
for the Dermatology Institute?

294
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,583
Window four. Down there.

295
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,208
Shit.

296
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,458
I didn't come early enough, did I?

297
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,750
Number 15.

298
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,041
Number 15.

299
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,333
Number 16.

300
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,083
Number 16.

301
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,666
Shit. Another 159 people.

302
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,541
Number 177.

303
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,958
Number 177.

304
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,958
Number 177.

305
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,166
Number 177.

306
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,291
I'm 175.

307
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,458
I called your number ten times.

308
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,708
You have to wait.
Your file went back to the records room.

309
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,333
You just passed my number by two.

310
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,208
Mr. 175. Don’t be selfish.
Take a seat and wait.

311
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,333
I will call you again.

312
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,958
And please pay attention this time.

313
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,166
Number 178.

314
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
Number 178.

315
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,833
Damn it.

316
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,208
If I paid 7,000 baht,
I would be done already.

317
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,916
Who said money can’t buy time.

318
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,333
Such a waste of time.

319
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,208
In three hours,
I could have removed 20 pimples

320
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,583
and retouched 30 more boobs.

321
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,958
Fuck this. Forget it.

322
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,416
Number 175.

323
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,375
Number 175.

324
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,125
I'm 175.

325
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,625
Please go to room number five.

326
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:11,916
Damn you, Doctor.

327
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,583
You'd better cure me.

328
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,375
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

329
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,416
What’s your name?

330
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,833
-Assanai.
-Last name?

331
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,791
Srisiri.

332
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,333
JAE

333
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,791
I won't examine you if you pick up.

334
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,791
So, what is the matter?

335
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,125
I have a rash

336
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,958
-on my arms and neck.
-Let me look.

337
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,333
-I see.
-It's on my finger too.

338
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,958
How long have you had it?

339
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,125
I've had it for a while now.

340
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,041
What’s your occupation?

341
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,416
I’m a graphic designer.

342
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,666
A graphic designer?

343
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,333
Are you regularly exposed to ink powder?

344
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,208
No, I'm not. I work on a computer.
I retouch photos.

345
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,416
I see.

346
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,208
Something like resizing
celebrities' boobs for magazines?

347
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,708
I also remove pimples and stuff like that.

348
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,958
Whose boobs are the hardest to work on?

349
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,041
I’m not at liberty to say.

350
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,625
So, I guess you have seen
a lot of boobs then, right?

351
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,166
Guys like you are good at...

352
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,625
that program Photo--

353
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,458
-Don’t scratch it. Photoshop.
-Photoshop.

354
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,708
-Right?
-Yes.

355
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,125
I...

356
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,666
I tried once, but it was too hard.

357
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,666
You tried using Photoshop?

358
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,333
What for?

359
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,458
Well...

360
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,583
You know, sometimes I get pimples,

361
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,833
and I had to post some photos.

362
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,666
So, you know, it was embarrassing.

363
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,291
But in the end,

364
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,666
I couldn't work it out.

365
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,833
To remove pimples,
you should use the clone stamp tool.

366
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,416
-See?
-Touch it lightly and drag it.

367
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It's over my head.

368
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,333
It's not hard.

369
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,500
Yes.

370
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,916
It is hard.

371
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,208
Let me see your finger.

372
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,500
Are you still in med school?

373
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,041
Yes, I am.

374
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,041
I'm doing medical specialty training.

375
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,666
If you

376
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,958
don't feel comfortable,

377
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,708
-you can change doctors.
-No, it's not like that.

378
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,541
I just imagined you would be older.

379
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,708
But you are not old.

380
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:08,666
I see.

381
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,958
Let me have a look.

382
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,333
So, you don’t really sleep much, do you?

383
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,583
How do you know?

384
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,541
It’s obvious.

385
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,166
I can see it in your eyes.

386
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,708
Shit! Why am I blushing?

387
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,083
Oh, no.

388
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,125
Stop sweating right now. Please stop. 

389
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,083
Are you hot?

390
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,666
What?

391
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,708
Are you hot? Because...

392
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,333
-you are sweating.
-Am I?

393
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,333
Yes.

394
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,500
Or...

395
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,333
I don’t know.

396
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,375
You are really not well.

397
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,458
Now, pull up your t-shirt.

398
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,291
Why?

399
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,541
I have to examine you.

400
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,791
Don’t be shy.

401
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,916
It’s okay.

402
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,083
Pull it up.

403
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,333
This is the most fucked up
moment in my life.

404
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,666
You said it was only on
your neck and hands.

405
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,541
Did you scratch here?

406
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,833
Yes, you did. Look at them.

407
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:35,791
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 13

408
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,458
Shit. I wish I could do some sit-ups now. 

409
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,916
Does it itch anywhere else?

410
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:42,708
Well...

411
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,750
There are some on my stomach
and some on my arms.

412
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,166
How about your penis? It’s important.

413
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,291
Oh, man.

414
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:56,958
Come on.

415
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,041
Your penis is just an appendage.

416
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,958
It's like your arms and legs.

417
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,458
No, it's not. How are they alike?

418
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,958
I can do an infographic for you later.

419
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,708
Come on. You are already 30 years old.

420
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,333
-You can't wait. No.
-It's all the same.

421
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,833
-They are just sores.
-It's okay.

422
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,291
I’ve seen more than
a thousand penises. I’m okay.

423
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,166
I’ve only seen one penis. I’m not okay.

424
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,291
Sir, we are very busy here.

425
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,750
A lot of patients are waiting outside.

426
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,458
-I understand.
-Good.

427
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,375
Look. They look like these here.

428
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,000
You see them, right?

429
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,833
They are just like these.

430
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:03,583
I see.

431
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,291
What's okay, Doctor?

432
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,500
Fuck.

433
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,166
So this is what being raped feels like.

434
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,125
Did you get raped or something?

435
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,000
Shit. Can she hear my thoughts?

436
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,041
All done.
Come back next month for another checkup.

437
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:48,833
Next month?

438
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,041
My schedule is always changing.
I am quite busy.

439
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,375
I will prescribe you
some medicine for this month.

440
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,541
The pharmacist

441
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,916
will explain how to take it.

442
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,750
I need you to do four things for me.

443
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,833
Listen carefully.

444
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,041
First,

445
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:10,791
take all your medicine.

446
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,208
Second, stop eating seafood altogether.

447
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,458
Third, go to bed before 9 p.m.

448
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,083
Fourth, exercise for 30 minutes a day.

449
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,708
All that?

450
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,291
And do not scratch.

451
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,708
Can't you give me
a get-better-right-away pill?

452
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,958
I’m kind of in a hurry.

453
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:29,958
If you are in a rush,

454
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,041
then exercise for one hour.

455
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,458
There is no such pill.

456
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:37,291
That's not what I meant.
I just want some medicine to cure me.

457
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,416
Non-drowsy ones, please.

458
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,166
Mister, your damn body
is declaring war with you.

459
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:44,583
Shit.

460
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,250
The doctor just said damn.

461
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,625
She rocks.

462
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,833
I’m sorry I said damn.

463
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,666
Sorry. You see,

464
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:57,500
your body is trying
to let you know that it's not okay.

465
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:00,916
-It’s actually trying to kill me.
-Correct.

466
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,166
All right. See you again next month.

467
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,041
Ms. Toi, send in the next patient, please.

468
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,541
Take these home and read them.

469
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,291
SKIN ALLERGY

470
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,625
Here is your next appointment.

471
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:19,166
See you next month. I hope you get better.

472
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,625
If I’m not free next month,

473
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,583
-can I reschedule?
-Come on.

474
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:23,750
The date is set.

475
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,958
Don't reschedule.

476
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,333
I want to see you.

477
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,250
Okay.

478
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,083
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

479
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:52,333
Excuse me.

480
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,291
So, what’s wrong with me?

481
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,333
I don’t know yet.
I just know you have an allergy.

482
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,333
An allergy.

483
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:05,583
Thank you.

484
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,250
Stop staring. It's stressing me out.
I'm almost done.

485
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,458
You never finish work late.

486
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,625
I still have time.

487
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,250
You are almost out of it.

488
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,166
-Jae.
-What?

489
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,666
I’m curious about something.

490
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,875
What is it?

491
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,208
Have you ever had

492
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,750
a breast cancer exam?

493
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Yes, why? Do you have breast cancer?

494
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,666
So, you’ve had them checked?

495
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:48,291
Yes.

496
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,458
Weren’t you embarrassed?

497
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,083
Why the hell are you asking? Just shut up

498
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,208
and work. Keep your hands busy.

499
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,000
No, I'm curious. Weren't you embarrassed

500
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,750
when you showed your boobs to the doctor?

501
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,666
Doctors see millions of boobs every day.
They wouldn't care about mine.

502
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,750
Not even if the doctor was a man?

503
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:06,750
No. The only time that I was embarrassed

504
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,666
was the first time
I showed my boobs to my boyfriend.

505
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,583
That is way too much information.

506
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:13,916
Well, you asked for it.

507
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,083
I asked about your doctor, not your boobs.

508
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,708
Why were you embarrassed?

509
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,333
Well,

510
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,000
because I like him.

511
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,833
We usually feel shy
around the people we like, right?

512
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,666
Why are you asking this?

513
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,958
Are you asking for someone else?

514
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,166
No, I was just curious.

515
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,416
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

516
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,666
Just tell me now.

517
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,416
What's going on?

518
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:42,833
I was just curious.

519
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,125
-Really?
-I'm done.

520
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,416
See? I told you it wouldn't be late.

521
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,666
Okay. Is it this one? I'll take it now.

522
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,375
Sure.

523
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,708
This is what they call late.

524
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,125
-How is it late?
-You are three minutes late.

525
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,083
Less than five minutes doesn't count.

526
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,041
Normally, you finish an hour early.

527
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:00,583
Is there anything to eat?

528
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,625
I waited for hours to get you this.

529
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,583
See how kind I am.

530
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,833
It's your favorite.

531
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,375
Send the rest to me later.

532
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,333
Okay.

533
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,625
Let's go, Suchart.

534
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,000
Shit. I’m conflicted.

535
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,583
What about the shrimp dumplings
you buy every day?

536
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,500
I don’t know either.

537
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:40,666
From what I heard,

538
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,416
if you are allergic to some kind of food,

539
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,041
you must eat more of that

540
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,833
to get over the allergy.

541
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:48,125
Like using snake venom

542
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,500
-to make snake serum, right?
-Yes.

543
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,083
-Have you ever heard of that?
-No. Never.

544
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,375
Fight fire with fire, man.

545
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,875
-You’re full of shit.
-I'm serious.

546
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,041
Damn it. What should I do?

547
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,083
-Kai.
-Yes.

548
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,208
Do you think we eat to live,
or live to eat?

549
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,833
Live to eat. Or else, why bother living?

550
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,000
I agree.

551
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,291
You should have said we eat to live,
so I would throw this away.

552
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,708
Don't you have any work?

553
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,208
-Well?
-I'm busy.

554
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,416
That's why I'm here to ask you.
Tell me now.

555
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,541
Okay. We eat to live.

556
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:19,666
Are you happy?

557
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,458
Right?

558
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,416
We eat to live.

559
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,625
But the soup is to die for.

560
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,166
What should I do?

561
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,208
You talk too much. How about this?

562
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,791
Trade your shrimp wontons
for my foot-long cheese sausage?

563
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,666
I’ll give you two.

564
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,333
Damn. Why am I not allergic
to macrobiotic food?

565
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,666
Everything that tastes good
is bad for our health.

566
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,875
But life without tasty food

567
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,000
is a sad one.

568
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,916
Such a waste of time. We've been talking
about wontons for ten minutes.

569
00:32:58,833 --> 00:32:59,916
I’ve made my decision.

570
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,708
Fuck you, shrimps.

571
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,125
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 23

572
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,625
I sent you the file.
See you at the meeting later.

573
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,500
Okay. But why did you send it late?

574
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,833
Bitch, it wasn't late.
Stop using the word "late". I hate it.

575
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,000
TAKE BEFORE BEDTIME MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS

576
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,291
Take before bedtime. May cause drowsiness.

577
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,708
I’ll have to skip this one, Doctor.

578
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,000
I feel so guilty.

579
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,208
What do I do?

580
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:05,416
Yes, Mister?

581
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,416
I want to become a member.

582
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,041
Monthly

583
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,416
-or lifetime?
-Lifetime.

584
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:11,916
Here.

585
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,333
All done.

586
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,875
Damn.

587
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,291
I feel healthier already just holding it.

588
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:21,666
I will be back.

589
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,083
Aren't you going to work out today?

590
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,750
Not yet. I have to go back to work.

591
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,666
I see.

592
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:36,791
Posting a picture of my new shoes
makes me breathe easier already.

593
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:37,791
NEW SHOES, NEW LIFE

594
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,958
This is where my healthy lifestyle starts.

595
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:49,458
What’s up, Jae?

596
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,083
“New shoes, new life.”

597
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:54,791
Someone like you,
jogging in the morning sunlight?

598
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,125
Why not? Even some rock stars
play ping pong. What is it?

599
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,333
Isn't a job better than a sunburn?

600
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,458
October 7, an early brief.

601
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,666
Sure.

602
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,541
This print job has five photos.

603
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,666
You have four days.

604
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,791
Do you know the way to Joe’s place?

605
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,208
DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE APPOINTMENT FORM

606
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,666
Remember? You’ve been there.

607
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:14,083
Jae.

608
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,458
What?

609
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:16,666
What day is it again?

610
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,625
October 7.

611
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,333
WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 7

612
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,375
I can't go.

613
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,916
What? You just said you could.

614
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,583
I have another job. Sorry.

615
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:32,250
OCTOBER 7

616
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,041
Damn. Dark circles.

617
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,125
She will know just by looking at me.

618
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,291
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 23

619
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,250
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 33

620
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,625
You’re not helping me at all.

621
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,125
I did what you told me.

622
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,708
New shoes?

623
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,166
Have you been jogging yet?

624
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,708
Judging from your rash,
you haven't done a thing.

625
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,208
No topical cream residue.
You’ve been scratching again, right?

626
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,458
It's itchy, Doctor.

627
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,833
Shouldn't I scratch when it itches?

628
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,000
-No.
-The itch goes away when I scratch.

629
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,291
It does not.

630
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,416
-What?
-Scratching makes it itchier.

631
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,708
You open up your wounds.

632
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,666
And the bedtime pills, you haven’t
been taking them either, have you?

633
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,083
Can you tell that I haven't?

634
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:41,833
No.

635
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,250
But based on your reply,

636
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:44,583
I know you haven’t.

637
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,375
And how is your penis?

638
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,458
Aren't you being too attentive, Doctor?

639
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,666
I’m really upset.

640
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:07,541
You're asking too much.
I feel like you're asking me to be a monk.

641
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,583
-This--
-Who sleeps at 9 p.m. anyway?

642
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,333
-It's not--
-My job doesn't allow that.

643
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,375
-What I asked you to do isn't hard.
-It is hard.

644
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,791
Doctor, do you go to bed at 9 p.m.?

645
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,208
Are you saying
that you work 24 hours a day?

646
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:23,833
Yes.

647
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,375
Don't you get weekends off?

648
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,500
-No.
-Sundays...

649
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,166
Wait. Shouldn't you get Sundays off?

650
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,916
Why should I?

651
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,583
Do you need the money?

652
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,791
No. It has nothing to do with money.

653
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:41,250
Let me explain.
The freelance industry is very tough.

654
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,416
Whatever work comes in, I have to take it.

655
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,666
Otherwise, someone else will take it.

656
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,416
And if I don’t take the job,

657
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,833
they won’t hire me next month.
Then I'll be in deep shit.

658
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:53,708
Why not get an assistant?

659
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:57,708
If I got an assistant, the company would
contact them directly and hire them.

660
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,416
Another thing is

661
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,041
since they called me for the job,

662
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,833
they want me to do the job.
I must do it myself.

663
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,041
Do you think you will only get
a rash and that's it?

664
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,791
This is just the beginning.

665
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,958
Fuck you, body.

666
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,500
Don't scratch.

667
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,291
What's your nickname?

668
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,500
-Yoon.
-Yoon, I'm Im.

669
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,333
Since we are around the same age,

670
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,458
let's be friends.

671
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,041
When I treat a patient,

672
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,625
I take it seriously.

673
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,125
I think that

674
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,666
you take things seriously too.

675
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,208
Because when I treat someone

676
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,666
and that patient doesn’t get better,
I feel like I'm not doing my job properly.

677
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,125
Do you know what I mean?

678
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,375
You may wonder

679
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:06,458
why I ask you so many personal questions

680
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,250
and they seem like none of my business.

681
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,333
But just trust me, I really do care.

682
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,125
Think of this as a partnership.

683
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,541
It's my pleasure to work with you.

684
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,250
Shit. You’re so screwed.

685
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,125
If you haven't improved
the next time you come,

686
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,291
you will see my dark side.

687
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,000
See you next month.

688
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
-Goodbye.
-You don't need to do that.

689
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:06,958
We are friends.

690
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,083
Don't scratch.

691
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,666
It’s perfect already.

692
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,833
Just check it and submit,
or you’ll miss your bedtime.

693
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,291
Hang on.

694
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,083
Fuck. Her nail is chipped.

695
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,958
Holy cow. It's almost 9 p.m.

696
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:59,625
You take long showers,
so you need extra time.

697
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,125
You also have to apply the cream.

698
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,166
Stop being paranoid.

699
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:05,541
No one will notice it.

700
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,250
It's tiny.

701
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,791
Enough. Done. Stop. Save. Send. Sleep.

702
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,291
Just hit Command-S.

703
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,875
Save.

704
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,416
Hello, I sent it.

705
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,708
What? Wasn't that too fast?

706
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,125
I'm just that good.

707
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,541
Sure.

708
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,541
You can't do any more. You sent it.

709
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:33,708
Turn off the computer.

710
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,333
Turn off the computer.

711
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,416
Turn off the computer.

712
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,375
Turn off the computer.

713
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,333
Turn off the computer.

714
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,416
Damn it. You only shook her hand once.

715
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,708
It's driving you crazy. 

716
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,625
This is the bravest
you’ve been in seven years.

717
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,666
The last time you were in bed before nine
was in seventh grade.

718
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:28,791
Inhale.

719
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:31,541
Exhale.

720
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:33,791
Inhale.

721
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,083
Exhale.

722
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,166
Inhale.

723
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,250
Inhale.

724
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,291
Hold on.

725
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,125
I have another deadline
on Wednesday, right?

726
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,583
Damn it. Seven hours out the window.

727
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,333
I should have fixed the nail.

728
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:55,041
Shit! I’m lying down but I can’t sleep.

729
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,375
Her nail is still broken.

730
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,541
Forget it. No one will notice it.

731
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,541
But if you noticed it,

732
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,166
someone else might too.

733
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,541
How could you submit
such crappy work like that?

734
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,541
Shit. Her nail is broken.

735
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:10,833
Just sleep.

736
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,625
I won't be able to fall asleep
if I force it.

737
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,791
In order to fall asleep,
I have to stop thinking about it.

738
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,958
But her nail is broken.
Oh, my god. Just sleep.

739
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,083
Stop thinking already.

740
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,333
Shit. But her nail is broken.

741
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,958
Shit. Stop thinking. Her nail is broken.

742
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,666
Wake up, kid.

743
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,666
What's with this machine?

744
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,750
How can anyone lift it when it's so heavy?

745
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:24,916
Mister.

746
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,458
Do you need any help?

747
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:00,541
I am coming for you.

748
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,541
I’m going to get you. You damn rash.

749
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,666
Wait.

750
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,208
Shit. I forgot to turn on my phone.

751
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,958
Holy cow, 57 missed calls.

752
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,541
Did a client die, Jae?

753
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:24,166
What's up?

754
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:26,666
What's up?

755
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,250
Didn’t you call me?

756
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,958
Never mind.

757
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,416
Just tell me why you called.

758
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,625
Nothing. The girl group's cover,
I saw one of the nails was chipped.

759
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:40,750
But I got Jerd to fix it. It's fine now.

760
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,791
What?

761
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:44,125
You sent my work to Jerd.
That was out of order.

762
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,833
Yoon, it's not a big deal.

763
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:47,583
-Not a big deal?
-It doesn't make a difference.

764
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,166
-Really.
-Fuck you. How can you say that?

765
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,000
-No difference?
-The job was simple.

766
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,041
-Be reasonable.
-Fuck you.

767
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,166
-You should have told me.
-You

768
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,791
turned your phone off for half a day.

769
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,208
I had to fix it. You weren’t here.

770
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,375
Is there a girl?

771
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,000
Hell, no.
Have you ever seen me with a girl?

772
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,750
No. I'm not saying you can't or anything.

773
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,041
But you can't just
turn your phone off like that.

774
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,875
Normally, you’re more professional
than this, you know?

775
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,083
Luckily, I spotted it first.

776
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,875
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.

777
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,291
"Normally, you’re more
professional than this."

778
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,166
Damn it. I'm not getting better.

779
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:45,916
I'm not getting better.

780
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,041
I'm tired.

781
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,291
I wasted my time.

782
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,500
What the hell am I doing?

783
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:56,916
Wait.

784
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:00,708
Shit.

785
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:02,416
NOVEMBER

786
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,666
There are fewer spots now.

787
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,375
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 33

788
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:06,458
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 31

789
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,791
One or two spots fewer

790
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,625
doesn't count.

791
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,166
But there are fewer spots.

792
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:14,666
Thank you.

793
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,541
Did you do everything I told you to?

794
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes.

795
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,458
Are you sure?

796
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,875
Yes.

797
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:27,208
Where did it go wrong then?

798
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,041
Let me ask you more personal questions.

799
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,625
I need to find out more.

800
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:41,791
What is your favorite food?

801
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,083
I guess

802
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,708
shrimp dumplings from 7-Eleven.

803
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:50,791
Your favorite food is from 7-Eleven?

804
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,666
There's nothing else to eat at night.
And they taste good.

805
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,541
They also have rice balls.

806
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:57,791
Are you joking?

807
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,291
I’m not joking. They really have them.

808
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,958
What do you do when you are free?

809
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,958
Oh, that’s hard to answer.

810
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,708
No, it isn’t. How about

811
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,416
movies, music,

812
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:13,916
the mall,

813
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,416
or the beach?

814
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,375
-Nothing?
-Those are just a waste of time.

815
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:20,958
How are they entertaining?

816
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,958
What would I do at a mall?
Shop for clothes? I don't buy clothes.

817
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,583
You don't buy clothes?

818
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,041
My old clothes are still okay.

819
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,458
Why would I go shopping?

820
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:30,541
I'm can't be bothered.

821
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,791
You could go out just for the sake of it.

822
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:33,875
It's fun.

823
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,041
What do you mean,
"go out for the sake of it"?

824
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,208
You go out for the sake of going out.

825
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,583
I don't get it. What do you mean?

826
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,375
Sometimes, it seems like

827
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,125
you are trying to piss me off.

828
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:50,291
No. Why would want to I piss you off?

829
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,666
What entertains you the most then?

830
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,708
-To think of a new project.
-Stop. That's work.

831
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,291
No. Work is when someone hires me
to do a job. The one I'm talking about

832
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,208
is my very own project.

833
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:10,583
Okay. How about sports?

834
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,666
Sports?

835
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:13,916
I like to play badminton.

836
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,541
But I don't have anyone to play with.

837
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,708
Don't you meet up with friends

838
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,166
ever?

839
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,166
I meet them sometimes,
at funerals and weddings.

840
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,000
But I can’t make plans
since my schedule always changes.

841
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,291
Do you have a girlfriend?

842
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,208
Damn.

843
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,875
What does that have to do with my rash?

844
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,666
Seriously, some people think
they're not related

845
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,625
but a patient’s lifestyle
has an effect on their disease.

846
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:41,625
-Really.
-I see.

847
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,583
And if I don’t have a girlfriend,

848
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,333
what is your medical opinion
on having one?

849
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,458
It actually depends on the person.

850
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,541
Some people have a partner

851
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:55,291
and it benefits them.
But some people's lives

852
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,541
are ruined because of dating.

853
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,208
Like how it can make you fail an exam.

854
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:08,833
You are like a detective.

855
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:10,958
I’m close to finding the bad guy.

856
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,541
You already know half my life story.

857
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,750
My mom has never even asked
some of your questions.

858
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,833
Are you saying I’m nosy?

859
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,083
No. Why would I say that, Doctor?

860
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,458
You should get more sleep.

861
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,416
What makes you say that?

862
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,083
I'm an expert on this.

863
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,708
I can tell just by looking into your eyes.

864
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,458
Yes. It's my

865
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,958
exam period.

866
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:49,791
I recommend Red Bull

867
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,125
mixed with coffee.

868
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,583
It will keep you up until dawn.

869
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,166
And that’s good?

870
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:56,958
It’s okay.

871
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,416
Well, we are not

872
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:07,125
in our 20's anymore. Back then,

873
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:10,166
I could stay up for two days
with no problem.

874
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:13,541
Now that I'm in my 30's,
my body is starting to break down.

875
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,916
-How many days can you go without sleep?
-Five days.

876
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,166
I'm one of the X-Men, you know?

877
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,708
It's my superpower.

878
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:32,041
But I'm okay, it doesn't affect me.

879
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:36,500
It's...

880
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,541
necessary.

881
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,250
Then

882
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:44,041
I think you should quit.

883
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,708
It's my job. How can I quit?

884
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:50,125
If you can't quit, you should cut down.

885
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,291
I can't.

886
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:59,500
But other freelancers I see
don't work as hard as you.

887
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,916
That's the case for normal people.

888
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,166
It's their choice.

889
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,500
I know that I can do more. So, why would I

890
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,458
want to be a normal person like them?

891
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:20,166
I don't think your work

892
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,500
is the source of your rash.

893
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,291
Make sure you take the bedtime pills.

894
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:33,208
I have been taking them.

895
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,958
If you have, you would be complaining
how sleepy you are right now.

896
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:57,666
Fuck.

897
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,208
How is it?

898
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,916
See? His work is good.

899
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:03,916
It's as good as yours.

900
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,500
To be honest, Jerd is just like you
were five or six years ago.

901
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:10,458
Everyone is calling him
Yoon the second, you know?

902
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,458
So, why did you call me here?

903
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,416
-It's wasting my time.
-Look.

904
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,208
Adidas Japan.

905
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:27,166
I'll take it!

906
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,333
Fuck. I'm sorry, Doctor.

907
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,000
You agreed without thinking.

908
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,583
Good. You will finally work
with an international brand.

909
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:36,708
I know you’ve been dying to do this.

910
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:38,416
Do you know how hard it was to land this?

911
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,958
Do a good job this time.

912
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:43,833
What's wrong? Are you possessed?

913
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,291
No. I'm just thinking

914
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,666
if I have other projects.

915
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,500
You must clear those projects first.

916
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,500
Make this your main project.

917
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:58,208
If you do a good job,
you will definitely get more projects.

918
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:06,916
Don't worry, Doctor.

919
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,208
I won’t break my promise.

920
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,458
Hey.

921
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,416
You can't charge your computer here.

922
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,208
Sir,

923
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:22,541
I just need to download a file quickly.

924
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,000
-Make it quick.
-I will.

925
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,458
MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS

926
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,333
I'm taking it, Doctor.

927
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,416
Fuck!

928
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:28,125
I have half an hour left.

929
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,041
-Is it ready?
-Yes.

930
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,333
Yes.

931
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:47,166
Thank you.

932
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,125
That is half of it.

933
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,625
I'll send the other half tomorrow morning.

934
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:53,666
Did you not finish it?

935
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,458
This is a big project.

936
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,083
-What are you doing, Jae?
-I'm calling Jerd.

937
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,708
Why? I'll submit it tomorrow.

938
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,833
-Yoon. I need it now.
-Don't call him, Jae.

939
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,291
-You have another half to finish.
-It--

940
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,458
-I'll finish it.
-No.

941
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,708
-You couldn't finish it.
-I will.

942
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:09,958
-Hello, Jerd.
-Why--

943
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,625
Yes. This is Jae.

944
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:14,666
Yes. That's right.

945
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,208
Do you have some free time?

946
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:17,416
Yes.

947
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,041
Okay. I have an urgent job for you.
It's for Adidas.

948
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,583
You can? Good.

949
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:23,208
You are free? Okay. Great.

950
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:24,416
Okay. Where are you?

951
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,500
Okay, I'll send it to you right now.
Goodbye.

952
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,416
Yoon, put it on the thumb drive
for me now.

953
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:33,416
No.

954
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,625
-Yoon.
-No.

955
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,208
This isn’t the time to be selfish.

956
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:38,625
-Are you ten years old?
-That's not it.

957
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,958
That's not it?
What are you doing right now then?

958
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,916
I said I would submit it tomorrow morning.

959
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,500
You have another half to do.
You won't make it in time.

960
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:49,458
Didn't you tell me
that a freelancer must be responsible?

961
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,416
-"If you can't make it, don't take it."
-But I can make it.

962
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:54,791
Can you really?

963
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:55,750
Yes.

964
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,833
Seriously, do you think so?
It's impossible.

965
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,458
-You have another half to do.
-Jae, I have been waiting for this job.

966
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,583
I don't want it to go to someone else.
Do you want me to beg?

967
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,000
Jae, please. Just this one time.

968
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,416
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

969
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:24,958
What do you expect me to do?

970
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,000
Damn it.

971
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:31,500
Let's go, Suchart.

972
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,458
MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS

973
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,875
Bring it on, bedtime pill.

974
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,250
I’m not afraid of you.

975
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,083
Kai, badminton.

976
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,666
-What?
-Let's play badminton.

977
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,625
What?

978
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,916
-Hurry.
-All right.

979
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,500
Don't hit it to the left
then to the right. I'm tired.

980
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,916
What's with the fancy technique?

981
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,875
Damn. I'm now immune to this bedtime pill.

993
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,458
Do you still have time to see me?

994
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,750
I’ve been standing here for a while now.

995
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:29,000
I feel like I’m making life hard for you.

996
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Seriously,

997
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,208
why are you here?

998
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,833
I’m trying very hard, Doctor.

999
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:43,083
Do you call this trying hard?

1000
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:44,208
Yes.

1001
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:46,333
Do you even know it has spread
to your ear?

1002
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,666
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 31

1003
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,500
If your skin is this severe...

1004
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:51,458
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 50

1005
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,875
...just imagine how rotten
you must be inside.

1006
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,833
I understand, but...

1007
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,458
I got this job

1008
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,208
that I have been dying to do.

1009
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,375
And I finally got it.
Do you think I can turn it down?

1010
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,291
An opportunity like this
comes once in a lifetime.

1011
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:08,875
Don't you only live once too?

1012
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
Exactly. You only live once.

1013
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,333
That's why you must follow your heart

1014
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,291
and do the best you can.

1015
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,791
You don't seem afraid of death.

1016
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,833
You said people only live once, right?

1017
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,958
Shouldn't we be happy while we are alive?

1018
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,500
My job is my happiness.

1019
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:27,791
I never feel tired when I work, Doctor.

1020
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,958
So, is it wrong for me to work hard?

1021
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:33,291
Also, everyone dies.

1022
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:34,583
You are a doctor. You should know.

1023
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,208
You don't know anything about death.

1024
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:37,625
I may know more than you.

1025
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,375
-That's why I'm not scared.
-Hold on.

1026
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,583
I used to know someone
who talked like you.

1027
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,791
He never cared about anyone
his entire life.

1028
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:46,250
Are you like that?

1029
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,208
I think your diagnosis

1030
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,541
has gone too far now.

1031
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,208
Being told you are nosy

1032
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,333
-is actually quite offensive.
-No, I...

1033
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,041
I didn't mean it like that.

1034
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,541
Okay. It’s a doctor’s duty
to never turn a patient away.

1035
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,250
So I have to continue treating you.

1036
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,000
Sorry for wasting your time.

1037
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:30,708
Do you still have the pills?

1038
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,125
Here.

1039
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,166
Next time, if you want a different doctor,

1040
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,500
you can have it.

1041
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,833
Just inform them at the counter.

1042
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,583
I'm never lonely

1043
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:30,666
Because I have me
To care for myself

1044
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:32,166
-The loser
-Damn.

1045
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,291
Is this a music video?

1046
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,708
Must take care of himself

1047
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,708
Fuck you.

1048
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:42,375
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1049
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,458
No.

1050
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,958
Are you sure? Do you want to see a doctor?

1051
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,666
Damn it.

1052
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,125
I have to wait a month

1053
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,625
to apologize to her.

1054
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:05,708
Yoon.

1055
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,291
-Yoon.
-Yoon.

1056
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,333
Yoon.

1057
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,375
Yoon.

1058
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,750
The client said
the crack doesn't look natural.

1059
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:23,375
You can tell it's been retouched.
It looks unrealistic.

1060
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,416
I see.

1061
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:31,041
Another thing,

1062
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,375
I'm sorry that I have to point this out,

1063
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,166
but you forgot to erase the finger
of the guy lifting the athlete's leg.

1064
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,041
Shit.

1065
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:00,833
Don't make excuses.

1066
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,041
Accept that it's shitty.

1067
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,791
The work is shitty because you suck.

1068
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,083
Excuses don't exist.

1069
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:32,666
Yoon.

1070
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:35,416
Yoon.

1071
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:36,708
Are you listening?

1072
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,083
Yes.

1073
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:44,416
The second part of the Adidas project,

1074
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,000
the female set,

1075
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:49,916
they put it on hold.

1076
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,041
Who got the job?

1077
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,541
No one. They just put it on hold.

1078
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,125
That doesn't happen.

1079
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,166
Who got the job, Jae?

1080
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:14,458
Jerd.

1081
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,541
-Peng. Hello.
-Hello.

1082
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,125
How are you?

1083
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,666
I heard you're having a hard time.

1084
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,416
You heard about it?

1085
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,458
Of course.

1086
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:52,166
Even though I'm not in Jae's department,

1087
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,541
I heard about her
getting severely reprimanded.

1088
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:58,833
Accidents happen,

1089
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:00,250
-I guess.
-Come on.

1090
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,750
Some people become permanently disabled

1091
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,458
after a car accident.

1092
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,916
Freelancers need
to maintain their standards.

1093
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,541
Or you'll be unemployed
before you know it.

1094
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,875
I suck, Peng.

1095
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,125
Come on.

1096
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,125
Look on the bright side.

1097
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:24,458
You'll get some time off,

1098
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,750
just like other people,

1099
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,625
for the first time.

1100
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,333
Anyway, I have to go.

1101
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:30,333
I have a briefing.

1102
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:31,791
Goodbye.

1103
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,250
Happy holidays.

1104
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,541
Are you ready to be happy?

1105
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:03,958
Starting today, many people
will be traveling back to their hometowns,

1106
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,916
while others will be taking trips

1107
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,541
to cities within Thailand and abroad.

1108
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,041
We will ask...

1109
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,416
I'm going insane on the first day.

1110
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:12,750
Damn. I want a job right now.

1111
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,500
...and where are you traveling to?

1112
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,500
You've got mail, Sir.

1113
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,208
"Happy New Year, Son. Stay healthy,

1114
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:25,041
and take good care of yourself. Mom.

1115
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,833
P.S. When will you retouch
the picture I sent you?"

1116
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,916
That's not what I do, Mom.

1117
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,458
Shoot, Jae.

1118
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,333
Shoot what?

1119
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,041
Nothing.

1120
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:52,750
What's up?

1121
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,041
I'm going to Japan. Do you want anything?

1122
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:57,875
Japan? Why are you going there?

1123
01:08:57,958 --> 01:08:59,250
My boyfriend surprised me.

1124
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,250
We will celebrate New Year's Day together.

1125
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:03,666
Can't you do that at Central World?
It's just as boring.

1126
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,166
Do you want to talk to my boyfriend?

1127
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:10,958
Are you leaving now?

1128
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,416
Yes.

1129
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:13,625
I'm about to leave now.

1130
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,458
So, do you want anything?

1131
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:16,958
I don't know.

1132
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,791
I don't want anything. You should go.

1133
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:21,958
Enjoy your trip.

1134
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,250
Okay.

1135
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,083
Happy New Year in advance, Yoon.

1136
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,166
Happy New Year.

“Pulling an all-nighter on New Year’s Eve

1140
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:51,125
is the highlight of my life.

1141
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,041
My fifth day without sleep."

-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

1145
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,333
Shit.

1146
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:40,666
How did I get to this point?

1147
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:44,875
The point where my calendar is empty.

1148
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,458
Wait. Maybe it's not empty after all.

Excuse me.

Do you have anything
that is scientific, yet artsy?

01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:14,166
What do you want it for?

01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,583
Let me take a look around first.

1158
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,041
Sure.

1159
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,541
A highlighter shaped like a needle

1160
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,958
is the perfect gift.
Scientific, yet artsy.

1161
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,166
Okay. The first step,

1162
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,041
place the box on your wrapping paper.

1163
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,291
Then wrap it.

1164
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:17,333
-This activity is for a sixth grader.
-Estimate the length.

1165
01:12:18,041 --> 01:12:19,416
It's actually kind of fun though.

1166
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:27,375
JANUARY

1167
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:29,208
Number 133.

1168
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:30,666
DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE NUMBER 134

1169
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,250
HAPPY NEW YEAR

1170
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,583
Happy New Year.

1171
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:37,833
I should say it in Thai.

1172
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:41,000
Doctor, Happy New Year.

1173
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:43,833
Well...

1174
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:47,666
-Doctor. Last month, I'm sorry--
-Number 134.

1175
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:51,875
Shit. My hands suddenly froze.

1176
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,083
I feel like I'm on a roller coaster

1177
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,416
that's about to flip upside down.

1178
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,375
I'm Assanai.

1179
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:10,708
Am I in the wrong room?

1180
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:12,708
No, you aren't.

1181
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,708
Welcome. Doctor Chonnikarn
is busy doing her rounds.

1182
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,458
All right. Let me check

1183
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,083
your progress.

1184
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,208
Doctor. I...

1185
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,208
can come back next month.

1186
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:28,416
Why?

1187
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,208
So Doctor Im can examine me.

1188
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:32,083
She’s handling my case.

1189
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,208
I have her treatment plan.

1190
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,541
She wrote your medical records down.

1191
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:37,833
It won't affect your treatment.

1192
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:40,333
Come on.

1193
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:42,708
What?

1194
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:45,625
Sir, I studied the same textbooks
as Doctor Im.

1195
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:46,750
You won't die.

1196
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,416
Come on. Let me see your arms.

1197
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,208
Here. There are

1198
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,125
red spots.

1199
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,416
How long have you been
receiving the treatment?

1200
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,916
It's been half a year.

1201
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,291
Wow. That's quite a long time.

1202
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:09,208
Doctor Im.

1203
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,791
None of her patients want to get better.

1204
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,625
What the fuck are you saying, Chink?

1205
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,625
Chink. Stop texting.

1206
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,041
Pay attention to me first.

1207
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,333
Here you go.

1208
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:43,958
DOCTOR IM

1209
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:47,500
TELL HIM IF HE HAS TO STAY AWAKE,
DON'T BE UP MORE THAN ONE DAY,

1210
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,708
TAKE HIS BEDTIME PILLS AND REST

1211
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,708
I feel the inside of my body is changing.

1212
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,333
But I don’t know what it is.

1213
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:59,291
OH, AND TELL HIM NOT TO SCRATCH

1214
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:11,875
Hey, Mister.

1215
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:13,458
You were only supposed to read it.

1216
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:14,916
Please.

1217
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:16,625
Let me answer her quickly.

1218
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:23,541
DOCTOR, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST MONTH

1219
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:33,208
I'm sorry. Please let me read her reply.

1220
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:36,791
HAPPY NEW YEAR, YOU

1221
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:42,083
YOU SHOULD REST, TURN OFF
YOUR COMPUTER, GO TO THE BEACH

1222
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:44,750
WATCH THE SUNSET OR SOMETHING

1223
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,291
YOU TOO

1224
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,833
This isn't an internet cafe.

1225
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,458
Bye, computer.

1226
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,833
I must rest. Doctor's orders.

1227
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:24,041
I can't turn back.

1228
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:29,750
Do you have other colors?

1229
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,291
All of the rings float,
whatever color they have.

1230
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:39,291
But these don't look nice.

1231
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:46,458
How fun.

1232
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,416
Yoon.

1233
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,375
How entertaining.

1234
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,666
What do I do next, Doctor?

1235
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,833
I didn't bring my computer.

1236
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,625
I'm sorry.

1237
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,708
Next time, please...

1238
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:15,208
Next time, please call me.
I'll do it for you right away.

1239
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,208
Yes. Please call me.

1240
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,375
Okay.

1241
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,166
How can anyone just lie down
and do nothing?

1242
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,875
This is so unproductive.

1243
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:57,375
GODDESS TUBTIM

1244
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,250
Goddess Tubtim.

1245
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:09,000
Even though I've been
a bit picky with my work,

1246
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:11,458
I still want some jobs to come my way.

1247
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,291
Holy cow.

1248
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,708
I haven't even finished yet.

1249
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,708
What is it, Jae?

1250
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:24,958
Hello, Yoon.

1251
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:27,208
-Please come for the brief.
-Sure.

1252
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:30,000
Yoon, these photos look cheap.

1253
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,416
Shouldn't wedding photos
be a bit more elegant than this?

1254
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,041
I want them to look

1255
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,583
classier.

1256
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:37,875
I won't take the job.

1257
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,958
What?

1258
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,666
Did the beach chill you out or something?

1259
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:45,000
Why are you doing this?

1260
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:47,708
I got pregnant, so my boyfriend proposed.

1261
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,208
No. I meant, why do you have to quit?

1262
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,375
I'm pregnant.
My boyfriend doesn't want me to work.

1263
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,750
Can't you work when you're pregnant?

1264
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:54,916
If I were pregnant, I would still work.

1265
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,208
Why can't you understand?

1266
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,208
I'm having a baby.

1267
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,833
My job will affect the baby.

1268
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:00,708
If you play that card,
there’s nothing more to say.

1269
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,708
-Why are you getting upset?
-I'm not.

1270
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,208
You told me
we would work together forever.

1271
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,166
Yes, I said that.

1272
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:13,500
I'm sorry.

1273
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:15,916
But you understand, don't you?

1274
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,041
I don't. You can't do this to me.

1275
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,416
Are you really upset?

1276
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,041
-You have no right.
-Why not?

1277
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,833
No, listen to me. Don't worry.
Your work won't dry up.

1278
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:25,583
I will find someone to replace me, okay?

1279
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:26,541
Why are you upset?

1280
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,041
Because no one can replace you.

1281
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:33,833
I don't care if the new person
is better than you. She's not you.

1282
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:38,291
For me, there will never be another Jae.

1283
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,708
I'm sorry.

1284
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,791
Don't apologize.

1285
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:57,625
It's my fault.

1286
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,625
I knew that this day would come.
I prepared myself.

1287
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,625
But now that it's really here,
I can't deal with it.

1288
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:05,916
I'm sorry.

1289
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,083
I'm sorry, too.

1290
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:17,666
I don't mean to leave you hanging.

1291
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:20,541
But at some point, we have to choose.

1292
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:23,541
I just didn't choose my job like you.

1293
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,166
Can I ask you to do one thing?

1294
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:44,208
Even if we don't work together anymore,
give me a call sometimes.

1295
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:52,916
Sure.

1296
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,208
I will call you.

1297
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,958
Once my baby is born,

1298
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:04,750
you will be the first one I call.

1299
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:08,541
Oh, shit, no. I need to call my dad first.

1300
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,125
You will be the second one I call, then.

1301
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:13,625
Do whatever you want.

1302
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,625
I have a lot of pimples there.

1303
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,416
Please get rid of them for me.

1304
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,625
No pressure.

1305
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,291
The deadline is in two days.

1306
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:28,500
Fuck you.

1307
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:31,833
Please give me bigger boobs too.

1308
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,333
Is this man the best for you?

1309
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,416
Do I have time to find someone else?
I'm always with you.

1310
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,916
SURPRISE PROPOSAL VIDEO OF JAE AND SHANE

1311
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Hold on.

1312
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,291
You had a romantic moment like this?

1313
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,958
How the fuck is this a surprise?

1314
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,666
This is the most clichéd shit ever.

1315
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,625
Jae.

1316
01:22:17,916 --> 01:22:21,166
We have been dating for many years.

1317
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,625
Jae. If you cry,

1318
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:25,666
I'll kick you in the face tomorrow.

1319
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:29,541
Will you marry me?

1320
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:34,791
Sure.

1321
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,833
LET'S GET MARRIED

1322
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:42,916
I'm sorry.

1323
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,208
I'm not crying.

1324
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,000
It's okay.

1325
01:22:58,416 --> 01:22:59,291
Wait.

1326
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,500
I'm crying.

1327
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:01,791
What the fuck?

1328
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:13,333
FEBRUARY

1329
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:30,250
Doctor.

1330
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:31,541
How could you make a mistake?

1331
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,333
People's lives are on the line.
We are not farm animals.

1332
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,166
You should quit being a doctor.
Find a new job.

1333
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:39,041
Please calm down, Sir.

1334
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,916
Please calm down.

1335
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:39,541
Doctor.

1336
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,041
I have a gift for you.

1337
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,291
You weren't here last time,

1338
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:47,833
so I brought it with me today.

1339
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:50,458
I see.

1340
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,375
Thank you.

1341
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:00,250
Let's have a look.

1342
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,250
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 50

1343
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,333
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 24

1344
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:12,791
It has improved.

1345
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:29,666
All right. See you next month.

1346
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,708
Tell the pharmacist
which medicine you have left.

1347
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:49,291
Doctor. I want to tell you...

1348
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:22,583
Doctor.

1349
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:27,125
You don't feel well, do you?

1350
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:43,666
I suck.

1351
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:49,041
That guy's nephew
has been my patient for a long time,

1352
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:51,333
but he never got better.

1353
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,458
It turns out it was a misdiagnosis.

1354
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,333
My patients are unlucky

1355
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,208
to have me as their doctor.

1356
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:06,875
Otherwise, you would be cured by now.

1357
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:11,041
No one wants to waste their time
coming to the hospital, right?

1358
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,458
I'm sorry.

1359
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,166
And...

1360
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:29,166
I

1361
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:32,958
know that I'm not a good doctor,
but I'm trying.

1362
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,583
I'm trying my best.

1363
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:38,833
Fuck.

1364
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:41,458
This is the time to come up
with a super cool encouragement. 

1365
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,166
What should I say?

1366
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:45,208
What kind of a doctor am I?

1367
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:48,833
I'm eating sausages that look like
puppies' penises. They contain saltpeter.

1368
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,875
As a kid, I was hospitalized
after eating them.

1369
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,583
But if eating them makes you feel better,

1370
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,333
I think it's okay.

1371
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,916
It’s not the standard medical practice but

1372
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:06,333
the better you feel, the faster you heal.

1373
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,666
Shit. It rhymes.

1374
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,583
It sounds sweet like a poem.

1375
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:12,166
Am I seeing a doctor right now?

1376
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:19,041
Actually, I just realized
that being a doctor is tough.

1377
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:23,208
You have to say things
that make patients feel better.

1378
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,291
I feel like I’ve been a bad patient
all this time.

1379
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,375
Do you feel better?

1380
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,208
Yes.

1381
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:52,958
Thanks a lot.

1382
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:00,583
Aren't you busy today?

1383
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,458
Am I keeping you from your work?

1384
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:05,416
I lost my job.

1385
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:08,541
I screwed up once
and word got out within the industry.

1386
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,791
No one wants to hire me anymore.
So, I’m free every day.

1387
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:14,583
I should say that’s great, right?

1388
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:17,750
You can finally rest now.

1389
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:20,458
Right?

1390
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:43,375
You don't have dark rings
around your eyes.

1391
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,083
I retouched my eyes for you.

1392
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,916
I will erase the rash for you, too.

1393
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:56,750
Actually, our jobs

1394
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,416
have a lot in common.

1395
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,958
I don’t know if you still want to die.

1396
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,958
But don't die, okay?

1397
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:10,333
You will get better.

1398
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:11,958
Okay?

1399
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:33,375
“The way you look at someone
says a lot more than words.

1400
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,041
And feelings sometimes
cannot be explained.”

1401
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:38,208
Shit!

1402
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,666
How did he come up with that?

1403
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,083
It's so warm and romantic.

1404
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,291
MY WORK IN CENTRAL SHIBUYA

1405
01:30:57,208 --> 01:31:00,416
JERD, YOU MAKE THAI PEOPLE PROUD

1406
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,916
WOW, YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY

1407
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:19,083
CONGRATULATIONS

1408
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:33,583
Black and white
makes it look like a funeral.

1409
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,708
Yoon, my boyfriend
wants it to look dreamier.

1410
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,541
What do you mean by dreamier?

1411
01:31:39,791 --> 01:31:41,125
Dreamy, you know.

1412
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:44,708
The fact that you took these
at the park is lame. Don’t tell me

1413
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,000
-you want pink grass, too.
-Yes.

1414
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,875
Just do it to make him happy.

1415
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:50,041
-For real?
-Yes.

1416
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:52,916
Do you want me to add
a hopping rabbit at the back too?

1417
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:58,166
Sure. Anything that the customer wants.

1418
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:14,041
Does a relationship

1419
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:16,291
not waste your time?

1420
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:18,416
It does.

1421
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,541
But I made my choice.

1422
01:32:23,333 --> 01:32:24,833
To be honest, it is fun.

1423
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,833
You get to do new things.

1424
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:30,291
Such as?

1425
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:32,708
I won't tell you.
I don't want to spoil it for you.

1426
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:34,083
You are being coy.

1427
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:36,916
You learn how to love.

1428
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,833
Wasn't my answer so sweet?

1429
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:42,916
But you fight and stuff, right?

1430
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,416
It’s a lot of hard work,

1431
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,833
but surprisingly, it feels good.

1432
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:50,291
Weird, right?

1433
01:32:58,333 --> 01:32:59,625
Have you nailed her yet?

1434
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:01,833
What the fuck?

1435
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:58,791
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 9

1436
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,875
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 0

1437
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:04,916
Shit!

1438
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:06,916
I'm better.

1439
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:10,625
Shit. I'm better.

1440
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:15,125
I don't need to see
the doctor anymore, then.

1441
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,125
DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE APPOINTMENT FORM

1442
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,833
MARCH

1443
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:02,166
I thought you weren’t coming.
Why are you late today?

1444
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,208
-I couldn't sleep last night.
-Wait.

1445
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:09,833
Didn't you take your bedtime pill?

1446
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:11,791
I did.

1447
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,333
But I couldn't sleep.

1448
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,958
I see. How odd.

1449
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,208
Do you feel better today?

1450
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,208
Let me have a look.

1451
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:31,208
Come on.

1452
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:47,833
The other one.

1453
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:50,166
They're...

1454
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,916
They have dried up.

1455
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:53,416
Wow.

1456
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,750
Let me see your neck.

1457
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:02,666
Wow. They are all gone.

1458
01:36:08,416 --> 01:36:09,458
Pull your shirt up.

1459
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,125
You don't have them

1460
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,416
anywhere else, right?

1461
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,500
All gone.

1462
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,083
So, you are cured.

1463
01:36:28,666 --> 01:36:30,250
Yes, I am.

1464
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,458
Why do you sound like you already knew?

1465
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,250
Oh. That’s why

1466
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:39,750
you didn’t wear a jacket.

1467
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,583
You know, if you’re all better,
you don’t have to come anymore.

1468
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:58,833
All done.

1469
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:03,041
Congratulations.

1470
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:07,458
I guess

1471
01:37:08,416 --> 01:37:10,083
we won't see each other next month.

1472
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:09,083
It's all good, Doctor.

1473
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:11,333
Thank you very much.

1474
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,250
Come on.

1475
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:36,833
It's okay.

1476
01:38:38,083 --> 01:38:39,041
You are fine.

1477
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:49,416
I understand. It's okay.

1478
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,666
You knew that was going to happen,
didn't you?

1479
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,333
So, why are you acting like this?

1480
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,208
You won't

1481
01:38:59,583 --> 01:39:00,833
see her anymore.

1482
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:09,333
Why does it feel like when you were
heartbroken in second year?

1483
01:39:15,666 --> 01:39:17,375
But are you heartbroken this time?

1484
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:21,041
You're not, right?

1485
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,416
Your relationship with her was

1486
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:26,416
a few minutes together each month.

1487
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:28,583
She was just doing her job.

1488
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:31,500
There was nothing more.

1489
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:35,750
How can you say you are heartbroken?

1490
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:39,916
But you said the word heartbroken
three times already.

1491
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:42,041
Shit.

1492
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,416
You are not heartbroken.

1493
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,458
You are heartbroken.
It isn't rocket science.

1494
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:47,375
I’ve given you my diagnosis.

1495
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:50,083
I can't be.

1496
01:39:51,208 --> 01:39:52,583
Why not? I'm sure.

1497
01:39:53,375 --> 01:39:55,791
You have all the symptoms.
You can’t eat or sleep.

1498
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:57,041
I was like this too.

1499
01:39:57,416 --> 01:39:58,541
When I was a teenager.

1500
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,541
But we are not even in a relationship.

1501
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:03,416
From what you told me,

1502
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:05,125
you have fallen for her quite hard.

1503
01:40:06,416 --> 01:40:07,291
Right?

1504
01:40:07,833 --> 01:40:10,208
You put your work aside to see her.

1505
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:13,833
You invited me to play badminton
and work out with you.

1506
01:40:14,291 --> 01:40:16,041
-Right?
-I was sick, so I went to the doctor.

1507
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,041
Sure.

1508
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,791
Exercise made me better.

1509
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,666
You did it because you wanted her

1510
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,958
to praise you, right? You did it for her.

1511
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,916
You wanted her to see

1512
01:40:25,041 --> 01:40:26,083
that you did well

1513
01:40:26,458 --> 01:40:28,916
and that you were
good enough for her, right?

1514
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,916
This shouldn't be hard to understand.

1515
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,958
Love is like a disease.

1516
01:40:41,791 --> 01:40:42,791
You can cure it.

1517
01:40:43,875 --> 01:40:45,083
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

1518
01:40:45,458 --> 01:40:46,833
Here. Shrimp dumplings.

1519
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,333
Eat your favorite food.

1520
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:51,750
It can help you.

1521
01:40:53,541 --> 01:40:55,875
Another thing is,
you must find something to do

1522
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,083
so you don't think of her.

1523
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,291
You should work.

1524
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,791
When I was heartbroken

1525
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:04,416
and almost flunked out of college,

1526
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,416
all I did was work.

1527
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,291
I forgot all about my broken heart.

1528
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:09,541
I stopped being sad.
I had no time to be sad.

1529
01:41:09,625 --> 01:41:10,916
Don't stop working.

1530
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:12,041
It works.

1531
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:44,458
Yes. I'm free during Songkran.

1532
01:42:45,083 --> 01:42:47,333
Yes. I can finish it in two days.

1533
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,041
Yes.

1534
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:50,791
For sure.

1535
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:21,333
Everyone.

1536
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,625
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 0

1537
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:24,916
I am back.

1538
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,375
NUMBER OF RED SPOTS: 1

1539
01:43:26,458 --> 01:43:28,083
I came back to life.

1540
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,208
SHRIMP WONTONS

1541
01:43:45,916 --> 01:43:46,791
Hello.

1542
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:49,041
Hello, Yoon.

1543
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:50,541
It's Peng.

1544
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:53,208
Are you free? I have a job for you.

1545
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:54,666
-It's a--
-I'll take it.

1546
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:57,875
This is why I like you.

1547
01:43:58,083 --> 01:43:59,208
You are hardcore.

1548
01:43:59,958 --> 01:44:02,666
Let's meet tonight at 9 p.m.

1549
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:05,333
-Okay.
-It's very urgent, I have to tell you.

1550
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:06,958
-See you later.
-See you.

1551
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:13,041
This job is for my friend, Lisa.

1552
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:15,833
She’s having a gallery exhibition
in New York.

1553
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:17,083
It's extremely urgent.

1554
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:20,500
And this is a part of her exhibition.

1555
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:22,166
It’s an installation piece.

1556
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:25,083
It needs some retouching.

1557
01:44:25,166 --> 01:44:26,458
Everything needs to be done quickly.

1558
01:44:27,625 --> 01:44:29,333
It’s so urgent
that I thought of you first.

1559
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:32,416
You are the only person in the world
who could get this done in time.

1560
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:33,500
DAY ONE

1561
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:34,958
You have two weeks,

1562
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:37,041
but you must update us every day.

1563
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:39,250
-Lisa will give you feedback right away.
-Okay.

1564
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:40,625
Kai.

1565
01:44:41,166 --> 01:44:42,458
But you must work alone

1566
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:44,041
on this project

1567
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:47,250
because Lisa is paranoid
about her work getting out.

1568
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:49,166
But if you nail this project,

1569
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,750
Jerd's Shibuya work

1570
01:44:50,833 --> 01:44:52,458
will be like a speck of dust
in comparison.

1571
01:44:53,791 --> 01:44:55,583
We will fly to New York together after.

1572
01:45:16,583 --> 01:45:19,750
DAY TWO

1573
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:33,541
Yes, Peng.

1574
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:35,791
I sent you the feedback
for the previous lot.

1575
01:45:35,875 --> 01:45:37,291
Are you done with the current lot?

1576
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:39,500
Not yet.

1577
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:43,166
What's taking you so long?
You must speed things up.

1578
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:44,416
Understood.

1579
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:47,416
DAY THREE

1580
01:45:57,708 --> 01:45:59,208
Do you have to work this hard?

1581
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:02,166
Won't your body fall apart?

1582
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:04,500
I'll be fine. My record is five days.

1583
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,416
Kai.

1584
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:12,416
I’m really thankful

1585
01:46:13,083 --> 01:46:14,541
that you told me to work.

1586
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:17,291
It really works.

1587
01:46:25,666 --> 01:46:26,541
Shit.

1588
01:46:27,041 --> 01:46:27,958
My head feels so heavy.

1589
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:31,583
DAY FOUR

1590
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:53,000
Yoon. Did you take the job from Peng?

1591
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:56,041
Yes.

1592
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:59,750
That job is two months of work.

1593
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:01,833
He gave you two weeks
yet you still took it?

1594
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:03,166
Yes.

1595
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:06,083
Yoon.

1596
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:08,291
If the job didn't have my approval,

1597
01:47:08,375 --> 01:47:09,666
you should have known.

1598
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:10,791
Why did you take it?

1599
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:14,375
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You are the only one who looks up to him.

1600
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:21,208
Do you know that he lied

1601
01:47:21,291 --> 01:47:23,541
when he said
you were the first one he thought of?

1602
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:24,916
Do you know that?

1603
01:47:26,208 --> 01:47:28,041
At least somebody thought of me, Jae.

1604
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:30,916
He doesn't care about you.

1605
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,333
He just wants your work.

1606
01:47:32,416 --> 01:47:35,000
He flattered you
so you would accept his offer.

1607
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:36,458
-Jae, I'm happy.
-The budget is small

1608
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:37,666
-so he hired you alone.
-Jae.

1609
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,208
-I'm fine. Okay?
-Others rejected it.

1610
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:42,583
What the fuck--

1611
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,333
Shit. This is day six.

1612
01:47:52,791 --> 01:47:54,750
I broke my record.

1613
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:55,875
DAY SIX

1614
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:18,625
DAY EIGHT

1615
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:38,166
DAY NINE

1616
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:01,958
Yes.

1617
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,666
Why didn't you pick up?

1618
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:05,291
Are you done? We are running out of time.

1619
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:08,583
-Yes.
-Yes, my butt.

1620
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:09,666
You must hurry.

1621
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:11,416
Do you know how long you are taking?

1622
01:49:13,458 --> 01:49:14,458
Yes.

1623
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:18,875
DAY 12

1624
01:49:45,208 --> 01:49:48,333
I've heard that the longest
someone stayed awake for was 11 days.

1625
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:53,666
This is day 12 for me.

1626
01:49:57,666 --> 01:49:59,458
I broke the world record.

1627
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,958
I'm at the next level.

1628
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:11,416
This means more than a Cannes Lions award.

1629
01:50:16,583 --> 01:50:18,291
We only live once,

1630
01:50:18,666 --> 01:50:20,666
so we have to give it all we have.

1631
01:50:25,291 --> 01:50:26,250
I think...

1632
01:50:27,416 --> 01:50:29,916
I have reached the pinnacle of my career.

1633
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:45,833
If Peng could see me now,

1634
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,916
he would know I gave it my all.

1635
01:50:56,041 --> 01:50:56,958
My chest hurts.

1636
01:50:58,583 --> 01:50:59,541
It hurts a lot.

1637
01:51:02,625 --> 01:51:03,541
Body.

1638
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:07,166
You are so unreasonable.

1639
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:11,458
Can you let me do my work?

1640
01:51:14,416 --> 01:51:15,958
I only have two photos left.

1641
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,083
Shit.

1642
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,750
I can't breathe.

1643
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:46,041
Hey, body.

1644
01:51:48,666 --> 01:51:50,541
You are getting back
at me now, aren't you?

1645
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:55,291
Bring it on.

1646
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:58,166
I’m not afraid.

1647
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:04,250
Death is a natural thing for me.

1648
01:52:19,041 --> 01:52:22,125
I used to think that we should be able
to plan our own funeral.

1649
01:52:23,666 --> 01:52:25,416
I want my funeral

1650
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:26,958
to not be at a temple.

1651
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,291
It can be in this room.

1652
01:52:30,791 --> 01:52:32,666
Just a nice coffin and flowers.

1653
01:52:44,208 --> 01:52:45,541
I like the band TK a lot.

1654
01:52:46,125 --> 01:52:47,458
I have never seen them live.

1655
01:52:48,333 --> 01:52:50,041
I would want them to sing at my funeral.

1656
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,625
I want them to sing
the song "Handkerchief".

1657
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:56,750
It’s a hit song.

1658
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,916
Everyone should be able to sing along.

1659
01:52:59,916 --> 01:53:02,666
The feelings

1660
01:53:04,375 --> 01:53:07,125
that I

1661
01:53:07,791 --> 01:53:09,041
Guest list.

1662
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:13,333
Am overwhelmed with

1663
01:53:16,208 --> 01:53:20,500
-But don't understand
-Jae.

1664
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:25,291
Where are we

1665
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,458
Right now?

1666
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:29,416
Kai.

1667
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:35,666
Can somebody

1668
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:39,791
Pongsathorn.

1669
01:53:39,875 --> 01:53:43,166
Tell me please?

1670
01:53:44,916 --> 01:53:47,625
-When everything
-Mom.

1671
01:53:49,416 --> 01:53:52,666
Passes

1672
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,666
-Will there be
-Four people. That's it.

1673
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:00,458
So few people.

1674
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:04,416
Anyone here?

1675
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:21,916
I'm not sure
if I would want the doctor to be here.

1676
01:54:30,583 --> 01:54:33,916
When the day comes

1677
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,458
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1678
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,791
I died.

1679
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:41,041
I broke my promise.

1680
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,500
But don't be sad.

1681
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:48,166
It wasn't your fault.

1682
01:54:52,416 --> 01:54:53,458
Hey, everyone.

1683
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:56,166
Don't be sad at my funeral.

1684
01:54:57,583 --> 01:54:59,083
Death is a natural process.

1685
01:55:02,625 --> 01:55:03,500
I just

1686
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:05,333
regret the fact

1687
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,125
that I won't get to see Jae's child.

1688
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:12,333
Kai.

1689
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:14,833
I won't get to play badminton
with you again.

1690
01:55:15,916 --> 01:55:17,125
That day was fun.

1691
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:21,125
Shit.

1692
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:24,625
I forgot to retouch that photo for my mom.

1693
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:32,083
Doctor.

1694
01:55:32,916 --> 01:55:35,125
I haven't told you
about my trip to the beach.

1695
01:55:38,041 --> 01:55:40,958
To be honest, I want to go back in time
and apologize to you.

1696
01:55:43,333 --> 01:55:44,708
And...

1697
01:55:46,041 --> 01:55:47,666
I want to talk to you again,

1698
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:50,791
as a friend.

1699
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:55,125
Shit.

1700
01:55:56,416 --> 01:55:58,166
I'm actually missing out on many things.

1701
01:56:17,958 --> 01:56:19,833
That's why the doctor told me not to die.

1702
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:27,666
Body.

1703
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm sorry.

1704
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:32,416
I give up.

1705
01:56:35,333 --> 01:56:37,083
But you won't forgive me now, will you?

1706
01:56:41,416 --> 01:56:42,750
Bye, everyone.

1707
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,791
Will this really be the last thing
I see before I die?

1708
01:56:51,583 --> 01:56:52,958
It's not a good view.

1709
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:27,416
Hello, Peng.

1710
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:31,041
Yoon.

1711
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:33,291
Don't call me cruel or anything

1712
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,708
but the work isn't done yet.
You have a bit more to do.

1713
01:57:37,333 --> 01:57:39,083
I asked Lisa to extend
the deadline for a day.

1714
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:41,208
If you get up and do it right now,

1715
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:42,583
I think you can do it in time.

1716
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:56,166
You can work here.

1717
01:57:56,541 --> 01:57:57,833
I brought your computer.

1718
01:57:58,208 --> 01:57:59,375
There is Wi-Fi here, too.

1719
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,375
That's why I said
don't call me cruel or anything.

1720
01:58:07,083 --> 01:58:08,583
But this is about finishing your work

1721
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:10,000
and being responsible.

1722
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:12,458
It's just a bit more. Two more photos.

1723
01:58:13,041 --> 01:58:14,833
Once you finish this job,

1724
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:16,416
you can go home and rest.

1725
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,208
You can sleep for as long as you like.

1726
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,750
Then, we'll go to New York together, okay?

1727
01:58:29,458 --> 01:58:30,500
What did you tell him?

1728
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:34,416
-I said I wanted to sleep.
-Damn.

1729
01:58:36,208 --> 01:58:37,791
Was Peng mad?

1730
01:58:43,333 --> 01:58:44,541
No.

1731
01:58:45,583 --> 01:58:48,875
He just told me to fuck myself
and find a new career.

1732
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:53,291
Don't worry. I'll find you some work.

1733
01:59:03,666 --> 01:59:05,000
Can I ask you to do one thing?

1734
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:08,625
Don't pull this shit again.

1735
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,666
I'm begging you.

1736
01:59:15,833 --> 01:59:16,833
All right.

1737
01:59:21,375 --> 01:59:22,208
Jae.

1738
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:27,875
You must have a baby, okay?

1739
01:59:28,708 --> 01:59:30,291
What?

1740
01:59:30,958 --> 01:59:34,291
I came back to life
just to see your child's face.

1741
01:59:40,250 --> 01:59:41,416
Are you free today?

1742
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:42,666
Yes.

1743
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:44,666
I came to see you.

1744
02:00:26,708 --> 02:00:28,333
I've got many things to do.

1745
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,583
Number 116.

1746
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:48,291
Mr. Assanai.

1747
02:00:48,375 --> 02:00:50,458
Why did you come back?
I thought you got better.

1748
02:00:51,208 --> 02:00:54,083
I missed you, so I came back to visit.

1749
02:00:54,541 --> 02:00:56,916
Really? Room number five, please.

1750
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:00,791
Number 117.

1751
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:43,958
If I only thought of you
as a patient that day,

1752
02:01:44,041 --> 02:01:45,875
I wouldn't have felt anything.

1753
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:49,666
But since we became friends,

1754
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:52,541
I was sad.

1755
02:01:54,833 --> 02:01:56,291
I hoped

1756
02:01:56,666 --> 02:01:58,375
for you to be healthy

1757
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:01,416
so I wouldn't have to see you again.

1758
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:06,291
I'm healthy and well, Doctor.

1759
02:02:10,916 --> 02:02:12,916
I just wanted to see you again.

1760
02:02:13,833 --> 02:02:15,166
I wanted to tell you a story,

1761
02:02:15,375 --> 02:02:17,916
but I never got the chance.

1762
02:02:24,083 --> 02:02:26,041
When you told me to go to the beach,

1763
02:02:26,916 --> 02:02:28,541
I actually went.

1764
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:34,500
I never thought about

1765
02:02:34,875 --> 02:02:37,500
watching the sunset before,

1766
02:02:37,666 --> 02:02:40,958
but since you told me to,
I thought of giving it a go.

1767
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:45,791
To be honest,

1768
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:49,416
I felt that it was a waste of time
to watch the sunset.

1769
02:02:49,875 --> 02:02:51,833
But I don't know
what got into me that day.

1770
02:02:52,208 --> 02:02:54,125
I sat there for hours watching the sunset.

1771
02:02:59,666 --> 02:03:01,333
That day, I felt that

1772
02:03:01,958 --> 02:03:03,916
I could breathe so easily.

1773
02:03:05,708 --> 02:03:07,166
And I was happy.

1774
02:03:13,708 --> 02:03:16,041
Just like when I see you.

1775
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:20,625
OUTPATIENT MEDICAL RECORD
DERMATOLOGY INSTITUTE

1776
02:03:21,125 --> 02:03:22,416
Thank you so much, Doctor.

1777
02:04:04,541 --> 02:04:06,125
I thought you said
you're healthy and well.

1778
02:04:48,416 --> 02:04:50,416
I hope I don't see you again next month.

1779
02:11:26,125 --> 02:11:28,125
