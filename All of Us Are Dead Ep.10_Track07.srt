And where is the proof for that?

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,379
Well, KDCA is creating a virus
using the exact method he described.

175
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,508
If they create the same virus,

176
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,344
then the KDCA will conclude it's credible.

[scoffs]
Well…

Many soldiers are going insane
from this thing, but…

179
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,770
It's scarier when a scientist goes crazy.

180
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,772
Did you hear
they're expanding martial law?

181
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,982
Martial law?

182
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,944
Why would they do that
if we're handling it well?

My friend in the NIS analysis team

184

said they're discussing pulling back
the blockade to Yangdong

185
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,201
and expanding martial law.

186
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,706
What about Hyosan?

187
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,586

to make sacrifices.

there might not be another time
to rescue survivors.

191

Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

192
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,236
The moment the blockade
is penetrated by the infected,

193
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
we'll have to step up and…

194
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492

something is going to happen very soon
in Hyosan.

202
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,774
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

203
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,695
I'll say you even resigned from your post
thinking it would help prevent it.

204

No one would even think of blaming you.

I'll protect your political career
until the end.

Do you need time to think it over?

You failed Hyosan.

They'll just abandon it?

337
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,346
What's that?

338
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,057
-[grunts]
-That's not it!

339
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,727
[Dae-su] Guys.

340
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,063
[Ha-ri] Come here. Gonna get you, asshole!

341
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,817
-Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it. Stop her.
-I don't want to come between you two.

342
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,320
-Right now.
-Okay. Only if you promise not to hit me.

343
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,283
[ominous music]

344
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,702
[grunts]

345
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,133
Where did those shitheads run off to now?

346
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,393
[clanking]

347
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,940
[clangs]

348
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
What are you doing?

349
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,445
Can we move this?
Do you think it's possible?

350
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,793
We can tie all the carts in a circle,
then we can just use them as a shield.

351
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,551
[Wu-jin] This way.

352
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,346
We need strings or something
to tie them together.

353
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,015
[Mi-jin] Is this it?

354
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,684
[Joon-yeong] This?

355
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,234
Cut as many as possible.

356
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,155
Hey. There's no way this is going to work.

357
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,450
We should flip it over completely,
so that we can hide underneath.

358
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536
Uh… We should stand it up.

359
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,830
Yeah, zombies sure can't climb that?

360
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,331
[sighs]
That's enough.

361
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,917
Don't be stupid. Okay? Let's redo them.

362
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,753
It's too short if we close the lids.

363
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,130
Unless you want us crawling?

364
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,007
Pulling rank right now?

365
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,133
-[slams]
-Hey.

366
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,385
Say it to my face!

367
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,012
If you don't like it, make your own.

368
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,930
[scoffs]

369
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,059
There.

370
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, shit. Are you crazy?

371
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,604
What's wrong with you?

372
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,150
-Sis, stop her.
-Come on. Say that again.

373
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,277
Do everyone a favor
and stay out of our way.

374
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,487
Hey, you.
[grunts]

375
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,990
[groans]
Shithead!

376
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,242
"Shithead"? Shithead. What the fuck?

377
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,201
Stop it.

378
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,662
Joon-yeong, you too.

379
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,748
Who the hell is she to tell us
we have to redo it?

380
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,500
"Who the hell is she?"
Your fucking nightmare.

381
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
-You're coming with us, right?
-You're the ones coming with me.

382
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,838
[sighs]

383
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,673
You won't just leave them here, right?

384
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,883
I wish, but no.

385
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,136
We're going together, anyway.
Why fight now, huh?

386
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,513
Just do as I say
unless you wanna die out there.

387
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,598
Which you might.

388
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,892
We're tryna make it that high,
so we don't die out there.

389
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
Enough already.

390
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,397
How many people have died on our way here?

391
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,441
[Su-hyeok] We can't lose anyone else.

392
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,319
We shouldn't waste energy
fighting among ourselves.

393
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
I'm not fighting to die.

394
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm fighting because I wanna live.

395
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,992
Then do as I fucking say, asshead.

396
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,912
Unless we split up.

397
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
-Problem solved.
-[clangs]

398
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,041
-Get back here. You hear me?
-Joon-yeong.

399
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,250
[Mi-jin] Get back here!

400
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,752
Let go of me, asshole!

401
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,670
You think I'm doing this,
because I wanna die?

402
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,465
[clanging]

403
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,010
We'll vote on it.

404
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
[sighs]
You are?

405
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,890
Class prez.

406
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,769
One. Split up.

407
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,691
Two. Stay together.

408
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,157
-Okay, we voted to stay together, then.
-Is it smart to vote

409
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,701
on life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

410
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,996
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

411
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,457
You know, there's such a thing
as collective intelligence.

412
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,292
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

413
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,837
You can't make intelligence
with a bunch of idiots.

414
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,422
So then what do you suggest?

415
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,133
Do we vote about voting, huh?

416
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,261
Fuck! How the hell did
your kids survive up to now?

417
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,430
Sorry, but can you mind your own business?

418
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,765
You started the fight, now we're voting.

419
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,475
Give me an arrow, so I can stab him.

420
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,060
Anyway, let's move on now.

421
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,397
One. We make the outside higher.

422
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,491
Five votes.

423
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,951
Two.

424
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,455
We fold the lids, make a box.

425
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,128
So that's four.

426
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,630
What the hell? I thought you were with us?

427
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,841
I changed my mind.

428
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,304
Option one received the majority vote,
so make the walls high.

429
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,723
Wait. Your vote.

430
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,477
If you're for option two, it's a tie.

431
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,812
Option one.

432
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,272
Oh, shit.

433
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,567
Okay. Let's do it.

434
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,820
Okay, but don't resent me
when the zombies climb over

435
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,113
and kill us all.

436
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,908
Don't worry, I'll take the front
and any blame.

437
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,075
You hold back.

438
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,328
Oh, what an asshole. Fuck.

439
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,705
Why are kids so damn rude these days?

440
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,040
And you're not?

441
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,585
Don't say that in front
of the underclassmen.

442
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,673
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method precisely.

443
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,760
This is a sample from an infected.

444
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,222
[doctor] The two viruses
are 98 percent match.

445
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,601
Are you saying everything he says
in the videos is true?

446
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,938
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

447
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,439
Only the virus survives.

448
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,942
It stimulates the brainstem
and moves the body.

449
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,777
They're like moving corpses.

450
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,614
We haven't found any way to save the dead.

451
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,494
You're telling me that he's dead?

452
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,290
Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

453
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960
[doctor] But she's, ugh…

454
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,878
Difficult to explain.

455
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,674
She was found alive.

456
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,971
There has never been a virus with such
a fast rate of infection in history.

457
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,807
Our only solution
is getting rid of the host.

458
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,060
I'm not going to tolerate
the sign of indifference!

459
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,271
Your only job is to find me a cure.

460
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,651
Commander, sir.

461
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,319
They broke through the barricade.

462
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,405
[soldier] It's spreading into Yangdong.

463
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,908
[Seon-moo] How bad is the spread?

464
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,870
[soldier] They're taking route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

465
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,873
<i>We sent army reservists
in the area to the barricades.</i>

466
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,959
[growling]

467
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,921
Send all the reservists to create
a lockdown zone in Yangdong

468
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,339
and evacuate the city.

469
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,133
-Call in all the advisers.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,803
You said you had a friend in the NIS?

471
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,096
Yes.

472
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,890
Ask him to meet officially.

473
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,891
Yes, sir.

474
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,732
[Joon-yeong] You have to tie
the knots harder.

475
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
[Hyo-ryeong] Here too?

476
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,071
-[Dae-su] I hope we're not doing…
-[Hyo-ryeong] Can you do it?

477
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
-…anything stupid.
-My hands hurt.

478
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,992
-[Wu-jin] Just do it.
-[Dae-su] Hey, that looks good.

479
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,619
Hand it to me. We're gonna die, anyway.

480
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,329
-[Mi-jin] Hey, come here.
-[Hyo-ryeong] Me?

481
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,999
-[Dae-su] I almost got killed confessing…
-Hey. Chocolate bar.

482
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,795
Let me see.

483
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,465
You think we can eat it, huh?

484
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, no, expired.

485
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,928
Okay, so what?

486
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
Okay, yeah, you're right.

487
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,729
[wrapping rustling]

488
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,691
Only take a tiny bite.

489
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,236
[Dae-su] It needs to feed all of us. Okay?

490
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,410
Oh, shit. I said a tiny bite.

491
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,829
I only ate freaking this much.

492
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,207
Selfish bastard.

493
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,045
[gulps]

494
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,679
I'm full, so…

495
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,071
