1
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,160
What happened in town
a few days before Marina's death?

2
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,960
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the news?

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
-Is there no police report?
-I want you to tell me.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,359
Everything happened.

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,320
-Things were really tense.
-Too much.

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,039
When gunpowder meets fire...

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,240
-...only one thing can happen.
-An explosion.

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,359
Everything went to shit.

9
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,119
Everything.

10
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,759
The burner phone,
so they can't trace the call.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,679
OK.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,039
-Got the marchioness' husband's number?
-Yes.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,119
Here it is.

14
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,920
His name is Teodoro Rosol.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,560
We need to decide how much to ask for
for the watch.

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,719
A whole lot, the more the better.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,480
That one will pay whatever we ask
to get this back.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,640
No, we need to be smart about this.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,519
It has to be an amount he can get
without attracting attention.

20
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,280
How much is that for a rich person?
Two hundred thousand?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,879
-Five hundred thousand?
-He won't have that at home.

22
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,079
Much less. Besides, if he withdraws
from a bank, they'll trace it.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
I'd ask for 90,000.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,239
Yes, 90,000 is good.
With that, we can do a lot.

25
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,359
I could start over somewhere else
with half that money.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,000
Are you sure you want to leave?
We are OK, aren't we?

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't want to miss you again.

28
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm not needed here, Samu.
You'll be better off without me.

29
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,359
Believe me.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,519
It will be good for everybody.

31
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,680
No, they've frozen our accounts,
and we can't make bail.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,759
Three hundred thousand.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,639
No.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,039
No, you wouldn't have to cover it all.

35
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,759
I see.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,240
Fine. Thank you, Federico.
Have a good day.

37
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,840
Asshole.

38
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,080
My mothers can cover part of it.

39
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,280
For more, they'd have to withdraw
from investment funds, which takes time.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Thank you. Tell them I'll call them later.

41
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,560
What about Lu's parents?

42
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,120
They're diplomats,
they can't get involved.

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Besides,
I don't want anything to do with her.

44
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,319
I get it.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,639
Testing. One, two, one, two. Testing.

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,879
Let's hear it.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Testing. One, two, one, two. Testing.

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,919
-Good, right? Sure?
-Yes.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
OK.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,919
Hello?

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes, speaking.

52
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,080
We have something you want.

53
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,400
You don't want it to end up in the papers,
or with a judge.

54
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,360
Who are you?

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,280
-Do you have my watch?
-We want 90,000 euros. Tomorrow.

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Ninety thousand euros?

57
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,759
You better hand it to me tomorrow,
and expect nothing in return.

58
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,639
You don't know who you're messing with,
idiots.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,759
Have the money tomorrow.
We'll contact you for the exchange.

60
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,439
How was it?

61
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,719
Fine, I think.

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
-He was scared.
-Good.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,599
-He'll pay for sure.
-Good.

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,479
Who do they think they are?

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
They want to blackmail me? Me?

66
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
-They want a measly 90,000 euros!
-You're not paying?

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,000
-How could I give in to amateurs?
-Wouldn't it be better to pay?

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
It's not that much money.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
-Do you know them, or what?
-That's ridiculous, Dad!

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
I'm only saying the person who called
is a clueless nobody.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,040
When they got in here to steal,
they even knew the alarm codes.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,160
And since you associate
with just anybody lately...

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,759
-Good morning, Carla.
-Hi.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,279
-Teodoro.
-Good morning, darling.

75
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,680
-I can't believe you'd say this to me--
-Everything all right?

76
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah.

77
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't worry. If someone's tried
to pull one over on me, I know what to do.

78
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,279
So do I.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
To begin with,
they won't get a single cent. Not one.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
They should know that.

81
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,720
Were you waiting for me?

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,959
I've been up since seven,
making calls to get the money.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
It's horrible.

84
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,120
I see.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm sure someone will lend it to you.

86
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,839
Doesn't seem like it.

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Rats are the first to abandon ship,
and my father's world was full of rats.

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It's good to see you.

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,839
Are you going to stick to me like glue
all day?

90
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,199
What will your friends think
when they see you this clingy?

91
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,959
I want to make the most of these days
with you, in case they're the last.

92
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,279
We have to keep you here
for the next school year.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
It's hopeless, Guzmán.

94
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,120
Once my father makes up his mind,
he's inflexible.

95
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
You should go to class.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,839
-Go on.
-Fine, I'm going. Bye.

97
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,519
Nadia.

98
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,759
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yes.

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,160
Give this to your brother?

100
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,920
My brother?

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,240
Yes. Your father took his phone away.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,399
I don't want to go near the store,
or they could see me talking to him.

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,759
Nadia.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,079
-Can we talk after class?
-We have nothing to talk about.

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,360
Do you realize
you've ruined my brother's life?

106
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,680
That's why I want to talk, to explain.
I didn't have a choice, Nadia.

107
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,120
There's always a choice, Marina. Always.

108
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,680
But people from your class never consider
anything but saving their own ass.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
-If you'll excuse me...
-So my betraying your brother is wrong,

110
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,720
but your betraying Martín is awesome,
right?

111
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Are you really making that comparison?

112
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,439
We need to talk.
Come to the bathroom with me?

113
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,079
I'm all ears.

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,160
Why did you get close to me
after ignoring me for years?

115
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,199
What?

116
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,279
Who stole the watches?

117
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
I know you are involved.

118
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,160
You were in my house,
you saw me enter the code.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
As girls,
we played with my father's watches.

120
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
You knew where they were.

121
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,720
Me?

122
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,199
Come on, do you think I remember that?
How can you think that?

123
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,720
Well, you have a history
of making crappy friends

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
and falling under their influence.

125
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,279
You seem stupid.

126
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,920
Marina, they are blackmailing us.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,360
And your family stands to lose
more than mine.

128
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,560
Your father is in pre-trial detention,
and if these papers surface...

129
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
not even the best lawyer will get him out.

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,920
-Carla, I know nothing about it, really.
-My father will not pay.

131
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,240
You think he's going to let some idiots
take his money and get away with it?

132
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
No.

133
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,480
He's going to find them,
and it'll be bad for everybody.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Mostly for you.

135
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,279
So tell them to keep the watches,
but to return the red one.

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
And to do it now.

137
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,559
Fucking Nano!

138
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
We agreed you'd forget the blackmail.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
-You've put me in a difficult situation!
-Don't worry about a thing.

140
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,840
How can I not worry?
That watch contains sensitive information.

141
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,000
If it reaches the press,
it'll ruin my family.

142
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,399
I won't let you do it.

143
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,240
That information won't reach anybody,
trust me.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,879
That guy will pay.
We need that money to go away together.

145
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,559
I haven't said I'm leaving with you.

146
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,399
Carla.

147
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,879
Here.

148
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
-What's this?
-Do you like it?

149
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,559
A bit obvious, don't you think?

150
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Your way of telling me
you can buy me these things,

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
and Christian can't.

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
It's a present. I'm not trying to buy you.

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
You can't buy me. I don't have a price.
If I did, you couldn't afford it.

154
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,960
Are you going to let that loser
ruin everything?

155
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,240
You ruined it. Not him.

156
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,519
And I'm the one in front of you,
asking you to forgive me.

157
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,279
I don't...

158
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,759
I can't live without you.

159
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,240
-Don't you see I can't?
-Yes, you can.

160
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,519
You know why?

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,039
Because, I think you like boys
more than girls.

162
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,159
And it's no big deal. That's fine.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,159
You just need to accept it yourself.
I'm working on it.

164
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,600
So what if I also like guys?

165
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,039
What we have is stronger than all that.
We're Carla and Polo.

166
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,799
We go together.

167
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,399
That can't be broken.

168
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,200
It's already broken.

169
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,480
Would you like a photo?

170
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,720
It's your moment of triumph.
I'd like to give you my best angle.

171
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,480
You are top of the class,
the prize is for you. As if I cared.

172
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,879
Lu, I'm also leaving the school.

173
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,600
My father doesn't want me
to do my next year here.

174
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,759
So we won the top idiot prize
by competing, right?

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,639
-I never wanted to compete.
-Nadia, please!

176
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,080
From day one I, recognized you
as my equal. Even if you won't admit it.

177
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,320
For you and me, nothing is ever enough.
We always want more.

178
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,960
Did you really think that prize
would change anything in my life?

179
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,360
No.

180
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
And still... I needed it.

181
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,720
Too bad another hypocrite will get it.

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
Marina?

183
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,480
She's the best after the two of us.

184
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,279
She really screwed us over.
She turned out to be the smartest of all.

185
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,720
But I'll tell you one thing.

186
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,600
I won't leave without a fight.

187
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,039
Or without winning.

188
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,080
-So what happened between you and Polo?
-I left him.

189
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,080
We wanted to keep our relationship alive,
but dead things don't come back to life.

190
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,960
Damn, I'm sorry.

191
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,720
So you have no boyfriend?
You're on your own, free.

192
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,240
Yes, on my own, free,

193
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,600
with no close friends,
and a thousand problems.

194
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,879
I did not expect this
going into the summer.

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,600
-But then you and I could...
-We could what, Christian?

196
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,159
We could date!

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,519
-We have great sex, right?
-Yes.

198
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,919
But I don't know if I'd date someone
who sells himself for a cover.

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,399
I don't sell myself, OK?

200
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,559
I make a living, which is what those of us
who weren't born rich do!

201
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,799
-It's very easy to judge us from up there.
-All right!

202
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Christian, wait!

203
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,279
Fine, you're right.
I'm not in your situation.

204
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Don't you think that's why
we can't be together?

205
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,320
Honestly, no.
Stranger things have happened.

206
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,759
-You could give me a chance.
-The only thing I need now is a friend.

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,080
Think you can be that?

208
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,679
Yes.

209
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:13,000
Omar! Remember Fatima and Nasser?

210
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,559
-Of course.
-She used to look after you.

211
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
-How are you? You're all grown up.
-How are you?

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,960
A very good son. Very responsible.

213
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,799
Follows the Koran. And very hardworking.

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,159
He has a daughter, about your age.

215
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,240
-You know her, right?
-Yes.

216
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,000
Why don't you come for tea
on Wednesday and bring her along?

217
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,559
I don't know if I can on Wednesday.

218
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,159
You have something better to do
than meet your future wife?

219
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,720
Bye, then.

220
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,159
And don't rush him.

221
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,679
We don't want him looking that scared
when we introduce them.

222
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,519
-See you soon.
-Bye, my friend.

223
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,360
I get it, my father is a leper,
and you won't help him. Fine.

224
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
When he returns to work, I'll remind him
who was there for him, asshole!

225
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,240
-Everything all right?
-What are you doing here, Lu?

226
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,919
I go to school for my things,
and don't see you.

227
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,480
I call and text you, and you don't answer.

228
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm beginning to feel a bit ignored,
actually.

229
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,559
You don't see me for three days,
and I'm already forgotten?

230
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,000
Sorry, I don't know why,
but all I can think about

231
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,639
is getting money to bail my father out.

232
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,639
I see.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,919
And you can't answer one of my messages
while you're holding your phone?

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,879
Lu, right now, the last thing I need
is your passive-aggressive drama.

235
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,679
And what do you need? Money.

236
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,679
-How much?
-300,000. Got that in your bag?

237
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,480
Why are you being such a jerk?

238
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,720
-I only wanted to help.
-Oh, you came to help me. Sorry!

239
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,279
I thought it was
because I didn't answer your calls.

240
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,639
If you're having a hard time,
you can lean on me.

241
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,759
But don't insult me.

242
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,120
And don't push me aside.

243
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,080
We've always supported each other
through the good and the bad.

244
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,799
"We," Lu?

245
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,440
How do I put this
so that you finally get it?

246
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,720
There is no "we" anymore.

247
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:15,759
That's nonsense.

248
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,279
I'm in love with Nadia.

249
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,159
You're not in your right mind
because of your father.

250
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,000
You don't know what you're saying.

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,480
Did you see what happened at the store?
Now they want to marry me off.

252
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,559
It's a nightmare.

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,639
Omar, she's a good girl.

254
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,360
Really, Nadia? You too?

255
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,759
Are you serious?

256
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,320
There are arranged marriages
that turn out fine.

257
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Before marrying her or any other,
I'd slit my wrists.

258
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,120
-No. Don't even joke about that.
-Get it?

259
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,519
Nadia, I don't want to be introduced
to that girl. Help me, please.

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,159
Dad is very upset.

261
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,440
But it will blow over.

262
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,240
All you have to do is go along with him
for a while.

263
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,279
For how long?

264
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,000
Until my wedding day?
Until my children get married?

265
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,919
No, I can't, Nadia.

266
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,200
Nadia, I can't breathe anymore.

267
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,840
Help me, please.

268
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
Ander gave me this, for you.

269
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,599
You really like him, huh?

270
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,720
But I'll never be able to be with him.

271
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,079
Go to him. I'll cover for you.

272
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,799
You mean it?

273
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,440
Thank you.

274
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
We can't accept this.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What we have to do
is ask for twice as much.

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,720
If they know Marina has something to do
with this, they'll get to us in no time.

277
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,839
And what are they going to do?
Call the police?

278
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,319
Hire thugs?

279
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
No, better yet,
they will come for us themselves.

280
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,279
They will give in.
They act tough, but they will give in.

281
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,160
We have to think our next move through.

282
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,680
Hey.

283
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,359
You came.

284
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,839
-Want to go inside?
-OK.

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sure your parents aren't here?

286
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,680
OK, I can see they are not.

287
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
So, shall we fuck?

288
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,640
Or we could talk.

289
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,400
While we fuck.

290
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,640
Are you going to let your father
arrange a wedding for you?

291
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,119
It's absurd.

292
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,200
That's what you want to talk about?
What a downer.

293
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
You won't let him do it, right?

294
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,039
When did you figure out you liked men?

295
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,319
You're changing the subject.

296
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,640
Do you know what two gay guys
ask each other when they meet?

297
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,960
That's the first one.
When you found out you liked guys.

298
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,640
The second one
is whether your parents know.

299
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,599
I want this moment to be ours.

300
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,880
And not to think that somebody out there
is arranging a wedding for me.

301
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,440
OK. But they are arranging it.

302
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,880
Do your parents know?

303
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:59,160
You know what?

304
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,039
I love you.

305
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,079
You are so lucky.

306
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,039
-I never have the house to myself.
-I have it to myself every day until ten.

307
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,960
-See you.
-Bye.

308
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,839
What's going on?

309
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Answer it.

310
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,759
-Wait, let me talk.
-No, I'll talk.

311
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,720
-Fine, put it on speakerphone.
-OK.

312
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,799
-Hello.
-How do we go about the handover?

313
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,680
When are you giving me the watch?

314
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,759
-We want double now.
-What?

315
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,319
One hundred and eighty thousand.

316
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,480
Who do you think you are?
Nobody will pay that much.

317
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:28,960
Nobody.

318
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,599
You've just dug your own grave.

319
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,079
-He hung up, but he'll pay for sure.
-Next time, let me do the talking.

320
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,079
If there is a next time, fuck!

321
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,200
We know you're... gay.

322
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,400
-Gay.
-Gay.

323
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
And it's not a problem.

324
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,359
-Did you look at my computer?
-There was no need.

325
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,000
Son, it's all right.

326
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,640
If, at his age, I'd told my father
I was a faggot...

327
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
-Antonio.
-...he would have hit me.

328
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,440
Fine. What I want to say is that you
shouldn't let that ruin your future.

329
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,960
Tennis is not like soccer.

330
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,599
It's not a paradise of tolerance,

331
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
but you could make history

332
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,319
as the first gay man
to win the French Open.

333
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,720
Think about it.

334
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm sure there's plenty of sponsors
who'd love to work with a boy...

335
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,599
like you.

336
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,559
OK.

337
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,960
So I can fuck guys
as long as I am a champion.

338
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,880
You can listen to music later.

339
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

340
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,799
What's his name?

341
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,880
His name's Omar. But we can't be together
because his father's from the Stone Age.

342
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,960
Omar, is that Arabic?

343
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,160
-You disapprove?
-Who, me?

344
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,319
What kind of person do you think I am?
What you think of us is alarming!

345
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,039
You could talk to his father.

346
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,279
Me? I don't know him.

347
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,240
He's Nadia's brother.

348
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,200
Omar?

349
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,640
That Omar?

350
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,680
The one who sells drugs?

351
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,480
-Are you in love with a dealer?
-He's not a dealer, Mom!

352
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,440
He used to deal because he needs money
to get out of that house.

353
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
Help us, please.

354
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,400
He's not lucky enough
to have parents like you.

355
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,240
Talk to his father.

356
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,240
And what would I tell him?

357
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,039
I can't, Ander.

358
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,640
Only you...

359
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,079
So many guys out there,
and you fall for a dealer.

360
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,079
A dealer who's Muslim and gay.

361
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,119
Mom.

362
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,359
I heard you want Omar
to meet Fatima's daughter.

363
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,920
Zahira.

364
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,880
Yes, a very good girl.

365
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,759
She is, right?

366
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,440
You know her, don't you?

367
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,200
Nadia,
do you have anything to say about her?

368
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,039
No. I won't speak ill of Zahira.

369
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,200
What about Fatima's daughter?

370
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,200
I think we all want Omar
to marry the right person.

371
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,720
If you have something to say, say it.

372
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,799
In this town, we all know each other.

373
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,599
Why don't you ask around?

374
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
There's no need.

375
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,680
I'll call them and cancel tea myself.

376
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,839
Our son cannot marry just anybody.

377
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,920
Besides, why the rush?

378
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Thank you.

379
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,559
I'm also doing it for her.
She doesn't deserve an unhappy marriage.

380
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,559
-May I come in?
-Of course, Guzmán.

381
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,359
-What is it?
-I wanted to talk to you about Nadia.

382
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,000
Did you know she's not coming back
next year? Her father forbids it.

383
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,839
-Oh. No, I didn't know.
-We can't let that happen.

384
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,799
Education is no longer compulsory
at your age.

385
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,559
If her father wants to remove her
from school, he can.

386
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,279
Why should she pay
for her father's intolerance?

387
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:41,400
She didn't choose to be born
into a family like that.

388
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,400
Nadia wants to be here.

389
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,799
She's a great student.
She has a scholarship.

390
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,319
We can't let her go.

391
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,759
You started to date Marina
and you found out she was pregnant.

392
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,359
-Didn't that bother you?
-No.

393
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,279
Of course not.

394
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,599
It was hard at first,
but I did not resent it.

395
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
Samuel, are you telling me
the whole truth?

396
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,440
Samuel, all of this is a bit absurd,
to be honest.

397
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,720
You don't need to avoid me
whenever we're in the same room.

398
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,640
You know full well
I didn't want to hurt you.

399
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
I need someone to lean on now,

400
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,680
-to tell everything--
-That's not going to be me.

401
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,400
Can you give us a moment? We need to talk.

402
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,359
Remember when I told you
the blackmailers were nobodies?

403
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,640
That they had asked for very little money?

404
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,960
-Today, they asked for twice that amount.
-What do you mean by that?

405
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,799
Marina, that proves you talked to them.

406
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,119
I don't give a rat's ass how you do it,
but you need to get that watch.

407
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,480
Fall in love with whoever you want.
Play at being the rebel, the misfit.

408
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,119
I don't care.

409
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,880
But don't risk everything you have
and endanger your family.

410
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,880
-Thank you for coming again.
-This is becoming a habit.

411
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,680
-What happened now?
-Nothing bad, I assure you.

412
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,920
It's about your daughter.

413
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,920
I heard you don't want her to come here
next school year.

414
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
We are delighted with her.

415
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,640
She's got an excellent record here.
She has adapted wonderfully.

416
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,920
-It's a thoughtfully considered decision.
-I'm not saying it isn't.

417
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,039
But if only there were a way
to change your mind...

418
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,759
We think you are taking
a wonderful opportunity from her.

419
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,799
Are you saying I'm a bad father?
That, as an uneducated Muslim,

420
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
-I don't know what's best for her?
-No.

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm just trying to make you see
that Nadia...

422
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,480
would have many advantages,
were she to remain here.

423
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
-She has learned a lot so far.
-Yes.

424
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,000
She has learned to disrespect her parents.
To lie, to sneak out of her house.

425
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:28,039
-To neglect her religious duties.
-She's a teenager. They rebel at that age.

426
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,960
Hey.

427
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
What are you doing? We have an exam.

428
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,559
Is that what you teach here?
To tolerate rebelliousness?

429
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,279
Don't turn over the paper
until I tell you to.

430
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't worry, there's nothing there
we haven't gone over a thousand times.

431
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,759
Excuse me.

432
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,160
What are you doing here, Lucrecia?
You're suspended.

433
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,319
I know,
but I have the right to take this exam.

434
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
I'll sit over there.

435
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,759
Nadia, we're leaving.

436
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,000
-What?
-I'm taking you out of here immediately.

437
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:09,920
-Let's go.
-Excuse me. Yusef, let's talk.

438
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,119
Don't take it like that.
I never meant to offend you.

439
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,559
Don't make her pay for it.

440
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Nadia, let's go.
Don't make me repeat myself.

441
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,400
Dad, we're about to start an exam.

442
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,359
Let's go!

443
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,240
-Don't treat her like that.
-Shut up!

444
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,640
-Don't grab her like that!
-Dad!

445
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,400
I feel for her! For her and for your son.

446
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,240
To be a woman or a homosexual
in your family must be hell! Poor Omar!

447
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,680
Dad.

448
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,160
Hey!

449
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,720
What?
What are you insinuating about my son?

450
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,720
Go back to class.

451
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,559
Let's go.

452
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,839
You too.

453
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,160
Come on.

454
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,519
Carry on with your exam.
Nothing to worry about.

455
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,720
-What are you doing here?
-She says she has a right to be here.

456
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,200
Out. Right now.

457
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,079
What are you laughing at, idiot?

458
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,400
If you think you'll get Carla,
you're mistaken.

459
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,960
As a hobby you were fine, but...
you're not enough for her.

460
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,160
Sure. But I was enough for you, right?

461
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,559
What did you like best about me? My ass.

462
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,519
Or my dick?
Because you sure held on to it.

463
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,599
Asking for a beating, are you?

464
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,759
You'll never be her boyfriend,
you hear me? Never!

465
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
Maybe.

466
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,799
But that is more likely to happen
than you fucking me again.

467
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,519
I didn't force you, remember?

468
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,119
You allowed yourself to be bought.

469
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,039
You're no better than me.

470
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
What are you looking at?

471
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,200
What's wrong?

472
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:27,079
Your fucking ex!
He knows how to push my buttons!

473
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,559
Calm down. Look at me, OK? Calm down.

474
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Ignore him. Just ignore him.

475
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:34,920
OK?

476
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,519
We could do something fun today.
Introduce me to your friends.

477
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,240
You know my world,
but I don't know yours. OK?

478
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,799
You!

479
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,920
Tell me why you are being slandered!
Why do they think you like men?

480
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,839
Dad!

481
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,200
Tell me it's not true!

482
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,279
Tell me!

483
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:59,640
Dad...

484
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,480
Tell me my son is not a homosexual.

485
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,639
No, I don't know who told you that,
but no.

486
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm not.

487
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,559
It's all right.

488
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,320
Tomorrow we'll see Fatima
and her daughter.

489
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,760
And if she's not the right wife for you,
then another.

490
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,119
But we'll find one soon.

491
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm not going to let anybody tarnish
your good name.

492
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,679
Or this family's.

493
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,079
I am a coward.

494
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,960
No.

495
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,079
You did what you had to do.

496
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,519
What happened? Why does he know?

497
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,360
-The school principal told him.
-What?

498
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,400
Isn't that Ander's mother?
What is she doing? She's ruined my life.

499
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,760
Yours and mine.
Dad dragged me out of class.

500
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,440
In front of everybody. So humiliating.

501
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,320
-Hello, Pilar.
-Hi, cutie.

502
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,880
-Is Samuel here?
-No, he's at work.

503
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,719
Do you mind if I wait for him here?

504
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,800
-Sure, come in.
-I don't want to go home.

505
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,639
Because of what's going on with my father.

506
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,039
Some story, that one.

507
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,039
I know.

508
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,440
-I don't think he'll be long.
-It's OK, I'll wait here.

509
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,199
You caught me with my cards.

510
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,719
Hey, do you want me to read them for you?

511
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,639
Maybe we find out
when your father gets out.

512
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,960
-No.
-This is never wrong.

513
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,280
-Could I use your bathroom?
-Of course, you know where it is.

514
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,199
Thank you.

515
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:23,920
Shit.

516
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,760
Looking for this?

517
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,719
Yes, but not to give it to them.

518
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,000
I wanted to keep it,
and keep it from the papers.

519
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,719
I told you I wouldn't give it
to the papers.

520
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,320
But here.

521
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,679
I do trust you.

522
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
I only ask one thing.

523
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,639
Let them pay us.

524
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,480
That money is loose change to them.
A bargain, after what they did.

525
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,679
And when they pay us,
you do what you want with the watch.

526
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
You sure?

527
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,559
Marina...

528
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,039
we are having a child together.

529
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,599
If I don't trust you,
who am I going to trust?

530
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
I haven't decided to keep it yet.

531
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,280
Do you know how many calls
I had to make to get that money?

532
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,639
Do you know what it cost me?

533
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,840
But that didn't matter to those losers.

534
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Because, to them,
we are only fucking rich snobs.

535
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,960
You didn't think the town would be upset?
To see your father go free?

536
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,320
What? The law is the same for everybody.

537
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,599
If a judge sets bail, and you can pay it,
that's not illegal.

538
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,920
You didn't know
you were walking into a hornet's nest?

539
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,320
Marina.

540
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,960
-Look who's here.
-Dad! They released you!

541
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,119
Thanks to your brother, who didn't stop
until he raised the money to pay bail.

542
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,800
He's shown me a lot.

543
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,480
-Marina, we need to talk.
-About what, Dad?

544
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,559
Teo tells me you are involved
in the theft of the watches.

545
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,599
Who are your friends?

546
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,519
-They've brainwashed you.
-Honey...

547
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,360
Do you know how serious this is?
All that's at stake?

548
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,199
-Dad, why do you think I'm involved?
-Carla told us everything.

549
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,679
And it wouldn't be the first time you
hang out with riffraff.

550
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
Riffraff, Guzmán?

551
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,360
Dad went to jail,
but they're the riffraff?

552
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,519
-What are you saying?
-Don't go there, please.

553
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,800
So you do have something
to do with those losers.

554
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,800
-Marina, you just don't learn.
-What losers are you talking about?

555
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,159
I'm tired of your arrogance, and yours.

556
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,719
So they caught you red-handed?
Deal with it!

557
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,239
Just a moment! Everybody calm down!

558
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,679
Sure, ask us to calm down now.

559
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,719
How can I calm down with this nutjob here

560
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,159
-who prefers those losers to her family!
-You know what, Guzmán?

561
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,800
With those people you call losers,
I'm making my own family.

562
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,079
More authentic and less hypocritical!

563
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,280
What do you mean?

564
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,159
I'm pregnant.

565
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:30,840
Marina. Please, say that's not true.

566
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,199
Who's the father?

567
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,559
That waiter?

568
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,960
No. His brother.

569
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
That's why you helped him
with the theft, huh?

570
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:49,039
That's it. I'll fix this right now!

571
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,480
Where are you going?

572
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,440
Ander, call Polo. You have to help me.
Now!

573
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,760
Marina, please.
Think about what you're saying.

574
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,639
Don't do things
out of spite for your parents.

575
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,519
You can't have a child now.

576
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,679
Much less with a boy like that!

577
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,199
-Even you should realize that!
-Do you think I can reason with you?

578
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
Look at yourself! You're so prejudiced!

579
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,480
Just thinking your girl may not date
a future minister makes you freak out!

580
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:22,760
-That boy is blackmailing us!
-You are a minor, and you'll do as we say.

581
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,360
That's it. You will not go ahead
with that pregnancy, you hear?

582
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,199
Wait and see. But don't worry,
this child will not meet its grandparents.

583
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,679
Nano,

584
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,559
listen, we can leave together
whenever you want, OK?

585
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,960
Guzmán, this is crazy.

586
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,400
Wait, stop. Stop, damn it!

587
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
What? Damn it, Ander!

588
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,039
Should I remind you what happened
last time you tried to fix things?

589
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,320
-They got fixed.
-You almost killed Pablo.

590
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,360
We go to their house,
take what's ours, and leave.

591
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,840
-Or are you getting cold feet?
-They're not home. Carla just posted this.

592
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,599
-I swear she's all right.
-Carla's here for a reason.

593
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,519
Why else would she ask so many questions?
She doesn't trust me or my brother.

594
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,039
No, man, she likes me, for real.
She's crazy about me.

595
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,599
Son of a bitch!
You may fool your brother, but not me.

596
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,039
First you steal from me.
And then get my sister pregnant.

597
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,000
You are an asshole!

598
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,559
Ah! Fuck!

599
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,239
-I won't let that bastard end up with you!
-Go to hell!

600
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,519
Son of a bitch!

601
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:37,960
Ander!

602
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,519
Let's go!

603
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,480
-Come back here!
-Son of a bitch!

604
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,320
Please, open up.

605
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,920
-I'm being chased!
-Go away!

606
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,760
Nadia.

607
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,239
He's not your problem.
Let him fend for himself!

608
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,760
-Say what you want, he's coming in.
-They're after me!

609
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,920
-Call the police!
-Why the police?

610
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,559
-If I catch that bastard, he'll be sorry!
-Son of a bitch!

611
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,320
See why I didn't want you to befriend him?
He's trouble!

612
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,760
Ander!

613
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,320
Ander!

614
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,199
I love you. I love you, damn it!

615
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,360
Asshole, they had to kill me
for you to say it.

616
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,599
Oh, what's wrong?

617
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,480
Samuel?

618
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,039
Samuel, what's going on?

619
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Samuel.

620
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,320
Samuel, what did you do?

621
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,679
