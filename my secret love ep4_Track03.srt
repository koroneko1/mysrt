1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:05,519
The people, places, organizations, events,
groups and professionals

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,492
depicted in this program are fictional

3
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:11,000
and created for entertainment purposes only.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,200
I came up with a small business plan.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
No one would want to buy a cheesy t-shirt like that!

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,440
We need something else to attract people.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,320
He just follows the script.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,656
You remember Fluke?
My classmate at school.

10
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:27,629
Oh yes, I remember.

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,760
Ever since you two got together,

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,683
seems like all your skills have been transferred to Park.

13
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,793
Tim-Kim seems like a good match too.

14
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:38,734
I have invited one of your friends
to collaborate with our channel.

15
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:53,262
Why do you look so serious?

16
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,453
What are you doing?

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,476
I'm planning for the shoot we're having this week.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,109
Ah!

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,000
With Tim, your sweetheart?

20
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:14,699
You like it, don't you?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,508
A collaboration with Tim.

22
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:19,160
Awwww.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
When will you stop irritating me?

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,799
I'm tired.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,533
Every time I meet you, you never fail to irritate me.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't like when someone does that to me.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,617
Because I can't fight with them.

28
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't like being a loser. You get it?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,344
Why did you get serious all of a sudden?

30
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:44,355
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to irritate you.

31
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:46,590
This is just how I am.

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,590
Take it easy.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,781
Really, I just want to talk to you.

34
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,137
You're serious all the time.
Don't you get tired?

35
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,207
I'm not that serious.

36
00:01:56,137 --> 00:01:57,317
Are you for real?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,107
Anyway,

38
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,683
Why is it so important
for you to be the head of the student club?

39
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,437
You work for the club all the time.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,863
It's part of my life plan.

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,754
I think...

42
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,590
It'll push me to great success in the future.

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,796
What do you mean by success?

44
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,590
To have a great job,

45
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,672
have lots of money,

46
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,257
and build a family in the way that I want.

47
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,929
Something like that.

48
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,400
What about you?

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,699
Do you have any plans for the future?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm not the type to plan things ahead.

51
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:39,000
But if you ask me now...

52
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,492
I say it's doing something people accept.

53
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,481
Like the Thunderous Sky channel?

54
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,797
Yeah, like that.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
If possible,

56
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:52,465
I also want to do something that
expresses my feelings.

57
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:56,465
Because sometimes I'm too shy
to say things outright.

58
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,016
Why do you think it's not possible?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,219
Maybe I'm kind of indecisive.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Whenever I have to make a decision,

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,757
I always find it hard to do.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I just let life takes me wherever it goes

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,426
never really have a plan.

65
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll just make the decisions right at the spot.

66
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:26,481
I think I understand that.

67
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,000
We're fine with making trivial decisions.

68
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:32,164
But when it's about something serious,

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,437
there are always hundreds of things to be considered.

70
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:37,535
Right?

71
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:40,234
Even a well-planned person like you got this issue too.

72
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:41,851
Let alone someone like me.

73
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:44,590
Something like this takes time.

74
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,492
I think when you get into details with anything,

75
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,428
that means you care about it.

76
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,469
And when that happens,

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,069
you'll realize that you're on the right track.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,574
Is this a 'Wise Words with Kim' segment?

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you going to keep working for long?

80
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:11,700
I'm not sure.

81
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,918
What I meant to say is

82
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,189
I can wait.

83
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,781
We can go home together,

84
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,289
so you don't have to pay for the fare.

85
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,070
But I still have a lot to work on.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,055
It's okay.

87
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,492
I can get some sleep while you finish it.

Hello, everyone!

99
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,180
It's Tim here.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm gonna take over Mek-Kim program for a day.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm going to do help mix & match the uniforms

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,629
for our university's hottest BL couple, Kimhan and Mek.

103
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,519
How's it going to be? Let's check it out!

104

Wow, wow, wow, wow.

Kim, you need to be professional.

All the people around here already know
that you like Tim.

107
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:20,847
You're grinning from ear to ear.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,153
Grinning my ass!

109
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,000
Stop irritating me.

110
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:29,383
He made a great speech,
so I needed to listen carefully.

111
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,221
Stop arguing.

112
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,915

so I can finish editing on time.

I'll do it.

Park, look at Mek.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,344
What is wrong with him?
He's looking daggers at Tim all the time.

121
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:25,672
He's jealous, I guess.

00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,617

Hey!

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,840
Why did you have to mock him?
He was just being helpful.

128
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,289
He's helpful because he wants something.

129
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,740
I saw it

130
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,273
and I didn't like it.

131
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,355

No, I don't.

00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:30,769

So this means...

163
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,680
You owe me one meal, alright?

164

Next time you must come.

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

167

Now please excuse me. I'm going home.

00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:05,510
Guys,

170
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,300
I'm going home now.

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,480
See you.

172
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,535
Are you heading right home?

173
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,218
Or you want to eat something first?

174
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:28,711
Nah, I'll just head back to my place.

175
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,453
I'm not really hungry anyway.

176
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:34,000
Why did you invite him to dine with you then?

177
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,536
You've already been with him all day.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Isn't that enough, Tim?

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I just want to extend the time with him.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You seem flustered every time you talk about him.

181
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,027
Right.

182
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,055
Is it because I like Kim?

183
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,672
If I do, what do you think?

184
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:56,000
You think he passes your standard?

185
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,273
Of course, I'm okay with him.

186
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,523
No matter who you like or what you like,

187
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm all okay.

188
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:05,760
Wow!

189
00:11:06,553 --> 00:11:09,001
That's good to hear, Mai!

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,770
Park!

191
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,085
I'm so confused about Mek today.

192
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,471
What's wrong with him?

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,046
One minute he raised his voice.

194
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:32,546
The next minute he got sarcastic.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
His mood swings even worse than the crypto currency.

196
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:37,207
I'm sure it's nothing.

197
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,656
I think he was just being hysterical as always.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,645
Is this because..

199
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:44,950
he's so into the role he's playing

200
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:46,753
that he gets jealous with Kim?

201
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,109
Stop thinking about it.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
He'll be back to normal soon.

203
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,137
Perhaps it's just me having bad luck today.

204
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,492
He just snapped at me out of nowhere.

205
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,716
Speaking of which,

206
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,137
I haven't checked my daily horoscope yet.

207
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's have a look!

208
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,617
See? It's true!

209
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:09,040
They said I might be in a discord with friends.

210
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,754
It's Mek for sure!

211
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,437
Park, what day is your birthday?

212
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,672
Saturday.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Saturday.

214
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,000
Things are looking promising for you
in terms of work and finance.

215
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,465
However...

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,059
If you're dating someone,

217
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,640
you must beware of the third wheel.

218
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,000
and the seven-year itch.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,820
It might get so bad that you two end up calling it quits.

220
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,000
How was that?

221
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:45,481
Is it accurate?

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't know.

223
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,453
It might be.

224
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,000
Is this reliable?

225
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,082
Some part it might.

226
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:07,098
Do you believe it?

227
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:10,957
Stuff like this is up to individual discretion.

228
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:14,651
Anyway...

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,765
What about the number you put after your name on LINE?

230
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,410
101. What's that?

231
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,000
Are you joining a survival show in Korea?

232
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:24,000
Ah!

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,547
It's a number a fortune teller gave me.

234
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,000
It's sort of a lucky number.

235
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:29,047
It's just a silly thing I do.

236
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,436
And you said you didn't believe it.

237
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,360
Oh, hi, Bear.

238
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,426
Hi, Bomb!

239
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,560
What a coincidence!

240
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,080
You said you had a part-time job.

241
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,099
It's here?

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why didn I never meet you here before?

243
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:10,809
I eat here quite often.

244
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:13,492
I've just transferred to this branch.

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,224
Good then.

246
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:18,000
Now I can ask you for some extra sauce.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,727
You can normally ask for extra sauce.

248
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:20,770
I was just kidding.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
Oops, I didn't see the long lineup.

250
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,443
I'll get...

251
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:30,480
one Double Taco Supreme combo set.

252
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,494
Eat here, right?

253
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:32,480
Yes.

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,380
Would you like to change from cheese to fries?

255
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:36,464
No, thanks.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's 199 baht in total.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Are you taking a break?

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,855
Yes.

259
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,437
When will you finish your shift?

260
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,000
I finish my shift around midnight.

261
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,972
But I'll have to clean up until around 1am.

262
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:14,320
How can do find time to do your assignments

263
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,601
or watch series then?

264
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,560
I can still manage my time to study.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,243
But for series,

266
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,242
I haven't watched them much.

267
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,200
I only watch Thunderous Sky channel.

268
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,520
That's so nice of you, Hailstone!

269
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,656
I'm dying to go back to work on my channel.

270
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:32,875
But Mek is not up for it yet.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I guess now we need to focus on BL content.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,519
Do you always come here alone?

273
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,328
Yes, I always come alone.

274
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,137
Why don't you invite anyone else to come with?

275
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:45,503
Eating alone is lonely.

276
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:47,480
You should bring your friends with you.

277
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:51,000
Mek and Park never come around this neighborhood.

278
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,766
Also, their places are on the other side of town.

279
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,996
Then...

280
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,683
Why don't you bring your date along with you?

281
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,070
My date?

282
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:03,821
I don't have one.

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,535
What about...

284
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,563
someone you have a crush on?

285
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,507
Do you have one yet?

286
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:16,579
Well...

287
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,481
There's someone.

288
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,000
But I don't really know who that person is.

289
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,437
I just know that the person is one of my fans.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I'm certain that I'm his bias.

291
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,273
I've been trying to find him.

292
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:36,164
But I still don't know who he is.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,246
He always gives me words of encouragement.

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I'd like to meet him for once.

295
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,000
I think I talked too much now.

296
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,148
Well...

297
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,535
Please don't tell anyone about this.

298
00:16:57,656 --> 00:16:59,027
I won't tell anyone.

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What a lucky person he is.

300
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:14,938
Excuse me.

301
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,092
I need to get back to work now.

302
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,481
Enjoy your meal.

303
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,240
Okay.

304
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
Cheer up!

305
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,000
What's wrong with you today?

306
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:07,590
You're in a bad mood all day.

307
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:10,492
Nothing.

308
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,110
What more do you want me to say?

309
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,590
You don't have to care about me.

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, I know!

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You must be angry because you're hungry for sure!

312
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:36,273
When Tim invited us to have a meal,
you should've said yes.

313
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,360
You didn't have to keep it cool.

314
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,480
I don't want to go with him.

315
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,519
If I do, I'd have to eat fancy stuff rich people eat.

316
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:45,492
Like what they have at those Omakase restaurants.

317
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,699
Each bite is so small.
I'll never be full.

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He wouldn't invite us to a fancy place like that.

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So this is why you're in the bad mood?

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,590
No, it's not about that.

321
00:18:56,754 --> 00:18:57,613
Nonsense.

322
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Come in.

323
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:10,973
Come.

324
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,380
So...

325
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,024
Can you be my personal chef from now on?

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,563
Hope you're not fully booked yet.

327
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm still available.

328
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,114
Feel free to book.

329
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,976
I only have instant noodles.
Are you okay with that?

330
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:15,251
Mm.

331
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:27,725
I haven't got much time these days
with the whole content creating thing going on.

332
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:29,009
Not to mention student club's works on the side.

333
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,832
That's why I no longer have time to buy groceries.

334
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:36,858
But don't worry.

335
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,708
I can assure you that this bowl of noodles

336
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,925
will definitely satiate your hunger.

337
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:44,740
Do you need my help?

338
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:46,545
It's fine.

339
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,301
Just sit tight over there, okay?

340
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,050
The food will be served right in front of you.

341
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,387
Here's Michelin star stir-fried noodles by Chef Kim.

342
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,485
Looks so yummy!

343
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:35,587
Well...

344
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:37,547
Let's dig in!

345
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:12,192
It's so good that you're putting real chefs in shame!

346
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:15,855
Maybe you were just starving.

347
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:17,939
Anything would be delicious for you.

348
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:22,140
I'm being honest here,
but you don't believe me.

349
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:23,401
I really meant it.

350
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:27,345
You cook so well.
Where did you practice it?

351
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,841
I'm sure I'm not that good.

352
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,265
I live alone with my sister.

353
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:34,897
And she's a fussy eater.

354
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,867
I want to make sure that she has good meals

355
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,450
so I do a lot of cooking.

356
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,651
I guess I got to practice along the way.

357
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,524
How lucky I am!

358
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:46,785
I don't need to line up at restaurants anymore

359
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:49,026
now that I have Chef Kim living next door.

360
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:53,446
So...

361
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,277
Can you be my personal chef from now on?

362
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,511
Hope you're not fully booked yet.

363
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:00,128
I'm still available.

364
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:00,983
Feel free to book.

365
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:28,468
OMG, guys!

366
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:31,004
Our Mek-Kim ship is now saling off-screen!

367
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,621
And it's sailing hard!

368
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,684
For people born on Saturdays...

369
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,838
Things are looking promising in terms of career and money.

370
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:43,637
However...

371
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,845
Those who are in a relationship

372
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:46,311
should beware of a third person

373
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:48,019
and the seven-year itch.

374
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,867
Some couples might even end up separating.

375
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:54,073
Babe.

376
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,004
Who are you texting?

377
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,951
I'm texting Kimhan.

378
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:00,587
It's just Kim...

379
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:03,640
Why are you looking so happy?

380
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,626
This is how I normally react.

381
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:30,947
It's nothing, Park.

382
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,347
[Would you take it?]

383
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:49,587
Some couples might suffer the seven-year itch real hard and end up separating.

384
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,700
What are you doing?

385
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:04,861
Nothing.

386
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:06,605
Just editing some videos.

387
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:09,956
Are you okay?

388
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,335
You look a bit tired.

389
00:25:12,748 --> 00:25:13,432
Here.

390
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:14,554
I'll give you a massage.

391
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:34,853
Woah!

392
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,707
What are those things in the bags?

393
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:39,827
Yesterday you said you didn't have time to buy groceries and only had instant noodles.

394
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:41,473
Don't tell me that...

395
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,300
you woke up early to get all these?

396
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:44,157
Well, yeah.

397
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:44,871
See?

398
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:46,227
I bought a lot of things.

399
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,719
Pork, duck, chicken, freshwater fish, sea fish

400
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,147
root veggies, leafy veggies, fruits.

401
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:51,667
Everything in one go!

402
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,031
Are you a grocery truck or something?

403
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:55,192
A lot of things indeed.

404
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,569
Here, I'll put them into the fridge.

405
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,820
I already bought these for you.

406
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,467
You have to cook something for me.

407
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:04,982
My life depends on you now, Chef Kim.

408
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:06,803
Alright.

409
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:08,700
What do you want for a meal, sir?

410
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,320
Anything is fine.

411
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,596
Steamed whole fish with spicy soup

412
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:15,666
or maybe a little bit of Tom Yum.

413
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,650
I like them all!

414
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:18,605
Enough!

415
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:20,266
I already know you're a funny guy.

416
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,507
Here, let me help you.

417
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,559
Make sure that Dao get to eat these too.
Don't finish them all by yourself.

418
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:35,160
Roger that.

419
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:56,194
Give it to me.

420
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:33,343
Seems like you've become way too immersed in your role.

421
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:34,959
Nonsense.

422
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,693
It's just for content.

423
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:12,991
Kritsada Pakdi.

424
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:17,661
Where should I start?

425
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,199
Facebook then.

426
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,183
That should be the easiest way.

427
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:28,701
[Kritsada Pakdi]

428
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:37,367
What's up?

429
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,274
Storms are coming today!

430
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:42,232
It's been so long since our last live chat with the Hailstones.

431
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:43,462
Let's do that again, shall we?

432
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,491
I'm sure the Hailstones are looking forward to seeing us.

433
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,664
Finally!

434
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:48,391
Mek of Thunderous Sky is making a comeback?

435
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,234
Hell yeah!

436
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,028
By the way...

437
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,191
Since we've been gone for so long

438
00:28:51,191 --> 00:28:52,954
Do you think we should dress up for a little bit?

439
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:55,658
Let's do a live chat like the Gentlemen of Juthathep.

440
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:56,861
What are you saying?

441
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,746
Don't you know...

442
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,451
their sequel is already in the works!

443
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,991
I'll take the role of James Ji's son, okay?

444
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,692
Get the announcement ready.

445
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:07,324
Thunderous Sky is going live at 6pm.

446
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:08,158
BAAM!

447
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,146
You got it, man!

448
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,248
BAAM!

449
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:12,601
Well...

450
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:14,590
I'll be James Ma's son then.

451
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:44,072
Caution:

452
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:45,711
Hailstones, are you ready?

453
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:46,923
Today at 6pm,

454
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:47,967
see you in a live chat!

455
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:49,592
Storms are coming.

456
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,100
BAAM!

457
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:02,862
Wow!

458
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,755
My baby.

459
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,100
I can't believe how much you've grown.

460
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:08,363
Keep growing, okay?

461
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:12,294
Daddy will take good care of you.

462
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,351
Well, well.

463
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,222
Is this plant called Kimhan or something?

464
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:18,510
You're taking such a good care of it.

465
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:21,831
Seems like you've become way too immersed in your role.

466
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,232
Nonsense.

467
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,012
It's just for content.

468
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,258
When you work on something

469
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,566
you should do it with passion, no?

470
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,351
Alright, I see.

471
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:34,417
You went to the market at 5 in the morning.

472
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:37,191
That's a surprise coming from a late, late bird like you.

473
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,431
It's nothing.

474
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:41,762
He cooked for me,

475
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:43,226
so I returned the favor by buying those groceries.

476
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,412
Your brother is a good person.

477
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:46,471
Have you ever thought about that?

478
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,906
Alright, alright, good guy.

479
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,269
By the way...

480
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:53,150
As the head of the fandom,

481
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,233
do you have any suggestion of what else we should do?

482
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,504
You already have a ship name.

483
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,397
You've already held an event together.

484
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,102
You've already launched merchandise.

485
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,965
How about a Q&A session?
Have you done that?

486
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,201
Not yet.

487
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,812
But it sounds interesting.

488
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:16,151
Got it, Captain!

489
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:18,391
I'm gonna go make that content right away.

490
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,699
Don't be confused.

491
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,950
People are eager for new content
and I just want us to stay active.

492
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:25,519
Up to you then.

493
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,460
Hi, guys.
This is Mek.

494
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,221
Hi. It's me, Kimhan.

495
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,783
Today, Mek and I are going to do a Q&A session with you guys.

496
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,735
We've read your comments.

497
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,970
Lots of you were asking me and this guy
to answer your questions.

498
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:42,191
Kim, are you ready?

499
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:42,835
Let's do this!

500
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:49,355
Is it true that Kim didn't like the content on Mek's Thunderous Sky channel at first?

501
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,719
Please go easy on this one.

502
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:53,865
Well...

503
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:56,423
It's true.

504
00:31:58,215 --> 00:31:59,723
You're so cruel.

505
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,662
I mean...

506
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:05,227
That video did get people in trouble for real.

507
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:06,517
But...

508
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,238
Mek is not that kind of person anymore.

509
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:09,362
That's right.

510
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:10,230
Right now...

511
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,031
I like doing this better.

512
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:17,873
Mek...

513
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:21,248
What is your favorite Kim's dish?

514
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,471
Also, I love his fried eggs.

515
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:34,803
Even though it's just an ordinary dish, it tastes so good!

516
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:37,133
Fried eggs?

517
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,446
I didn't do anything special.

518
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,831
I just fried them.

519
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:45,071
Mek is exaggerating again!

520
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:51,183
Is Kim's sister the admin of Mek-Kim fanbase?

521
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:52,963
I saw the photos on her IG.

522
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:55,931
Yes, she is.

523
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,253
Damn it, Mek, why aren't you picking up my calls?

524
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,459
Did you forget?

525
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,438
Then why would you make that appointment with me?!

526
00:33:08,956 --> 00:33:09,694
Jeez.

527
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:10,650
I got tricked.

528
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,831
You bastard.

529
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,763
You stood me up

530
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:22,790
and you're embarrassing me.

531
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:28,414
How come you and your sister

532
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:30,414
don't look alike at all?

533
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:33,669
I guess my sister inherited both of our parents' genes.

534
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,808
Meanwhile, I look like my mother.

535
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:39,462
Actually, Q's father is my stepdad.

536
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,622
My biological father...

537
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,761
is now in heaven.

538
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,808
As a matter of fact, there are some perks of haveing a stepfather.

539
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:51,688
Whenever we go out for a meal

540
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:52,994
I never have to spend a dime.

541
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,187
What?

542
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:55,886
Because...

543
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:57,221
My stepdad always "steps" up and pays for me.

544
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,453
Is it funny?

545
00:34:02,183 --> 00:34:04,691
Alright, let's call it a day.

546
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,471
I think next time we should run a poll

547
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:10,467
on whether Kim should keep making jokes or not.

548
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,182
See you guys next time.

549
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:13,245
Bye-bye.

550
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,807
Bye-bye.

551
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,126
Are you okay with that mention about your father earlier?

552
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:28,426
I'm okay.

553
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:33,782
I used to get sad when someone asked me about him.

554
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:36,266
But I've come to terms with it.

555
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,988
Here, let me give you a hug

556
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:45,990
to celebrate your strengths
and also your audacity to pull off that joke.

557
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:49,889
But we've already turned off the live.

558
00:34:50,347 --> 00:34:51,470
I don't think that's necessary.

559
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:53,661
I'm hugging you because I want to,

560
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,488
not for the sake of content.

561
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:09,987
Kim,

562
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:12,323
you don't have to wake up early for class tomorrow.

563
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:15,240
Why not?

564
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,531
But traffic is bad in the morning.

565
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:19,882
What I meant to say is
I want you to go to the campus with me.

566
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:23,988
Sure.

567
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll see you then.

568
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:33,963
They're sweet, aren't they?

569
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:35,325
Indeed, they are.

570
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,516
The first signs of cheating:

571
00:35:44,652 --> 00:35:46,214
1. Overprotection of his phone

572
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:05,409
2. Avoidance of eye contact during conversations

573
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:07,556
Babe.

574
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:09,652
Who are you texting?

575
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:11,630
I'm texting Kimhan.

576
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,369
The rice is too soft, don't you think?

577
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:16,746
Yes, it is.

578
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:21,557
3. A lack of conversations and inputs

579
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,609
4. Secretive texting when you're not looking

580
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:45,938
Just like what the tips say.

581
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:55,184
It's all of the above.

582
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:56,541
Spot-on!

583
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:04,802
"Seriously, I get flustered every time Tim and Kim get together."

584
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:06,363
"I've already replayed that shot three times."

585
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:08,302
"They made me smile so wide my cheeks hurt!"

586
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:09,213
The audacity.

587
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:10,722
I'm gonna block you all.

588
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:13,364
These people must be blocked!

589
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:19,172
"They're so cute together.
Mek-Kim, OTP of the Year."

590
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:27,546
Thank...

591
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:29,327
you...

592
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:30,968
...so much.

593
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:32,614
Love you.

594
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:33,452
XX

595
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,847
The OTP of the Year award...

596
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:44,561
Here we come!

597
00:37:58,722 --> 00:38:01,024
Mek-Kim so cute!

598
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,370
They got so many likes for this video.

599
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:33,365
Someone says...

600
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:34,906
they already watched it three times
but still can't get enough.

601
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:36,271
They're going for a fourth rewatch!

602
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,680
I think you've watched it more times than the channel owner has.

603
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,824
Not yet.

604
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:42,764
But it's possible.

605
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,159
The views are still going up.

606
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:46,360
Hey...

607
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,901
What do you think if I start making BL contents?

608
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:55,419
Are you being serious?

609
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,273
With whom?

610
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,600
Look at you.

611
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,524
You hardly have any friends.

612
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:05,728
I know.

613
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:09,888
I think I can do it.

614
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:27,055
We love Mek-Kim.
We love Mek-Kim.

615
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:41,143
We love Mek-Kim.
We love Mek-Kim.

616
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,697
Thank you all so much.

617
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:44,922
We love you too.

618
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,853
Don't forget to eat something
before you go to class.

619
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,151
You always care for your fans.

620
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:55,831
You, too.
Don't forget to grab something to eat.

621
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:58,586
Don't worry.

622
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:00,064
I've already had breakfast.

623
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:02,137
With Kim, actually.

624
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,888
We had a great meal!

625
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:09,885
Indeed, we did.

626
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:12,953
By the way,

627
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,668
I think it's time you guys headed to class,

628
00:40:14,668 --> 00:40:16,234
or you'll be late for attendance check.

629
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:17,518
Let's go.

630
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,582
Kim,

631
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,250
keep it up!

632
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,324
What's up, my fellow Thunderous Sky people?

633
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:47,303
How are you guys this morning?

634
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:53,657
Park,

635
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:55,894
Are you okay?

636
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:57,515
You look a little blue.

637
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,106
How can he be blue?

638
00:40:59,454 --> 00:41:00,352
He's not a smurf!

639
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:07,442
It's nothing.

640
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,345
I guess I'm just tired.

641
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:10,610
I'll be fine soon.

642
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,348
It's not fine.

643
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:15,681
You're my friend.

644
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:18,057
What's the matter?
Tell me.

645
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:19,354
You can share it with me.

646
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:22,031
He said he's fine.
Stop bugging him.

647
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:24,916
It's still morning.
Why are you sitting here looking depressed?

648
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,551
You have to feel good!

649
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:27,710
What would you know?

650
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:30,354
You're too busy enjoying that BL fame.

651
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:31,905
Come on, Bear.

652
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:34,031
I only stood you up a little
and now you're mad at me?

653
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,671
When are you going to stop being so sulky?

654
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:37,628
Look at yourself!

655
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:40,536
Please stop fighting.

656
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:42,589
I beg you.

657
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:47,793
Go feeling good somewhere else.

658
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:49,098
You're annoying me.

659
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:51,922
Sure.

660
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,209
You said it yourself.

661
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,071
Fine. Up to you.

662
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,201
Are you okay?

663
00:42:16,527 --> 00:42:17,409
Hi there, Kim.

664
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:18,726
Hi, Tim.

665
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,141
What a coincidence.

666
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:22,035
I suppose you've already watched our collab video.

667
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:23,009
Do you like it?

668
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,431
Yes, I have.

669
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,806
Honestly, it felt a bit weird modeling.

670
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:30,531
Fashion shoots are not really my thing.

671
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,268
Why would you feel weird?

672
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,871
I think you did a great job.

673
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,708
Maybe partly because we enjoyed ourselves during the shoot.

674
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:38,395
That's why it came out great.

675
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,569
Also, you don't look awkward at all.

676
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,601
It was fun indeed.

677
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:44,967
So that means...

678
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:47,883
If I ask you to join me for future collabs on my channel,

679
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,673
you'd be happy to come, right?

680
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:50,907
Of course.

681
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:52,715
I'd love to.

682
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:54,173
Then...

683
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:58,623
If I ask you

684
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,564
to make BL content with me

685
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,687
you'd also be happy to, right?

686
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:05,810
What did you say?

687
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:10,371
Kimhan, I want you...

688
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:12,151
to be my BL partner.

689
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,611
Doesn't that mean you're going to get sacked?

690
00:43:31,706 --> 00:43:32,947
How did it come to this?

691
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,312
I have a new pranking idea!

692
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,511
So you're coming back to make prank content on our channel?

693
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,631
Let's do a prank on Kim!

694
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,358
You're abusing your power for personal gain.

695
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:42,177
You know me.

696
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,307
What I want

697
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,431
I get.

698
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,499
I decorated this chocolate cake with orange slices

699
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:49,709
to add a sense of refreshment.

700
00:43:49,709 --> 00:43:50,952
For the cake texture...

701
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:52,272
I opted for fudge...

702
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,841
Tim!

703
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,630
No matter what excuse you make,

704
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,824
it doesn't change the fact that you did wrong.
