1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,719
I’m leaving now.
It was very fun flying with you.

2
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,840
Ms. Pleng.

3
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,039
Stop making me blush.

4
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,879
It's with me already.

5
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,639
You have good taste.

6
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,079
-I'll have one original mocha ice blended.
-Sure.

7
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,639
Gosh!

8
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,040
I’m sorry.

9
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,199
Hey!

10
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,279
What's wrong with you?

11
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,519
What are you looking at?
Do I look like your husband?

12
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,240
Are you Gym? Kaya’s boyfriend?

13
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,879
Kaya asked me to translate
this voice message for you.

14
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
It’s in this thumb drive.

15
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,120
I’m going to start, okay?

16
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Are you mixed-race?

17
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
Hi, Gym.

18
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,720
I’m sorry about keeping my interview
at the factory a secret.

19
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
I love you.

20
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,480
But we hardly have anything in common.

21
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,040
For example,

22
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,680
our interests,

23
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,319
culture,

24
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,399
attitude,

25
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,199
religion,

26
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,279
and way of life.

27
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,839
I think

28
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,680
we won’t make it together.

29
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,480
We can’t really communicate
and understand each other.

30
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Communicate, my ass!

31
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,759
We slept together every night!

32
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
I don’t know anything.

33
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
I’m just here to translate the file.

34
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,759
I’m going to continue, okay?

35
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,160
I hope you will meet

36
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,839
the right person one day.

37
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,240
You are the right one for me.

38
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm done listening.

39
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,959
Okay. That’s fine
if you don’t want to listen anymore.

40
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,120
Wait.

41
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,079
You’re the one
who taught her English, right?

42
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,800
Yes.

43
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
This is your fault!

44
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,839
Damn it!

45
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,079
What the hell are you looking at?

46
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,439
Is that a bomb?

47
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,759
Excuse me. What is that?

48
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,240
I think it's chicken soup.

49
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Chicken soup?

50
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,480
Here. Look, winter melon.

51
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,799
Winter melon!

52
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,159
What kind of person are you?

53
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,279
Are you talking to me?

54
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,240
I’m talking about that guy.

55
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,120
What kind of person are you?

56
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you talking to me?

57
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,279
I’m talking about that guy.

58
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,240
A person like that shouldn't live long.

59
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,080
Oh. You must be talking about that guy.

60
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm talking about you!

61
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,279
SPEAK ENGLISH LIKE A NATIVE

62
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh gosh!

63
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,320
What the hell is wrong with you?

64
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Don’t get any closer.

65
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,120
I will poke your eyes.

66
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,080
It’s not worth it.

67
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,320
Do you want to play rough?

68
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,639
I’m going to go for that interview
so I can get Kaya back.

69
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,200
And you have to teach me.

70
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,000
Ask your dad to teach you then.

71
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,120
Aren’t you mixed-race?

72
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,519
Hey!

73
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,440
My dad is French.

74
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
He fled back to his country
even before I could walk.

75
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,519
-You can study with some other teacher.
-No, I can’t.

76
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,039
You taught Kaya.

77
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,519
So you have to teach me too.

78
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,600
You saw your cut-out standee, right?

79
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,039
So will you teach me?

80
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,559
Sure.

81
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,759
One on one?

82
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,879
Okay.

83
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,399
Here. The fee.

84
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,399
If you ditch me,

85
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,399
I won’t ask for a refund.

86
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,200
I want something else in return.

87
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,559
Is this even worth it?

88
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,279
It’s four in the morning
and you're still awake?

89
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,039
You should have joined us for dinner.

90
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,320
Because you didn’t go, Aey and Chai
kept clinking glasses with me.

91
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,360
Hey.

92
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,919
They sent their regards to you too.

93
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,399
See?

94
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,120
There are a lot of them.

95
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,759
They wrote things on me
like I was a notebook.

96
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
DON'T BE SAD, MICRODICK! -AEY

97
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,159
THE END OF THE LEGENDARY
SEX MACHINE. -CHAI

98
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Isn’t that the erotic chicken?

99
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,080
Wow. So sexy.

100
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,720
So erotic.

101
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,679
Hey.

102
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,559
Don’t be depressed.

103
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,240
You know when you get sad,

104
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,080
you don't look cool anymore.

105
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,639
-Dude, you’re drunk. Go to sleep.
-Hey, you don’t need her.

106
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,120
Kaya.

107
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,399
Kaya.

108
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,559
Kaya.

109
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,240
Kaya.

110
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,279
The Kaya kick.

111
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,600
It all came out...

112
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
my congee.

113
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,759
Why are you standing up?

114
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,679
I said understand, not stand up.

115
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,279
I know that.

116
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,879
I am going to get coffee.

117
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Do you want one?

118
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,639
Sure.

119
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,919
Go ahead.

120
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,440
This is harder than trying
to move an elephant.

121
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,879
INTERNATIONAL SONG

122
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,120
The sound snakes make. Hisses.

123
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
Give it a try.

124
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,360
Head.

125
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,679
Head.

126
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,840
Not head. Pull your tongue back in.

127
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,720
Head.

128
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,039
Why are you making that sound?

129
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,919
It's like when you shoo away a dog.

130
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Shoo shoo.

131
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, like that.

132
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,240
Combine them together.

133
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
Head shoo shoo.

134
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,919
Fail!

135
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Do I have to exaggerate that much?

136
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,319
Z.

137
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,359
Excuse me?

138
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,440
X, Y and...

139
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,920
Z.

140
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,759
See!

141
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,920
Even sixth graders know this word.

142
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,400
That.

143
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
No.

144
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,319
Are you blind?

145
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,359
So what is it then?

146
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,680
Those are mangoes.

147
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,119
Mangoes?

148
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,559
What mangoes?

149
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
Ripe juicy mangoes.

150
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,039
Why are you walking up?

151
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,200
It’s already 10 p.m.
I had to teach you until late.

152
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,200
The building and the elevators are closed.

153
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,599
Do you need a ride to your car?

154
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,359
No.

155
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,680
My boyfriend gave me this.

156
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,680
You have a boyfriend?

157
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
Have the cap open and ready

158
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,119
so when you get jumped
you can use it right away.

159
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,440
I know you are talking shit about me.

160
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,400
I don’t understand though.

161
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,480
Do I just pick one?

162
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,839
Go ahead.

163
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
Everybody has to take a turn.

164
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,440
What do you want me to say about moles?

165
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,519
Anything you want.

166
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,359
Anything I want?

167
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,880
Ready?

168
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,559
Wow, that was fast.

169
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,599
Pleng, a student asked
for your number today.

170
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,599
Who?

171
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,599
Mr. Pruek, the student in your
conversation for business class.

172
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,279
And did you give it to him?

173
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,200
I did.

174
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,519
And why did you do that? That’s not right.

175
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,960
Try to keep a straight face then.

176
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,640
You're smiling from ear to ear.

177
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,799
This is me smiling from ear to ear.

178
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,160
My goodness. Life is good.

179
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,160
Bitch.

180
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
What is Mama?

181
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,519
Pork Mama, Tomyum Mama,
duck-flavored Mama. Never had any before?

182
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,880
But foreigners don’t know what Mama is.

183
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,799
They will think you want to
literally eat your mom.

184
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
Why do you keep smiling?
Have you lost your mind?

185
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,359
Or you can also say midnight.

186
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,519
If you use the word "mid"
in front of any word, it means half.

187
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,839
For example, midterm means
middle of your school term.

188
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,799
Then why if you get stabbed midway
between the ribs it goes all the way in?

189
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,640
Whatever.

190
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,279
You should say...

191
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,559
Or if you want to ask someone
a question back, you say...

192
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,440
What if I don’t care to know?

193
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,440
You will just look like someone
who has no manners.

194
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,240
Wow, she’s hot.

195
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
Damn it! Why did you use the flash!

196
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,839
Hey!

197
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,000
Her panties is showing.

198
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
Hey! What?

199
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,599
Where are you going?

200
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,680
Come here.

201
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,119
What are you doing to him?

202
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,680
He took a picture of your thing.

203
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,599
No, I didn’t.

204
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,519
-Really?
-No, I didn’t.

205
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,240
You like to look at underwear, right?

206
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,200
Hey. What are you doing?

207
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,759
-You like to look, right?
-I didn’t do anything.

208
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,559
-You didn’t do anything?
-I didn’t.

209
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,799
-Sure?
-Sure.

210
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,319
Give your phone to her.

211
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,359
Give your phone to her.

212
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,279
Now!

213
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,640
That hurts.

214
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,440
It’s locked.

215
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,640
Password.

216
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,759
Password.

217
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,400
Eight, six, and double fours.

218
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,440
Hold on. Did you send it
to any of your friends?

219
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,759
No, I didn’t send anything.

220
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,119
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

221
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
Did you delete everything?

222
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,559
Are you sure?

223
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,279
Why are you only keeping quiet?

224
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,839
Did you say sorry to her?

225
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I’m sorry.

226
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,359
Next time, if you want to have a peek,
go look at your mom’s.

227
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,960
Don’t let me see you
do anything like this again. Understand?

228
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,160
Hey! My phone!

229
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,319
Come on, man. Let me go! My phone!

230
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,400
Actually, it's pronounced as password.

231
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,759
Hey!

232
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,559
Shit! It’s shit!

233
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,039
Damn, he’s so scared he shit his pants.

234
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,119
Shit! Shit! Shit!

235
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
Get me some tissue.

236
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
There isn’t any.

237
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,519
Over there.

238
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,160
This is called a napkin not tissue.

239
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,160
Seriously!

240
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,240
What a punk-ass kid.

241
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,839
I wiped it off already.
Why does it still stink?

242
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,200
It must be some radioactive shit.

243
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,599
Damn it!

244
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,319
Are there any stains?

245
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,480
A little.

246
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,559
What the hell did you eat?

247
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,359
What's up with you?

248
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,160
What are you reading?

249
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,680
A Happy Door Plin.

250
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,880
A Happy what?

251
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,359
A Happy Doll Plin.

252
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,880
That says A Happy Dolphin.

253
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
Just put it down.

254
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,759
If you’re going to read this book,
it's better to read something else.

255
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,880
Cinderella has a lot of
easy words for kids.

256
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
That’s for sissies.
Let a daddy’s girl read it.

257
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,799
No way. I like this one.
A Happy Door Plin.

258
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,319
Talk to him.

259
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,720
You talk to him.

260
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,319
Tell him to go away.

261
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,279
You tell him to go away yourself.

262
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,079
Go away.

263
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,160
What? I don’t understand.

264
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,640
How is he supposed to understand you?

265
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,400
You just go far.

266
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,200
Oh, another one.

267
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,319
No. What?

268
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,200
I don’t know what it says.

269
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,200
I don’t want to.

270
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,519
Say hi to your dad.

271
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,279
Foreigners are not scary at all.

272
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,839
Just speak up.
Don’t worry about your grammar.

273
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,480
What are you doing?

274
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,160
What are you doing?

275
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,079
Take it home to re-boil with noodles.

276
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,759
Are you done with that?

277
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,400
May I?

278
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,400
Who taught you this?

279
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,880
Kaya. Kaya taught me.

280
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,359
-You can understand each other?
-Sure, we can.

281
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,839
See. This is eat.

282
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,920
When it’s time to sleep, we do this.

283
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,759
And when you can’t sleep?

284
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,960
We do this.

285
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,119
And if the toilet is clogged?

286
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,359
A clogged toilet?

287
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,359
Stop messing with me.

288
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,920
And how did you ask her
to be your girlfriend?

289
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,839
We rode a motorcycle
and took her to the beach.

290
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,519
We were a couple the moment we woke up.

291
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,559
Oh. Then you can stop now.
Stop right here. Stop.

292
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,799
This is my car.

293
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,240
-This one?
-Yes.

294
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,480
IT'S ME, PRUEK.

295
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,880
Do you plan to sleep here?

296
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,640
Who is it?

297
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,799
None of your business.

298
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,759
I'm asking so you can teach me.

299
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,680
I’m not interested
in your personal affairs.

300
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,400
You don’t have a boyfriend.

301
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,359
I do.

302
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,480
If you really have a boyfriend,

303
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,240
he would have had his friends
beat me up since the first day.

304
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,960
Well he isn’t my boyfriend yet,
but he will be soon.

305
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,599
He is waiting for a romantic moment
to ask me.

306
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,799
I didn’t ask. So why are you telling me?

307
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,559
Later.

308
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:59,359
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT OF TOWN TOGETHER?

309
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,240
So slutty.

310
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,039
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

311
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,079
Too flirty.

312
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,359
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

313
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,799
SHALL WE GO ON A DATE?

314
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,880
No!

315
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,359
My phone dropped and hit my chin.
It accidentally hit send.

316
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,119
So it accidentally typed
that sentence too?

317
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,839
Yes.

318
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,039
Then I will book a table.

319
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,039
Yes.

320
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,039
What?

321
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,079
It’s late. I won’t bother you anymore.

322
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,839
Get some rest, Ms. Pleng.

323
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,200
Wow. He’s even got his own sticker.

324
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,160
Talk about a premium package.

325
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,359
Hey.

326
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,519
How the hell did she get a key?

327
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,519
I made a copy for my girl.

328
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,519
Someone sent you a bomb.

329
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,920
There is no sender’s name.

330
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,800
I will go wash this for you.

331
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,599
Don't you know how to wash it yourself?

332
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
Do you have no hands or feet?

333
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,000
You're always using my boyfriend.

334
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,840
I didn’t even say a word.

335
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,079
Gosh, are you his slave?

336
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,440
You’re lucky she sent it back.

337
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,679
Actually, throwing it away
would have been easier.

338
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,599
She probably sent it for you to resize it.

339
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,719
Being abroad she must have gained weight
eating all that milk and cheese.

340
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,559
Your friend isn’t a stupid cow
even though he looks like one.

341
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,840
Gosh, you didn’t even blink!

342
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,519
I didn’t even flinch.

343
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,559
I will get some pepper and
sprinkle it into your eyes.

344
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,599
I dare you.

345
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,760
You’re so going to get it.

346
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,920
Bring it on!

347
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,400
You picked the wrong path to cross.

348
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,280
Keep going.

349
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,199
Further.

350
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
Further.

351
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,280
What should I do now?

352
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,119
Whatever you want.

353
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,360
Don’t! Let it go babe.

354
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,840
This time I must.

355
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,960
Your wish is my command.

356
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,880
All that left is water.

357
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,480
I got to go wash my ass.

358
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,360
I got this...

359
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,760
for you!

360
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,599
You can wind it too.

361
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,079
I got it custom made
in Chinatown, you know?

362
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
They said Japanese people love it.

363
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,119
No. I asked Joke to buy
some grilled chicken. That’s all.

364
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,039
But...

365
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,719
Goodness.

366
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,880
Do you like it?

367
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,760
Can you send this back to Kaya?

368
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,159
She sent it to you?

369
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,559
You want me to send it back?

370
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,079
Yes.

371
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,440
Do you want anything?

372
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,559
No, thank you.

373
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Thank you.

374
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,800
I want you to give her a message.

375
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,599
Can you both talk it out yourselves?

376
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,519
Facebook, FaceTime, Line, whatever.

377
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,400
I can’t contact her. She blocked me.

378
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,000
I don’t want to.

379
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,880
Why not?
You’re going to send the ring back anyway.

380
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,559
Come on. Just a little help.

381
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,320
I’m not doing this.

382
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,800
That’s one thick forest!

383
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,840
I won't break up with her.

384
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,480
She sent your ring back.

385
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,119
I think it’s game over.

386
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,920
Why are you so stubborn?

387
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,440
I HAVE BEEN AN ASSHOLE TO ALL MY EXES.
I REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD TO YOU.

388
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:01,800
I HAVE BEEN AN ASSHOLE TO ALL MY EXES.
I REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD TO YOU.

389
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,920
Talk about being naughty. Really naughty.

390
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,360
I have a secret in my heart

391
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,400
It’s a secret hiding inside

392
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,159
-LOVE SONG
-but I don’t know how to tell you.

393
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,400
I have a secret in my heart

394
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,679
It’s a secret hiding inside

395
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,800
But I don’t know how to tell you

396
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,280
I love you.

397
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,519
You can’t contact her at all?

398
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,599
No.

399
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,440
What time did you Skype her?

400
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,920
Many hours ago. Many times.

401
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,440
Take out your notebook and jot this down.

402
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,079
-I have to take notes?
-Yes.

403
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:35,559
There are three tenses we use most often,

404
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,880
Present, Past and Future

405
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,239
Present Simple combined
with a subject and a main verb

406
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,239
becomes S+V1.

407
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,719
Present Simple,
you use when the action is happening.

408
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,880
No more!
Can we study conversation like before?

409
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,800
If you don’t want to study
or don’t take notes,

410
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,000
I can’t teach you anymore.

411
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:58,760
Why are you treating me like this?

412
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,519
Your test is in July. You’ve only got
two months. You won’t make it.

413
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,199
You are...

414
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,480
too dumb.

415
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,480
Am I that dumb?

416
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,199
Yes.

417
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,639
Just take your money back.

418
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,639
Yes, Mr. Pruek?

419
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,039
Where are you?

420
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,239
I’m on my way to work.

421
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,920
I want to invite you
to my mother’s birthday party.

422
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,519
Your mom’s birthday?

423
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,519
Yes.

424
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,000
When is it?

425
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,920
This Saturday.

426
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:46,760
Are you free?

427
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
I’m free.

428
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,760
Is that a hairdo or a banana bicycle seat?

429
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,760
You’ve got something on your lip.

430
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,800
Is there something there?

431
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,599
This is my grandfather’s car.

432
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,880
There are only three of them
in all of Thailand.

433
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,599
Do you want to try sitting in it?

434
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,039
Then I will get the key.

435
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,559
I’m back.

436
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,199
I think I should go now.
I am getting sleepy.

437
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,440
Is this Pleng’s?

438
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:46,719
Please stop the car.

439
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:57,320
You forgot your phone.

440
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,519
Thank you.

441
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,719
I’m sorry for making you run.
You are sweating all over.

442
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,320
If I didn’t run to give this back to you,

443
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,679
then who will I talk to tonight?

444
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,519
EVEN THOUGH YOU AREN'T A SINGER,
BUT CAN I ASK TO BE YOUR DEVOTED FAN?

445
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,000
SHALL WE CELEBRATE OUR ONE-DAY
ANNIVERSARY TOMORROW NIGHT?

446
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,840
It's just me.

447
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,760
Why does he seem so sad lately?

448
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,599
Hey. Don’t say that word.
Don’t use any Japanese words.

449
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,239
He'll be hurt when he thinks of Kaya.
We’re all going to be in trouble.

450
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,119
Joke, that sounds sensible.

451
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,719
But this means we need to say hi
to him more often.

452
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,960
No! Hi sounds just like Hai in Japanese.

453
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,480
If you want to say hi
then just say hey instead.

454
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,440
That makes a lot sense!

455
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,840
I have always looked up to you.

456
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:24,159
Hey.

457
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,679
I saw you working hard so I thought

458
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,159
I’d come over with this glass of water...

459
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,159
to say hi.

460
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,039
I’m sorry.

461
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,679
I’m just worried about you.

462
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,800
I didn’t mean to say hi.

463
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:51,719
What is your problem?

464
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,159
I’m dead.

465
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,119
My neck feels weird.

466
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,559
Dude, can you take a look for me?

467
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:11,400
It’s just a scratch.

468
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:27,519
Attention Mechanic Weerayut Kerdkaewngam.

469
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,760
Your teacher is waiting
in front of the statue.

470
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,639
Nice handwriting.

471
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,800
You missed.

472
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:57,719
Do you think this is funny?

473
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,199
Can I be your tutor again?

474
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,119
Do you want to get punched?

475
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,199
If you punch me, I will slap you back.
I really want to help.

476
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,960
Didn’t you say I was too dumb
and two months wasn’t enough?

477
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,159
That’s true.

478
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,760
If you want to speak fluently,
then there’s no time.

479
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,280
But if you just want to pass your test
there is another trick that tutors use.

480
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,880
What’s that?

481
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,880
Memorize the possible questions
and answers.

482
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:47,559
Translate.

483
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,880
Let’s go for it.

484
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,280
-Check.
-Hey!

485
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,039
What do you mean check? It’s my turn.

486
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,719
Then I'll check out what's over there.

487
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,119
I will kick your ass.

488
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,480
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT

489
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:13,800
Everyone. This is Ms. Pleng, my tutor.

490
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,320
The tutor said

491
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,880
I’m a cook and I use gas
to heat your fries.

492
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,639
American cheese is so extravagant.

493
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,159
Okay, let’s eat.

494
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:13,639
She wants some milk.

495
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,559
You sure learn fast.

496
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,239
How are we supposed to know
what the interviewers are going to ask?

497
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,880
I don’t know either. Help me think.
Come up with as much as you can.

498
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,519
Okay!

499
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,320
Why do you want to work in America?

500
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,000
I want to get my wife back.
Is that a problem?

501
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,000
Hey. If you answer like that
nobody will pass you.

502
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,960
You have to say

503
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,960
I want to gain new experiences

504
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,679
and come back to improve
our Thailand branch.

505
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,639
If the hydraulic pump is making sounds...

506
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,800
Stop that. Eed is my mom’s name.

507
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,559
So if the pump starts making
sounds like Kahlua's mom's name,

508
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,760
that means the problem is in
the forward pump. It is too narrow.

509
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,360
If this isn’t because the oil is dry
then the pump is starting to fail.

510
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:02,360
Why is your nickname Kahlua?

511
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,320
He made me drink milk spiked with alcohol.

512
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,719
What the heck?

513
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,760
Hey, tell me.

514
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,000
What is the optimum temperature
for our factory’s boiler?

515
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,199
What temperature?

516
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,000
Well, is your name Curl

517
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,079
because you like to curl your mustache?

518
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,760
He likes to curl his hair...

519
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:18,440
Down there.

520
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,400
When a machine breaks down,
do you replace it or repair it?

521
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,000
I’m a maintenance engineer,
not a repairman.

522
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,559
Replacing would be the last choice.

523
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,320
You’re through. I choose you.

524
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,639
Who would turn down
such a good employee like you?

525
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,559
There you go, kissing ass again.

526
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,400
He wants you to ask him questions
not kiss his ass.

527
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,119
Whoa!

528
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:53,800
Are those hips for real?

529
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:02,960
Hey, show me what you’ve got.

530
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:05,320
If the party isn’t big enough,
I don’t dance.

531
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,679
How about we let Ms. Pleng
come up with a game.

532
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,760
Everyone must say one letter
of the English alphabet A to Z.

533
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,199
You can’t go in order.

534
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,920
So little, only three alphabets?

535
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,800
A to Zed.
We’re all confused with your accent, see?

536
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:36,079
But hold on, whoever loses
must light a firecracker in the ass.

537
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,880
Women are no exception.

538
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,679
Let’s begin.

539
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,159
Are you withdrawing cash?

540
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,039
Are you going for some K-pop dance?

541
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,320
Come on now.

542
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,400
One, two...

543
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,159
Hey! K is mine.

544
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,840
I just said, "D".

545
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,840
It’s your turn.

546
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,119
-What?
-What alphabet?

547
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,840
-What?
-What is it?

548
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,239
One, two...

549
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,320
Hold on.

550
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:31,960
That’s taken.

551
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:33,320
Come on.

552
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
That was the first one.

553
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:43,239
I present to you, a butt crack.

554
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:47,760
Hey, that’s too deep.

555
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,800
Too deep?

556
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,639
Feels like a splinter.

557
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,119
I’m okay.

558
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,559
Are you ready, Kahlua?

559
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:59,960
Day, month, year.

560
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:14,679
Is it a dud?

561
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,840
Man. Let it go.

562
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,800
I did.

563
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,519
Not your hands, dummy. Relax your ass.

564
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,360
Shit.

565
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:42,679
Dude. It freaking smells like BBQ.

566
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,679
God, I probably won’t be able to shit now.

567
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:46,719
It burns all the way up into my asshole.

568
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,440
Are you okay? Are you going to make it?

569
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,920
My stomach hurts.

570
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:00,440
Are you going to die?

571
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,480
What do you mean by nozzle nipples?

572
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:18,960
You, pervert. I will break your shoulders.

573
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:24,079
Wow.

574
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,440
It’s not in here.

575
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,679
You were able to fix it still?

576
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,760
When I first saw it,
I thought it was unrepairable.

577
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,960
I'm a maintenance engineer

578
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,039
so whatever breaks, I can always fix.

579
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:52,320
You better keep your fingers crossed.
Some things are not as easy as you think.

580
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,679
If you are referring to Kaya

581
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,880
I never thought it would be easy.

582
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,760
If she couldn’t speak Thai
then I would learn English.

583
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,920
If English was too hard to learn
then I would learn Japanese.

584
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:19,599
-That went in my eyes.
-Are you okay?

585
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,159
My contacts fell out.

586
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:24,639
Hey. This way. I’m here.

587
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,360
I’m here.

588
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,800
You are extremely nearsighted?

589
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:34,079
Yes.

590
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,679
Do I look like a blind person?

591
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,960
Translate.

592
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,280
I think so means I agree.

593
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,480
Wait. Stop.

594
01:01:55,639 --> 01:01:56,559
Let’s go.

595
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,880
Hey, slow down.

596
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,840
If we go any slower we won’t make it.

597
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,639
Hey, Pleng!

598
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,760
Gosh.

599
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,199
Hey!

600
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,039
You said you wouldn’t laugh.

601
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,440
I couldn’t help it.

602
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:08,440
Shit!

603
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:11,280
If Joke sees me now,
he will lose all respect.

604
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,639
Why are you doing that?

605
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,960
WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
WHY SHOULD WE CHOOSE YOU?

606
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:44,400
AS A MAINTENANCE ENGINEER, I BELIEVE...

607
01:03:48,519 --> 01:03:49,920
I'm a maintenance engineer

608
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,159
so whatever breaks, I can always fix.

609
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:03,039
EVERYTHING CAN BE FIXED
AND MADE TO WORK AGAIN.

610
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:10,519
If English was too hard to learn
then I would learn Japanese.

611
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,079
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS TO FIX

612
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:23,559
I WILL ALWAYS FIND A WAY.

613
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,679
YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE ME.

614
01:04:57,199 --> 01:04:58,800
Before I came to study with you,

615
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,199
we ran into each other before.

616
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,880
Really?

617
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:06,599
Do you remember
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs party?

618
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,840
You were an interpreter.

619
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,679
I remember.

620
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:11,559
That’s when.

621
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:14,280
After that I asked my friend
to find out where you work.

622
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,000
and then I enrolled in your class.

623
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:19,920
So you had no intention
of actually studying?

624
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,800
That's right.

625
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:23,280
I didn't intend to study.

626
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,840
I just wanted to sweep you off your feet.

627
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,679
Are you okay?

628
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:33,760
Here. Let me help.

629
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:36,519
It’s okay.

630
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,639
I dreamed of doing this for a long time.

631
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,440
How romantic of you.

632
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,559
Close your eyes.

633
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,480
Close them.

634
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,119
Close my eyes?

635
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,719
COUNTRY SONG

636
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,400
A love this beautiful

637
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:46,920
All my life

638
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:51,880
I’ve been looking endlessly for

639
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,440
I want you to be by my side like this

640
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:01,280
Tell me you love me again

641
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,079
Let’s stay close together always

642
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:13,000
Pleng, are you happy?

643
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,079
Very happy.

644
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:23,679
So are you a fan of country music?

645
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:27,400
I would rather be
your devoted fan for life.

646
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,800
How lucky of me.

647
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,000
I didn’t know you were this funny.

648
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,440
I’m not trying to be funny.

649
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,239
He's for real.

650
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,840
Mr. Pruek, if you plan to go
to sail your yacht around this time

651
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,880
don’t forget to check the weather.

652
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:52,400
The weather forecast.

653
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,719
The weather forecast, for sure.

654
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,800
If you want to go to

655
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,480
-Maan-nok Island.
-Maan-nok Island?

656
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,920
-Maan-nai Island?
-Maan-nai Island.

657
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,840
Or Samed island.

658
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,960
Samed island, where everybody relaxes.

659
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:07,280
Yes, let me know.

660
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:12,559
All right?

661
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,480
Totally.

662
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,439
Pleng, you're just in time.

663
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,560
Come and try this on.

664
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,159
Why can’t it be me? Why?

665
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:51,399
I think this pair is a bit too small.

666
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:57,039
Then please try this one.

667
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,159
It’s a perfect fit.

668
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,239
Yes, perfect.

669
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,800
You could have called
and asked me for my size.

670
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,760
But then it wouldn’t be a surprise.

671
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,520
It’s a small price to make you happy.

672
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,399
There is so much more I can do for you.

673
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:24,319
Okay.

674
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:34,159
Will it be okay, if I don’t accept this?

675
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:35,319
Why not?

676
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,840
This pair is just like the one that broke.

677
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,840
Yes, it is.

678
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:48,159
But Pruek...

679
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:49,079
Yes?

680
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,199
Can we just go back
to being teacher and student?

681
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,960
Why?

682
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,319
My mom went to see a fortune-teller.

683
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:05,239
She said...

684
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,600
I shouldn’t date someone
who was born in the same month.

685
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,359
It’s really bad luck.

686
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:25,159
Remember?

687
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:27,960
Yes.

688
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,800
Sore feet?

689
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,960
Let me give you a massage.

690
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:39,119
Just relax. No need to be uptight.

691
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,960
It cracked too.

692
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:01,319
Didn’t I answer correctly?
Why did you punch me?

693
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,159
I didn’t get a chance to answer.
What’s wrong with you?

694
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:10,319
I can’t take it anymore!

695
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,720
Come on.

696
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,479
Hold on.

697
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:26,039
Come on.

698
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
Do you feel better?

699
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,279
Much better.

700
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,760
What’s wrong?

701
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,399
I want to break up with my boyfriend.

702
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,840
Damn. She punches hard
like Manny Pacquiao.

703
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Hey. Where are you going?

704
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:53,319
There is a crazy guy
who closed down the coffee shop.

705
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:10,039
Translate.

706
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,960
It means run!

707
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,119
Don’t tell me that he is...

708
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:15,199
Yes, that’s him!

709
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,000
Is that a bouquet of flowers
or a manhole cover?

710
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,199
You are not done yet.
You got to say one last thing.

711
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,760
You will regret it,
if you don’t choose me.

712
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:57,880
Isn't this sentence a bit over the top?
I will get kicked instead of picked.

713
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,920
It’s okay. It fits you.

714
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,359
Have some self-confidence.
It’s your selling point.

715
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,560
Let’s continue, okay?

716
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,640
Almost.

717
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,119
but that is number...

718
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,239
235.

719
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,239
I thought the key word is pressure?

720
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,960
Yes, but what I asked you just now
was pressure as in the force

721
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,359
not as in the stress you feel.

722
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,079
Talk about pressure, here he comes now.

723
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,920
Did he see me?

724
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,520
He didn’t even look over here yet.

725
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:49,680
Just be straight with him.

726
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,720
Breaking his heart would be like
running over a little puppy.

727
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:54,960
Come on. It won’t kill him.

728
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,119
I thought I would surprise you.

729
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:16,239
How are you, Pleng? Feeling better?

730
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,439
Ms. Tui said you were not feeling well.

731
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,840
I’m feeling better now.

732
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:25,399
That’s good. I bought some dinner for us.

733
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,920
Let’s go.

734
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,000
What a mess. My room is such a mess.

735
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:31,960
That’s good. I can help.

736
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:34,560
You are not feeling well.

737
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,600
It’s okay. I...

738
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,960
What’s going on?

739
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,760
Is this the guy?

740
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,520
Who are you?

741
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,800
What?

742
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,039
Come on. Let’s go up.

743
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,039
Excuse me.

744
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:58,239
Who are you?

745
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:02,479
I'm her husband.

746
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:08,479
I...

747
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,760
What is going on?

748
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,239
It hasn't been a month
since we started dating.

749
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,960
Come. Let’s go.

750
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,760
How could you say
that you were my husband?

751
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:16,640
I was trying to help.

752
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,319
I don’t know if I should thank you or not.

753
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:23,399
And what did you whisper in his ear?
He looked totally shocked.

754
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,439
I told him...

755
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:29,279
I knocked you up.

756
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,760
What!

757
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:32,279
You made me seem slutty!

758
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,920
What were you thinking?

759
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:36,960
Do you even care?

760
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,359
That’s slutty! So slutty!

761
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,720
I’m leaving.

762
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,399
Hey! Where are you going?
Why don’t you use the elevator?

763
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,319
If he is still freaking out down there
then our plan will be exposed.

764
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:00,039
Bye.

765
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:53,520
-Hello. What’s up?
-Hello. Where are you?

766
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:56,159
I’m here already, buying coffee.

767
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,079
Let’s just go. There is no time.

768
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,239
We will make it.
Taking my bike only takes a second.

769
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,039
What are you wearing?

770
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,119
I told you to dress up nice.

771
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:29,720
I did. Here.

772
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,600
Is this what you are planning to wear?

773
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:35,720
Yes.

774
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,000
You told me to wear something
I’d wear to a wedding party.

775
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,399
This is what I wear to every party.

776
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,840
Hey! Wait.

777
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,560
Don’t tell me you’ve never
bought a dress shirt.

778
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:53,960
The paper is still there.

779
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:10,439
Why didn’t you say something?

780
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:15,800
When you’re about to get into a fight,
you aren’t afraid.

781
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,279
I’m a player not a fighter.

782
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,800
Whatever you are,
if you don’t start talking,

783
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,239
you will never learn to speak.

784
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,239
No excuses. I got you here already.

785
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:28,159
Today you have to talk
to at least three foreigners.

786
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:29,319
Understand?

787
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,960
How could I?
They speak so fast like they are rapping.

788
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,880
Spot the key words.

789
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,479
See you.

790
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:53,960
Look at that. How lame.

791
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,159
We can speak Thai just fine.
What was up with that apology?

792
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,119
Seriously, he’s a maintenance engineer.
Dumbass!

793
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:00,560
Yes, I know.

794
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:52,640
Your mom has nice shoulders.

795
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:09,520
Are you sure you are excited?

796
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:22,399
Who are you?

797
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,239
Whose cute kid is that?

798
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,520
Wow. He really only dances at big parties.

799
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,880
I want to thank everyone who honored me
by coming here tonight.

800
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,880
And I want to also thank
our beautiful interpreter, Ms. Pleng.

801
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,840
Thank you.

802
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,680
-Okay. See you next time. Bye.
-See you

803
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,000
Do you want to take off first?

804
01:24:26,439 --> 01:24:27,720
It’s okay. I can wait.

805
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,680
Why don’t you put them on?

806
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,560
It broke. It wasn’t fixed right.

807
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:35,560
Hold them for me please.

808
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,760
Thanks.

809
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:24,319
Did you understand what they said?
Or are you just clapping along?

810
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:26,239
I understood.

811
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,039
Good evening.

812
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:31,279
Wow.

813
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,079
I can translate the whole song.

814
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,840
Tonight...

815
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,920
Something about two.

816
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,039
Forget means we can’t remember.

817
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:01,560
Open your eyes means have a look.

818
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,760
That’s correct. Have some confidence.

819
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:08,119
Your...

820
01:26:12,279 --> 01:26:13,319
dress is beautiful.

821
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:14,479
Thank you.

822
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:19,159
It sounded like “Do Do Look Look”.
I don’t know.

823
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:21,760
No. Listen carefully.

824
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:31,720
Do you want me to walk you home?

825
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,439
I have a mean dog at home.

826
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:44,159
Don’t help me on this one.

827
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:50,159
I think I need help.

828
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,039
I will always be yours. I promise.

829
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:13,399
Tonight, can I walk you home?

830
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,680
Morning.

831
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,479
Before we go back to reality...

832
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,239
where you go your own way.

833
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:52,039
Can you tell me
if you feel the same way too?

834
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:16,000
I fixed it.

835
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:52,760
Please tell me how you feel

836
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:01,920
’Cause deep inside I know it’s real

837
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:11,359
I promise I will forever be yours.

838
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,079
I got to go.

839
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,039
Darling open up to me.

840
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:24,399
Let me walk you home.

841
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,520
Even if you will never be mine.

842
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:38,600
I’m in love with you tonight.

843
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:56,960
Why are you home so late?

844
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,119
You have that test tomorrow.

845
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:01,680
Are you crazy? My test is next month.

846
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,479
Really?

847
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,520
Because I helped set up the room today.

848
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,800
Shit! June isn’t the seventh month?

849
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:17,760
Seventh month is correct.
The talking dictionary is wrong for sure.

850
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:19,399
You’re right.

851
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,840
What the hell!

852
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:22,840
Everyone on this planet uses one.
I’m just stupid!

853
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,640
Stop being such an ass kisser.

854
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,319
I’m always to blame.

855
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:41,960
Hello, Pleng.

856
01:30:49,159 --> 01:30:50,119
Calm down.

857
01:30:58,479 --> 01:30:59,960
Okay. You can come over.

858
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:17,800
I’m sorry.

859
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,159
It’s my fault for being dumb.

860
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:28,640
You remembered all of this?

861
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:30,199
Yes.

862
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,680
Nothing else to fix, right?

863
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,520
Pleng.

864
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,039
Go sit on the other side.

865
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,159
I don’t want Kaya to see you
and misunderstand.

866
01:34:58,199 --> 01:34:59,199
What did she say?

867
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,159
She still wants you to go.

868
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,760
That’s all.

869
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:16,640
I heard she said...

870
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:31,520
Do you like me?

871
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:40,680
Do you still want to take your test?

872
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,800
I have my heart set on it.

873
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:55,359
I have to.

874
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:03,079
I know.

875
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,119
How can a tutor like me

876
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,359
get involved with a student?

877
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,279
She said she wants the ring back.

878
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,319
Today I will go first.

879
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:03,600
I admit I'm hurt...

880
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,520
but being straight forward
like this helps.

881
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,840
There is something I want to clear up.

882
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:12,600
I am not pregnant.

883
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:18,760
What made you think

884
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,960
that I think you are pregnant?

885
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:29,239
That day at my condo...

886
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,920
that guy whispered that to you.

887
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,520
He actually said...

888
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:45,399
Leave you alone.

889
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,800
You are his girl.

890
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,640
He always talks nonsense.

891
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,520
Do you remember my story
about the mole and destiny?

892
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:15,039
I do.

893
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:16,600
My mole

894
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,880
will have to set up
a new date with destiny.

895
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,119
Did that take a long time to come up with?

896
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,039
But I think you may
have found your destiny.

897
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,359
HEARTBREAK SONG

898
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:52,520
KAYA SAID TO MEMORIZE THE NAME
OF THE JAPANESE FOUNDER

899
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:14,439
Noda Toichi.

900
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:00,319
Shit. Is it something to do
with people or machinery?

901
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,199
You are not done yet.
You got to say one last thing.

902
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:18,079
You will regret it if you don’t choose me.

903
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,600
You will regret it if you don’t choose me.

904
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,560
Wait!

905
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:22,680
What?

906
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:26,239
It's for you.

907
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,239
Miss.

908
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,880
Somebody left this for you.

909
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,640
Pleng, the interview result is out.

910
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,640
I didn’t make it.

911
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,199
I really wanted to pass my interview
to make you proud.

912
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:06,239
What is name of our company’s founder?

913
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:09,920
Doraemon.

914
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,399
You know I don’t know
how to talk nicely to anyone.

915
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:17,640
Well...

916
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,319
Just have a listen.

917
01:45:22,199 --> 01:45:24,560
I don’t love her you know.

918
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,760
I just wanted to treat a girl right.

919
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,840
for once.

920
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,640
That’s all.

921
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:36,359
And she just happened to
walk into my life at that moment.

922
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:40,279
Damn! I am so freaking dumb.

923
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,880
That gear ring,
I flushed it down the toilet already.

924
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,199
I’m sorry for not telling you in person.

925
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:52,439
Anyway...

926
01:45:55,239 --> 01:45:56,359
I am such an asshole.

927
01:46:34,119 --> 01:46:35,920
I wanted to ask you...

928
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:41,880
if I want to tell Kaya that
I don’t want to go see her anymore,

929
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:45,319
how do I say that in English?

930
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,119
If that’s all you wanted to ask,
you could have just called.

931
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:52,920
Pleng.

932
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,359
I can

933
01:46:56,359 --> 01:46:58,600
break up with a girl through a phone call.

934
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,199
But I cannot tell a girl
that I like her through the phone.

935
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:10,840
I want to see your face
when I tell you that I like you.

936
01:47:14,359 --> 01:47:15,239
So...

937
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:18,239
Do you

938
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,720
feel

939
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,560
the same way?

940
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:29,840
Why are you crying? What does that mean?

941
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:33,319
Don’t cry.

942
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:36,880
How far have you listened to?

943
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,800
As a maintenance engineer,

944
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:01,760
I believe everything can be fixed
and made to work again.

945
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,159
No matter how hard it is to fix

946
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,439
I will always find a way.

947
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,079
I will be very sad if you don’t choose me.

948
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,720
Translate please.

949
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:33,359
Come here.

950
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:34,840
Come here.

951
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:58,359
DANCE SONG

952
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:32,279
The State of O-ha-o.
I used to live in O-ha-o.

953
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:33,720
Okay. A new state.

954
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:35,159
They have their own anthem too.

955
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:36,520
Never heard of this O-ha-o state.

956
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,720
Have they got a state song too?

957
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,840
What does it sound like?

958
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:46,920
Just like that. Can you sing?

959
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,960
Yes, of course.

960
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,279
Never heard this type of accent before!

961
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:59,359
Okay, let’s eat. She wants some milk.

962
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:04,319
Okay, let’s eat. She wants some milk.

963
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:13,399
Okay, let’s eat. She wants some milk.
