00:08.040 --> 00:11.040

00:11.170 --> 00:12.670

00:31.060 --> 00:34.330
Sure it's amazing being Ladybug,
I've got powers, kwamis...

00:34.560 --> 00:36.260
But what if I could
prevent Shadow Moth

00:36.370 --> 00:38.700
from creating villains
in the first place? Ha!

00:38.800 --> 00:41.270
He'd be ruined!
Have you noticed he seems

00:41.400 --> 00:43.440
to re-akumatise people
much more often

00:43.570 --> 00:44.710
these days?
Do you know why?

00:45.370 --> 00:47.270
Because he gets to know them
and figures out

00:47.410 --> 00:49.110
how to manipulate them better!

00:49.210 --> 00:51.010
You're right! I was akumatised

00:51.080 --> 00:52.680
because I was obsessed with you!

00:52.750 --> 00:55.280
You were hiding something
and it drove me crazy.

00:55.380 --> 00:57.580
- But I had to keep it a secret!
- I know, girl.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.390
But now that I know the truth,
I've got your back!

01:00.460 --> 01:04.190
What? Mr Pigeon has already
been akumatised 71 times?

01:04.590 --> 01:07.360
He's just a harmless guy trying
to take care of pigeons.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.260
It's so not fair!

01:08.560 --> 01:10.060
I promised him I'd keep him

01:10.170 --> 01:11.470
safe from Shadow Moth,

01:11.730 --> 01:13.530
but I just can't figure it out.
Argh!

01:13.600 --> 01:15.700
I don't understand a thing
in this spell book!

01:15.770 --> 01:18.110
Master Fu didn't understand
much in it either,

01:18.670 --> 01:21.240
but he was able to do it,
with proper time and rest!

01:21.740 --> 01:24.310
Hold that thought, Wayzz!
I think this is it!

01:24.480 --> 01:26.550
- (Explosion)
- Aaah!

01:26.650 --> 01:28.950
- Ugh!
- Ugh...

01:29.090 --> 01:31.290
I was sure "spicy little rock"
would be pepper.

01:31.620 --> 01:34.290
Alya, help us
reason with her, please?

01:34.390 --> 01:37.090
Marinette, how long
have you been working on this?

01:37.190 --> 01:39.460
I dunno. Maybe ten days.
Now we're on spring break,

01:39.560 --> 01:42.360
I finally have time
to put my whole heart into it!

01:43.130 --> 01:45.100
When was the last time
you worked on a design?

01:45.200 --> 01:48.140
I do loads of designing! Look!
I designed a security system

01:48.270 --> 01:50.270
so nobody can enter my room
when I'm not in,

01:50.370 --> 01:53.410
and if I put this on,
I can hear what's going on,

01:53.480 --> 01:55.180
even when I'm out of the room!

01:55.310 --> 01:56.310
I'll have to break it to you.

01:56.410 --> 01:57.950
I'm the only one who can.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.510
This is totally insane!

01:59.650 --> 02:01.480
Girl, trust your BFF!

02:01.580 --> 02:04.490
When I'm researching something
obsessively,

02:04.620 --> 02:06.620
that's when my mind
can get really blocked.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.460
You know what you need most
right now? A break!

02:10.360 --> 02:12.560
No way! No breaks until I find
out how to keep Shadow Moth

02:12.660 --> 02:14.230
from re-akumatising people!

02:14.630 --> 02:15.530
Aaah!

02:16.830 --> 02:19.530
Tom, this science experiment
is starting to worry me.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.500
But you know that she asked us
not to bother her.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.370
I know you want to stop
Shadow Moth.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.510
But my grandmother says,

02:28.640 --> 02:30.610
"Life is not waiting
for the storm to pass,

02:30.680 --> 02:32.480
it's learning
to dance in the rain.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.720
Dance? How can I dance when
he's going after those I love?

02:40.590 --> 02:42.190
(Trixx whimpers)

02:44.230 --> 02:46.660
I bet you had no idea
Adrien and Kagami

02:46.730 --> 02:48.660
aren't seeing each other
any more.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.360
What? Are you serious?

02:50.700 --> 02:52.500
I have to go and console Kagami!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.770
The poor thing!
She must be devastated!

02:55.370 --> 02:58.210
Hang on. Don't you mean you have
to go and console Adrien?

02:58.340 --> 02:59.770
Why would I console Adrien?

03:00.110 --> 03:01.540
The house-and-three-kids

03:01.640 --> 03:04.240
and a hamster-named-whatever?
Ring a bell?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.110
There's no way
we can be together!

03:06.220 --> 03:10.550
I can't even talk to him!
Besides, I have... no more...

03:10.650 --> 03:12.350
feelings for Adrien!

03:12.590 --> 03:14.390
I don't love him any more.
There!

03:14.860 --> 03:16.220
And Kagami is perfect for him!

03:16.360 --> 03:18.030
She has no problem
talking to him,

03:18.090 --> 03:19.360
and they fence together.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.700
Poor girl.
She must be so upset!

03:22.400 --> 03:25.070
This is a joke, right?
Or maybe all the days

03:25.170 --> 03:26.600
locked in your room
breathing fumes

03:26.700 --> 03:28.240
must have gone to your brain.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.500
Alya, Kagami doesn't have

03:29.570 --> 03:31.610
any friends in Paris besides me.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.410
I have to go and console her.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.110
Fine! Go console Kagami
if you want to.

03:36.210 --> 03:40.280
As long as you're getting
some fresh air, it's all good.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.720
And I'll go through the notes,
and see if I can

03:42.790 --> 03:45.490
- make any sense out of it.
- Oh, you would do that?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.920
You're not alone any more.
I've got your back, remember?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.220
Thanks, Alya.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.930
Forgetting something?

03:52.030 --> 03:53.390
Oops! Spots off!

03:56.600 --> 03:58.470
Aren't you still
forgetting something?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.600
Why? No! Of course! My pool bag!

04:02.140 --> 04:03.400
Uh, Marinette...

04:05.210 --> 04:06.710
Oh! My pyjamas!

04:07.640 --> 04:11.110
Ah, sweetie! That project
of yours is finally done?

04:11.410 --> 04:12.980
- Yes! I mean, no!
- (Stomach rumbles)

04:13.080 --> 04:15.580
But Alya is helping me,
so I'll take a break!

04:16.220 --> 04:18.490
Maybe you should take something
to eat on the road.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.650
Thanks, Dad!

04:25.760 --> 04:28.300
Now, let's go cheer up Kagami!

04:28.400 --> 04:30.600
(Phone rings)

04:30.700 --> 04:32.470
- Hello?
-<i> Kagami! Where are you?</i>

04:32.600 --> 04:34.300
- In the Tuileries.
-<i> Perfect!</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.170
<i> Don't move. I'm on my way!</i>

04:36.270 --> 04:38.270
- Now is not a good time --
<i> - I'll always be</i>

04:38.370 --> 04:39.540
<i> there for you, Kagami!</i>

04:41.580 --> 04:43.310
Kagami!

04:43.450 --> 04:45.850
Oh! Would you like
a brioche, Mrs Tsurugi?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.320
Mother, you remember Marinette?

04:49.420 --> 04:54.450
Yes. I distinctly remember
your very<i> unique</i> friend.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.690
I'll bring her back in an hour!
Try the ones with fresh fruit.

04:58.190 --> 05:01.190
It's one of my dad's
new recipes! They're delish!

05:01.330 --> 05:03.030
- Mmm.
- Adrien is at the pool,

05:03.130 --> 05:05.030
getting ready to shoot
his next ad!

05:05.130 --> 05:06.470
It's the perfect place
to make up!

05:06.570 --> 05:08.300
You know his schedule by heart?

05:08.400 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, for the next 3 years,
duh! But who cares?

05:11.140 --> 05:14.310
'Cause today's the day that I'm
getting you two back together!

05:15.310 --> 05:17.210
I don't want
to get back with Adrien.

05:17.310 --> 05:19.010
I decided to break up and --

05:19.110 --> 05:23.180
Of course you did!
You felt unworthy of him,

05:23.290 --> 05:25.050
but you're wrong!
You're strong,

05:25.150 --> 05:26.520
you're both perfect!

05:26.620 --> 05:28.690
- Marinette!
- You're meant for each other!

05:28.790 --> 05:31.360
I get it.
It's out of sight, out of mind.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.330
But when
you lay eyes on him again,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.030
you'll both blush and stutter,
talk about big houses,

05:36.130 --> 05:38.530
three kids and a hamster
and it'll all be wonderful!

05:38.630 --> 05:41.070
- (Phone rings)
- Sorry. Hello?

05:41.170 --> 05:44.440
I don't want to be with Adrien
any more. He let me down.

05:46.110 --> 05:49.110
Just trust me! I can prove
that he's worthy of you!

05:52.450 --> 05:54.380
Of course! Makes sense!
They've closed the pool

05:54.480 --> 05:56.550
to rehearse in private!

05:56.650 --> 05:59.190
- Perfect, let's go!
- Absolutely, let's go...

05:59.290 --> 06:01.760
inside,
by distracting the bodyguard.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.360
I'll have to break it to you,
'cause only I can.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.500
This is totally insane!

06:09.570 --> 06:13.100
Jumping into freezing water
when we could be peacefully

06:13.200 --> 06:15.800
eating cheese? Oh!

06:17.140 --> 06:19.570
I take back everything I said!
Everything is great!

06:19.680 --> 06:21.540
(Munches)

06:21.610 --> 06:24.440
Just great. Mmm! Mmm!

06:26.280 --> 06:27.750
OK, now picture it, Gabe.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.180
Adrien is on top
of the Eiffel tower,

06:30.250 --> 06:33.390
bathed in sunlight.
He jumps off. Slow motion.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.660
Doves flutter all around him
as if his fall would never end.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.060
The catchphrase,
"Dive into romantic, magical,

06:40.130 --> 06:42.600
eternal Paris!"
And then splash,

06:42.700 --> 06:45.230
right into a glass
of sparkling golden juice!

06:45.300 --> 06:49.200
Packshot! "Splash"
the new fragrance by Gabriel!

06:49.610 --> 06:51.710
Those birds are not doves.
They're pigeons.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.810
(Laughs)
Not at all! They're doves!

06:55.310 --> 06:57.640
- My birds aren't do --
- I know they're pigeons.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.510
But it is in our interests

06:59.620 --> 07:01.280
if Agreste believes
they're doves!

07:01.420 --> 07:03.580
Mine, because he's paying me
a lot of money,

07:03.650 --> 07:06.620
and yours because I can convince
the mayor to create a space

07:06.760 --> 07:09.490
specifically dedicated
to pigeons in Paris.

07:09.590 --> 07:14.130
So, for today,
your pigeons are doves. Got it?

07:16.700 --> 07:19.300
OK, everybody, places!

07:20.440 --> 07:21.300
Action!

07:22.370 --> 07:23.600
(Blows pigeon caller)

07:32.550 --> 07:35.050
<i> Something is missing.</i>

07:38.350 --> 07:40.220
(Giggles)

07:41.190 --> 07:43.860
Adrien's at the pool! There!

07:51.000 --> 07:53.230
<i> We've got "Magical Paris",</i>
<i> and "Eternal Paris"</i>

07:53.340 --> 07:55.470
<i> but we're missing</i>
<i> "Romantic Paris."</i>

07:56.040 --> 07:58.310
<i> A red rose!</i>
<i> I want one of these doves</i>

07:58.410 --> 08:00.310
<i> to bring a rose to my son.</i>

08:01.010 --> 08:03.210
<i>He'll take it between his teeth,</i>
<i> before he enters the water.</i>

08:03.280 --> 08:04.310
<i> That will be perfect.</i>

08:09.490 --> 08:12.690
You can count on Edgar!
No animal's more obedient

08:12.750 --> 08:14.350
than this sweet little pigeon!

08:14.420 --> 08:15.890
Dove! They're doves!

08:15.990 --> 08:18.090
Hang on.
I'm allergic to pigeons.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.130
Nothing will happen!
They're doves!

08:20.260 --> 08:22.330
<i> I'll give you 30 minutes</i>
<i> to set this all up.</i>

08:23.100 --> 08:26.230
You heard the man, Ramier.
You better not let me down!

08:27.270 --> 08:29.000
And now, time for camouflage!

08:31.070 --> 08:32.840
Do you always
carry this with you?

08:33.110 --> 08:35.140
Of course, I have to be rea --
I mean,<i> you</i>

08:35.240 --> 08:36.980
have to be ready
for any opportunity

08:37.080 --> 08:38.950
whenever you run into Adrien!

08:39.050 --> 08:41.920
Everything folds up neatly,
even this fancy ball gown!

08:41.980 --> 08:43.920
You'll be needing it
when you get back together!

08:44.020 --> 08:45.990
Here are the swimsuits!
No time to lose!

08:51.430 --> 08:54.060
I bet you're starting
to fall in love with him again!

08:54.130 --> 08:57.130
- No.
- You've not seen him in action.

08:59.070 --> 08:59.800
Action!

09:05.310 --> 09:08.380
- Atchoo! Aaah!
- (Splash)

09:08.480 --> 09:10.280
Your pigeon
isn't up for the job!

09:10.350 --> 09:12.150
Why bring back the rose?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.810
The sneeze frightened him!

09:14.080 --> 09:16.220
I told you, I'm allergic
to pigeons! Atchoo!

09:16.550 --> 09:18.320
Did you see how handsome he is?

09:18.420 --> 09:22.460
Did you feel your heart
beat faster? Get the shivers?

09:22.520 --> 09:25.030
I felt sorry
for that poor pigeon tamer.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.390
You haven't looked
into each other's eyes yet!

09:27.500 --> 09:29.460
- Oh! I've got an idea!
- (Groans)

09:30.000 --> 09:32.530
Here,
for your allergy to the doves!

09:38.540 --> 09:41.170
KAGAMI: What are you doing?
Put me down right now!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.340
I'm helping your eyes meet!

09:44.350 --> 09:46.750
He's looking at you!
Look at him! Look at him!

09:53.190 --> 09:55.760
This cannot be happening!
How complicated is it

09:55.860 --> 09:58.120
to deliver a rose in mid-flight
to a model?

09:58.190 --> 09:59.890
It's all my fault.
I thought I saw

10:00.000 --> 10:01.360
one of my friends from school!

10:03.170 --> 10:05.370
Well, I don't see anyone,
except a stupid bird

10:05.470 --> 10:08.200
that's incapable of doing
what it's been asked to do

10:08.300 --> 10:10.400
and that's gonna get banned
from all of Paris

10:10.540 --> 10:13.540
if it continues
to ruin my rehearsals!

10:15.080 --> 10:18.240
No, Marinette, I didn't feel
anything, except shame,

10:18.350 --> 10:19.710
for me, for Adrien

10:19.850 --> 10:22.020
and for this embarrassing
situation!

10:22.120 --> 10:25.250
- I'm leaving!
- You were too far apart!

10:25.350 --> 10:28.690
It's when you're close together
that you really feel it!

10:28.760 --> 10:29.520
I've got an idea!

10:38.000 --> 10:40.970
<i> - Are you ready?</i>
- Of course! Grr!

10:41.070 --> 10:42.940
Remember, Edgar,
if Mr Roth is happy,

10:43.070 --> 10:44.740
he'll speak to the mayor

10:44.840 --> 10:47.910
and pigeons will live in Paris
happily ever after!

10:48.910 --> 10:49.480
Action!

10:51.880 --> 10:54.250
Marinette! Stop it!
This is completely crazy!

10:54.380 --> 10:57.220
Love is crazy, so stop
thinking so much and dive in!

10:58.350 --> 11:00.250
- Aaah!
- Marinette?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.290
Edgar!

11:12.030 --> 11:13.900
Marinette,
what are you doing here?

11:14.000 --> 11:17.300
Who, me? I just came here to do
a few laps and wind you up!

11:17.410 --> 11:19.410
I mean, unwind! How about you?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.440
We're in rehearsal
for a commercial.

11:21.540 --> 11:24.110
- The pool was closed --
- Closed? Oh!

11:24.210 --> 11:26.280
That's why there was
no one at the desk!

11:26.380 --> 11:29.050
Oh, boy, I wouldn't want
to kiss you, I mean keep you,

11:29.120 --> 11:31.280
keep you from your job.
So I'll be on my way!

11:31.390 --> 11:34.120
Ha, ha! Aaah!

11:36.790 --> 11:38.320
<i> This is a complete failure.</i>

11:38.430 --> 11:40.160
It's not my fault!
It's his fault!

11:40.300 --> 11:43.100
How dare you?
Edgar is my best friend,

11:43.200 --> 11:46.000
the most intelligent
and loyal pigeon there ever was!

11:46.100 --> 11:48.800
<i> - So it is a pigeon.</i>
- What? This is a pigeon?

11:48.900 --> 11:51.070
How dare you cheat me
out of the real thing?

11:51.140 --> 11:53.940
So sorry. I'll find
a replacement immediately!

11:54.010 --> 11:57.180
- I know a good shark tamer!
-<i> Do not disappoint me again.</i>

11:58.310 --> 12:00.350
This commercial
is turning into a fiasco,

12:00.480 --> 12:01.920
but maybe we can salvage

12:01.980 --> 12:04.350
something beneficial from it,
my love.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.490
You! Get out of my pool!
You're fired!

12:11.790 --> 12:13.830
But how about the mayor?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.230
I'll tell the mayor
to ban those flying rats

12:16.330 --> 12:19.370
and tamers like you,
now and forever! Get out!

12:20.170 --> 12:23.240
- Mr Ramier...
- I failed.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.810
I sense that this time
Mr Ramier's distress

12:29.880 --> 12:31.480
has reached new depths!

12:35.950 --> 12:40.820
Fly, my lovely akuma
and evilise his unhinged heart.

12:46.230 --> 12:50.100
(Fans shouting for Adrien)

12:53.840 --> 12:56.870
Mr Pigeon, I am Shadow Moth.

12:56.970 --> 13:00.170
Since humans and pigeons cannot
live together in harmony...

13:00.240 --> 13:04.410
I will turn every human
into a pigeon!

13:08.880 --> 13:10.220
(Cooes)

13:10.320 --> 13:13.020
What would Paris be
without its pigeons

13:13.090 --> 13:14.920
and without Mr Pigeon!

13:15.020 --> 13:18.320
From now on, everyone will have
to accept us, my friends,

13:18.390 --> 13:20.860
because everyone
will be just like us!

13:26.370 --> 13:28.100
Kagami, please!
Just one last try!

13:28.200 --> 13:29.600
Now I know what I got wrong!

13:29.740 --> 13:31.370
I haven't gone
far back enough in time!

13:31.470 --> 13:33.910
Let's recreate the moment
you first fell in love!

13:34.010 --> 13:36.210
Marinette, I'm going to tell
you, once and for all --

13:38.080 --> 13:39.210
Kagami?

13:42.550 --> 13:43.480
Adrien!

13:49.990 --> 13:52.160
And we were having
such a pleasant time.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.490
Tikki, spots on!

13:57.200 --> 13:58.000
Atchoo!

14:00.740 --> 14:02.040
PLAGG AND LADYBIRD: Adrien!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.170
This is not the time
to get trapped!

14:07.840 --> 14:10.940
Cat Noir! I won't make it
through this without you!

14:11.080 --> 14:13.680
You'll have to.
Cat Noir has been feathered.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.920
Lucky charm!

14:22.860 --> 14:25.490
A hand drill? I don't think
you'll get out of here

14:25.630 --> 14:27.030
with such a tiny hole.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.670
Who said anything
about getting out?

14:42.180 --> 14:44.980
Of course! Just like
with every other investigation,

14:45.110 --> 14:46.610
the answer was
right under my nose

14:46.720 --> 14:48.180
since the very beginning!

14:51.020 --> 14:54.120
This is not normal.
No, it isn't. We'll never know!

14:54.190 --> 14:56.320
<i> Mr Pigeon is back</i>
<i> for the 72nd time,</i>

14:56.420 --> 14:58.160
<i> and now</i>
<i> he's transforming Parisians --</i>

15:00.630 --> 15:02.360
- Ladybug!
- I'm stuck at the pool.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.130
<i> - Shall I get you out?</i>
- No, not you.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.330
It's too dangerous
to be out in Paris.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.500
Cat Noir's
been transformed into a pigeon.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.000
<i> - How can I help?</i>
- I need Ladybug and Cat Noir

15:11.110 --> 15:13.670
- to lure Mr Pigeon back here.
-<i> Got it.</i>

15:17.980 --> 15:19.580
Ladybug needs us.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.550
Trixx, let's pounce!

15:39.630 --> 15:40.600
Mirage!

15:45.010 --> 15:47.840
- Illusions are on their way!
-<i> Thanks, Rena Rouge.</i>

15:48.540 --> 15:50.540
This way, Mr Mayor.
Hurry. Hurry!

15:50.950 --> 15:54.710
No need for permission to turn
Paris into a pigeon paradise

15:54.820 --> 15:56.750
when the mayor himself
is a pigeon!

15:56.890 --> 15:59.450
Don't forget that there are
other evil animals in Paris,

15:59.550 --> 16:01.750
ready to put a stop
to your power.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.890
Ladybug! Cat Noir!
Give yourselves up,

16:05.030 --> 16:07.560
or else I'll spread my wings
even farther.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.560
So far... that the entire world
will become pigeons!

16:15.770 --> 16:18.600
If I were you, I'd transform
people into kittens.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.510
Everyone likes kittens better!

16:20.580 --> 16:23.040
Or into ladybugs!
At least they bring good luck!

16:23.140 --> 16:24.780
I couldn't have said it better!

16:24.910 --> 16:26.880
- Nice work, Rena!
- Oh, yes!

16:26.980 --> 16:30.780
Ladybugs make an excellent
snack... for pigeons!

16:30.920 --> 16:33.590
Sure, but you gotta
catch them first!

16:36.890 --> 16:38.590
Careful!
If they touch the illusions,

16:38.690 --> 16:40.930
- they'll disappear!
- Don't worry!

16:41.030 --> 16:43.930
- Plagg, you're up!
- Ugh, I hate water and pigeons,

16:44.070 --> 16:46.830
and that Cat Noir isn't here
to do this instead of me!

16:56.610 --> 16:58.580
(Cooing) Ha, ha, ha!

16:58.650 --> 17:01.080
Jewels are forbidden
in the pool, Ladybug!

17:01.150 --> 17:02.020
It's time, Rena!

17:03.650 --> 17:06.320
I'm afraid this time
we don't have a choice, Milady.

17:06.450 --> 17:08.650
It's time to throw in the towel,
Kittycat!

17:15.060 --> 17:16.960
- Finally!
- Now!

17:17.430 --> 17:18.870
Take them if you can!

17:21.640 --> 17:24.500
Pigeons might not like water,
but I do!

17:32.810 --> 17:33.680
No!

17:35.480 --> 17:37.180
No!

17:38.690 --> 17:40.620
My bird call!

17:47.700 --> 17:48.830
There you go!

17:54.470 --> 17:56.640
No more evil-doing for you,
little akuma!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.540
Time to de-evilise.

18:06.150 --> 18:06.980
Gotcha!

18:08.450 --> 18:09.980
Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:11.020 --> 18:12.690
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:17.130 --> 18:17.860
Huh?

18:20.530 --> 18:22.860
Have fun with your little
magic tricks, Ladybug.

18:23.670 --> 18:28.030
One day I will crush you
and that won't be an illusion!

18:30.970 --> 18:35.740
Happy to see you again, Adrien.
So, still allergic to pigeons?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.180
Atchoo! Just as always, Plagg!

18:41.580 --> 18:45.690
Oh, no... I was the victim
of Shadow Moth again, wasn't I?

18:45.790 --> 18:48.650
I wish I could tell you it would
be the last time, Mr Ramier,

18:48.720 --> 18:50.660
but that's a miracle
I cannot perform.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.060
- Don't be so sure!
- Rena Rouge?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.530
You've been so focused
on being a guardian

18:55.630 --> 18:57.660
that you've forgotten
you're Ladybug!

18:57.730 --> 18:59.170
You found something
in the spellbook?

18:59.730 --> 19:02.700
No! There was nothing to find!
What if the rules

19:02.800 --> 19:04.700
are not a finite set
of existing rules,

19:04.810 --> 19:07.540
but only what the guardians
had learned so far?

19:08.710 --> 19:12.110
Which means... If my power
is the power of creation...

19:12.210 --> 19:14.410
Yes! Create! Your only limits

19:14.550 --> 19:16.050
are the ones
you put on yourself!

19:42.610 --> 19:44.940
Wow! What happened to your suit?

19:45.050 --> 19:46.580
And what's that?

19:46.850 --> 19:49.450
It's a... magical charm!

19:50.920 --> 19:53.990
Mr Ramier,
always keep this with you.

19:54.090 --> 19:56.790
It will protect you
from negative emotions.

19:56.890 --> 20:01.490
Does this mean that Shadow Moth
can't akumatise me any more?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.500
Oh! Do you hear that,
my friends?

20:03.630 --> 20:06.170
We'll never be
Paris's villains again!

20:07.140 --> 20:08.130
- Pound it!
- Pound it!

20:08.640 --> 20:11.600
That girl is truly miraculous.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.810
You know, that whole
heart-beating, tingling,

20:19.910 --> 20:22.950
knees trembling thing?
I felt all that...

20:23.820 --> 20:26.790
from you. You're the one
blushing and stuttering

20:26.890 --> 20:29.390
and saying silly things
every time you see Adrien.

20:29.490 --> 20:32.530
You're the one
who knows his schedule by heart.

20:32.660 --> 20:35.160
You're right, Marinette.
Adrien is perfect.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.860
He's perfect for you.

20:37.630 --> 20:41.470
I... but... Kagami!

20:48.440 --> 20:50.140
Wow, you've had it
all this time?

20:54.180 --> 20:57.050
Oh, yeah, it's a sorry sight.
I mean, sorry, you're right!

20:57.190 --> 21:00.320
This is your embrace, I mean,
umbrella, you let me kiss...

21:00.420 --> 21:04.790
keep, er, keep! I can finally
gaze... I mean give it back!

21:05.630 --> 21:07.890
You're gonna need it
to get through all this.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.600
That's true.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.570
Or maybe we could drop you off?

21:20.610 --> 21:23.040
Oh! (Laughter)

21:23.180 --> 21:25.850
We've got an umbrella,
why don't we use it?

21:26.210 --> 21:29.680
We could... walk home.
What do you say?

21:30.150 --> 21:31.220
I...

21:36.620 --> 21:40.590
I have Chinese class. You know
how demanding my father is.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.430
But see you tomorrow, at school?

21:42.530 --> 21:45.060
Yes. See you tomorrow, Adrien.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.200
- Ooh!
- (Chuckles)

21:57.410 --> 21:59.550
They really are
made for each other.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.550
Tatsu! Let's go!

22:04.220 --> 22:07.850
- Everything OK, Marinette?
- Everything's great, Tikki.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.620
Life is not about waiting
for the storm to pass,

22:10.730 --> 22:12.930
but learning
to dance in the rain.

22:13.730 --> 22:29.680
Woohoo!
