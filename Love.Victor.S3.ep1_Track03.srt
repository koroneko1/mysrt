I've been drinking sometimes.

The night I came over your house

Look, I've been running away from it,
just wanting it to go away,

but it-it won't.
And then, last night,

00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,546
I lied to you.

658
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,840
I drove. I put you in danger.

Look, Victor, if you and I are gonna have

660
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:26,595
any real chance of working out,
then I have to figure this out.

661
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,597
And I have to do it alone.

662

Okay? So, that means three weeks,
no emails, no phone.

663

I think it's going to be
really good for me.
