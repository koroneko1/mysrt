&lrm;on fateful things that happen.

&lrm;The flowers must be yours.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.060

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.580
&lrm;and evilise him!

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.980
&lrm;Victory never tasted so good.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.220
&lrm;Marinette was right.
&lrm;It was that evil brat!

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.900
&lrm;No respect for Cheng Sifu.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.260
&lrm;Kung Food, I am Hawk Moth.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.460
&lrm;Those who tasted your soup
&lrm;will become your servants.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.980
&lrm;The one who wronged you
&lrm;will pay dearly.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.260
&lrm;I will show I am
&lrm;greatest chef in the world!

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.940
&lrm;[tummy rumbles]
&lrm;[groaning]

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.820
&lrm;[groaning]
&lrm;My guts are killing me.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.740
&lrm;[groaning]
&lrm;I'm feeling quite uncomfortable.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.180
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;You have eaten my soup.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.100
&lrm;You become my servants!

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.820
&lrm;At your command, master.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.460
&lrm;Grab the girl!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.380
&lrm;Wait! Calm down.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.740
&lrm;I'm the mayor's daughter, remember?

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.180
&lrm;Daddy?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.340
&lrm;Kung Food make new Brat Soup.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.900
&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;But I don't like soup!

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.020
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Perfect!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.460
&lrm;Soon Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;will show up to meet their doom.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.940
&lrm;[cackling]

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.060
&lrm;Get out! Hurry!

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.220
<i>&lrm;Not polite to leave table</i>

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.420
<i>&lrm;Cut off exits!</i>

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.780
&lrm;-What's that?
&lrm;-Caramel?

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.060
&lrm;It tastes good but it's indestructible.
&lrm;We're trapped.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.740
&lrm;My uncle's upstairs.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.740
&lrm;Don't worry. I'll go find him.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.020
&lrm;Thanks...
&lrm;I'll... look for a way out.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.220
&lrm;[Kung Food]
<i>&lrm;You will taste Kung Food's soup.</i>

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.140
<i>&lrm;Everybody become my servant.</i>

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.620
<i>&lrm;And I become</i>
<i>&lrm;World's Greatest Chef!</i>

&lrm;[cackling]

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.980
&lrm;Uncle?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.100
&lrm;I shouldn't have riled up Chloe!
&lrm;I've gotta save my uncle.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.300
&lrm;You'll do it, Marinette,
&lrm;I'm sure you will.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.460
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.420
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.540
&lrm;You didn't happen to pick up

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.140
&lrm;a little piece
&lrm;of camembert, did you?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.740
&lrm;Cheese comes after the meal.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.780
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.340
&lrm;-Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Ladybug?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.900
&lrm;I don't know about you
&lrm;but I'm hungry.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.660
&lrm;Let's go eat then.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.060
&lrm;Who are those two?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.100
&lrm;They're Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.580
&lrm;They've come to stop you.
&lrm;Add them to your recipe!

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.500
&lrm;Surprise ingredients?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.940
&lrm;Delicious!

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.820
&lrm;-You, capture them.
&lrm;-Yes, master Kung Food.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.180
&lrm;Brat Soup more powerful
&lrm;with superhero flavour.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.020
&lrm;[Chloe]
&lrm;I will not eat your soup!

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.100
&lrm;Foolish girl. You are not eating soup.
&lrm;You are soup!

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.860
&lrm;Help! Let me down.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.100
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;You will be let down soon.

&lrm;Seafood Appetisers.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.460
&lrm;Jagged Stone!

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.900
&lrm;Seafood? This "scampi" happenin'.
&lrm;Can you carry a "tune-a"?

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.100
&lrm;Look out!

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.220
&lrm;That's not very rock 'n' roll.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.340
&lrm;Rock is one thing, soup is another.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.980
&lrm;When I'm done with you,
&lrm;you'll be mince-meat.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.660
&lrm;[he groans]

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.940
&lrm;Good job.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.580
&lrm;No time to lose.
&lrm;Chloe may be the main dish.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.700
&lrm;We better not wait to find out.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.060
&lrm;Let me out!

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.580
&lrm;This Brat Soup will be
&lrm;Kung Food's masterpiece.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.580
&lrm;Must you tie me up
&lrm;above this foul liquid?

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.500
&lrm;My clothes will stink.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.460
&lrm;Soup not greasy at all.
&lrm;Soup very well-balanced.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.020
&lrm;[he cackles]

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.380
<i>&lrm;-Let me outta here.</i>
&lrm;-Bad sous-chef!

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.860
&lrm;You, do me justice!

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.540
&lrm;Yes, master.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.020
&lrm;Ladybug, come on.
&lrm;It's just you and me together.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.540
&lrm;We could go places.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.220
&lrm;Yeah, like up.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.500
&lrm;Yeah, we've nowhere to go but up.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.260
&lrm;You spoke too soon.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.340
&lrm;The electricity between us
&lrm;caused a short-circuit.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.220
&lrm;You wish. More like us getting
&lrm;ourselves into a sticky mess.

&lrm;[lift beeps]

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.500
&lrm;Royal hotpot,
&lrm;with its giant smoked sausages.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.460
&lrm;Looks like a food-fight.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.900
&lrm;I prefer my sausages with mash.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.980
&lrm;Welcome to the world-famous
&lrm;Suite 36 of this hotel.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.260
&lrm;If we're not careful,
&lrm;we'll be the mash.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.500
&lrm;You're no competition, Ladybug.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.580
&lrm;Time to pick up the bill, Kung Food.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.540
&lrm;Grab Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.540
&lrm;His ring, bring it to me.
&lrm;Do it now!

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.100
&lrm;Wrong superhero, Bourgeois!

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.020
&lrm;I bet you don't know how to do this.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.620
&lrm;Really, Ladybug?

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.860
&lrm;Nice work, Milady.
&lrm;Shall we go find the head chef?

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.100
&lrm;Pea-brain! Useless!

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.540
&lrm;My recipe not perfect
&lrm;without those two.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.940
&lrm;Capture them! And don't mess up,
&lrm;or you end up in soup.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.340
&lrm;[together]
&lrm;Yes, master.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.340
&lrm;My hair is ruined.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.220
&lrm;Do you know
&lrm;how long it took to style it?

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.940
&lrm;That won't be a problem soon.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.580
&lrm;Ladybug, help me!

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.140
&lrm;We're almost there.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.460
&lrm;This fighting has made me hungry.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.060
<i>&lrm;Kung Food is generous.</i>

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.500
<i>&lrm;No need to choose</i>
<i>&lrm;between cheese and dessert.</i>

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.660
<i>&lrm;You get both.</i>
&lrm;[lift beeps]

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.060
&lrm;Watch this spectacular demonstration
&lrm;of the famous Flying Cakes.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.260
&lrm;Our guests seem to have
&lrm;a few tricks up their sleeves

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.700
&lrm;but how will they fair
&lrm;against the Stinky Cheese Bomb?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.980
&lrm;These cheese stings your eyes.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.540
&lrm;[Alec laughs]
&lrm;You're no match for my... Hey!

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.300
&lrm;It's about time
&lrm;for second course.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.300
&lrm;[Chloe whimpers]

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.140
&lrm;Temperature is just right.
&lrm;Time to add main ingredient.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.940
&lrm;No, no, no, no!

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.020
&lrm;No!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.460
&lrm;Ladybug? What took you so long?
&lrm;Wait till I tell everyone...

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.340
&lrm;Oops.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.940
&lrm;No! My Brat Soup
&lrm;will be so flavourless.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.540
&lrm;You're more honourable than this,
&lrm;Cheng Sifu.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.540
&lrm;I am not Cheng Sifu. I am Kung Food,
&lrm;the greatest chef in world!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.180
&lrm;Nobody will stop me
&lrm;from finishing my Brat Soup!

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.460
&lrm;Get back, Chloe.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.860
&lrm;I take care of you two myself!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.700
&lrm;Cat Noir,
&lrm;the Akuma must be in his hat.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.100
&lrm;Try to grab it.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.100
&lrm;It burns!

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.820
&lrm;[cackling]
&lrm;Like it spicy?

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.180
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.980
&lrm;A check?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.780
&lrm;It's gonna be a steep one.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.420
&lrm;Think you can beat me
&lrm;with a piece of paper?

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.860
&lrm;You've been trying to defeat us
&lrm;with sausages and cheese

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.300
&lrm;without any luck.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.420
&lrm;Cat Noir, destroy his bag.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.580
&lrm;Got it.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.340
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.580
&lrm;Your days are over, Akuma.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.340
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.500
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.460
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.180
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.220
&lrm;This evil dinner was almost perfect.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.140
&lrm;Revenge is a dish
&lrm;that's best served cold

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.540
&lrm;so watch yourself because
&lrm;I'll be ready to strike again!

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.700
&lrm;Could you teach me
&lrm;how to make Celestial Soup?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.420
&lrm;With pleasure, Marinette.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.020
&lrm;Cooking needs no words.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.820
&lrm;Seriously? Still making soup?

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.620
&lrm;I told you I hate soup.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.820
&lrm;Do you think
&lrm;the jury will approve?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.860
&lrm;Didn't your father
&lrm;kick you off the jury?

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.180
&lrm;No, he didn't.
&lrm;I... I... I resigned.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.820
&lrm;I think Cheng and Marinette
&lrm;have it covered.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.780
&lrm;Let's let the real jury decide.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.500
&lrm;Ridiculous!

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.420
&lrm;Utterly ridiculous!

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.940
<i>&lrm;Cheng Sifu, your Celestial Soup</i>
<i>&lrm;received the highest marks,</i>

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.300
<i>&lrm;making you the final winner!</i>

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.060
<i>&lrm;And it will be the "Mayor's Special"</i>

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.020
<i>&lrm;on the restaurant menu</i>
<i>&lrm;of my prestigious hotel.</i>

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.700
<i>&lrm;Rock 'n' roll!</i>

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.060
<i>&lrm;I can't wait to get home</i>
<i>&lrm;and write a song about soup.</i>

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.100
&lrm;Thank you
&lrm;but no longer Celestial Soup,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.740
&lrm;now called Marinette Soup.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.260
&lrm;[in Chinese]
&lrm;Thank you.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.260
&lrm;You're welcome.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.620
&lrm;Come stand next to your uncle,
&lrm;the World's Greatest Chef.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.740
