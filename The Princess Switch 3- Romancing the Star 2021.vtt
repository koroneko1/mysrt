00:23.500 --> 00:26.458
[narrator] Once upon a time,
there was a baker from Chicago.

00:26.541 --> 00:27.708
Merry Christmas.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.500
[narrator] That's me, Stacy,

00:30.083 --> 00:33.416
who looks just like Margaret,
the duchess of Montenaro.

00:33.916 --> 00:38.250
Stacy, me again, married
the handsome Prince Edward at Christmas,

00:38.333 --> 00:41.166
while Margaret married
my adorable best friend Kevin

00:41.250 --> 00:44.833
right before she was crowned
queen of Montenaro,

00:44.916 --> 00:46.750
which almost didn't happen,

00:46.833 --> 00:49.708
because her cousin Fiona,
who looks like both of us

00:49.791 --> 00:51.250
and is so over-the-top…

00:51.333 --> 00:53.000
Maggie Moo!

00:53.083 --> 00:56.916
[Stacy] …impersonated her
in an attempt to steal the throne.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.708
Luckily, Fiona was caught and sentenced
to many years of community service.

01:02.958 --> 01:06.416
I thought she should go to jail,
but Margaret says she's family.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.708
[chuckles] Could Christmas get
any more eventful?

01:09.791 --> 01:11.625
-Well, maybe.
-[sirens wail]

01:11.708 --> 01:13.625
Because this year, I'm cochairing

01:13.708 --> 01:16.541
an international Christmas festival
with Margaret,

01:16.625 --> 01:19.125
who's just about my best friend
in the world.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.708
-[triumphant music plays]
-[crowd cheers]

01:22.791 --> 01:24.708
And to commemorate the occasion,

01:24.791 --> 01:28.291
the Vatican has loaned us
the Star of Peace,

01:28.375 --> 01:33.166
a priceless relic that once belonged
to Saint Nicholas himself.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.541
[sirens wail]

01:41.541 --> 01:46.000
The Star will be kept under guard
until it goes on top of a ginormous tree

01:46.083 --> 01:49.125
at our tree-lighting ceremony
on Christmas Eve.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.416
[crowd cheers]

01:51.500 --> 01:55.958
Oh, and that's Cardinal Amoah,
the special emissary from the Vatican.

01:56.041 --> 01:58.208
Oh, this is so huge!

01:58.291 --> 01:59.375
Can you believe this?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.916
It's incredible.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.375
I feel like we're making history.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.041
Because you are making history.

03:20.958 --> 03:23.708
No one's getting paid a dime.
It all goes to charity.

03:23.791 --> 03:25.291
Yes, we had a cancellation,

03:25.375 --> 03:28.666
so there's one final audition
to fill the spot in the program.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.583
[Kevin] Okay. Bye.

03:29.666 --> 03:33.208
Stacy and I are handling
the details ourselves, so we'll be there.

03:33.916 --> 03:36.166
All right, thank you for checking. Bye.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.583
[exhales] That's the last call
I'm taking tonight.

03:40.666 --> 03:41.916
Me too.

-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas.

03:52.375 --> 03:55.166
Mm, we miss you, darling. How were exams?

03:55.250 --> 03:56.708
[Olivia] A major pain.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.416
I love the ballet academy,
don't get me wrong,

03:59.500 --> 04:02.166
but they make you work really hard
on the school part.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.833
Oh, it's nothing you can't handle.

04:04.416 --> 04:05.958
Are you on your way to the airport?

04:06.041 --> 04:09.208
That's why I called.
JFK's closed because of the weather.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.708
The chaperone says
we might leave from Bradley.

04:11.791 --> 04:13.583
Oh. Well, keep us posted.

04:13.666 --> 04:14.500
I love you.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.833
I love you more.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.958

04:22.041 --> 04:23.458
Yeah. You and me both.

04:23.541 --> 04:24.375

04:24.958 --> 04:25.833
Come here.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.083
[Edward] Very good, Your Majesty.

04:30.166 --> 04:34.500
Margaret and I love working together.
Yeah, I'm sure we'll do it again.

04:34.583 --> 04:37.250
It's just right now
we kinda have our hands full.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.333
We would love to see the corgis as well.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.416
-Absolutely. You can quote me.
-Yes. And a very Merry Christmas to you.

Just like your dear old Chicago Red Sox.

It's White Sox.

I'm terribly sorry to interrupt,

This is Inspector Moretti,

The police? Well, that sounds serious.

[exhales] This can't be happening.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.583
Isn't the museum vault
under guard around the clock?

06:14.666 --> 06:16.041
The guards were drugged.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.833
We found traces of chloromethazine
in the ventilation system

06:18.916 --> 06:21.000
that services the security office.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.208
Surely there's surveillance footage.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.416
The thieves wiped the hard drives clean.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.041
Whoever did this came prepared.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.291
We've notified Interpol,
but with no forensic evidence,

06:31.375 --> 06:32.625
we've very little to go on.

06:32.708 --> 06:36.375
Just please promise us you'll get it back
in time for the ceremony.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.041
I'm afraid that would be
a piecrust promise.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.750
Easily made, easily broken.

06:41.833 --> 06:42.750
Oh dear!

06:42.833 --> 06:45.583
We'd like to keep
the investigation confidential

06:45.666 --> 06:46.833
until we know more.

06:46.916 --> 06:48.500
Well, shall we notify the cardinal?

06:48.583 --> 06:52.875
Since it's possible the breach came
from within Vatican security,

06:53.500 --> 06:56.125
Interpol has asked us to hold off
until we rule them out.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.416
Just know we're doing everything we can.

of epic proportions.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.458
Yes, of course. [clears throat]

Wait. If the police don't have any leads,

07:40.500 --> 07:44.041
then it's up to us to come up
with something they haven't thought of.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.041
Like what?

07:45.125 --> 07:46.541
Well, what we need

07:46.625 --> 07:49.541
is someone with information
that the police don't have.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.208
Someone with connections
to the black market,

07:52.291 --> 07:55.958
and it wouldn't hurt
if they were just a little bit crooked.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.541
A little crooked?

[exhales]

08:01.333 --> 08:02.708
Yes, indeed.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.458
We need a person
who actually thinks like a criminal,

08:07.375 --> 08:10.250

of never considering consequences,

08:25.333 --> 08:27.083
I'm sorry. Let me get this straight.

08:27.166 --> 08:30.500
You want to employ the woman
who, with the help of her cohorts,

08:30.583 --> 08:33.250
masqueraded as you in an attempt
to take over the country?

08:33.333 --> 08:34.750
Didn't she go to jail?

08:34.833 --> 08:37.250
Fiona's serving a sentence
of community service

08:37.333 --> 08:38.750
at St. Michael's Convent.

08:38.833 --> 08:42.791
I was actually thinking of inviting her
for Christmas before any of this happened.

08:42.875 --> 08:43.791
You were?

08:45.375 --> 08:47.583
I've always felt sorry for her,

08:48.208 --> 08:51.416
growing up in boarding schools
with no one to look after her.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.750
I think this past year
at the convent's done her some good.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.250
Not that much good.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.375
Look, it's not like I trust Fiona,

08:59.458 --> 09:02.916
but I mean, St. Michael's
is less than an hour away,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.583
and the police are stumped.

09:04.666 --> 09:07.875
It would be unconscionable
to sit here and do nothing.

that isn't nailed down, but… [sighs]

11:57.083 --> 11:58.958
Yeah, keep us posted.

11:59.791 --> 12:00.625
Anything?

12:00.708 --> 12:03.125
They thought they had a lead,
but it didn't pan out.

12:03.666 --> 12:06.250
[exhales] We could certainly use
some good news right about now.

12:06.333 --> 12:11.000
No worries, royal six-pack.
Good news has arrived.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.625
Special delivery.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.458
-Handle with care.
-[Fiona] Hm.

12:14.541 --> 12:15.625
[sighs]

12:16.208 --> 12:17.041
[Fiona chuckles]

12:17.916 --> 12:18.916
Mm.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
[jazz music plays]

12:23.583 --> 12:25.291
[Stacy] Um, Reggie and Mindy?

12:25.375 --> 12:26.541
You gotta be kidding me.

12:27.166 --> 12:31.250
Fiona agreed to help us,
but she said she needed her squad.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.416
-Weren't they in jail as well?
-[scoffs]

12:33.500 --> 12:37.791
They were, but I, uh, pulled
a few strings. [chuckles]

12:37.875 --> 12:39.500
Well, it's good to be queen.

12:39.583 --> 12:40.916
[glasses clink]

12:41.000 --> 12:41.833
[sighs]

12:41.916 --> 12:44.708
How's my fave cuzzie-in-law?

12:44.791 --> 12:46.250
Fine, I guess.

12:46.333 --> 12:51.250
I hope you ain't still sore
over our little mix-up last Christmas.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.916
-Mix-up?
-[Reggie] Yeah.

12:53.000 --> 12:53.875
You kidnapped me!

12:53.958 --> 12:56.416
Okay. Still sore.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.708
Spicy.

12:57.791 --> 13:01.250
Why don't I have
Mrs. Donatelli show you your rooms?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.916
This way. Please.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.375
[sultry music plays]

13:07.208 --> 13:09.125
Meow.

13:09.208 --> 13:10.541
Right, yes, uh,

13:10.625 --> 13:12.166
meow to you as well.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.666
[purrs]

13:15.375 --> 13:17.125
-No respect.
-[mouths] No.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.958
None. Cool.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.750
[birds chirping]

13:24.875 --> 13:26.250
Am I late for brekkie?

13:26.333 --> 13:28.791
Only by an hour… or three.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.958
No worries. I couldn't eat a thing.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.250
Hey!

13:33.333 --> 13:36.916
But I do have news.
I've been in touch with an associate

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
who should be able
to help us find our missing treasure.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.916
[Margaret] Does this associate
have a name?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.041
I'd rather not say until he's on board,
but trust me, he's the GOAT.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.166
Sorry, he's… he's a goat?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.583
"Greatest of all time," babe.
It's like a sports thing.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.333
I knew that. I… I knew that.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.708
[Mindy] I bet it's that count
from Barcelona.

13:57.791 --> 14:00.250
[Reggie] Nah, he's a squirrelly one.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.375
Never looks you square in the eye.

14:02.458 --> 14:04.291
He's got a glass eye, idiot.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.083
Oh.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.958
[inhales] I'll need to borrow a car,

14:08.041 --> 14:10.583
and preferably a 'rari
that matches my Manolos.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.541
Don't worry.
Frank will be happy to drive you.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.708
Don't you trust me, royal boo?

14:14.791 --> 14:16.208
[Stacy] Hell no.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.375
And Bonnie and Clyde
are staying right here

14:18.458 --> 14:20.166
just to make sure you come back.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.958
-[scoffs]
-Here? What are we supposed to do all day?

14:23.041 --> 14:25.875
Perhaps you could start
by, uh, returning the silver.

14:27.791 --> 14:28.625
Reggie!

14:29.583 --> 14:30.416
What?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.416
[sighs] Dear.

14:32.958 --> 14:35.458
[uplifting instrumental music plays]

14:54.125 --> 14:57.041
[uplifting instrumental music intensifies]

15:01.208 --> 15:02.791
[uplifting instrumental music ends]

15:05.000 --> 15:09.416
Right. Okay. Now look, I don't wish
to be impertinent, Your Ladyship,

15:09.500 --> 15:11.625
but if you're not out in 20 minutes,

15:11.708 --> 15:14.833
I have strict orders
to come in there and fetch.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.000
-Mm.
-[tense music plays]

15:17.083 --> 15:18.208
Bossy.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.166
[Frank] Hm.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.791
Remember! Twenty minutes!

15:23.583 --> 15:25.875
[door creaks]

15:28.833 --> 15:29.708
[exhales]

15:29.791 --> 15:31.791
[tense music continues]

15:34.708 --> 15:36.208
[door closes]

15:40.083 --> 15:42.291
You haven't lost your touch.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.166
[tense music ends]

15:44.250 --> 15:45.250
Some say.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.750
You're looking well, Peter.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.750
You too, Pemmie.

15:51.541 --> 15:52.791
It's Pembroke.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.625
You'll always be Pemmie to me.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.541
[scoffs]

15:56.541 --> 15:58.666
So, how long has it been

15:58.750 --> 16:01.166
since you walked out on me
that spring night in Barbados?

16:01.250 --> 16:02.416
Oh, please.

16:03.541 --> 16:07.875
We were always better as friends.
Everything else was a complication.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.791
[bottles clink]

16:09.875 --> 16:11.666
That's an interesting word for it.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.541
[Fiona exhales]

16:14.208 --> 16:15.750
I heard from Bianca the other day.

16:17.041 --> 16:20.541
Mummy's always had a soft spot for you
since we were in nappies.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.291
She says you won't return her calls.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.958
I have nothing to say.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.583
[Peter] Oh, come on, Pemmie.

16:26.666 --> 16:27.583
It's Christmas.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.666
Give the old girl a break.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.791
If I remember,
you weren't speaking to your father.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.250
No. I wasn't.

16:38.291 --> 16:42.083
But I saw him last Christmas,
two days before he passed.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.458
And I'm very glad I did.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.291
Well, now that we've limped
down memory lane,

16:50.166 --> 16:51.500
can we talk business?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.333
The Star of Peace.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.250
You want my help getting it back.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.833
Question is,
why is it so important to you?

17:01.916 --> 17:03.708
[Fiona] Well, it's important to my cuzzie.

17:04.416 --> 17:08.291
I treated her… [sighs] …unkindly,

17:08.375 --> 17:11.583
so I thought I'd make it up to her.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.250
[chuckles] Yes, I heard
about your little escapade.

17:16.833 --> 17:22.125
So, will you help
despite our colorful past?

17:23.458 --> 17:24.916
You know the answer to that.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.291
[tense music plays]

17:27.375 --> 17:30.166
No matter what, no matter where?

17:33.666 --> 17:36.458
Let me show you
what I've dug up. [chuckles softly]

17:40.291 --> 17:42.666
[dramatic music plays]

17:47.458 --> 17:49.416
-Are you coming?
-Mm.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.833
[computer beeping]

17:53.916 --> 17:56.625
Et voilà! The Interpol case file.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.000
Interpol? I thought you left them.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.666
That doesn't mean I've forgotten
how to get around their firewalls.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.708
-Oh.
-According to this report,

18:04.791 --> 18:06.666
there are no suspects in the theft,

18:06.750 --> 18:09.166
but the interesting bit

18:09.250 --> 18:12.458
is that chloromethazine was used
to drug the guards.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.666
Why on earth is that interesting?

18:15.750 --> 18:17.625
Interpol is utterly convinced

18:17.708 --> 18:20.875
that the black-market supply
is limited to an Asian distributor.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.375
And it is,

18:23.250 --> 18:27.541
except for one disreputable pharmacist
in Geneva,

18:27.625 --> 18:29.208
who runs an after-hours operation

18:29.291 --> 18:31.833
out of the back of his warehouse
on Place du Port.

18:31.916 --> 18:33.500
[inhales] Now, lucky for us,

18:34.083 --> 18:36.583
there are security cameras
all along the riverbank.

18:36.666 --> 18:39.958
I searched through the last three days
of footage and came up with this.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.333
[computer whirs]

18:41.416 --> 18:43.625
[tense music plays]

18:45.458 --> 18:46.333
[computer beeps]

18:47.625 --> 18:48.583
[computer beeps]

18:49.458 --> 18:51.583
[computer beeps, whirs]

18:51.666 --> 18:53.041
That's Itai Krauss.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.708
Do I know him?

18:55.250 --> 18:56.333
Indirectly.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.333
He works for an old friend of yours.

18:59.916 --> 19:02.416
-[computer beeps]
-Hunter Cunard,

19:02.500 --> 19:04.583
the billionaire hotel tycoon.

19:06.416 --> 19:09.416
Why would a hotel tycoon steal
the Star of Peace?

19:09.500 --> 19:12.750
It's a little-known fact
that Hunter's secret obsession

19:12.833 --> 19:15.500
is collecting precious items
that aren't for sale.

19:16.666 --> 19:21.250
Paintings, antiquities, jewels.
He loves an impossible challenge.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.541
You've been an invaluable help,
Mr. Maxwell.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.208
I'm certain the police will be grateful
for the information.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.666
Maggie, don't be silly.
You can't go to the police.

19:30.750 --> 19:31.750
Why not?

19:31.833 --> 19:33.500
Hunter has friends everywhere.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.375
One wrong word to the wrong person,
and the Star disappears forever.

19:37.458 --> 19:39.291
[scoffs] So, what do we do?

19:39.375 --> 19:41.041
The only thing you can do.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.583
You steal it back.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.125
-[mischievous music plays]
-[scoffs]

19:46.833 --> 19:47.666
How?

19:47.750 --> 19:52.375
Every Christmas, Hunter hosts
an exclusive soiree at his estate.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.791
It happens to be this Saturday night.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.625
[sighs] Well, I assume
security will be tight as a drum.

19:57.708 --> 19:58.875
-Oh.
-[Peter] It will be,

19:58.958 --> 20:01.333
but there'll also be
people coming and going,

20:01.416 --> 20:05.666
caterers, florists, guests,
which affords us the perfect opportunity.

20:06.416 --> 20:09.000
All we have to do
is make sure Hunter is occupied,

20:09.083 --> 20:13.458
and lucky for us,
he used to be quite enamored of Fiona.

20:13.541 --> 20:17.333
Oh! So, uh, this bad boy
had a thing for you, huh?

20:17.416 --> 20:20.416
Oh, we had a bit of a steamy. [chuckles]

20:20.500 --> 20:21.791
But he wasn't my type.

20:22.541 --> 20:25.833
So, when was the last time
you spoke to this Mr. Cunard?

20:25.916 --> 20:29.083
[scoffs] A few years ago.
We both moved on.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.541
If it's been years,

20:30.625 --> 20:32.333
how are you gonna get invited
to the party?

20:32.416 --> 20:35.458
Hunter walks his dog
through the park behind the library

20:35.541 --> 20:38.375
every morning at 8:00 a.m., rain or shine.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.583
Fiona will do the same.

20:42.166 --> 20:46.000
I'm certain once they coincidentally run
into each other,

20:46.083 --> 20:48.000
she can charm an invitation out of him.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.083
Where is she gonna get a dog?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.291
Hm, I can pinch her a pooch.

20:52.375 --> 20:56.208
Forgive me, but aren't you
the Peter Maxwell who worked for Interpol

20:56.291 --> 20:59.958
and was, well, charged
with a rather large-scale diamond theft?

21:00.041 --> 21:01.375
[tense music plays]

21:03.333 --> 21:07.333
The charges were dismissed,
but the incident tarnished my reputation,

21:07.416 --> 21:10.125
so I resigned
and started my own private security firm,

21:10.208 --> 21:12.541
which has proven quite lucrative.

21:12.625 --> 21:15.291
Mm-hmm. So what's your finder's fee?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.333
-There is no fee.
-Why not?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.666
Let's just say…

21:21.666 --> 21:23.083
I have my reasons.

21:26.541 --> 21:28.416
[tense music ends]

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
[dog pants]

21:31.166 --> 21:34.958
[exhales] This isn't a dog.
It's bloody Big Foot.

21:35.666 --> 21:38.958
Pugsley's a pussycat.
You just don't know how to handle him.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.458
[Fiona scoffs] I know
how I'm going to handle you

21:41.541 --> 21:42.791
if I break a heel.

21:45.583 --> 21:46.875
If I can have your attention…

21:46.958 --> 21:48.625
[on comm] …Hunter's just arrived.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.583
-[Fiona] Location?
-[Peter] He's headed your way.

21:50.666 --> 21:52.291
-[dog sniffs]
-[Fiona grunts]

21:52.375 --> 21:53.666
[groans]

21:54.791 --> 21:56.583
Oh, he's lush.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.625
[Peter] You'll intersect his path
in 100 yards.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.375
Would you please get your nose
out of that bush?

22:02.041 --> 22:03.666
[Mindy] He just passed the latte stand.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.041
Ugh, what seems to be your problem?

22:06.625 --> 22:07.708
I don't have a problem.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.458
Not you.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.958
-[squirrel squeaks]
-[dog barks]

22:12.041 --> 22:13.750
-No. No.
-Pugsley!

22:13.833 --> 22:17.500
Stop this at once!
Naughty dog. Bad dog. Stop!

22:18.333 --> 22:20.250
Dog! [gasps] Oh no.

22:20.875 --> 22:21.708
[grunts]

22:22.625 --> 22:23.541
[groans]

22:23.625 --> 22:25.083
Wretched.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.125
My nail!

22:27.208 --> 22:29.750
-[chuckles]
-[Fiona] I've broken a nail!

22:29.833 --> 22:30.875
[Reggie laughs]

22:30.958 --> 22:34.541
-Where'd you get it from, a horse ranch?
-Would you watch what you're saying?

22:34.625 --> 22:36.250
You couldn't have got us a toy poodle?

22:36.333 --> 22:38.833
Oh, because poodles grow on trees.

22:38.916 --> 22:41.791
Did she say poodles grew on trees, genius?

22:41.875 --> 22:44.458
Oh, look, it's a poodle tree.

22:44.541 --> 22:47.625
[gasps] Let's pick us a white one,
shall we?

22:47.708 --> 22:48.541
[Peter whistles]

22:49.375 --> 22:52.000
-Can we talk about plan B?
-Thank God there's a plan B.

[Fiona exhales]

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:20.500
-[sighs]
-That was uncomfortably close.

1:03:21.375 --> 1:03:23.708
Oh. On the bright side,

1:03:24.208 --> 1:03:25.666
found the keypad.

1:03:26.916 --> 1:03:27.875
[exhales]

1:03:28.916 --> 1:03:31.833
[choral music plays]

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.416
How on earth does she walk
in these things?

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:36.333
No idea.

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:38.375
[exhales]

1:03:40.291 --> 1:03:42.250
-Are you okay?
-[Edward] Well, more or less.

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:44.208
Never done anything like this before.

1:03:44.291 --> 1:03:47.708
[exhales] Yeah, um, just try and be chill.

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:49.791
Right, yes. Chilling.

1:03:49.875 --> 1:03:52.166
[inhales and exhales]

1:03:52.250 --> 1:03:53.125
[chuckles softly]

1:03:54.583 --> 1:03:55.958
[Mother Superior] Okay. Come!

1:03:56.041 --> 1:03:57.083
[door creaks]

1:03:57.875 --> 1:04:01.041
Ms. Pembroke.
[chuckles nervously] There you are.

1:04:01.125 --> 1:04:02.625
You're very late.

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:07.666
Correction, official man.
I'm fashionably late.

1:04:09.458 --> 1:04:10.541
Take a seat.

1:04:11.291 --> 1:04:13.041
-[Edward] Ladies and gentlemen--
-Aren't you--

1:04:13.125 --> 1:04:14.958
Prince Edward of Belgravia.

1:04:16.791 --> 1:04:19.208
Ms. Pembroke kidnapped my wife,

1:04:19.291 --> 1:04:22.875
and I thought, if anybody should be
a character witness on her behalf,

1:04:22.958 --> 1:04:24.125
well, it would be me.

1:04:24.208 --> 1:04:27.333
But you just said she kidnapped your wife.

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:29.875
Yes, I did.

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:33.916
And she did,
but since then, she has reformed.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.291
You see, underneath all of, uh… uh, that,

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:41.166
Ms. Pembroke really has a good heart.

1:04:41.250 --> 1:04:44.375
And yes, she has made some mistakes,

1:04:44.458 --> 1:04:48.708
but isn't our ability to forgive
a measure of our own humanity?

1:04:49.583 --> 1:04:51.000
Especially at Christmas.

1:04:51.625 --> 1:04:52.500
[exhales]

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.166
Is there anything you'd like to add?

1:04:59.833 --> 1:05:04.083
Everything His Royal Hotness says is true.

1:05:04.583 --> 1:05:06.791
I've made some hideous mistakes.

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:12.083
In fact,
if you need to extend my sentence,

1:05:12.166 --> 1:05:14.375
I completely understand.

1:05:14.458 --> 1:05:17.041
Actually, I recommend it.

1:05:17.125 --> 1:05:18.916
-[Edward] She doesn't mean that.
-Oh, but I do.

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.208
-No, you don't.
-I do.

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:21.125
-No, you don't.
-I do.

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:23.416
-No, you don't.
-I think we've heard enough.

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.916
I'd like to confer
with my colleagues for a moment.

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.500
-Of course.
-Take all the time you need.

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.416
[cell phone beeps]

1:05:35.541 --> 1:05:36.500
[cell phone buzzes]

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:38.541
[Peter] Damn it, it's not connecting.

1:05:38.625 --> 1:05:41.666
Try my birthday. December 14th.

1:05:41.750 --> 1:05:44.875
You and Hunter haven't been together
for more than five years.

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:46.958
He's not going to remember your birthday.

1:05:47.041 --> 1:05:50.958
[scoffs] Trust me. I made an impression.

1:05:51.041 --> 1:05:52.291
-Hm.
-Hm.

1:05:53.333 --> 1:05:54.166
Fine.

1:05:55.791 --> 1:05:57.041
[keypad beeps]

1:05:59.208 --> 1:06:00.458

[triumphant music plays]

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:27.083
[sighs] Here he comes.

1:06:32.333 --> 1:06:33.833
Well, that took forever.

1:06:33.916 --> 1:06:36.666
Oh, trust me. It's worth the wait.

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:40.500
Merry Christmas.

1:06:42.583 --> 1:06:44.958
[jazz music plays]

1:06:49.541 --> 1:06:53.416
Doesn't the duchess of Marlborough
have this same bracelet?

1:06:54.166 --> 1:06:56.291
And matching earrings?

1:06:56.916 --> 1:06:57.875
Oh.

1:07:00.791 --> 1:07:05.041
You know,
I think I left those earrings upstairs.

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:07.875
[tango music plays]

1:07:07.958 --> 1:07:09.208
Shall we go and fetch them?

1:07:13.750 --> 1:07:15.708
But they're playing a tango.

1:07:15.791 --> 1:07:19.125
You always loved a good tango.

1:07:19.208 --> 1:07:20.583
Then let's dance.

1:08:05.375 --> 1:08:06.750
[tango music continues]

1:08:57.833 --> 1:09:00.583
[crowd cheers]

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:33.166

[Fiona breathes heavily]

1:09:42.458 --> 1:09:43.541
[exhales]

1:09:51.583 --> 1:09:55.375
Are you ready to go upstairs
and find those earrings?

1:09:56.583 --> 1:10:00.666
[pants] So hot. I need water.

1:10:13.666 --> 1:10:16.708
We've reached a decision
regarding Ms. Pembroke.

1:10:16.791 --> 1:10:18.833
The fact that she was late
for this meeting

1:10:18.916 --> 1:10:21.958
indicates a troubling disregard
for authority.

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:24.083
Added to her past transgressions,

1:10:24.166 --> 1:10:27.208
it would appear that increasing
her sentence is warranted.

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:30.875
If I may be allowed to say,
uh, just one more point

1:10:30.958 --> 1:10:32.458
about my wi… Ms. Pembroke--

1:10:32.541 --> 1:10:35.333
If you'll allow me to finish please,
Your Highness, sir,

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:36.750
I said it was warranted,

1:10:38.083 --> 1:10:40.583
but I don't believe
it's the right thing to do.

1:10:41.916 --> 1:10:43.250
Ms. Pembroke,

1:10:43.333 --> 1:10:47.541
the committee is very impressed
with your sincere remorse.

1:10:48.250 --> 1:10:51.166
You truly aren't the person
we met with before.

1:10:51.666 --> 1:10:53.666
I truly am not.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:57.833
Based on the testimony
of your character witness

1:10:57.916 --> 1:11:00.750
as well as the recommendations
of Mother Superior,

1:11:01.791 --> 1:11:05.250
we hereby commute
the remainder of your sentence.

1:11:05.333 --> 1:11:08.291
It's a Christmas miracle!

1:11:13.625 --> 1:11:18.000
[hesitates] Of course
we will miss you terribly.

1:11:18.083 --> 1:11:20.333
Oh, of course you will.

1:11:20.416 --> 1:11:23.125
Well, we best be going.

1:11:23.208 --> 1:11:24.208
-[chuckles]
-Yes.

1:11:24.291 --> 1:11:26.833
Thank you very much,
and of course, Merry Christmas.

1:11:29.166 --> 1:11:30.333
[door closes]

1:11:31.250 --> 1:11:34.666
I'm not sure how I feel
about getting Fiona off the hook.

1:11:34.750 --> 1:11:37.458
-Let's not worry about that right now.
-[scoffs]

1:11:38.125 --> 1:11:42.166
You know, it's deliciously exhilarating
engaging in all this skulduggery.

1:11:42.250 --> 1:11:43.500
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

1:11:43.583 --> 1:11:46.625
-[laughs] Come on.
-Ah.

1:12:13.833 --> 1:12:15.208
That wasn't supposed to happen.

1:12:15.291 --> 1:12:16.375
[groans]

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:18.875
Hey. What's that?

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:20.541
[alarm beeps]

1:12:20.625 --> 1:12:22.250
It's a sensor in the gallery.

1:12:22.333 --> 1:12:24.666
Something's happening.
I think it's an alarm.

1:12:24.750 --> 1:12:27.041
-Well, sort it out then!
-I don't know what to do!

1:12:27.125 --> 1:12:30.750
-Use the laptop! Turn it off and on again.
-I don't think that's gonna work!

1:12:30.833 --> 1:12:31.666
[Reggie] Google it!

1:12:31.750 --> 1:12:32.583
Take this.

1:12:34.291 --> 1:12:35.583
[Fiona breathes heavily]

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.791
[tense music intensifies]

1:12:41.375 --> 1:12:43.000
[alarm stops blaring]

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:45.750
Hold on. It stopped.

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:49.208
For now, but the jig is up.
You got to get out of there.

1:12:49.291 --> 1:12:50.125
[grunts]

1:12:52.291 --> 1:12:55.083
-Maybe the music's vibration set it off.
-Yeah.

1:12:55.166 --> 1:12:56.083
Psst, psst!

1:12:56.166 --> 1:13:00.375
Psst! Frank! Mayday, Frank. Mayday!
Abort the mission.

1:13:00.458 --> 1:13:01.791
-What?
-Get in the van!

1:13:01.875 --> 1:13:03.875
[tense music continues]

1:13:05.625 --> 1:13:06.583
[Reggie grunts]

1:13:15.625 --> 1:13:16.625
[exhales]

1:13:19.291 --> 1:13:20.125
Hm.

1:13:20.208 --> 1:13:21.625
What about Fiona and Peter?

1:13:21.708 --> 1:13:24.208
Me and Frankie boy, we're getting out
while the getting's good.

1:13:24.291 --> 1:13:26.250
I ain't ending up six foot under.

1:13:26.333 --> 1:13:27.250
Okay, I'm coming.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:29.916
Oh God.

1:13:32.041 --> 1:13:32.916
Hey, hey, hey!

[tense rock music plays]

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:48.583
Stay here.

1:13:49.208 --> 1:13:53.000
Oh. But… but… I've… I've cooled off now.

1:13:53.083 --> 1:13:55.000
-I'll only be a minute.

1:14:18.416 --> 1:14:21.250
[exhales] Don't panic.
Keep calm and carry on.

1:14:22.041 --> 1:14:23.500
[exhales] And run.

-They're coming. Take it.

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:30.833
What about you?

1:14:30.916 --> 1:14:33.416
Just take it. Go. I'll distract them.

to the east stairway.

All right! Let's get the hell out of here!

1:15:21.208 --> 1:15:23.000
But Ms. Pembroke is not here!

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:25.416

1:16:12.625 --> 1:16:15.333
Ms. Pembroke,
come with me if you want to live.

[scoffs] Go!

-I'll call the police.
-No.

1:16:47.166 --> 1:16:49.291
No police, idiot.

1:16:50.875 --> 1:16:52.333
And shut off that alarm.

1:17:05.625 --> 1:17:08.000
[tense music plays]

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.875
[all argue indistinctly]

1:17:16.958 --> 1:17:19.458
[Mindy] I said to him, "Don't go."

1:17:19.541 --> 1:17:21.166
There you are.

1:17:21.250 --> 1:17:23.000
-We were so worried about you.
-Zsst.

1:17:24.791 --> 1:17:25.791
Explain.

1:17:25.875 --> 1:17:26.916
Oh. [scoffs]

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.791
Well, Mother Superior called,

1:17:28.875 --> 1:17:31.041
and your disciplinary meeting
got pushed up,

1:17:31.125 --> 1:17:33.583
so I had to be you.

1:17:33.666 --> 1:17:36.333
But never mind me. Are you guys okay?

1:17:36.416 --> 1:17:39.041
Well, more or less.
There was a bit of a hitch.

1:17:39.125 --> 1:17:41.833
Peter had to stay behind
to create a diversion.

1:17:41.916 --> 1:17:43.250
But he was able to escape?

1:17:43.333 --> 1:17:46.458
Well, we still haven't heard from him,
so we don't know.

1:17:46.541 --> 1:17:48.125
[Stacy] Oh. Um…

1:17:48.208 --> 1:17:49.958
Well, did you get the Star?

1:17:50.041 --> 1:17:52.875
Of course we did, royal worrywart.

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:02.416

1:18:12.958 --> 1:18:14.541

He switched it.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.208
Which means Peter has the Star.

1:18:22.291 --> 1:18:25.000
He fooled every one of us
into thinking we could trust him.

1:18:25.708 --> 1:18:29.208
After everything we went through?
I can't believe it.

1:18:30.125 --> 1:18:31.125
[Margaret] Fiona.

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:34.000
Fiona, you can't feel bad about this.

1:18:34.083 --> 1:18:36.166
Yeah, it really isn't your fault.

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:38.083
Well, then whose fault is it?

1:18:41.583 --> 1:18:44.250

-We're back!

1:18:49.083 --> 1:18:51.208
-Huh?
-What's going on?

1:18:51.291 --> 1:18:52.708
I can explain everything.

1:18:52.791 --> 1:18:54.041
Which one are you?

1:18:54.125 --> 1:18:56.875
It's okay, Kev.
That's Margaret, not Fiona.

1:18:56.958 --> 1:18:58.583
-Stacy?
-Yeah.

1:18:58.666 --> 1:19:00.291
-And that's Margaret?
-Mm-hmm.

1:19:00.375 --> 1:19:02.458
-Are you sure?
-Let me prove it to you.

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:05.000
-No, no, no.
-[Margaret] Shh.

1:19:16.666 --> 1:19:19.041
[exhales] Okay. It's you.

1:19:19.125 --> 1:19:22.208
-Mm.
-Phew. That was really strange.

1:19:22.291 --> 1:19:26.458
I guess we should call a press conference
and let everyone know what's happened.

1:19:26.541 --> 1:19:28.750
[Edward] I can see the headline now.

1:19:28.833 --> 1:19:31.666
"Saint Nicholas's Star of Peace
gone forever."

1:19:31.750 --> 1:19:34.208
I suppose we should cancel everything.

1:19:34.708 --> 1:19:37.125
The tree lighting, all of it.

1:19:37.208 --> 1:19:40.541
Well, first, let's start by informing
Inspector Moretti and the cardinal.

1:19:40.625 --> 1:19:43.000
They deserve to be prepared
before all hell breaks loose.

1:19:43.083 --> 1:19:43.958
Yes, sir.

1:19:44.041 --> 1:19:46.625

1:19:48.875 --> 1:19:51.416
-What was that?
-[Stacy] No more community service.

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:53.000
You're done.

1:19:54.041 --> 1:19:55.833
[Reggie] You hear that, Fifi?

1:19:55.916 --> 1:19:57.250
You're as free as a bird.

1:19:57.333 --> 1:20:02.166
Even so, we're hoping you'll stay
and spend the holidays with us.

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:04.500
There's a noon flight to Capri tomorrow.

1:20:04.583 --> 1:20:06.208
We can make it
if we leave after breakfast.

-Joyeux Noel, mes amours.

-[Reggie] Looks like a school to me.
-[Mindy] Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

1:20:48.625 --> 1:20:50.666

1:20:50.750 --> 1:20:52.916
I hated school. Skipped most of it.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:54.291
That explains a lot.

1:20:55.375 --> 1:20:57.583
Hey, Fifi, where you going?

1:20:57.666 --> 1:21:00.416
-Stop talking.
-[girl] Emily, I'm gonna miss you so much!

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:04.041

Where's the Star, Peter?

1:21:26.166 --> 1:21:27.666
I needed to get your attention.

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:30.875
[scoffs] I want the Star.

1:21:30.958 --> 1:21:32.125
And you'll get it.

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:37.416
But in exchange, I need you
to pop around to the dining hall.

1:21:38.875 --> 1:21:40.375
What on earth for?

Someone has to, or you'll just go on
living an empty, hollow life.

1:21:54.416 --> 1:21:57.583
[scoffs] So that's why
you double-crossed me,

1:21:57.666 --> 1:21:59.958
to let me know I'm destined
to be lonely and miserable?

I wasn't going to,

Oh, I don't see why not.

1:23:59.041 --> 1:24:02.166
You know, I've spent
the last few years traveling the world

1:24:02.250 --> 1:24:04.166

But it was on a retreat
at an ashram in Rishikesh

that I finally realized
that there has been a void in my life.
