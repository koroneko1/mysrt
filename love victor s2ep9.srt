155
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,914
and he was kind enough to bring me
my homework so I wouldn't fall behind.

156
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,042
I'm Rahim, by the way.
‐ Hi.

157
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,255
Oh, uh, sorry. Uh, Victor, this is, uh,
my friend Shelby.

158
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,632
‐ So nice to meet you, Victor.

159
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,926
Your dad talks about you all the time.

160
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,970
‐ He does? When?

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,057
‐ PFLAG. Shelby and I, we know
each other from the meetings.

162
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,645
Uh, Victor, can we talk for a second?

163
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,985
‐ Happy holidays. I just love pistachios.

164
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,028
[both chuckle softly]

165
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,657
‐ Are you on a date right now?
‐ Shelby and I...

166
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,827
Yes, we're seeing each other.

167
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,415
It's very new. It's too new
to tell you about, but here we are.

168
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,168
‐ Does Mom know?
‐ She does.

169
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,130
‐ So, that's it?

170
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,342
You guys are never getting back together?
You're just giving up on her?

171
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,219
‐ Victor, I'm not giving up on anything.

172
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,930
‐ You're dating other people.
You're not even trying anymore.

173
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,600
‐ Look, I think that this is a much
bigger conversation.

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,644
And maybe me catching you skipping school

175
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,979
is not the best time to have it.

176
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,564
Your friend over there,
he's pretty smooth,

177
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,815
but I wasn't born yesterday.

178
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,817
‐ Are you gonna tell Mom?

179
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,030
‐ If you head back to class now,
maybe I'll forget to mention it.

180
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,745
VICTOR:
I can't believe my dad got a girlfriend.

181
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,289
God. How could he do this to my mom?

182
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,336
‐ Can I ask you a personal question?
‐ Mmm.

183
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,257
‐ Do you think your parents
should get back together?

184
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,552
Like, do you think that
they're right for each other?

185
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:21,061
‐ I don't know. I mean, last year,
they were constantly fighting.

186
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,231
And sometimes I just wished they'd
get the hell away from each other

187
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,482
and give us all a break.

188
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,402
Before that...

189
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,947
They were pretty magic together.

190
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,243
I mean, they were our age
when they started dating.

191
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,997
But maybe that's part of the problem.
You know, like...

192
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,833
what are the odds that the first person
you date is the person

193
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,751
you're supposed to end up with?

194
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,300
‐ Okay, I don't care what your dad says.
We're not going back to school.

195
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,635
It's time to turn the self‐care
up to an eleven.

196
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,309
VICTOR: You know, I've never actually
had a pedicure before.

197
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,104
‐ You're acting like this is news,
but those hooves are rough.

198
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,399
Linda, Michelle,
the number 4 special, please.

199
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,775
"Oh oh aubergine" for me,

200
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,321
and "clear" for my very
wild friend over here.

201
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,989
‐ Okay. [laughs]
[phone alerts]

202
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,787
Okay, why do you keep grinning
at your phone like that?

203
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,248
Did Tom Holland slide into your DMs?
‐ No!

204
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,252
Okay? It's just this guy Charlie
I've been talking to on one of those apps.

205
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,755
You know which one.
‐ Well, let me see.

206
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,304
Wait. Are all these
headless torsos in Atlanta?

207
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,056
‐ This is just guys nearby.

208
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,683
Turns out there's a ton of gay fish
in the online sea.

209
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,894
‐ And all the fish claim
to have 9‐inch dicks.

210
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,437
‐ Yeah, all the fish kind of lie.

211
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,649
Like when Charlie and I started talking,
we both said we were twenty‐two.

212
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,235
But turns out he's a senior
at Thadwick Academy.

213
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,444
‐ Thadwick?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

214
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,695
‐ Damn. Your boyfriend's bougie.

215
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,657
‐ He's not my boyfriend, okay?
We, we haven't even met.

216
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,867
We just text a lot.

217
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,079
And send the occasional
mildly scandalous pic.

218
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,039
‐ You should ask him
if he wants to meet up.

219
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,416
‐ What, like now?

220
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,127
‐ You said I get to pick what we do today,
and this is what I pick.

221
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,215
‐ I can't believe I'm actually
gonna do this.

222
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,008
I feel a pimple starting on my chin,

223
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,010
and this isn't even
one of my top‐tier outfits.

224
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,513
‐ Well, lucky for you, we're in a spa.

225
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,723
Linda, Michelle, give him the works.

226
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,851
‐ I have $17 in my wallet.

227
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,770
‐ Give him $17 worth of works.
‐ There we go.

228
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,647
RAHIM:
Okay, you sure you don't mind being here?

229
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,024
‐ No. Benji's not working today.

230
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,360
And plus, I know where
we keep the pepper spray

231
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,113
in case Charlie turns out to be
a sixty‐year‐old murderer

232
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,907
whose kink is decapitating high school
students with a box cutter.

233
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,078
Do you think you're the only person
that watches true crime?
[Rahim chuckles]

234
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,377
‐ Oh, my God. I think that's him.

235
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,592
Okay, I would so let him decapitate me.

236
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,719
‐ Maybe don't start with that.
‐ Right.

237
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,846
‐ Go.

238
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,266
‐ Charlie. Hi‐yee!

239
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:08,145
I don't know why I just said "hi"
like that. I'm nervous.

240
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,980
‐ It's fine. Nice to meet you.
‐ Yeah.

241
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,065
You look just like your pics, thank God.

242
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,110
A lot of people use those ring light
things that make their pores disappear,

243
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,321
and they end up looking like
hideous monsters in real life,

244
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,866
but you don't.
So, drop that skincare routine, sis!

245
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,619
‐ Thanks. Thank you.
[Rahim chuckles]

246
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,538
What's good here?

247
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,292
‐ Ah, well, the chili mocha latte
is my personal obsesh.

248
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,544
She's serving spicy, she's serving sweet.

249
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,129
You need her in your life.

250
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,509
‐ "Her" as in the, the coffee?

251
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,095
‐ Uh, why don't you order,
and I'll grab us a table?

252
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,430
‐ Hey, um...

253
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,474
Sorry. Uh...

254
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:48,310
You're, you're just different
from how I pictured.

255
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,105
‐ What do you mean?
‐ No, I just‐‐ Like the...

256
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,357
The way you talk.

257
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:57,277
And like, the way you... are.

258
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,696
Sorry, I‐‐

259
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,407
I tend to go for guys
who are a bit more masculine?

260
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,618
No offense.

261
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,869
‐ Oh.

262
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,496
CHARLIE:
Yeah. It's just my preference.

263
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,916
RAHIM: Yeah. No, if you're not into it,
you're not into it.

264
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,130
[door opens]

265
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,303
[door closes]

266
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,849
‐ I kind of wish
he'd decapitated me instead.

267
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,690
I'm so embarrassed.

268
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,483
I can't believe you just saw that.

269
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,652
‐ No, he should be embarrassed.
What a dick.

270
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,072
‐ No. I, I get it.
If he's into "masc" guys or whatever,

271
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,116
I'm never gonna be that.

272
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,034
I'm wearing lavender suede.

273
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,287
‐ Okay, first off, that jacket is fire,
and you know it.

274
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,790
And secondly, don't let one stupid boy
ruin what's great about you.

275
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,042
‐ Except it's not just one stupid boy.

276
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,505
You know, a lot of people see me as just
this funny, fruity beanpole,

277
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,966
and nothing else.
‐ All right, that's bullshit.

278
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,635
You're tall, you're smart,
you're super handsome‐‐

279
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,012
‐ Super handsome?

280
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,890
‐ Stop. I'm just saying that objectively,

281
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,141
you're a very good looking guy.

282
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,728
‐ Okay. Okay, this is the content
I signed up for.

283
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:15,647
Can you start an OnlyFans where
it's just you complimenting me?

284
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,900
Maybe in an ASMR whisper voice?

285
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,694
‐ I'm trying to tell you something.

286
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,446
You're a catch, Rahim.

287
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,283
And, uh,

288
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:29,620
if we went to a gay bar,
you would totally clean up.

289
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,832
‐ Well. I'm pretty sure you would
clean up at a gay bar, too.

290
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,669
If you were single.
Which you're not.

291
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,380
Because things are gonna work out
between you and Benji.

292
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,091
‐ Maybe. Or maybe not.

293
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,470
[phone vibrating]

294
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,393
It's just my mom.

295
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,520
‐ Oh. Sorry.

296
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,690
‐ You know what?
We don't we go to a gay bar?

297
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,944
‐ Really? I don't have, like,
an ID or anything.

298
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,821
‐ So? I went to one in New York,
and they never even checked.

299
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,116
RAHIM:
Ugh, no...

300
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,452
‐ Okay, we can do this.
Just act confident,

301
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,288
and try to make yourself look older,
like, like, beaten down by life.

302
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,373
‐ Right.

303
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,418
‐ No. It's not gonna work.
‐ God, we're never gonna get in.

304
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,760
