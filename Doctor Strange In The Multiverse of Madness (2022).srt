4
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,494
- Did that kill it?
- No.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,933
That, that will kill it.

6
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,761
The Book of Vishanti!

7
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:15,085
We can't let it take your
power. Get to the book.

8
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,174
- How do we get across?
- Jump!

9
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:08,582
It's too strong.
I can't hold it.

10
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:38,307
I'm so sorry. This
is the only way.

11
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:42,419
What are you doing?!

12
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:46,243
I can't let that thing take
your power. You can't control it.

13
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:48,669
But I can.

14
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,951
But we're friends!

15
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:54,477
- You're killing me.
- I know.

16
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,898
But in the grand
calculus of the Multiverse,

17
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:01,611
your sacrifice is worth
more than your life.

18
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,314
Excuse me.

19
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:27,547
Thanks.

20
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,523
Doctor Strange.

21
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,657
Doctor West.

22
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,645
Haven't seen you in a while.

23
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,875
Well, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years.

24
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,517
So were a lot of us.

25
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:03,974
While I was gone...

26
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,591
... thank you for asking...

27
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,660
I lost both my cats.

28
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:13,775
And my brother.

29
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm very sorry.

30
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:20,884
Thank you.

31
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,232
I, uh...

32
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:28,892
I guess what keeps me
up at night is wondering...

33
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,742
Did it have to happen that way?

34
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,461
Was there any other path?

35
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,314
No.

36
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,796
No, I made the only play we had.

37
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,297
Oh, of course, you did.

38
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:50,402
The best surgeon
and the best superhero.

39
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:56,573
But you still
didn't get the girl.

40
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,509
Glass of red, please?

41
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:48,707
Allow me, Miss.

42
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,961
A little too on the nose?

43
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:54,414
What, for you, at my wedding?

44
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,583
Nah. It was perfect.

45
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,177
Congratulations.

46
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,447
Thank you.

47
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,551
There's Charlie.

48
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,590
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

49
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,747
It's embarassing, but
he's a big fan. So...

50
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,021
Hey, uh, Christine... umm...

51
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,325
I should have...

52
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,510
I wish it had been different.

53
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,451
I never stopped caring about us,

54
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,491
but I had to make sacrifices.

55
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,724
To protect you.

56
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:24,908
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:31,328
It was never gonna
work out between us.

58
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,160
Why not?

59
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,405
Because Stephen...

60
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,160
You have to be the
one holding the knife.

61
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,272
And I always respected you
for it, but I couldn't love you for it.

62
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,449
How long have you
had that one in the barrel?

63
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,780
Long time.

64
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,021
Yeah. I bet.

65
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,081
Truly, I'm just glad
that you're happy.

66
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,303
I am.

67
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,746
I really, really am.

68
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:08,543
Good.

69
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,375
Are you?

70
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,045
I'm happy.

71
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:13,419
Good.

72
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,404
You deserve it.

73
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,224
Thank you.

74
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:41,937
Look out!

75
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:54,318
Do I know you?

76
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:45,844
You're welcome.

77
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:50,390
Do you know it's ancient custom to bow
in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?

78
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:52,455
Yeah. I'm aware of the customs.

79
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,493
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Whoa!

80
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,475
Ho-ho-ho!

81
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,652
- That's incredible.
- Yeah.

82
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,768
- Who's this?
- Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

83
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:33,827
Hey, kid.

84
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:35,730
What did that
creature want with you?

85
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:36,905
Where are your parents?

86
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:38,365
Take her back to the Sanct...

87
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,929
She took my slingy.

88
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,678
She took your slingy.

89
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,612
We're not gonna kill you, kid.

90
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:58,536
I just bust my ass trying to
save your life, remember?

91
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:02,954
Giant monsters, I
can clearly handle.

92
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:06,039
But what bothers me, is that
last night, you were in my dream.

93
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,637
That wasn't a dream.

94
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,695
It was another universe.

95
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:17,389
How much experience do you
guys have with the Multiverse?

96
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,567
We have experience
with the Multiverse.

97
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,807
Most recently, there was
an incident with Spider-Man...

98
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:22,828
Hmm, what Man?

99
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,421
Spider-Man. He has
the powers of a spider.

100
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:26,491
Hence the name.

101
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,580
Gross. Does he
look like a spider?

102
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,838
- No, no. More like a man.
- Climbs walls, shoots webs.

103
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,356
- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?

104
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,982
- No. -Ew.
- No. Maybe. I don't know.

105
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,757
Honestly, I hope not.

106
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,171
Super weird.

107
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,014
You're gonna get a stomachache.

108
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,388
I'm from another universe.

109
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,492
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

110
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:45,560
I don't.

111
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:48,436
I don't even know if you're
from another universe.

112
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:51,135
Which is why I'm still sitting here
waiting for you to enlighten us.

113
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:52,543
Frankly,

114
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,863
of the two Doctor
Stranges that I've met,

115
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,533
you are not my favorite.

116
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,276
Which means?

117
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,712
He can't speak Spanish?

118
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,426
I don't even know if he
speaks his own language.

119
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,506
Look, I left a very nice
wedding to save a smartass kid

120
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,160
from getting eaten
by an octopus.

121
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,887
- Whose wedding?
- -Tell me... Christine's.

122
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,615
- You went?
- Holy shit. You married Christine?

123
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,298
Do you mind?

124
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:14,938
Yes, I do. No, I didn't. Yes.

125
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:17,475
You need to explain
to me what's going on.

126
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,394
Why was that octopus
trying to eat you?

127
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:21,378
That thing was
trying to kidnap me.

128
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:24,373
It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.

129
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:27,668
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

130
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:28,922
What power?

131
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,167
I can travel the Multiverse.

132
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:33,687
What?

133
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,039
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

134
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,779
- How?
- That's the problem. I don't know how.

135
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:40,649
I can't control it.

136
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,122
It only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.

137
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:47,124
Okay. Did the other me know
how to defeat this demon?

138
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:50,588
Well, you just knew this
magical book of pure good,

139
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:53,800
that gives a sorcerer whatever
they need to defeat their enemy.

140
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,137
The Book of Vishanti?

141
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:57,743
It's not real.

142
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,817
It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.

143
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,205
Actually, it does.

144
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:04,900
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

145
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,217
Unbelievable.

146
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,504
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

147
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,078
No, I am not the
Sorcerer Supreme.

148
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,230
Other you was Sorcerer
Supreme of his universe.

149
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,037
Right. Yeah.

150
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,924
Although it does exist,

151
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,318
the Book of Vishanti is
said to be unreachable.

152
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,225
It is, except...

153
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:21,009
we reached it.

154
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:24,336
Then the demon
caught up with us.

155
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,890
I thought you'd
protect me, but...

156
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:31,272
You didn't.

157
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,080
That was the fight in my dream.

158
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:35,602
That wasn't a dream.

159
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:37,232
Prove it.

160
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:46,968
It wasn't a dream.

161
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:55,563
That means...

162
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:00,881
Dreams are windows into the
lives of our Multiversal selves.

163
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:04,101
That was his theory.

164
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,652
So that recurring nightmare where
I'm running naked from a clown...

165
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,207
Somewhere out there, it's real.

166
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,955
Somewhere out
there, I had a ponytail.

167
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,465
There could be more
creatures coming for her.

168
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:18,826
The power is dangerous
enough in the hands of a kid.

169
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,849
Imagine if a real threat acquired it.

170
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,540
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

171
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,175
America Chavez.

172
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,634
Miss Chavez, will you
come with us to Kamar-Taj?

173
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:35,003
You'll be safe there.

174
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,871
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

175
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,853
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

176
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:45,825
What do we do with him?

177
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,226
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

178
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,792
Oh, I've buried worse.

179
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,637
The creature that
killed him, did...

180
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,368
Did it have the same
markings as the octopus?

181
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:06,452
Runes.

182
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,806
This isn't sorcery.

183
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,391
It's witchcraft.

184
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,484
Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?

185
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:18,366
I think I might.

186
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,350
- Chocolate!
- Hey!

187
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,723
What did I say?

188
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,928
But we couldn't wait.

189
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,156
Well what did I say?

190
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,259
Go wash your hands.

191
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:38,535
Mom, come on.
I'm too old for that.

192
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,519
Okay.

193
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,110
You can tuck me in, Mom.

194
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:43,965
I will.

195
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,095
You know...

196
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:50,655
A family is forever.

197
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:54,697
We could never truly leave
each other even if we tried.

198
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:59,277
Mom, I changed my mind. You
can come tuck me in if you want.

199
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,192
Okay.

200
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,649
Love you.

201
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,311
Apples, right?

202
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:40,139
Eventually.

203
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,238
- Smells...
- Sweet.

204
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,399
I was gonna say real.

205
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,355
It's all very real. Thanks.

206
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,270
I put the magic behind me.

207
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:57,714
So I can see.

208
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:00,212
Well, I knew
sooner or later you'd,

209
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:03,088
show up, wanting to discuss
what happened at WestView.

210
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,867
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

211
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,950
But you put things right in the
end and that was never in doubt.

212
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,293
I'm not here to talk
about WestView.

213
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,001
- Then what are you here for?
- We need your help.

214
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,259
With what?

215
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,203
What do you know
about the Multiverse?

216
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:24,808
The Multiverse.

217
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:26,600
Vis had his theories.

218
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,295
He believed it was real.

219
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,608
And, dangerous.

220
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:32,641
Well, he was right about both.

221
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:36,922
We found a girl who can somehow
travel across it but she's being pursued.

222
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,915
- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.

223
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,204
One that covets
her power for itself.

224
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:43,461
Now we've taken her
to Kamar-Taj, and...

225
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,373
We've got our defenses, but...

226
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,043
We could use an Avenger.

227
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,108
There are other Avengers.

228
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,200
Yeah, but given a choice between
the Archer with a mohawk, and

229
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,119
several bug-themed crimefighters,

230
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:54,991
or...

231
00:20:55,016 --> 00:21:00,534
One of the most powerful magic
wielders on the planet, it's an easy call.

232
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,567
Come to Kamar-Taj.

233
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,894
We'll get you back
on the lunch box.

234
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,754
What if you brought
America here?

235
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,062
Here?

236
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:15,528
Yeah. I know what it's like.

237
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:19,312
To be on your own, hunted
for abilities you never wanted.

238
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:21,561
And I can protect her.

239
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,592
You never told me
her name, did you?

240
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:30,591
No.

241
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:33,275
- Hmm.
- No, I didn't.

242
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,323
You know, the hex
was the easy part.

243
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:43,865
The lying, not so much.

244
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,456
The Darkhold.

245
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,014
You're familiar with
the Darkhold?

246
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,813
I know it's the Book
of the Damned.

247
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:19,759
And that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

248
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:21,495
I wonder what it's done to you.

249
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,656
The Darkhold only
showed me the truth.

250
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:27,638
Everything I lost...
can be mine again.

251
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,430
What do you want with America?

252
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,301
What do you want
with the Multiverse?

253
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,929
I'm going to leave this reality,

254
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:37,170
and go to one where I
can be with my children.

255
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,494
Wanda, your
children aren't real.

256
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,000
You created them using magic.

257
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:43,969
That's what every mother does.

258
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,858
If you knew...

259
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:49,484
there was a universe,

260
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,210
where you were happy,
wouldn't you wanna go there?

261
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:56,363
I am happy.

262
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:59,432
I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.

263
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:04,107
What you're doing is a flagrant
violation of every natural law.

264
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,866
And if you take that child's power,

265
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:07,103
she won't survive.

266
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:09,344
I don't relish hurting
anyone, Stephen.

267
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:11,376
But she's not a child.

268
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,424
She's a supernatural being.

269
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,981
Such raw power could wreak
havoc on this, and other worlds.

270
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:21,628
Her sacrifice, would
be for the greater good.

271
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:23,427
Well you can kiss the
lunchbox goodbye 'cause

272
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,772
that's the kind of
justification our enemies use.

273
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,491
Is it the one you use?

274
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,678
When you gave
Thanos the Time Stone?

275
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:37,647
That was at war, and I
did what I had to do.

276
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,085
You break the rules
and become a hero.

277
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,294
I do it and I become the enemy.

278
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,582
That doesn't seem fair.

279
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,499
What happens now?

280
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,539
Return to Kamar-Taj,

281
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:53,593
and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.

282
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,177
Peacefully.

283
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,468
After that...

284
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,517
You'll never see me again.

285
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,308
And if we don't?

286
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,912
Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.

287
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:17,867
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

288
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:29,892
Scarlet Witch.

289
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,271
Wanda's gone.

290
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,708
She's got the Darkhold
or the Darkhold has her.

291
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:44,368
The Scarlet Witch is a being
of unfathomable magic.

292
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:47,748
She can rewrite
reality as she chooses,

293
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:51,436
and is prophesized
to either rule,

294
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:53,766
or annihilate the cosmos.

295
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:56,899
She took over a whole
town using her mind.

296
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,860
If she gets America's power...

297
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:04,122
she could enslave
the entire Multiverse.

298
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,196
So the person you
went to ask for help,

299
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,846
and told exactly where I am,

300
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:12,863
is the person that's
trying to kill me?

301
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,159
Yeah.

302
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,430
Suspend teaching at once.

303
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,957
And arm the students.

304
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:21,840
Kamar-Taj must now
become a fortress.

305
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,530
Wow.

306
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,368
That's the Masters of the Hong
Kong and London Sanctum.

307
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:05,617
We are honored to face death
again by your side.

308
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:06,732
The honor is ours.

309
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:10,628
Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme
asks of us, it shall be done.

310
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:15,110
It's ancient custom.

311
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,518
Choose your words wisely.

312
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:22,402
The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.

313
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:23,357
Got it.

314
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,259
No pressure, then.

315
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,413
All this for a child
you met yesterday?

316
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,839
Wanda, you are
justifiably angry.

317
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,411
You had to make
terrible sacrifices.

318
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,513
I blew a hole through the
head of the man I loved.

319
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,255
And it meant nothing.

320
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:58,328
Do not speak to me of
sacrifice, Stephen Strange.

321
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,414
If you give me what I want...

322
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,700
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

323
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:18,347
The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.

324
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:21,873
Defensive positions. Now!

325
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:31,289
Do not dare to enter
these sacred grounds.

326
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:34,928
You have... no idea just
how reasonable I have been.

327
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,168
Yeah. Book of the
Damned, calling yourself a

328
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:39,008
Witch, conjuring
creatures to abduct a kid...

329
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:41,643
I don't exactly call
that being reasonable.

330
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:45,690
Sending those creatures after
her instead of myself was mercy.

331
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,714
And in spite of
your hypocrisies...

332
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:54,525
and insults, I have begged
you to safely get out of my way.

333
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,247
You have exhausted my patience.

334
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,911
But I do hope you understand...

335
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,863
that even now...

336
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:06,056
what's about to happen...

337
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,831
This is me, being...

338
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:12,064
reasonable.

339
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:22,580
Hold!

340
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,568
Hold!

341
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:41,504
Nailed it.

342
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:47,416
Reinforce the shield!

343
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,262
Reinforce the shield!

344
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,806
Reinforce the shield!

345
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,253
She's trying to
get in their heads.

346
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:15,321
Sorcerers! Fortify your mind!

347
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:28,506
Run.

348
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:53,955
The shield is down!

349
00:30:58,943 --> 00:30:59,973
Fire!

350
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:04,454
Yes!

351
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,533
Take cover!

352
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,766
Fire at will!

353
00:31:34,034 --> 00:31:35,489
Fall back!

354
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,686
Wong! Get out of here!

355
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,559
Go go go!

356
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,692
You want the girl, you'll
have to go through me.

357
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,021
Fine.

358
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,813
We gotta get you
out of here. Now.

359
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:55,787
- Why? What happened?
- Kamar-Taj has fallen.

360
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:10,864
Reflections.

361
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,708
She's using the
reflections. Cover them!

362
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,383
You gave all those lives just
to keep me from my children.

363
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:51,134
You took those lives.

364
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:54,265
You cannot be allowed to
cross into the Multiverse.

365
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:56,618
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

366
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:58,265
I'm a mother.

367
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:00,740
Wanda, you have no children.

368
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,484
They don't exist.

369
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:03,913
Oh but they do.

370
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,274
In every other universe.

371
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,974
I know they do.

372
00:35:09,713 --> 00:35:11,336
Because I dream of them...

373
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:14,666
Every... night.

374
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:22,932
(Now, boys!)

375
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,256
(Mom! Won't you...)

376
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:25,509
(...no, mom!)

377
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:27,671
(- Go back, go back!)
(- All right.)

378
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,036
Of my boys....

379
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:33,314
Of our life together.

380
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:36,829
(- Ha ha ha!)
(- Hey!)

381
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:39,889
(Can I have some? Please?)

382
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,754
(- Are you guys ready?)
(- I love you mom.)

383
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,951
Every night,

384
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:49,011
the same dream.

385
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:52,128
And every morning...

386
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:56,538
the same...

387
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,161
nightmare.

388
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,734
What if you reach them?

389
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:06,293
What happens to the other you?

390
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,801
What happens to their mother?

391
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,022
You okay?

392
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,084
You saved me.

393
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:02,956
I hope so.

394
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:08,578
Surprised you didn't puke.

395
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,602
That's not my
first weird trip, kid.

396
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,066
So. This is New
York in the Multiv-urp---

397
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,620
There it is.

398
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,949
Ah! Crap.

399
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:29,753
Cut it out.

400
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:35,111
Yeah. You got pretty dinged up.

401
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:37,745
We'll get you fixed.

402
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:39,786
All right, America.

403
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:42,735
You gotta open a portal
to get us back there right now.

404
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,067
Well, I don't know how.

405
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,274
You just did it.

406
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,166
Not on purpose.

407
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:49,338
Wong is back there alone with
Wanda and I'm the only hope he has.

408
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:50,527
I can't control my powers...

409
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:52,849
You must be able to control
it somehow. Even I could...

410
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,756
Sorry.

411
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:02,696
Well, what about this universe's version
of you? Maybe she can control her powers.

412
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:04,784
This universe doesn't have a me.

413
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,665
- What?
- None of them do.

414
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:07,853
Well how do you know that?

415
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,170
Because I've looked.

416
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:12,962
And... because I never dream.

417
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,150
It's okay, kid.

418
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:24,979
Even if you could get me back
there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.

419
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:27,751
- What about the Book of Vishanti?
- What about it?

420
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,256
Other you thought it could
stop whoever was after me.

421
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,682
Yeah, well, good for other
me. He's not here, is he?

422
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,477
I don't know where it is. So
unless there's another other me...

423
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,182
We need to go find...

424
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:42,257
Other "other me".

425
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:15,502
We go on red?

426
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:17,931
Rule number one
of Multiversal travel?

427
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,084
You don't know anything.

428
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:21,202
Right.

429
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:25,805
It's red.

430
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:30,447
So, what's rule number two?

431
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,269
America?

432
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,309
America?

433
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:40,471
Rule number two?

434
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:41,612
Find food.

435
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,214
Preferrably, pizza. Pizza balls.

436
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,111
How'd you pay for that?

437
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:47,211
It was free.

438
00:40:47,332 --> 00:40:49,533
Food's free in most
universes, actually.

439
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:51,421
It's weird you guys
have to pay for it.

440
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:52,538
Hey.

441
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:53,992
You didn't pay for that.

442
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,297
Crap. Maybe it's not free here.

443
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,378
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

444
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:00,417
Alright, Pizza Poppa.
Relax, she's just a kid...

445
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:02,946
Relax yourself
there, Doctor Strange.

446
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,944
Where did you get
this cape from anyway?

447
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,759
Oh, that feels authentic.

448
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:09,944
It's not a cape, it's a cloak.
And I suggest you let go.

449
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:13,277
You took this whole suit from
the Strange Museum, didn't ya?

450
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,422
- Strange Museum?
- You're a taker.

451
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,253
Why don't you take
some mustard, huh?!

452
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:28,250
Come on. It's not permanent.

453
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:30,773
Is it gonna stop
in a few minutes?

454
00:41:31,785 --> 00:41:33,070
About three weeks.

455
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:41,425
Those universes we went through,
were we paint in one of them?

456
00:41:41,513 --> 00:41:43,723
Yeah. You don't
wanna get stuck in there.

457
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,763
It's really hard to eat.

458
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:48,695
How many universes
have you been through?

459
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:51,900
Seventy-two?

460
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:53,562
Seventy-three, counting this one.

461
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,824
That's...

462
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,398
That's a lot.

463
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,667
Memory Lane.

464
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:01,160
Replay your significant memories,

465

We remember,
so you don't forget.

466
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,289
This is pretty fancy.

467
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:14,930
Sure you won't have to
take out another student loan?

468
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:18,859
Nah. I just sold one of those
kidneys that we operated on last week.

469
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:24,311
So, I got you a little something...

470
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,310
Congratulations.

471
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:30,450
What is it?

472
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:32,169
Open it and see.

473
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:38,556
Christine, this is...

474
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:41,800
This is amazing. Thank you.

475
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:44,886
We don't have time for this.

476
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:48,846
Memory Lane.

477
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:52,436
Replay your significant memories,
now at a discounted price.

478
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:54,741
We remember,
so you don't forget.

479
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:02,495
Where's this?

480
00:43:04,828 --> 00:43:05,750
Home.

481
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,338
My moms.

482
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:57,876
Yeah, you were right. This
is just a waste of time.

483
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:58,919
Hey, kid.

484
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:02,576
That was the first time that
you opened a portal, right?

485
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:03,734
It doesn't matter.

486
00:44:03,782 --> 00:44:05,563
It does matter. You lost your parents.

487
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:07,051
I didn't lose them.

488
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:08,423
I killed them.

489
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:10,367
No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.

490
00:44:10,456 --> 00:44:13,242
Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control,

491
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:16,070
and sent them to a random, probably
deadly universe with no way to escape.

492
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:18,889
Listen, if your moms are
anything like their daughter...

493
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:20,408
They survived.

494
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,178
I'm sure you'll meet
them again someday.

495
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,070
Not bad.

496
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,400
Thanks.

497
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:36,085
That woman, in your memory
bank thing, that was Christine, right?

498
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:40,271
Yes, that was Christine.
How do you know her?

499
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:41,579
From other you.

500
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,155
Were they together?

501
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:44,496
No, they didn't talk anymore.

502
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:45,741
You blew it.

503
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,099
Of course.

504
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:50,347
Did you blow it
with your Christine?

505
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:53,045
Yes, I guess I did.

506
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,084
Why?

507
00:44:55,957 --> 00:44:57,017
Complicated.

508
00:44:57,057 --> 00:44:59,506
More complicated than being chased
by a witch through the Multiverse?

509
00:44:59,554 --> 00:45:00,970
Yes, actually. It is.

510
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:44,057
"Gave his life
defeating Thanos?"

511
00:45:44,104 --> 00:45:45,992
Yeah, see? We're not all bad.

512
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,852
If other you's dead...

513
00:45:49,464 --> 00:45:51,141
Who's master of the Sanctum?

514
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:59,089
Oh, shit.

515
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,415
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

516
00:46:10,712 --> 00:46:13,074
He's actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.

517
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:14,093
Oh, great.

518
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,919
And then he snapped and
dedicated his life trying to kill me.

519
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:18,141
Oh...

520
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:19,869
Great.

521
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:27,291
I always suspected
this day would come.

522
00:46:27,396 --> 00:46:28,416
You did?

523
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:29,531
Yes.

524
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,287
Because you always
suspected this day would come.

525
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:43,584
My brother.

526
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:49,035
All right.

527
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:54,030
Come in, and tell me everything...

528
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,371
About your universe.

529
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,640
We go on red.

530
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:08,428
And you're quite formidable too, it seems.

531
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,998
A multiversal traveler.

532
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,705
Well thank the stars you
brought Doctor Strange to safety.

533
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,231
Well, just 'cause we jumped
ship, doesn't mean we're safe.

534
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:22,225
Our Wanda has the ability to conjure
demons and monsters to attack America

535
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:25,053
- in other universes.
- So she has the Darkhold?

536
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:26,766
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

537
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:29,304
Oh, yes. We have a
Darkhold in this universe, too.

538
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,763
I got it here in this Sanctum.

539
00:47:31,788 --> 00:47:35,602
We would never risk a weapon that
dangerous falling into the wrong hands.

540
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:36,807
Damn right.

541
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:38,839
If your Darkhold is
anything like ours,

542
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:42,631
I'm afraid she can do far worse
than just summon monsters,

543
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,406
to come after you here.

544
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:45,861
What do you mean?

545
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:47,153
There is a spell

546
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,893
contained within those pages.

547
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:53,645
Corrosive to the soul.

548
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,565
A desecration of reality itself.

549
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:00,689
Dreamwalking.

550
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:07,177
A dreamwalking sorcerer projects their
own consciousness from their universe

551
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:08,576
into another.

552
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:12,415
Possessing the body
of an alternate self.

553
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:18,138
They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger,

554
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,506
and pursue their
enemies from afar.

555
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:27,608
The possession is not a
permanent link between realities,

556
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:31,093
but in the fleeting
time they dreamwalk,

557
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:34,845
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

558
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,620
So it may not be a
demon that you face.

559
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:46,034
It may be, the Scarlet Witch.

560
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,399
But, why didn't she
do that to begin with?

561
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,809
Because that was
her being reasonable.

562
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,686
What do you know of
the Book of Vishanti?

563
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:56,790
The Darkhold's antithesis.

564
00:48:57,626 --> 00:49:01,787
It can give a sorcerer whatever power
they need to vanquish their enemy.

565
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,105
I need your help to...

566
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:11,048
I'm sorry, Stephen.

567
00:49:12,512 --> 00:49:16,175
But I hope you, of all
people, understand...

568
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:20,873
That it is not Wanda Maximoff
who threatens our reality.

569
00:49:22,189 --> 00:49:23,716
It's the two of you.

570
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:26,837
What was in that tea?

571
00:49:31,062 --> 00:49:33,134
You son of a bitch...

572
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:47,404
The Sands of Nisanti.

573
00:49:48,097 --> 00:49:51,134
I've only acted, as you would.

574
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:55,855
She's coming.

575
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,164
Boys, it's time for bed.

576
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:22,381
- Can we have one more ice cream?
- Un-un.

577
00:50:22,558 --> 00:50:23,763
- Please, please...
- Please!

578
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,812
Make mom out to be the bad guy.

579
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:27,554
- You know who's best?
- Who?

580
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:29,668
2003 Tigers.

581
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,904
They suck.
They're so bad.

582
00:50:32,231 --> 00:50:34,863
Hey. No they don't,
they're the best.

583
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,082
Mom?

584
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:45,958
Yes, sweetheart?

585
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:47,706
Where are you going?

586
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:53,605
Just... to take out the trash.

587
00:51:55,021 --> 00:51:56,660
Can we show you something?

588
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:01,415
Mom, hurry. Come on!

589
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:03,174
Come on, it's important.

590
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,070
Mom! You'll like it.

591
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,045
Mom!

592
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,744
Hurry up. It's important.

593
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:11,795
Okay, so mom...

594
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:13,835
Listen to this.

595
00:52:13,874 --> 00:52:15,801
- I'm gonna start it.
- No, I wanna start it.

596
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:18,101
- I wanna start it!
- No, I wanna start!

597
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:20,085
Why don't you both...

598
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:24,052
start it... whatever...

599
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:26,390
... it is, together?

600
00:52:27,138 --> 00:52:28,272
- Okay.
- Okay.

601
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:29,873
- You ready?
- Yeah.

602
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:32,616
Three, two, one, go.

603
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:39,878
We like ice cream
like every child should...

604
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:47,797
And if we get some ice
cream, we promise to be

605
00:52:48,112 --> 00:52:49,132
good!

606
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:17,893
You're alive.

607
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:18,923
Yes.

608
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:21,605
But so many others were lost.

609
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:26,810
Set me free. I need
to destroy the book.

610
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:30,393
No. It cannot be you.

611
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,366
No!

612
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,974
Mom! What happened?

613
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,164
- What?
- Are you okay?

614
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:10,300
Billy. Tommy.

615
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:19,512
No. No.

616
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,817
I need the Darkhold spells.

617
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:46,992
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

618
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,738
Tell me what you know.

619
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:52,514
You'll have to kill me, witch.

620
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:53,911
Not you.

621
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,289
Them.

622
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:03,944
Wanda, stop.

623
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:08,202
Wanda, please.

624
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:14,942
The Darkhold was a copy!

625
00:55:17,777 --> 00:55:18,862
A copy?

626
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:21,641
Legend speaks of a
mountain with the wretched

627
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:23,625
spells you seek
carved into its walls.

628
00:55:24,379 --> 00:55:27,055
It's there the Darkhold
was transcribed.

629
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,890
Mount Wundagore.

630
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,923
Wundagore?

631
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:34,493
No one has survived the journey.

632
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:40,977
Perhaps we will
be the exception.

633
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:49,751
Hey.

634
00:55:51,502 --> 00:55:52,218
Hey!

635
00:56:05,173 --> 00:56:06,707
This universe sucks!

636
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:10,772
Cloak?

637
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:23,801
Hey.

638
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,733
Hey, Labcoat.

639
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:28,653
Where the hell are we?

640
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:32,646
Look, I don't know who you are or what
you think you're trying to do here, but...

641
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:37,586
These situations don't usually work out
well for the nameless scientist, so just...

642
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:42,821
Christine?

643
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:46,036
Hello, Stephen.

644
00:56:46,517 --> 00:56:47,537
Ay, Dios.

645
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:49,777
Miss Chavez.

646
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:55,183
To answer your question, you are
in a highly secure research facility.

647
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:57,408
The two of you, along
with your sentient

648
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,416
cloak, are here for
surveillance and testing.

649
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,021
Testing?

650
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:04,761
Well, yes. You're visitors
from another universe.

651
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:08,231
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive.

652
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:10,961
You may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.

653
00:57:11,837 --> 00:57:14,550
Hence these amazing
polycarbonate fishbowls.

654
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,415
All right. So, I have you
to thank for these then.

655
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,495
Yes, I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.

656
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:25,089
One of 838-Stephen's
magical relics.

657
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:27,805
838-Stephen. Is that
some kinda cyborg me?

658
00:57:27,886 --> 00:57:29,822
Our universe is 838.

659
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:32,311
And we've designated yours 616.

660
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:33,420
Oh.

661
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,493
You guys sure must know
a lot about the Multiverse

662
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:37,717
if you got someone going
around naming realities.

663
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:38,713
Yes.

664
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:40,383
Me.

665
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:42,834
I'm a senior fellow at
the Baxter Foundation,

666
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:45,187
and I specialize in
Multiversal research.

667
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:50,917
So, how'd you end up
working here? Wherever here is.

668
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:53,165
Well, I volunteered.

669
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,141
At your funeral.

670
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:57,631
Thank you for going.

671
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,551
Your injuries, they're...

672
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,544
They're similar, but
they're not identical.

673
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:02,789
It's fascinating.

674
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,685
What were we, to each
other in this universe?

675
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:18,388
We never quite figured that out.

676
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,882
Yeah.

677
00:58:21,294 --> 00:58:23,262
Well that's something
we got in common.

678
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:27,062
Christine...

679
00:58:27,986 --> 00:58:29,673
You gotta let us out of here.

680
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:34,058
Everyone's in real danger.
Look, I know you don't know me...

681
00:58:34,107 --> 00:58:38,210
And I don't want to. Whatever
I was to you, in your universe,

682
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:39,488
does not matter.

683
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:41,672
Why not?

684
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:48,940
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

685
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:53,121
Someone from my
universe wants that girl.

686
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:57,321
And she's gonna rip this place apart, atom
by atom, until she gets what she wants.

687
00:58:57,442 --> 00:59:01,055
So I don't care, if you're from the
Avengers, or S.H.I.E.L.D...

688
00:59:01,135 --> 00:59:02,284
We're neither.

689
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,279
Well, what then? Hydra?

690
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:13,926
The Illuminati,
will see you now.

691
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:16,142
The Illumi-whati?

692
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,370
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

693
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:31,840
It's gonna be okay.

694
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:03,285
You couldn't portal us up there?

695
01:00:03,855 --> 01:00:05,968
My magic can
only take us so far.

696
01:00:06,884 --> 01:00:08,828
Masters of the Mystic
Arts weren't meant to

697
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,157
tread upon the forbidden
grounds of Wundagore.

698
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:38,041
Eons ago...

699
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,942
The first demon, Chthon,

700
01:00:41,488 --> 01:00:44,620
carved his dark
magic into this tomb.

701
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:50,268
These same spells were later
transcribed into the Darkhold.

702
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:09,284
There's no telling what
soulless monstrosities lie within.

703
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:53,456
They've been waiting for me.

704
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:03,056
This isn't a tomb.

705
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:08,854
It's a throne.

706
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,585
Stephen Strange...

707
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,991
You are now called
before the Illuminati.

708
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,639
I, Baron Karl Mordo,

709
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:53,222
The Sorcerer Supreme, hereby...

710
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,170
Karl?

711
01:02:58,789 --> 01:03:00,339
Captain Carter.

712
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:01,857
The First Avenger.

713
01:03:03,255 --> 01:03:04,637
Blackagar Boltagon.

714
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:06,081
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists.

715
01:03:06,107 --> 01:03:07,503
The Inhuman King.

716
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,455
Blackagar Boltagard?
Huh.

717
01:03:10,156 --> 01:03:11,523
Hey, the guy under there.

718
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:14,229
Captain Marvel.

719
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:15,595
Defender of the Cosmos.

720
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:19,974
And the smartest man alive,

721
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:23,073
Reed Richards of
the Fantastic Four.

722
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,451
Hello, Stephen.

723
01:03:25,508 --> 01:03:27,909
Fantastic Four? Didn't you
guys chart in the sixties?

724
01:03:27,982 --> 01:03:29,733
I'm sorry. Is this
a joke to you?

725
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:32,802
Well there's a guy over there with a
fork on his head, so, yeah. A little bit.

726
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,996
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.

727
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:39,051
Why? Does he have bad breath?

728
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:41,165
This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

729
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:43,181
No. Just more alive.

730
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,297
For now.

731
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:49,615
Stephen, your arrival here
confuses and destabilizes reality.

732
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:53,864
The larger the footprint you leave behind,
the greater the risk of an incursion.

733
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:56,186
- Incursion?
- An incusion occurs,

734
01:03:56,259 --> 01:04:00,557
when the boundary between two
universes erodes, and they collide.

735
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:05,102
Destroying one,
or both, entirely.

736
01:04:06,148 --> 01:04:09,360
Your alternate self created
the Illuminati, to make

737
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,456
difficult decisions
that no one else could.

738
01:04:11,793 --> 01:04:15,279
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you, and the child.

739
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:17,182
So, before we vote,

740
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:20,959
if you got anything serious
to say, now's the time.

741
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:22,107
Yeah, I do.

742
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,421
If it's incursions you're worried
about, do you seriously

743
01:04:24,446 --> 01:04:26,572
think I'm a bigger threat
than the Scarlet Witch?

744
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:29,922
Oh, we can handle your little
witch if she decides to dreamwalk.

745
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:33,210
No. No, you cannot, not unless
you give me the Book of Vishanti.

746
01:04:33,338 --> 01:04:36,873
We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but
it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear.

747
01:04:37,185 --> 01:04:40,744
From our experience, the greatest
danger to the Multiverse, it turns out...

748
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,447
is Doctor Strange.

749
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:48,262
Wait, your Doctor Strange? Earth's
Mightiest Hero who died defeating Thanos?

750
01:04:48,897 --> 01:04:50,456
We should tell him the truth.

751
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:00,226
Our final member...

752
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:02,826
Professor Charles Xavier.

753
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:05,647
What truth?

754
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:08,168
That's not how our Strange died.

755
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,849
You're wondering
what happens now.

756
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,980
No. That I've already accepted.

757
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:34,068
But I do wonder...

758
01:05:35,354 --> 01:05:38,309
When you could force America to
send you to any universe you want,

759
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:41,120
Why take her power for your own?

760
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,671
You know it will kill her.

761
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:45,016
For Billy and Tommy.
To protect them.

762
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,951
What if they get sick?

763
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:51,218
In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

764
01:05:52,593 --> 01:05:55,428
A solution to every problem.

765
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,386
I won't lose them again.

766
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:03,622
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

767
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:04,675
But I can.

768
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:06,539
Look around you.

769
01:06:08,129 --> 01:06:09,792
It's carved in stone.

770
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,315
I was meant to rule everything.

771
01:06:19,336 --> 01:06:20,632
But that's not what I want.

772
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:23,136
I just want my boys.

773
01:06:23,216 --> 01:06:25,079
At the cost of a child's life!

774
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:27,848
Is there no peace
in knowing that,

775
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,010
even though you can't
be with the ones you love,

776
01:06:30,147 --> 01:06:33,714
there are worlds where you
are together. Is that not enough?

777
01:06:35,506 --> 01:06:36,365
No.

778
01:07:13,552 --> 01:07:16,613
Our Strange did not
die defeating Thanos.

779
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:18,725
We were at war.

780
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:22,402
While the rest of us banded
together to try to stop Thanos,

781
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:26,539
Stephen, as always,
chose to go it alone.

782
01:07:26,716 --> 01:07:29,681
He turned to the Darkhold.
Began dreamwalking.

783
01:07:30,138 --> 01:07:32,926
In hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.

784
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,368
And guess what? It didn't.

785
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:37,304
But he kept doing it anyway.

786
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:41,249
One night, you called us all together,
confessed that you'd been dreamwalking.

787
01:07:41,465 --> 01:07:44,526
And in your words, "things
had gotten out of hand."

788
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,674
You never told us the
details of what had happened.

789
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,599
Only that you had inadvertently
triggered an incursion.

790
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:56,344
You, our friend, had caused the
annihilation of another universe.

791
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:00,610
Everyone in that
reality died. Everyone.

792
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,625
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil

793
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:05,173
and helped us
find the Book of Vishanti.

794
01:08:05,454 --> 01:08:09,512
A weapon we did use
together to defeat Thanos.

795
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:12,360
But, one final threat remained.

796
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:41,806
I shall miss you, my friend.

797
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:46,750
I'm ready.

798
01:08:55,306 --> 01:08:56,358
I'm sorry.

799
01:09:19,297 --> 01:09:20,823
Did you tell Christine?

800
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:23,053
Yes.

801
01:09:28,942 --> 01:09:31,046
That statue... what
about the statue?

802
01:09:34,178 --> 01:09:35,681
You built a statue.

803
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:37,447
The world needs heroes.

804
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:41,528
We made the difficult choice because we
knew what our Strange was capable of.

805
01:09:42,797 --> 01:09:46,940
What, perhaps, every Doctor
Strange is capable of.

806
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,440
The building's been breached.

807
01:09:52,846 --> 01:09:54,107
No shit, genius.

808
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,590
Status report on sentries.

809
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,885
Stop or we will...

810
01:10:07,266 --> 01:10:09,290
Stop re...

811
01:10:09,568 --> 01:10:10,957
She's headed for the child.

812
01:10:11,013 --> 01:10:12,740
Watch him. We'll
vote on our return.

813
01:10:14,672 --> 01:10:17,298
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber,

814
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:19,524
you must guide America Chavez.

815
01:10:19,644 --> 01:10:21,121
What the hell are you saying?

816
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:23,717
Save the girl, and get
to the Book of Vishanti.

817
01:10:23,796 --> 01:10:25,226
What, you have the book here?

818
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,588
Yes. You built a waypoint.

819
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:29,645
Charles. We cannot trust him.

820
01:10:29,651 --> 01:10:30,969
I believe we can.

821
01:10:32,326 --> 01:10:34,373
Just because someone
stumbles and loses

822
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:36,752
their way, doesn't
mean they're lost forever.

823
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:40,464
We will see what kind of
Doctor Strange you are.

824
01:10:42,095 --> 01:10:43,115
Thank you.

825
01:10:46,614 --> 01:10:48,639
All sentries on me.

826
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:51,098
Everybody out.

827
01:10:52,523 --> 01:10:54,547
Help!

828
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:56,207
It's Wanda.

829
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,077
Ultron commander...

830
01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:15,333
Ultron command...

831
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:20,709
Hurry, hurry, she's coming.

832
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,744
Oh, no.

833
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,948
Wanda, stop.

834
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:53,258
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

835
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:54,743
Let her go.

836
01:11:57,949 --> 01:11:58,800
Please.

837
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:02,666
I have children of my
own. I understand your pain.

838
01:12:03,197 --> 01:12:04,932
Is their mother still alive?

839
01:12:06,442 --> 01:12:07,293
Yes.

840
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:08,458
Good.

841
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:11,380
There will be someone
left to raise them.

842
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:15,188
Wanda...

843
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,658
Black Bolt can destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

844
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:21,350
What mouth?

845
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:22,910
Take me to the Book of Vishanti
so that we can fight her together.

846
01:13:22,936 --> 01:13:25,459
You are in no
position to give orders.

847
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:28,941
My vote will conclude these
proceedings when they return.

848
01:13:41,102 --> 01:13:42,466
Haven't you had enough?

849
01:13:43,513 --> 01:13:44,949
Oh, I could do this all day.

850
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:23,570
Get the hell out of my universe!

851
01:14:58,173 --> 01:14:59,361
They're not coming back.

852
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,631
And you just cast your
vote now to kill your friends.

853
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:09,227
Not that that ever
bothered you before.

854
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:13,683
You know, you hated
me where I came from.

855
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:16,927
And I bet secretly, "my
brother", you hated me here.

856
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:19,339
You must've been so jealous.

857
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:22,640
Do you know what? I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted,

858
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:24,705
hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with.

859
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,513
You know nothing,
of this universe!

860
01:15:26,561 --> 01:15:30,303
I know, that killing Stephen Strange
was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,

861
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:32,440
to becoming Sorcerer
Supreme, and to joining

862
01:15:32,465 --> 01:15:34,794
your little circus of
clowns, the Illuminati.

863
01:15:34,819 --> 01:15:36,248
I'm ready!

864
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,140
To cast my vote.

865
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:42,153
Now..

866
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,114
die!

867
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:49,335
I think I'm beginning
to understand,

868
01:16:49,432 --> 01:16:51,117
why your Mordo,

869
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,254
didn't like you very much!

870
01:16:56,389 --> 01:16:57,528
They're sealed shut!

871
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:08,976
Get back.

872
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:21,012
Whoa.

873
01:17:21,193 --> 01:17:22,193
Whoa.

874
01:17:26,455 --> 01:17:27,379
Enough!

875
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:24,003
Help me. Please...

876
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:25,425
Wanda Maximoff...

877
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:28,405
Your mind is being held
hostage by your alternate self.

878
01:18:31,827 --> 01:18:33,007
Grab my hand.

879
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:38,084
Perhaps, if I can pull you from under
the rubble, the spell shall break.

880
01:19:23,896 --> 01:19:25,940
Hey. You all right?

881
01:19:28,284 --> 01:19:29,431
You okay?

882
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:33,803
You all right?

883
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,015
Yeah.

884
01:19:36,657 --> 01:19:38,682
Hey.

885
01:19:38,918 --> 01:19:39,956
She fixed him.

886
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,658
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

887
01:19:41,684 --> 01:19:44,961
Xavier said I built a waypoint to the
Book of Vishanti. Can you take us there?

888
01:19:44,986 --> 01:19:46,150
How am I supposed to trust you?

889
01:19:46,176 --> 01:19:48,239
I know what happened.
I'm sorry for what he did.

890
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,341
But believe me, the Book
of Vishanti is the only way.

891
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:51,475
Yeah. Your way.

892
01:19:51,629 --> 01:19:53,637
You sound a lot like
my Stephen right now.

893
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:57,259
He had to be the one holding the knife, and
then that knife killed a trillion people.

894
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:59,660
This Stephen is different.

895
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,346
He is. It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.

896
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:05,892
You're not like them.

897
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:11,124
Smart kid.

898
01:20:15,798 --> 01:20:17,197
Give me your hand.

899
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:23,188
Do not make me regret this.

900
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:24,329
I won't.

901
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,414
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

902
01:20:41,928 --> 01:20:43,365
Where does that tunnel go?

903
01:20:43,415 --> 01:20:44,859
Under the river.

904
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:54,510
Go. Go, go, go!

905
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,978
I warned you.

906
01:22:13,613 --> 01:22:15,499
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

907
01:22:15,942 --> 01:22:17,315
hold your breath.

908
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:27,636
Did it kill her?

909
01:22:27,724 --> 01:22:29,356
No, just bought us some time.

910
01:22:30,835 --> 01:22:32,104
The book's through here.

911
01:22:32,144 --> 01:22:33,847
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

912
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:44,715
Shit.

913
01:22:46,402 --> 01:22:49,310
A chant only specific to me,
something only I would know. Come on.

914
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:50,426
Stephen...

915
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:52,147
Come on...

916
01:22:53,263 --> 01:22:54,283
Stephen!

917
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:03,883
Yeah.

918
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:07,875
Thank you.

919
01:23:08,412 --> 01:23:09,287
Sure.

920
01:23:15,335 --> 01:23:16,427
Open sesame.

921
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,072
Come on, kid. You got this.

922
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:55,601
I got this.

923
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:58,928
Yeah.

924
01:24:07,112 --> 01:24:08,300
Are you all right?

925
01:24:08,325 --> 01:24:09,177
Yeah.

926
01:24:11,835 --> 01:24:15,419
This is the gap junction. The
space between universes.

927
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:29,764
All right, Book...

928
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:34,222
Give me what I need.

929
01:25:46,816 --> 01:25:47,885
My boys.

930
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:01,580
This isn't what your
children would want.

931
01:26:17,518 --> 01:26:18,940
They'll never know.

932
01:26:19,478 --> 01:26:21,968
Maybe not. But you will.

933
01:26:25,955 --> 01:26:29,080
Oh, no. Oh, crap!

934
01:26:30,662 --> 01:26:33,610
It's like, this reality
collapsed in on itself.

935
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:37,143
Yeah. Two realities collided.

936
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:41,383
Come on. America doesn't have long.

937
01:26:41,787 --> 01:26:43,369
So where are we going?

938
01:26:43,395 --> 01:26:47,024
Well, if there's still a
Sanctum in this universe,

939
01:26:47,714 --> 01:26:51,361
then there might be
another, other, "other me",

940
01:26:51,426 --> 01:26:54,028
and that's our best shot
at getting back to her.

941
01:27:06,446 --> 01:27:09,806
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about incursions.

942
01:27:11,814 --> 01:27:13,236
Whatever happened...

943
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:17,766
this universe's you didn't do
a very good job of stopping it.

944
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:30,029
I'll tell him you said that.

945
01:28:30,237 --> 01:28:31,112
Hello?

946
01:28:39,354 --> 01:28:40,607
Stop where you are.

947
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:44,960
How did you get here?

948
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:47,025
By accident.

949
01:28:49,209 --> 01:28:52,045
Who are you... what are you?

950
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:54,422
I'm just, one of us.

951
01:28:54,568 --> 01:28:55,925
From the Multiverse?

952
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:57,010
That's right.

953
01:28:59,478 --> 01:29:00,433
Prove it.

954
01:29:03,516 --> 01:29:04,721
We had a sister.

955
01:29:05,557 --> 01:29:06,577
Donna.

956
01:29:09,107 --> 01:29:10,119
She, uh...

957
01:29:11,799 --> 01:29:13,640
She died, when we were kids.

958
01:29:15,919 --> 01:29:16,866
How?

959
01:29:18,409 --> 01:29:19,421
We were...

960
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:22,916
playing on a frozen lake, and...

961
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:29,752
She fell through the ice.

962
01:29:36,547 --> 01:29:37,848
I couldn't save her.

963
01:29:40,507 --> 01:29:41,968
Sounds about right.

964
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:47,368
But we don't talk
about that, do we?

965
01:29:48,678 --> 01:29:49,794
No, we don't.

966
01:29:51,592 --> 01:29:53,970
I suppose your reality
wasn't always like this?

967
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:57,177
I suspect it was
somewhat like yours, until...

968
01:29:57,208 --> 01:29:58,059
Until?

969
01:30:00,004 --> 01:30:01,241
Until I lost.

970
01:30:02,871 --> 01:30:03,939
To whom?

971
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:09,232
What do you want?

972
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,109
I just want to get home.

973
01:30:12,879 --> 01:30:14,237
Yeah, believe me...

974
01:30:14,263 --> 01:30:17,306
I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.

975
01:30:18,462 --> 01:30:19,643
The Darkhold.

976
01:30:19,965 --> 01:30:22,586
You guard the Darkhold
in this universe?

977
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:25,853
Yeah. For good reason.

978
01:30:26,007 --> 01:30:27,702
That's a start. I could use it.

979
01:30:27,766 --> 01:30:29,911
It could help me to
communicate with my universe.

980
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:30,957
Careful.

981
01:30:32,105 --> 01:30:34,755
The Darkhold
exacts a heavy toll.

982
01:30:34,892 --> 01:30:37,767
I don't mean to be callous, but,

983
01:30:37,793 --> 01:30:40,644
how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?

984
01:30:40,731 --> 01:30:42,770
Not just on its reality...

985
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:44,738
On its reader.

986
01:30:45,808 --> 01:30:47,687
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,

987
01:30:47,713 --> 01:30:50,620
but maybe, you could
help to save mine?

988
01:30:53,504 --> 01:30:55,191
Are you happy, Stephen?

989
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:56,997
What?

990
01:30:58,002 --> 01:31:02,364
Are you happy, Stephen?

991
01:31:04,654 --> 01:31:06,340
It's the question that....

992
01:31:08,493 --> 01:31:12,710
Christine Palmer asked
me at her wedding.

993
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,947
I said, yes, of
course, I'm happy.

994
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:22,703
I'm a sorcerer with the power of
gods. What man wouldn't be happy?

995
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:28,203
Then I, came back to this
goddamn haunted house.

996
01:31:29,482 --> 01:31:30,646
Sat down...

997
01:31:32,244 --> 01:31:34,398
and wondered why I'd lied.

998
01:31:36,945 --> 01:31:39,082
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

999
01:31:41,331 --> 01:31:44,568
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1000
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:50,143
Where I had Christine.
Where I was... happy.

1001
01:31:52,402 --> 01:31:53,677
But I didn't find it.

1002
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,597
All I found were more of us.

1003
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:02,038
So I did those Stephens a favor.

1004
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:06,193
You ever had that
dream where you're falling,

1005
01:32:06,218 --> 01:32:09,704
as if you've been
pushed off a tall building?

1006
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,072
That was probably me.

1007
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:26,118
The Darkhold
exacts a heavy toll.

1008
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,452
Okay.

1009
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,240
All the more reason to give
it a rest, so let me have it.

1010
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,248
Here's the deal: I'll let
you use the Darkhold...

1011
01:32:36,075 --> 01:32:38,068
if you give me your Christine.

1012
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:39,658
Yeah...

1013
01:32:40,004 --> 01:32:41,947
I don't think she's
gonna go for that.

1014
01:32:42,165 --> 01:32:42,961
No?

1015
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:45,723
Didn't think so.

1016
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,820
Hang on. We're coming.

1017
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:22,914
What are you doing
with the Darkhold?

1018
01:36:24,971 --> 01:36:26,627
Were you going to dreamwalk?

1019
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:29,201
It's a little bit more than
just dreamwalking.

1020
01:36:29,673 --> 01:36:31,906
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1021
01:36:31,948 --> 01:36:32,750
I know.

1022
01:36:35,094 --> 01:36:36,067
You're right.

1023
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,535
We are all the same.

1024
01:36:39,521 --> 01:36:44,702
But right now, that kid needs me, and
I can't do any of this without your help.

1025
01:36:45,762 --> 01:36:47,699
While I'm under, I
need you to protect my

1026
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:50,270
body, in case they
attack me for trespassing.

1027
01:36:50,446 --> 01:36:51,466
Who's "they"?

1028
01:36:53,394 --> 01:36:55,090
The Souls of the Damned.

1029
01:37:18,241 --> 01:37:19,092
Okay.

1030
01:37:19,253 --> 01:37:22,562
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe?

1031
01:37:23,365 --> 01:37:25,405
So that you can
dreamwalk into them.

1032
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:28,530
Who said they have to be living?

1033
01:38:42,473 --> 01:38:47,437
Stephen Strange, possessing
a dead body is forbidden!

1034
01:38:53,597 --> 01:38:58,057
Cease your dreamwalk, or
face the eternal consequences.

1035
01:39:06,645 --> 01:39:07,720
Stephen!

1036
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:09,786
They're pulling me down.

1037
01:39:11,987 --> 01:39:12,862
Stephen?

1038
01:39:18,205 --> 01:39:19,205
Oh!

1039
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,538
Hang on. Hang on, hang on.

1040
01:39:22,937 --> 01:39:24,057
Where are you?

1041
01:39:24,104 --> 01:39:25,104
Hey.

1042
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:52,070
Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1043
01:40:02,755 --> 01:40:04,411
Go back to hell.

1044
01:40:16,374 --> 01:40:17,386
Stephen...

1045
01:40:19,042 --> 01:40:20,350
I've got you.

1046
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,644
You're a Master
of the Mystic Arts.

1047
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:27,114
They're spirits. Use them.

1048
01:40:32,561 --> 01:40:33,605
Use them.

1049
01:40:36,007 --> 01:40:37,155
Use them.

1050
01:41:48,721 --> 01:41:49,821
Come on!

1051
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:56,679
Uh-oh.

1052
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:26,421
Strange!

1053
01:42:34,911 --> 01:42:36,792
Dreamwalking, you hypocrite!

1054
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:46,646
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me to kill me.

1055
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,356
I don't even wanna know.

1056
01:43:28,736 --> 01:43:30,286
She's breaking free!

1057
01:43:30,977 --> 01:43:31,948
Hold her!

1058
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:34,704
Strange! Take America's power.

1059
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,211
There's no other way.

1060
01:43:43,484 --> 01:43:44,279
Yeah.

1061
01:43:44,545 --> 01:43:46,223
This is the only way.

1062
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:01,953
It's me, in other me's body.

1063
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:08,211
You're gonna take
my power, aren't you?

1064
01:44:09,567 --> 01:44:10,787
Before Wanda can.

1065
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:14,066
It's okay.

1066
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,354
I understand now.

1067
01:44:21,151 --> 01:44:23,762
No, America.

1068
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:28,416
I've come here to tell you to
trust yourself, trust your power.

1069
01:44:28,842 --> 01:44:30,729
That's how we stop her.

1070
01:44:31,927 --> 01:44:33,156
But I can't control it, I...

1071
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,770
Yes, you can.

1072
01:44:35,317 --> 01:44:36,898
You have been all along.

1073
01:44:37,727 --> 01:44:42,610
Every time you opened a portal, you
sent us exactly where we needed to go.

1074
01:44:43,937 --> 01:44:45,271
What about the first time?

1075
01:44:46,117 --> 01:44:48,351
Even that led you
to this moment.

1076
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,042
When you're gonna
kick that witch's ass.

1077
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:16,184
I've got you!

1078
01:45:41,485 --> 01:45:42,368
Uh-huh.

1079
01:45:43,708 --> 01:45:45,226
Mm-mm.

1080
01:46:06,451 --> 01:46:07,899
I can't beat you.

1081
01:46:09,762 --> 01:46:11,457
I'll give you what you want.

1082
01:46:25,618 --> 01:46:26,638
Billy.

1083
01:46:26,679 --> 01:46:27,691
Tommy.

1084
01:46:28,004 --> 01:46:30,269
- Mommy!
- There's a witch!

1085
01:46:30,534 --> 01:46:32,374
What have you done?!

1086
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:33,473
- Mom!
- Mommy!

1087
01:46:33,546 --> 01:46:35,857
- Wait! Boys.
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1088
01:46:36,045 --> 01:46:37,274
I'm your mother!

1089
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,850
Get away from them.

1090
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:42,799
No! Mom!

1091
01:46:44,183 --> 01:46:44,954
No.

1092
01:46:45,605 --> 01:46:46,618
Not yet.

1093
01:46:47,229 --> 01:46:48,281
Mommy!

1094
01:46:48,432 --> 01:46:50,722
Get away from our
mom! Leave her alone!

1095
01:46:50,747 --> 01:46:53,798
Boys, stop. Please.
Wait, boys. Stop.

1096
01:46:54,764 --> 01:46:56,864
- No!
- Go away! - Go!

1097
01:46:56,906 --> 01:46:58,078
Stop it!

1098
01:47:06,707 --> 01:47:08,009
Please don't hurt us.

1099
01:47:09,053 --> 01:47:09,937
Please.

1100
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:12,387
I would never hurt you.

1101
01:47:12,757 --> 01:47:13,777
Never.

1102
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:19,440
I would never hurt
anyone. I'm not a monster.

1103
01:47:20,042 --> 01:47:21,064
I'm not...

1104
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:25,876
I'm...

1105
01:47:43,441 --> 01:47:45,385
Mom. You're okay.

1106
01:47:47,313 --> 01:47:49,588
Okay, okay... I'm okay...

1107
01:48:05,070 --> 01:48:07,359
- No, mom, no!
- Don't go. Don't.

1108
01:48:07,718 --> 01:48:08,569
Mom...

1109
01:48:51,008 --> 01:48:52,614
Know that they'll be loved.

1110
01:49:33,888 --> 01:49:34,779
What now?

1111
01:49:34,821 --> 01:49:36,177
Get out of here.

1112
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,065
I'll find you.

1113
01:49:46,942 --> 01:49:48,805
We have to go. Now.

1114
01:50:01,055 --> 01:50:02,653
I opened the Darkhold.

1115
01:50:03,754 --> 01:50:05,266
I have to close it.

1116
01:50:08,839 --> 01:50:11,869
No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.

1117
01:50:56,534 --> 01:50:57,777
Are you all right?

1118
01:50:58,804 --> 01:51:00,258
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

1119
01:51:01,158 --> 01:51:02,324
Is America okay?

1120
01:51:02,349 --> 01:51:04,267
She's on her way here to get us.

1121
01:51:06,983 --> 01:51:07,938
Wanda?

1122
01:51:09,641 --> 01:51:10,274
No.

1123
01:51:18,878 --> 01:51:22,259
So she destroyed the
Darkhold in every universe.

1124
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:26,808
She did the right thing.

1125
01:51:29,008 --> 01:51:30,028
Yeah, she did.

1126
01:51:37,828 --> 01:51:39,739
What's your universe like?

1127
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,371
It's very beautiful.

1128
01:51:48,303 --> 01:51:49,893
I wish I could show you.

1129
01:51:54,053 --> 01:51:55,386
I'd really like that.

1130
01:52:00,641 --> 01:52:02,247
But I... have to go.

1131
01:52:02,272 --> 01:52:03,284
Yeah.

1132
01:52:04,296 --> 01:52:05,308
Yeah, I know.

1133
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:10,723
It's too bad, though.

1134
01:52:12,986 --> 01:52:14,963
Could have been one
hell of an incursion.

1135
01:52:18,577 --> 01:52:19,749
I love you.

1136
01:52:22,996 --> 01:52:25,600
I love you in every universe.

1137
01:52:29,689 --> 01:52:31,455
It's not that I don't
wanna care for someone,

1138
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:34,017
or have someone
care for me. It's just...

1139
01:52:37,745 --> 01:52:38,990
I get scared.

1140
01:52:43,318 --> 01:52:44,026
Yeah.

1141
01:52:55,948 --> 01:52:57,282
Face your fears.

1142
01:52:59,876 --> 01:53:01,235
Doctor Strange.

1143
01:53:32,553 --> 01:53:35,598
How is this so much harder
than a Multiversal portal?

1144
01:53:37,846 --> 01:53:40,352
She needs to slow
down, and be more patient.

1145
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:43,997
Reminds me of
another student I knew.

1146
01:53:44,093 --> 01:53:45,093
Hmm.

1147
01:53:45,898 --> 01:53:47,136
How are you feeling?

1148
01:53:48,413 --> 01:53:49,608
Why do you ask?

1149
01:53:50,909 --> 01:53:53,945
You used the Darkhold to
dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1150
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:56,340
Oh. Yeah, right, uh...

1151
01:53:57,833 --> 01:53:58,814
I'm fine.

1152
01:54:00,814 --> 01:54:02,807
But I do wanna
ask you something.

1153
01:54:04,075 --> 01:54:05,255
Are you happy?

1154
01:54:07,048 --> 01:54:08,164
That's an...

1155
01:54:08,909 --> 01:54:10,357
... interesting question.

1156
01:54:11,652 --> 01:54:14,310
You'd think that saving the
world would get you there, but...

1157
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:16,470
It doesn't.

1158
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:21,292
Sometimes, I do wonder...

1159
01:54:22,286 --> 01:54:23,758
about my other lives.

1160
01:54:25,128 --> 01:54:27,450
Yet I remain
grateful in this one.

1161
01:54:28,712 --> 01:54:30,548
Even with its tribulations.

1162
01:54:32,254 --> 01:54:34,472
At least we don't have to go
through it alone, huh?

1163
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,256
No, we don't.

1164
01:54:48,835 --> 01:54:49,896
Wait.

1165
01:54:52,474 --> 01:54:54,298
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

1166
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:57,036
I made some sparks.

1167
01:54:57,704 --> 01:54:58,459
That's great.

1168
01:54:59,012 --> 01:55:00,562
Your parents would be proud.

1169
01:55:00,595 --> 01:55:02,668
I hope you'll get to
show them one day.

1170
01:55:04,338 --> 01:55:05,317
Stephen?

1171
01:55:09,423 --> 01:55:11,455
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1172
01:55:13,728 --> 01:55:14,957
So am I, kid.

1173
01:55:16,524 --> 01:55:17,640
So am I.

1174
01:57:26,855 --> 01:57:28,055
Doctor Strange.

1175
01:57:31,989 --> 01:57:33,190
Can I help you?

1176
01:57:33,823 --> 01:57:36,703
You caused an incursion.
And we're gonna fix it.

1177
01:57:45,256 --> 01:57:46,935
Unless you're afraid.

1178
01:57:51,355 --> 01:57:52,715
Not in the least.

1179
01:58:33,622 --> 01:58:35,622
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1180
01:58:36,789 --> 01:58:37,789
It's over!

1181
