1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,839
If personal data
is the modern equivalent of oil,

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,679
the data of the most influential families
is gold.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,879
I understand,
but the risk isn't worth the profit.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,239
The profit
is immeasurable, Benjamín.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
What? You want it all for yourself?

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,879
For you and your precious holding, right?

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,679
I have evidence, Benjamín.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
Evidence that could destroy you
in a second.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
You and all your companies.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,759
Just share the wealth with me,
and nothing will go wrong.

12
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,000
CHARITY AUCTION
LAS ENCINAS AND LAKE CLUB

13
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,439
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

14
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Welcome to our auction.

15
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,759
The proceeds of which will be put
towards funding scholarships

16
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,199
for… for students who show promise

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,560
but who might not have
the financial means to attend Las Encinas.

18
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,479
The ones who are truly deserving.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,680
Because we all know
those who change the world do so

20
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,759
with their talent,
regardless of their background.

21
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,319
So I'm appealing to your generosity.

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,120
And I hope, together, we can make
this fundraiser truly unforgettable.

23
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
Thank you all.

24
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,360
Patrick?

25
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
No idea.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,280
Omar? The guests' party favors are…?

27
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,599
-In the storeroom.
-And the canapés?

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
-In ten minutes.
-Great.

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,000
-You see where the dossiers got placed?
-I think over there.

30
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,000
-All right. Okay. Thanks.
-No problem.

31
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,599
Oh man.

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
Uh, hey there.

33
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,759
Yeah. Hi.

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,919
Uh, Mencía, this is Jess.
And Jess, Mencía.

35
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,759
Ah, so this is Menci, is it?

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
"Menci," huh?

37
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,759
-You told her about me?
-Nah. Just gave her context.

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,879
-Right.
-Mm.

39
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,800
Well, it's a pleasure, Jessie.

40
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,159
Jess.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,319
-Right.
-Mm.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
Mencía. Found them.

43
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,120
Mm. Thank you.

44
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,959
-Give me the phone.
-Let go.

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,079
-The phone.
-Don't have one.

46
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
Hand it over.

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,480
Now.

48
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,519
No, I… I don't--

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,920
-Excuse me.
-Oh.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,319
-You dropped this.
-Thanks.

51
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,240
Of course.

52
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,240
-I was gonna give back the phone.
-Give back my laptop too.

53
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,199
Fuck you.

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,439
Omar stuck his neck out to help you,
and you just stabbed him in the back.

55
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,720
Today's really important
for him professionally.

56
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,959
So don't you dare
fuck this up for him. Clear?

57
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,879
-What were you doing?
-Kicking Bilal out.

58
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Was he here?

59
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,240
Stealing.

60
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,639
Yeah. Sure.

61
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,720
He pickpocketed a phone.

62
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,560
You made that up.
Just admit you were dickin' around.

63
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,040
Think whatever you want.

64
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,199
I can separate our work
and our personal shit.

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,639
You clearly can't.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,759
Are you here to see me?

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,160
-I can't stay long. I only have a minute.
-Only one?

68
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,079
I just had a fight with Omar,
and if he sees me here, he'll kill me.

69
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,079
When you're not studying, you're working.
When you're not working, you're worn out.

70
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,399
Look, I'd love to hang out with you
all the time and study, but I can't do it.

71
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,319
Pretty please?

72
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,839
See you later, okay?

73
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,920
Thanks.

74
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,720
For you.

75
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,639
Thanks.

76
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,759
Well?

77
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,959
What?

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,079
Let's meet new people today.
C'mon. You first.

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,079
What are you into? Businessmen?

80
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,800
-Ugh, so boring.
-You're not wrong.

81
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,120
-Okay. What about students, for example?
-No, no, no. Yeah, no.

82
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
-No more students, please. Ever.
-Okay, um…

83
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,439
Well, then, over in the back, the uh…

84
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,399
What are they? Drug dealers, I guess.

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,839
I mean, look at them.

86
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,079
-Close enough. They're soccer players.
-We're in trouble.

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,120
The one in the middle is
Iván Carvalho's father. Know who that is?

88
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,240
-No way.
-Mm.

89
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,639
As far as eye candy that won't make us
think too hard, they're not bad, right?

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,160
Yeah. Who needs interesting conversation?

91
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,360
-Maybe… they could surprise us, right?
-You never know.

92
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,600
Hi. What's up, guys?

93
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,759
-What's up?
-You boys care if we join you, or…?

94
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,800
Of course not, gatinhas.

95
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,079
Sorry, what?

96
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Sorry. He said, um, "You're beautiful."

97
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,160
-Ah.
-Oh.

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,639
Literally, "cats." Little ones.

99
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,879
So, we're little kittens, huh? Okay.

100
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,759
You soccer players
sure are direct, aren't you?

101
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,720
There you are, already scoring goals.

102
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,480
Ooh!

103
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,879
I think, like,
even a little bit. You know?

104
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,360
Excuse me.

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
I hate seeing
so much potential go to waste because

106
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,360
you don't believe in yourself.

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
-My potential isn't paying my bills.
-You mean you're scared?

108
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,279
I'm not scared. I'm realistic.

109
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
That makes me unreal? Hmm?

110
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,080
What I've achieved,
coming from the same place as you,

111
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
is that unreal too?

112
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,399
-You know what I meant by that, though.
-No, I don't know, but you can explain it.

113
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,960
Not only are you scared,
you're making excuses.

114
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,879
That's a shame.

115
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,679
There are influential people here today
I wanted to introduce you to

116
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,559
for future internships, but…

117
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,200
…since you're dressed like a waiter
and not like a guest…

118
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,919
What do you think I should do?
Hang up my uniform?

119
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,480
Priorities, Samuel.

120
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,480
Benjamín, I hope everything's good so far.

121
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,320
If you'll excuse us…

122
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
-Do I have to be on your back all day?
-He pulled me aside. What should I do?

123
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Your job, dude.

124
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,080
Or were you
just on another break of yours?

125
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,360
Since you'll make
my life miserable anyway…

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,960
-What's this?
-I quit.

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,120
Let's see how you get by today
with one less waiter, Omar.

128
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,080
Hey, Samuel!

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Dammit, dude!

130
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,159
You little sh…

131
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,000
Sir?

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,639
You okay?

133
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,720
Hello. I'd like a sparkling water.
With lime, not lemon.

134
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,159
And a little baby sprinkle
of turmeric. Thanks.

135
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,919
Hey, sweetie.

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
-What's wrong?
-I quit.

137
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,519
I mean, fuck this shitty job.
I'm out, you know?

138
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
-Seriously?
-Yes.

139
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,519
Oh, honey. That's great!

140
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,759
-Baby, let's order something to celebrate.
-Not now.

141
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,200
Gotta return the uniform,
tell the manager, and find your dad.

142
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,679
He's introducing me
to important people. Know where he is?

143
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,879
-My father?
-Yeah.

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,639
-He's someplace.
-Okay.

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,120
Hey, but why can't you just stay with me?

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,919
Later, all right?

147
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,559
We'll celebrate later.

148
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,759
Actually, I don't want a sparkling water.
I want a gin and tonic.

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
Any brand will work.

150
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,759
No, make that two gin and tonics.

151
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,960
Uh, um… Can I come up for air?

152
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,039
I mean, just so… just so… so I don't die.

153
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
Like, not suffocate.
I mean, that kinda thing.

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,440
Yeah, but every minute I'm not kissing you
is one I can't get back.

155
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,600
Yeah.

156
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,879
Okay. Which Twilight film
did you escape from, dude?

157
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,080
Has no one shown
strong feelings for you before?

158
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,000
It's not that.

159
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,960
No, no. No. But just pace yourself, okay?
Pace yourself a smidge.

160
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,240
-Smidge? I'm pacing myself.
-Yeah. Let me grab you one. Okay?

161
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
-I want a gin and tonic.
-No. Absolutely not.

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
-I am getting you some water.
-No, not water.

163
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Your sobriety's as existent
as your filter right now, all right?

164
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,120
Wait for me here.

165
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,639
I'll wait forever, boo.

166
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
Hmm. Okay.

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,399
Jesus H. Christ.

168
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,360
Why the computer?

169
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,600
To organize the auction.

170
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,440
The bids, the purchases
and sales, the participants--

171
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,480
Your dad went
from not trusting you to total trust.

172
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,200
That's because I have earned it.

173
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,960
It's what you always wanted.
To be daddy's little girl.

174
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,000
How's your little girl doing?

175
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,879
I mean, wouldn't it be cheaper
to buy a box of suction cups

176
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,480
and just, like, get it over with?

177
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,600
Then you wouldn't have to try
to speak to her.

178
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,440
She's like glue to your boo.

179
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,679
I think the word
you're looking for is "affectionate."

180
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,440
And super thoughtful,
and she's basically all over me.

181
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,159
-She's smothering?
-She's not smothering.

182
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,879
-Oh, no?
-No, I did not say that.

183
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,600
It's just I'm not used to having someone
give me all the attention that I deserve.

184
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,639
You know what?

185
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,960
Don't want that drink anymore.
Good luck with the auction, all right?

186
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,679
I've been lookin' for you.

187
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
Something wrong?

188
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,759
No, nothing. Just the stress
and pressure of all this stuff.

189
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,799
It's nothing.

190
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,559
Of course. Well, you're doin' great.

191
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
You think so?

192
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,320
Mm-hmm.

193
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm… proud of your work today.

194
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,519
I didn't know you drank.

195
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,720
Only once in a while.

196
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,919
Why'd you text me, Ari?

197
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,440
To come get fresh air.

198
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,240
-Iván, can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,960
Your father and you are filthy rich,
isn't that right?

200
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,240
What?

201
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,080
I meant that you don't have more

202
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,519
only because there aren't enough days
in the year.

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,879
What's this all about?

204
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,879
Just tell me. C'mon.

205
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,200
Are you and your father
filthy stinking rich or not?

206
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,360
Well, obviously, my dad is.

207
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,039
I knew it.

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,080
Why ask?

209
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,600
Is that what you want? A rich guy?

210
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,600
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

211
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,759
What I want is
a guy who doesn't need anything.

212
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,720
Who doesn't need me.

213
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,879
Understand that?

214
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,639
Mm.

215
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,720
Let's go.

216
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,559
-Come here.
-What are you doin'?

217
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,200
-This isn't yours, is it?
-No.

218
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:33,000
-Do you know how to drive it?
-Not at all.

219
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,240
Whoo-hoo!

220
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,679
Whoo!

221
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,679
Whoo-hoo!

222
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,159
Whoo!

223
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,600
Sir?

224
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,399
Hello?

225
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,279
Hey!

226
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,960
Hey!

227
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,759
You're not supposed to use the boats!
What the fuck, guys!

228
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,559
Bilal!

229
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,240
Well, what… what I'm interested in

230
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,120
at Las Encinas is trying
to remove the barriers

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,519
that challenge so many young artists

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,399
that have lots of talent
but, uh, not the resources.

233
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,440
That's interesting
and very necessary.

234
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,720
So, Dad, I have to go organize
the auction items now.

235
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,080
-It's about to start, okay?
-Mm-hmm. Better?

236
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,159
I am. Thanks.

237
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,120
And that's pretty much been
my line of work over the last few months.

238
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,039
Hmm?

239
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,559
Could I borrow you?

240
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,440
Mm, yes. Ah, excuse me, please.

241
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,279
I did it.

242
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,919
I just quit my job.

243
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,119
I'm going all in on Las Encinas.
On any internship or whatever it takes.

244
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,319
That's if you still wanna help.

245
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:17,960
Hmm.

246
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,359
Uh… uh, yes. Can you bring me
a blue pinstripe suit to the Lake Club?

247
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,480
Size?

248
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,759
This guy's been dead a really long time.

249
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,519
That's impossible.

250
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,000
He disappeared. They said he ran off.

251
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,680
Huh?

252
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,279
This guy, I know who he is.

253
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,279
Well, at the time,
it was such a big scandal

254
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,000
because if my father married my mother,
it would be the first time a…

255
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,880
a commoner married…

256
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,039
Am I boring you or something?

257
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,640
-Huh?
-I said, am I boring you?

258
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,839
No. No, no. I'm listening.

259
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,759
I'm sending a super important text,
but… but it's done now.

260
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,319
-Go on. Tell me.
-What was I speaking about? Huh?

261
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,160
Your family and… all that stuff.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,920
"All that stuff."

263
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,319
I'm gonna go get something to drink.

264
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,359
-You checked out, didn't you?
-No, no. I was paying attention.

265
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,480
Do you want a…? Oh! Whiskey? Rum? Vodka?

266
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,519
-What do you want?
-Nothing. I'm avoiding alcohol.

267
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,519
-A Long Island. To make you less uptight.
-I said no.

268
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,799
Were you not listening?

269
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay, baby.
How about an orange juice, then?

270
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,319
An orange juice, yeah. All right, then.

271
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Thanks a ton.

272
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Well, let's move on, without further ado,
to the first lot in the auction.

273
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,920
A rather unique sculpture.

274
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,799
Made of Murano glass, of course.

275
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,759
-By the artist Angelo Davide--
-Hey, excuse me. Dad!

276
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,160
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,559
-Generously donated by the Monte family.
-Dad, I'm sorry. I'm here now. Hey! Sorry.

278
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,799
Please. I'm sorry. Move.

279
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,119
The starting price
for the bidding is set at 10,000 euros.

280
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
-C'mon. Move. Fuck.
-It's…

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,839
Excuse me.

282
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,319
Patrick.

284
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,720
Ooh. I'm sorry.

285
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,480
Oh my God.

286
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,799
Have them clean this up
and settle the payment for the sculpture.

287
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,279
How am I supposed to…?

288
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,599
Samuel really kicked you out of the house
because of me?

289
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,200
No, Bilal. I made that up.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,240
I'm gonna call the police.

291
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Uh, please wait until I leave.
Or else they're gonna pin this on me.

292
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,519
Ah, fuck!

293
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,559
My cell must have died in the water.
Do you have one?

294
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,680
No. Otherwise, you wouldn't steal one.

295
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,960
I can't go back to the club
like this, with my uniform wet.

296
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,319
I can sneak in and maybe find someone.

297
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,279
Okay.

298
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,079
Look for Rebeka.

299
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,400
Brunette, in a tracksuit,
long nails, tacky jewelry.

300
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,480
Um, uh, likely
with another chick, making out.

301
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,480
With another chick? For real?

302
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,559
Save the homophobia for later,

303
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,640
when there aren't dead bodies
lying around. Okay, man? Okay?

304
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,640
-Sorry.
-Thank you. Find Rebeka.

305
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,160
Why don't I find Samuel?

306
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,200
It really bugs me
you're not talking 'cause of me.

307
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,039
-And he's your best friend.
-Find Rebeka.

308
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,000
-Go on.
-Okay. Okay.

309
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Fuck.

310
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,400
Okay. So you're totally gonna deny

311
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
that you're here with me
because I'm a young woman.

312
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,240
One that you can…

313
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,440
Uh, I mean, potentially take to bed

314
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,920
so you can keep thinking you're still
an energetic, young 20-year-old, right?

315
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,759
I am not in the habit of,
uh, sleeping with girls

316
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,759
in my son's circle.

317
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,960
Oh, well, that's too bad.

318
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,759
You even have a moral code.

319
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,759
-Yeah, I do.
-Hmm? Yeah, for sure.

320
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,680
Well, maybe I should throw mine
out the window,

321
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,759
and then I can start setting my sights

322
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,400
on mature, older men
with their heads screwed on straight,

323
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,079
like yours is… maybe.

324
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,359
That's a great idea.

325
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,799
And stop setting my sights on

326
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,039
these lost, messed-up,
and confused spoiled brats all the time.

327
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,480
Hmm?

328
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Well, I finished my drink.

329
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,720
Have you gone to see the pier?

330
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,799
No.

331
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,279
No? Oh, it's beautiful.
You have to see it.

332
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,599
If you wanna head over there,

333
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,720
I'll get a couple of drinks
and show it to you.

334
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,640
Right now?

335
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Yeah, now, if it's okay with you.

336
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:37,160
Yeah. I think that'd be great.

337
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,279
Okay.

338
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,839
No. You sit down!

339
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,319
-Know the price of that sculpture?
-You'll pay for it.

340
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,039
Well, I'm sure for you,
it's like peanuts.

341
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,279
-Are you high right now?
-No.

342
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,920
Have you seen your eyes?

343
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,039
It's a reaction.

344
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,880
-A reaction to what? To being a disgrace?
-As if any of this affects you.

345
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,319
'Cause now you have that suck-up, Samuel.

346
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,920
The perfect son you can play daddy to.

347
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Since you can't stand
the selfish queer you got as a real son.

348
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,160
-Come on.
-That you're ashamed of every day.

349
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,839
You gonna cry about it?
Right now? You're such a child.

350
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,599
It must have been real torture
for you to outlive Mom

351
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,240
and have to always lug us around
with you, right?

352
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,000
You think everyone is so mediocre.

353
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,359
Even your family,
beginning with your children.

354
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,599
You even thought Mom was weak.

355
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,119
But she chose to see the good in everyone.
In her children!

356
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,680
Even in a pathetic man
with delusions of grandeur like you.

357
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,039
Stop it!

358
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,640
Hey!

359
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
I said stop it!

360
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,720
You've never laid a hand on us
before this.

361
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,400
Mm. Mm.

362
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,079
Benjamín's having me consider
a career in law.

363
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,599
Right now we're just trying to find
the right university for me.

364
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,400
Excuse me just a moment.
I'll be, uh, right back. Just a sec.

365
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,200
Excuse me.

366
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,240
Why are you here?

367
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,279
-Samuel, I'm sorry.
-I told you to leave.

368
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,279
-Listen to me--
-Leave, or I'll call the police.

369
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,920
-Omar needs your help.
-Okay. So what?

370
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
I quit. What's the problem?

371
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,319
We found a dead guy's body
floating in the lake,

372
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,039
and Omar knows who he is.

373
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,480
Huh?

374
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,119
It's so cold!

375
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,880
Let me help you.

376
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,559
Ah, it's so cold.

377
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,680
-Just to warm us up a bit.
-Yeah.

378
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,240
Better?

379
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,440
What? Huh?

380
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
Patrick.

381
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,400
What's wrong?

382
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,799
Can I help?

383
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,119
Leave me the fuck alone, all right?

384
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,799
Uh, excuse the interruption.

385
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,839
It's time that we continue on
with the next lot,

386
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,839
which is a unique donation
from one of our most illustrious guests.

387
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,799
Uh, from Cruz Carvalho,

388
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,119
who's actually here with us right now.

389
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,559
Uh, Cruz?

390
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay. I can't see him right now,
but I assure you, he's here.

391
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,640
Okay. As I was saying, this is a sculpture
by contemporary artist Carlos Moncas.

392
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,599
It's signed by the artist and comes with…

393
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
-Hey.
-Hey.

394
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,160
How's your evening going? Well?

395
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,359
Super happy. Great.

396
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
It's just great.

397
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,119
-Fucking awesome.
-You feeling a little too fucking awesome?

398
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,160
-No.
-No?

399
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm fine.

400
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,119
Are you on drugs?

401
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,039
Oh, Caye, Caye, Caye.

402
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,200
Can I not be doing well
unless I'm with you?

403
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,240
The royal arrogance. Two points.

404
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,440
-And you?
-What about me?

405
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,519
You can't have a prince,
so you chase the king of soccer? No?

406
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,599
Ah, I figured it out. That's what this is.

407
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,640
Two Long Island iced teas.

408
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Wow. They don't have
anything with more alcohol?

409
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,799
You don't control me.

410
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
No, never.

411
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,079
Getting anything?

412
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
-I ordered two gin and tonics.
-Mm!

413
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,599
Two gin and tonics. Mm.

414
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,599
Perfect for getting to know someone.

415
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,160
Oh wow. You got it.

416
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:01,880
Ah, thanks.

417
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,599
I mean,
maybe that's what we have to do.

418
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,680
-What is?
-Open up more to other people.

419
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,319
Stop being… so stuck on each other.

420
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,200
Mm-hmm.

421
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,440
Caye,
what you and I feel… is very special.

422
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,359
But I don't think
it's going anywhere, honestly.

423
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,759
Because you're held back
by your need to look after me.

424
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,880
And I'm held back by the constant need
to never disappoint you.

425
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,599
So, it's probably best
we go our separate ways.

426
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,880
And… and breathe freer.

427
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,240
No?

428
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,200
Sure.

429
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,359
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

430
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,640
Do I hear 15,000? 15,000.

431
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,599
Going once. Going twice.

432
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,799
Thank you, sir.

433
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,680
What the fuck, Bilal?

434
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:19,279
Hey. Now that you're both here,

435
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,880
I feel awful
you guys are fighting because of me.

436
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,799
Shut up.

437
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,559
I need to think.

438
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,920
I've tried to figure out what to do.

439
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,160
Should I tell Ari and Mencía
or maybe call the police directly?

440
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,759
I don't know, man. I'm lost.
This is way above my pay grade.

441
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,240
Maybe we should call the police.
Don't you think?

442
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,720
Fuck it. Of course we should call.
Come on.

443
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,720
No. Don't call them.

444
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,440
Then who?

445
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,599
Fucking Benjamín? No way.

446
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,680
Rebe.

447
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,400
She and I
helped Guzmán dump this guy in the lake.

448
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,400
Excuse me?

449
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,599
This very beautiful Bohemian glass goblet,

450
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,240
property of
our beloved Herrera de Miguel family

451
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,160
for over six generations,

452
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
which has a starting price
of 15,000 euros.

453
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,880
Who will offer 15,000?

454
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,519
Ah? Sold.

455
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,559
The next lot.

456
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,559
Mixed-media oil and collage.

457
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,240
The work of the virtuosic hands
of Argentinean artist Gabriela Rosales.

458
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,200
A starting price of 12,000 euros.

459
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,079
One-of-a-kind diamond necklace,
crafted with olivine

460
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,519
from the Kilauea volcano

461
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,880
in Hawaii, inspired
by the extinct Russian Czarist Empire.

462
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,240
With a starting price of 200,000 euros.

463
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,680
What's cookin', Samuel?

464
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,400
What?

465
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,079
And it's sold.

466
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,519
Charge this for me and keep an eye on it.

467
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,519
Okay. Excuse me, sir.
Please, can you charge this phone?

468
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:01,279
Yeah? Thank you.

469
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,079
Menci. Uh, I have a favor to ask you.

470
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm busy enough with the auction.

471
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,079
Yeah, uh, the thing is,
this is an emergency, you know?

472
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,000
I need to pop out for a moment.

473
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,400
It'll be just a sec, but I'll be back.

474
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,119
Could be longer, or it might be quick,
but I'll be back.

475
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
Can you stay with Jess?

476
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,359
You're kidding, right?

477
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,680
Look at her.

478
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,400
So drunk, she doesn't know where she is.
Stumbling all over.

479
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,119
I can't leave her along
because she might crack her head, crash--

480
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,359
Rebeka, you're asking your ex
to look after your… I don't know.

481
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,880
-I don't know. Your girlfriend?
-We're just friends.

482
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,640
Okay. Your "just friend."
No. I mean, I don't care.

483
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,480
I wouldn't ask you to do it
if it weren't important.

484
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,720
Please, Menci.

485
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,480
I'll go get her. Thanks.

486
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,720
Sorry about earlier.

487
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,039
Ah, no problem. Don't worry.

488
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,480
You feeling better?

489
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,680
Yeah.

490
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,920
What happened with your father?

491
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,799
I always felt like an outsider
in this family.

492
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,680
You know?

493
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,839
As if I had to apologize
for having survived

494
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,559
the accident that killed my mother.

495
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Clearly,
my dad wanted a different type of son.

496
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,960
They all want a different type of Patrick.

497
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,119
Everyone.

498
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,480
-Nobody loves me as I am.
-Come on.

499
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,279
Don't say that.

500
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,920
No, seriously. I'm over it.

501
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,319
No one ever notices me.

502
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,920
Like, I do my own fucking thing,

503
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,920
I keep not needing anyone,
and I can still get whatever I want.

504
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,160
And I'm sick of it.

505
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,559
That's not true.

506
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
That no one notices you.

507
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,039
No one.

508
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,839
Not possible.

509
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,680
Holy shit.

510
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,119
-You seem kinda intelligent.
-Yeah. That's 'cause I am intelligent.

511
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,240
That's 'cause you
an intelligent bitch.

512
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,799
Why'd you let her get away, then? Hmm?

513
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,440
What do you mean?

514
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,599
You still seem to like her a bit.
A little.

515
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,119
You know,
she won't stop talking about you.

516
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,640
It's like, "Menci this."
It's like, "Menci that." You know?

517
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,240
-"Menci." She calls you that.
-Yeah, I know. She calls me Menci.

518
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,480
Hmm.

519
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,559
-You can imagine that gets under my skin--
-Listen.

520
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,759
I have to work, okay?
So would you mind not…?

521
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,480
Appreciate it. Thank you.

522
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,119
Mm.

523
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,599
Mm.

524
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,519
Excuse me?

525
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,039
Can I please have another one of these?

526
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,000
Thanks.

527
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,119
Mm.

528
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,039
You like that she talks about you, right?

529
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,559
I mean, if you like her,
she's all yours, dude.

530
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,519
No problemo.

531
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,680
If you wanna be with her,
I'll step aside, hundo P.

532
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,440
Thanks.

533
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,559
But… say it, you know? Be clear.

534
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,239
But what you can't do is reject her
and be there, constantly just…

535
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,679
…orbiting around her.

536
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,599
Tell her you're out of the picture
because I'm already fed up

537
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,800
with her talking about you all day.

538
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,639
What? Not gonna say anything?

539
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,559
I mean, like, if you'd rather go on

540
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,920
doing damage
but playing the victim…

541
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,480
Well, great, sugar.

542
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,000
Like, what can I say?

543
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,159
But be careful, okay?

544
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,880
Yeah.
Because you might have to deal with me.

545
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,039
And if you come
between Rebe and me…

546
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,199
…I'll get you out of the picture.

547
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,679
Yeah, sure. I'll make sure she finds out
what a shit person you are.

548
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,920
So you won't fucking see her ever again.

549
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,199
I swear.

550
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,599
Understand?

551
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,599
I gotta pee.
I've been holdin' it for a while. Cool.

552
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,719
Holy-- That's a fuckin' smell.

553
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,800
-Rebe, c'mon.
-Absolutely not.

554
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,679
Man, that smell is seeping
into my bone marrow.

555
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,199
-I can't. Let Omar help.
-No. Don't drag Omar into this.

556
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,599
At least try. C'mon.

557
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,440
No, I can't do it, dude. I can't.

558
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,119
Rebe, we did it once before.

559
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,480
Then he had just died.
Now he might decompose in our hands.

560
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,960
-Who knows?
-Just try. Please.

561
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,760
Don't think about it. Just grab.

562
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,360
Grab that.

563
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,559
I told you, man.
I can't, Samuel. I told you that.

564
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,199
Hey. Omar's fucking upset.

565
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,119
Oh God.

566
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,039
Omar. Omar, hon. We wanted
to keep you out of it to protect you.

567
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,199
Who knew about this?

568
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,719
Guzmán, Rebe, and I.

569
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,199
And Ander?

570
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,719
Who knows? Guzmán might've told him,
but it's hard to say.

571
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:34,760
Dude! When exactly did you guys
become a bunch of murderers?

572
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,639
-Hey. We didn't kill him, okay?
-And?

573
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,719
You're accomplices.

574
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,639
Uh, sorry, but let's
not lose perspective here.

575
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,079
The world's way better
without this piece of shit in it, okay?

576
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,920
I mean, he was a victimizer,
abuser, rapist. Should I go on?

577
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,639
And you gave me shit
because of a computer?

578
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,519
Can you help us? We really need you, man.

579
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,639
For what?

580
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,119
Are we sinking him again? Ten-hut.

581
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,800
We're just a bunch of fucking kids!

582
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,840
We don't know
what we're doing with our lives,

583
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,800
never mind how to handle a body!
That's it.

584
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,599
-We're gonna call the police now.
-No.

585
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,360
-Think about Guzmán and the two of us.
-Can you think about me? Huh?

586
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
What about me, dude?

587
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,559
-I found him. I know everything now.
-I'm sorry, Omar.

588
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,800
Things just are how they are, okay?
You're my best friend. You always will be.

589
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Well, now your best friend
is telling you to call the police, okay?

590
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,679
A FRESH START. KISSES, ARMANDO

591
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,199
Fine.

592
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll call them.

593
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,360
But I'm asking you one last favor.

594
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,760
You don't know anything.

595
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,280
Hurry up. Leave.

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
