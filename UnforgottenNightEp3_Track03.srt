What do you want from me?

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,050
I want you to live at my house.

9
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,660
Can't we just forget about what happened last night?

10
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,750
You're the one I want to be with.

11
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,440
I'll give you some time to think about it.

12
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,120
He acts like a mafia.

13
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,430
Send someone to look after Kim.

14
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,250
Don't let him out of your sight.

15
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,230
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,010
I have to go abroad for work.

17
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,280
When I return, I'll pick you up at your place.

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's go. It's time for Omakase.

19
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,990
Kim, you're the best!

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,890
He hasn't said that he will treat us to Omakase yet.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,800
Omakase please.

22
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,640
Anything is fine for me because I'm so hungry.

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,400
Kim!

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,050
Hello.

25
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,760
How are you? I came here yesterday, but May said that you were sick.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,170
Actually, I really wanted to go visit you.

27
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,840
I told him that you didn't want anyone to disturb you.

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,230
I'm much better now. Please take a seat, Mr. Karan.

29
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,030
I would definitely have gone to visit you if I knew where your house is.

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,980
Here. I've brought this for you. At first, I was going to ask May to give it to you.

31
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,820
Thank you. But you don't have to give me all of this.

32
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,880
Kim.

33
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,740
You're on lunch break now, right?

34
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,010
Well...

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Do you want to have lunch with me?

36
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:39,950
Please?

37
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,370
I...

38
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:04,950
Mr. Kamol.

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,720
You have a guest?

40
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,050
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,640
I already told you that I'll treat you to a meal after my work is done.

42
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,220
Kim, who is this guy?

43
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
It's none of your business.

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm taking Kim out for lunch.

45
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,010
You guys can't threaten me like this.

46
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,320
Please leave.

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,050
Don't touch me!

48
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,760
Please leave now.

49
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,350
Kim.

50
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,880
When...

51
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,600
are you going to shut up?

52
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,050
It's annoying.

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,220
Stop bothering someone who belongs to me.

54
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,000
Who belongs to you?

55
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,680
I mean...

56
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,200
My soon-to-be person.

57
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,790
It's all in your head.

58
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,350
Please leave.

59
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,880
Kim, are you going to have lunch with him?

60
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,590
I'll owe you guys a meal, then. I have to take care of something first.

61
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,800
Let's go.

62
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,110
How do you feel?

63
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,700
We haven't seen each other for a couple of days.

64
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,940
I feel good.

65
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,230
Are you happy now?

66
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,130
Are you saying that you don't miss me at all?

67
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,410
It was just a one-night stand. Why would I miss you?

68
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,250
But I miss you.

69
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,700
♪ I don't know if you're going to believe it or not ♪

70
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,710
♪ I just knew what love was the day I met you ♪

71
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,520
♪ The first time our eyes met ♪

72
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,100
♪ When we're close, only a breath apart ♪

73
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,360
♪ You're the one I'm looking for ♪

74
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,990
Why are you not getting out?

75
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,950
You said you're taking me out to lunch. But why are we at the hotel?

76
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,140
Are you getting out of the car by yourself? Or do you want me to carry you out? You decide.

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,960
Move. I'll get out of the car by myself.

78
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,150
I remember this hotel. It was where we first met.

79
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,280
What's your intention?

80
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,780
What do you think?

81
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,589
I'm bringing you here for lunch. You don't trust me?

82
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,730
You like Japanese food, don't you?

83
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,750
You know me so well.

84
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,990
If you have something to say, just say it.

85
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,310
We can talk while we eat. I'm not in a hurry.

86
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,120
But I am! What do you want from me?

87
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,180
It was just one night.

88
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,190
Let's forget about it.

89
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,600
Have you packed your belongings yet?

90
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,400
I'm not going anywhere. Are you trying to get on my nerves?

91
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,500
I didn't intend to make you feel that way.

92
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,460
This is the last time that we meet.

93
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I won't go anywhere with you anymore because we don't know each other.

94
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,390
But I'm giving you a chance to get to know me.

95
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,970
I told you before that I don't want to get to know you. Who would want to get to know a guy like you?

96
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,600
You have people following you around and calling you "boss."

97
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,960
There are only a handful of jobs that have people act that way.

98
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,610
And I don't want to know anyone who has those kinds of jobs.

99
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,700
But it seems like

100
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,990
you want to know what kind of job I have.

101
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,260
I don't want to know that.

102
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm a business owner.

103
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,800
I guess it's a shady business. You're a mafia, aren't you?

104
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,000
What's your definition of "mafia"?

105
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,670
Someone like you.

106
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,990
If you want me to be a mafia,

107
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,380
I can be that for you.

108
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,800
But if you want me to be a business owner,

109
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,130
I can be that as well.

110
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,760
I can be whatever you want me to be.

111
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,160
Am I that important to you?

112
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,240
I want to know... why does it have to be me?

113
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,900
You're the first person that I'm interested in.

114
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,520
Then you might be interested in other people as well.

115
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,130
Let go of me.

116
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,990
Can you give me some time to explain

117
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,140
why you're the only one that I want?

118
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,350
Let's begin plan B.

119
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,190
Plan B?

120
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,209
I really want to know you better, Kim.

121
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,069
Why don't we take some time to get to know each other more?

122
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,629
Or to make things easier, we can be boyfriends.

123
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:56,739
Tonight...

124
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,609
You will stay with me, right?

125
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,019
No. I will go back home.

126
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,259
If you want to go back,

127
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,329
you have to let me drop you off.

128
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,179
I can go back by myself.

129
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:29,799
I'm sorry, boss. There's an urgent call from a Korean investor.

130
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:35,379
Wait for me here.

131
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,749
Don't try to run away.

132
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,829
Do whatever you want.

133
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,039
Even if I run away from you, you can find me anyway.

134
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,749
Gosh! He's such a control freak!

135
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,459
Hello, is there something urgent?

136
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,279
I have something to tell you.

137
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,259
That's why I have to call you now. Sorry about that.

138
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,909
No worries.

139
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,199
Mr. Danai contacted me regarding the casino concession.

140
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,209
He has offered me 300 million baht for investment.

141
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:32,839
But you have offered me only 100 million baht. So, I think...

142
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:41,879
We will reconsider it and get back to you soon.

143
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:46,089
Well, if you're too slow...

144
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,349
I won't. I'll get back to you within two hours.

145
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,279
Give me some time to sort this out.

146
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,079
Mr. Hyung-sik, do you still trust me?

147
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,529
All right. We'll wait for you.

148
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,839
Thank you for your trust.

149
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,079
Danai is trying to hinder me from getting this project.

150
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:15,569
Send me the details of the entire budget.

151
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,219
And let's begin plan B.

152
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,719
There will be a lot of losses if we go with plan B but end up not winning at the auction.

153
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,659
A man like me

154
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,549
never loses.

155
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,399
Kom.

156
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:34,999
Send someone to check on Danai.

157
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:38,639
Find out if he has contacted any of our partners.

158
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:40,989
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:15,919
Kit.

160
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,199
Yes, sir.

161
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:21,269
Tell Lop to call someone at Kim's office

162
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,979
and let them know that Kim will arrive home safely.

163
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,099
Yes, sir.

164
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,009
Why do I like you so much?

165
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:03,439
What time is it now?

166
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,569
It's 11 p.m.

167
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,659
11 p.m.? Why didn't you wake me up?

168
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,849
My phone is dead.

169
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:24,689
May is probably worried about me now.

170
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,969
Don't worry. I already told her.

171
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,209
Also,

172
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:35,469
I didn't want to wake you up because you were sleeping so soundly.

173
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,139
You called May?

174
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,009
Wouldn't that make her question the fact that I--

175
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,119
That you're here with me?

176
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,259
I told my subordinate to call her

177
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,449
and tell her you're safe.

178
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:51,929
Don't worry.

179
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,399
You can trust me.

180
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,449
I'll go back now.

181
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:00,429
Okay.

182
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,439
If you want to go back, I'll drop you off.

183
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,139
Get up, then.

184
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,259
What do I have to do

185
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,259
if I want to see you every day?

186
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:22,599
Will you come live at my house?

187
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:26,609
I'll give you the same answer, which is no.

188
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,159
I'm not rushing you.

189
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,179
I'll give you a couple of days to think about it.

190
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,769
Once you have the answer,

191
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,639
I'll go pick you up by myself.

192
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:45,889
I want you to come and live with me.

193
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:48,079
Okay?

194
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,089
If that's the case,

195
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,659
I can go back home by myself.

196
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,379
I hope we'll never meet again.

197
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:57,859
Kim.

198
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,399
I've told you before.

199
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,819
I want to get to know you.

200
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:08,699
Kit.

201
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:10,569
Yes, sir.

202
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,219
Give me the car keys and get the car ready.

203
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:15,599
Yes, sir.

204
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,409
Let me wash my face first, and we'll go back together.

205
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,339
Why are you not answering my call, Kim?

206
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:45,259
There are a lot of men in black suits in front of our office. What should we do?

207
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:14,166
Have a good rest.

208
00:21:16,386 --> 00:21:19,586
Thank you for dropping me off. You can leave now.

209
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:24,126
Do you know that you look like a cat trying to threaten me?

210
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:27,016
I'm human.

211
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:29,996
Okay.

212
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,336
I'll leave then.

213
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,466
I hope that you'll reconsider what I said.

214
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:43,036
Just leave. I want to sleep now.

215
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,656
Hello, May.

216
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:27,196
Hello, Kim. Are you all right? They didn't try to kill you, right? You're safe, right?

217
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:31,306
I'm sorry for making you worried. I'm back at my condo now.

218
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:38,706
That's good. I'm glad to hear that. I don't want to say this, but his subordinates are so rude.

219
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:46,816
I'm fine. Thank you for worrying about me. You should get some rest.

220
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:51,906
Okay. It's good to hear that you're still okay. You should get a lot of rest. I'll see you at the office.

221
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:53,766
Okay, see you later.

222
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,586
It's all because of you, Mr. Kamol.

223
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,676
I haven't thought about Day at all today.

224
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:31,826
You can really make me forget his embrace, huh.

225
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:33,646
Mr. Kamol.

226
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:47,916
Hello, Ms. Cherry.

227
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:51,696
I want the full treatment today since I'm going to meet my special someone.

228
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,486
Of course. Please wait.

229
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:44,566
Here you go.

230
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:47,056
Thank you.

231
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:48,626
May.

232
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:50,776
Please sit.

233
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:52,496
Alright.

234
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:59,036
Well... I need some advice.

235
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:03,186
It's about my friend.

236
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,116
Sure.

237
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:09,366
My friend told me that...

238
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:14,386
someone asked him to live together.

239
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:18,316
Like, they had a one-night stand.

240
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,246
But then that person suddenly asked my friend to move in with him.

241
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,266
Do you think I--

242
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:33,396
What do you think I should tell my friend?

243
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:43,986
I think it's too fast. You don't know his personality and how he lives his life.

244
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,466
It's not like you'll live in his house for free, right?

245
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:49,556
You're right.

246
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:57,756
But I think you can tell him that it's better to get to know each other more before moving in together.

247
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:08,006
There are a lot of men in black suits in front of our office. What should we do?

248
00:26:20,326 --> 00:26:21,046
What's going on?

249
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:26,246
Hello, Kim. We're sorry for alarming you. We're here for your safety.

250
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:31,406
That's right. Don't mind us. You can live life as usual.

251
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:39,046
How can you call this "usual"?

252
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:57,026
Do you miss me that much to the point where you have to call me?

253
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:58,616
Quit imagining things!

254
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:05,196
Tell your subordinates to leave and give me back my normal life!

255
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:13,976
He's quite stubborn.

256
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:18,596
Sir.

257
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:24,406
We can identify those who committed the arson now.

258
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:34,526
We've found out that these two belong to Danai.

259
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:37,956
That's what I thought.

260
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:42,676
Get ready.

261
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:45,186
Since he wants to play with us,

262
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,476
Show him that we are not the ones he should be messing with.

263
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:52,166
Yes, sir.

264
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,266
Kamol is here, right?

265
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:22,106
He's not available for guests at the moment. Please go back first.

266
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,386
I'm not a guest.

267
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:41,906
Kamol, look at Kom. He won't let me go in to see you.

268
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,266
I'm getting angry now.

269
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:47,626
What are you doing here?

270
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:54,936
I'm here to ask you to eat out together. Let's find something to eat.

271
00:28:57,356 --> 00:28:58,076
I'm not free.

272
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:02,226
Please excuse me.

273
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,176
You've changed.

274
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:10,216
You're not like this before.

275
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,526
You used to be kinder.

276
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:17,536
I'm not a kind person.

277
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:24,996
If you were not kind, you wouldn't have helped me on the first day we met.

278
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:28,386
You would've probably let me get hit by a car.

279
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:32,527
If that wasn't an act of kindness, then what was it?

280
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:42,126
If I've done something to make you misunderstand my intention,

281
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:45,096
I'm sorry about that.

282
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:49,166
Kom, please send off the guest.

283
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:52,596
All guests are not welcome.

284
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,486
Kamol!

285
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:58,456
Please leave.

286
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:08,746
(2 days later)

287
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:13,726
I want you two to take care of the financial statements of the Siam Tech company.

288
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:27,086
Siam Tech is going to be listed on the stock exchange soon.

289
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,546
I want you guys to have a look--

290
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:31,546
(Mr. Kamol)

291
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:41,026
Whoever is calling is so persistent. Kim is not answering his calls, but he keeps calling anyway.

292
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:45,096
Kim, are you okay? Do you need our help?

293
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:49,616
I just want you to help with the financial statements.

294
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:52,926
Not about that. You can tell us if you're having personal problems.

295
00:30:58,076 --> 00:30:59,966
I'm fine. Thank you so much.

296
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,236
Why don't you take a vacation?

297
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:06,736
Take a break from everything for a little while.

298
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:10,646
That's right. You don't have to worry about work. I'll take care of it.

299
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:16,826
It's okay. You guys should get back to work now. Thank you so much.

300
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:26,636
Don't forget what I asked you to do.

301
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:29,186
Are you sure that you're okay?

302
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:30,506
Yes.

303
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,716
Why are you not answering my calls, Kim?

304
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:54,066
I want to talk to you.

305
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:03,766
Should I hang out with my friends?

306
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:09,606
My only friend is Day.

307
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:13,436
Should I do that?

308
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:31,286
Hey, dude. You've disappeared!

309
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:33,436
Well, I'm calling you right now.

310
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:34,856
Are you free?

311
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:40,136
When? If now, no. I have a meeting.

312
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:44,716
Really? I was going to ask you to hang out with me.

313
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:48,496
Why don't you ask Day? He's a freelancer.

314
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:52,146
I gotta go now. Bye!

315
00:33:01,836 --> 00:33:02,906
Should I call Day?

316
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:15,726
Hello, Day. Are you free? Can I talk to you?

317
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,776
Sure. What's wrong?

318
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:23,486
Where are you? Can I come to see you?

319
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,716
I'm out of town right now. Is something the matter?

320
00:33:27,636 --> 00:33:28,656
It's nothing.

321
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:31,236
I can wait until you come back.

322
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:35,306
Wait until I go back to Bangkok then. I'll call you.

323
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:40,516
Hey, Itt. Why don't you dry hair after getting in the water? You'll get sick.

324
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:44,386
I know. My towel is with you.

325
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:50,616
I gotta go. I have to deal with something.

326
00:33:59,006 --> 00:34:00,206
Come here. I'll dry it for you.

327
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:04,246
Why don't you dry your hair?

328
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,486
Did I make the right decision to call Day?

329
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:16,996
I'll find out if I can forget about him yet or not.

330
00:34:22,036 --> 00:34:22,636
Hello, Day.

331
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,146
What's wrong?

332
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:28,636
Can I come over to your house and have a talk?

333
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:30,846
Our people is still keeping an eye on Kim, right?

334
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:32,441
Yes, sir.

335
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:35,770
Good. Don't let him out of your sight.

336
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:47,796
What's going on?

337
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,496
Are we going to die?

338
00:34:49,496 --> 00:34:51,096
I don't know.

339
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:51,896
Who did this?

340
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,896
(DIE)

341
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:56,946
Move!

342
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:00,106
Damn it!

343
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:02,356
He dares to do this to me?

344
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:27,196
Everyone in his company is scared now.

345
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:30,596
A rabid dog like him

346
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:32,736
should be scared too.

347
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:40,066
Also, those people who spied on us have disappeared.

348
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:42,006
Good.

349
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:47,386
Now they'll know that they shouldn't mess with me.

350
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:55,966
You dumbass!

351
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:00,736
You're all useless!

352
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,766
How could you let him do this?

353
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,506
Maybe it's not Kamol's doing this time.

354
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:14,516
Are you serious?

355
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,076
If it's not him, then who?

356
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,736
You're fucking stupid!

357
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:27,646
Listen to me. From now on, keep an eye on him.

358
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,776
He will try to get back at us again.

359
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:32,066
Yes, sir.

360
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,376
How's Kim?

361
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:56,786
He goes to work as usual.

362
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,966
He loses his temper because of Lop sometimes.

363
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:03,256
Nothing's changed. Everything is as usual.

364
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,396
Does he think that he can continue to not pick up my calls?

365
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:40,646
Hello.

366
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:42,866
You're finally picking up the phone.

367
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:44,476
Hey, you!

368
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:46,566
I miss you, Kim.

369
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,986
Why aren't you answering any of my calls?

370
00:37:49,816 --> 00:37:52,966
When will you stop bothering me? This is my office number.

371
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:57,696
It's been three days. Get ready.

372
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,556
I'll pick you up this evening.

373
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,196
He's so stubborn, just the way I like.

374
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,396
Our people is still keeping an eye on Kim, right?

375
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:17,026
Yes, sir. Lop's team is still watching him.

376
00:38:21,556 --> 00:38:24,256
Good. Don't let him out of your sight.

377
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:25,936
Yes, sir.

378
00:39:38,696 --> 00:39:39,306
Hello, Day.

379
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,456
I'm back in Bangkok.

380
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:47,106
What's the matter?

381
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,406
Can I come over to your house and talk to you?

382
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:52,126
What's wrong?

383
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:54,906
Can I tell you in person?

384
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,946
Okay, I'll wait for you at home then.

385
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:04,476
Thank you so much.

386
00:40:27,326 --> 00:40:31,046
May and Jin, can you get Mr. Pakorn's document for me?

387
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:39,786
Kim, is something the matter?

388
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:42,676
I'm going on a vacation.

389
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:45,166
My friend asked me to go out of town with him.

390
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:47,986
But if I go out now,

391
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,586
those people will follow me.

392
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:53,186
Are you going to run away?

393
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:42,846
I've got to go now.

394
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:45,316
I'm off.

395
00:41:46,996 --> 00:41:48,596
I'm off.

396
00:41:57,506 --> 00:41:58,146
What's that sound?

397
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:06,856
What happened?

398
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,056
Miss, what's wrong?

399
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,556
I have a stomach ache.

400
00:42:15,216 --> 00:42:16,106
Are you all right, Miss?

401
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,196
Have a safe trip, Kim!

402
00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:27,006
Thank you so much, May. You can contact me via e-mail. Please don't let anyone know where I'm going.

403
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:27,696
Sure.

404
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:31,076
How can I help you?

405
00:42:39,116 --> 00:42:40,356
It's okay. Thanks!

406
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:44,986
What's wrong with her?

407
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,986
It's a pleasure to work with you all.

408
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,596
I hope that we will win this time.

409
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:19,856
A man like me doesn't know how to lose.

410
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:23,045
Please, sir.

411
00:43:33,136 --> 00:43:33,636
Hello, Lop.

412
00:43:34,553 --> 00:43:34,987
What?

413
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:36,696
What did you just say?

414
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:42,606
Okay. I'll let him know.

415
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,636
Sir, I have something to report to you.

416
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:53,436
Er... Mr. Kim has escaped.

417
00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:00,976
This is why I want him to be my lover.

418
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:06,506
I'll handle this myself.

419
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:11,266
He couldn't have gone far. He's probably still in Bangkok.

420
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:13,596
Also,

421
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:17,016
don't bother anyone from his office.

422
00:44:18,706 --> 00:44:21,766
Kim will be mad at me if he knows.

423
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:23,956
Yes, sir.

424
00:44:29,446 --> 00:44:30,466
Who are you talking about?

425
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:32,656
Who is Kim?

426
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:44,486
The hands that I've wished would hold mine someday.

427
00:44:56,056 --> 00:44:57,196
I have something to discuss with Kim.

428
00:44:57,716 --> 00:44:58,216
Move out of the way.

429
00:44:59,476 --> 00:44:59,976
No.
