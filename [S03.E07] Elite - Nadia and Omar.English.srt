1
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,280
What the hell is he doing here?

2
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,320
GRADUATION PARTY

3
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,359
Sure, private number.
There's no fucking way I'm answering that.

4
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,280
I already have a phone plan.

5
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,079
Rebe.

6
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,680
-What?
-Were you really dealing at school?

7
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,400
Were you, Valerio?

8
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,359
You two... come in.

9
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,040
-Azucena, good morning.
-Good morning, Begoña.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,640
I'd like to talk to you.
Do you have a few minutes?

11
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,480
Actually,
I have an important matter to see to.

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Not more important
than what I have to say.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,520
I'll be right with you--

14
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,280
I can always go over your head
and speak to the board.

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,159
I'm only asking to meet with you
as a courtesy.

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
Just a moment.

17
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,560
Damn.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,199
I have to go to Ander's
to get the rest of my stuff.

19
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,080
After that, I don't know...

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Maybe I'll perform hara-kiri
over my grades.

21
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,360
Were they really that bad?

22
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,039
On a scale of disasters...

23
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,960
the Notre-Dame fire,

24
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,680
Spain at Eurovision,

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,800
-Madonna at Eurovision...
-Damn.

26
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,719
...my grades.

27
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,560
I have to laugh
because if I really think about it...

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,240
In the end, I'm not graduating,
I've lost Ander...

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,879
and I'm homeless.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,319
What?

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,919
Why don't you come to New York with me?

32
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,439
-What?
-Come on.

33
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,479
You've always wanted to travel

34
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,280
and live somewhere
where you could blend in.

35
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,960
New York meets that criteria
better than any place I can think of.

36
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
You'll get a job, learn English...

37
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,479
What the hell would I do there?

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Where would I stay?

39
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,879
It's crazy, Nadia.

40
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,159
In my apartment?

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,159
Yeah, you showed me photos.
It's as big as Central Park.

42
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,520
You can't ask someone
you barely know to put people up--

43
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,919
What do you mean?
We were engaged for a night.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,360
Although, you two are pretty close,
right?

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,639
We just hooked up a few times.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,560
-I mean--
-Yeah, we just hooked up. Got it.

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
I would only stay temporarily.

48
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,639
OK, sure. Why not?

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,079
Nobody would know
if someone hadn't snitched.

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,399
Valerio and Rebeka were selling drugs,
and Polo reported it.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
You're blaming him
for doing what's right?

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Samuel, Guzmán.

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
Come with me, please.

54
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,279
Us?

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Now.

56
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,480
Look, Azucena.

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,000
You can make an argument for expelling us,
but these two?

58
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,920
-We didn't do anything!
-I warned you.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
I said there'd be zero tolerance. 

60
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,600
And yet, you've been tormenting him
since Christmas.

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,279
This is bullshit.
Polo's mother's behind it.

62
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,279
She was in here right before us.
Am I right?

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,240
It's been decided.
You're expelled and won't graduate.

64
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,759
-What?
-Samuel!

65
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,800
You fucking sellouts.

66
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,800
There's no fairness here!
All you care about is money and power.

67
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,560
-Don't talk to me like that.
-Or what? You'll expel us?

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,120
Samu... it's not worth it.

69
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,439
What are you doing?

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,639
What's he doing? Stop!

71
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,639
-What are you doing?
-Relax.

72
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,199
That's enough violence, OK?

73
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,920
-Are you defending him?
-Yes!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,319
He said he didn't accuse you two
of anything.

75
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,959
And you believe him?

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,079
You're doing this so you won't feel bad
about accepting the grant.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,800
You'll accept it no matter what,
even if it means taking his side.

78
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,800
Son of a bitch.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,720
Lu, forget about him.

80
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,399
Nadia, don't play innocent.

81
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,759
You want to smash this bottle
over his head as much as I do.

82
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,879
Admit it.

83
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,040
This wouldn't have happened
if they'd just let me leave.

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,920
That doesn't matter now. 
We need to think of a way to fix this.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,839
We could--

86
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,519
It's too late. It's over.

87
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,040
-You can't end things this way.
-Carla almost drowned last night.

88
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,079
She almost died because of him.

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,319
Because of me! It was my fault, OK?

90
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,079
What are you saying?

91
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,319
I sold Carla the Molly
'cause Valerio refused.

92
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,399
He was going to stop dealing
after your little lecture.

93
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,199
What? You didn't know? Well, now you do.

94
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,040
But you had to go and make a scene.

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,720
I guess you couldn't bear the idea
of doing something right for once.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
-Why don't you go home, Rebeka?
-Fucking Bodyguard Barbie.

97
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
Better yet, just go straight to jail.

98
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,920
-You'll end up there with your mom anyway.
-We have something in common.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,279
Because you also get along great
with criminals.

100
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as they pay for your outfits,
expensive meals, and tuition...

101
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,399
But I get it, OK? I really do.

102
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Hold on to him tight.
You know what you'll have once he's gone?

103
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,399
Nothing and no one, hon.

104
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,120
Damn private number!

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,480
You don't look too bad...
at least not at first glance.

106
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,600
-I can't remember a thing.
-That's normal.

107
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,639
No, it's not. 

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,519
I lost control.

109
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,560
-And I helped you lose it. I'm sorry.
-No, you warned me.

110
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm the one who's sorry. 
I just heard you were expelled.

111
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,439
He got what was coming to him.

112
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,680
Don't blame him for yesterday.
He wouldn't sell to me.

113
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,759
Well, it's the first bit of common sense
he's shown in ages,

114
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,839
-but it's still too late.
-Well, later.

115
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,079
I've been trying to change
for a long time.

116
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,519
Trying...

117
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,879
but you never change.

118
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,399
-You'll never grow up.
-I had nothing to do with what happened.

119
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,360
You're like a fucking baby...

120
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,240
sticking his fingers
in electrical sockets.

121
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,399
For 17 years, I've tried to stop you
from electrocuting yourself...

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,440
but it's never enough.

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,600
I can't take it anymore.

124
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,960
Have a good life.

125
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,519
He always wins.
I'm fucking sick of this.

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,039
-We should've moved on a long time ago.
-We didn't do anything to him!

127
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,879
Not today,
but look at everything we've done

128
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,039
to make his life a living hell.

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Not a single day has gone by
that we haven't hated him,

130
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,480
and we made sure he knew it.

131
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,759
He didn't win... We lost.

132
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,879
Guzmán.

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
-How are you?
-Fine.

134
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,360
I know you.

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,759
What they did to you is a disgrace.

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,279
We deserved it.

137
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,039
What? It can't end like this.

138
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,559
-I swear--
-Stay out of wars that don't affect you.

139
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
They affect me...
if they hurt someone I love.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,759
You can't risk your scholarship. 
It's your future.

141
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,600
What about yours? Doesn't it matter?

142
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm 17 years old.

143
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,279
I can afford
to put the future on hold for a year.

144
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Hey...

145
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,720
After graduation, we'll throw a party.

146
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,759
We'll have a blast.
Nothing will fuck it up.

147
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
I promise.

148
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,039
Give me a light, honey.

149
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,039
You never smoke on the job.

150
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,960
Those kids will be the end of me.

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,360
The school year's almost over,
but they'll be the end of me.

152
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,039
What you did is unfair, you know.

153
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,519
-Please, not you too.
-What do you want me to say?

154
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,879
It's not a question of being fair or not.
It's much more complicated.

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,159
-You'd need to be in my shoes to get it.
-But Guzmán and Samu don't deserve this.

156
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,360
Focus on the important stuff.

157
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
Your exams, for example.

158
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
I'm not taking any makeup exams.

159
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
Don't start with that nonsense
about favoritism again.

160
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,960
Allowing you to retake exams due to chemo
isn't favoritism.

161
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm not wasting my last few days of life
in front of a book.

162
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,240
What do you mean, "last days"?

163
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,799
There's no hope for me...

164
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,159
at least not down the road.

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,879
-And...
-Where'd you get that idea, Ander?

166
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Who told you that? No one told me that.

167
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,840
This is all I have. The here and now.

168
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,399
But, honey...

169
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,039
OK, and maybe tomorrow.

170
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,000
But I won't waste my time studying.
What for?

171
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,320
I won't allow
this resigned, defeated attitude.

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,279
Mom...

173
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,879
You don't want to study?
What do you want to do, then?

174
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
I don't know.

175
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,559
Spend some time with myself.

176
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,200
Start preparing myself.

177
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,600
You'd need to be in my shoes to get it.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,080
HI, YERAY. WHEN CAN WE MEET?
YERAY, PLEASE ANSWER ME.

179
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,039
ARE YOU OK? CAN I CALL YOU?

180
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,200
FROM: MOM
SUBJECT: GOOD NEWS!!!

181
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
The lawyer wants to meet
with my mom and brother in Morocco.

182
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,600
-He says he has good news.
-That's fucking awesome.

183
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,039
Maybe this nightmare will be over,
and Nano can come home.

184
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
It's not over as long as Polo's free.

185
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,759
You're obsessed with Polo, man!
Forget about him already.

186
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,799
He's already ruined your year,
your life, and everything.

187
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,679
-How can I forget?
-Distance.

188
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,159
Focus on what matters now,
like your family coming home.

189
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
-Be like Guzmán. Move on.
-Bullshit.

190
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,679
Here.

191
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,000
-What're you doing?
-Close your eyes. Close them!

192
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,919
All done.

193
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,159
-What's all done?
-Polo doesn't exist.

194
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Polo who? I don't know any Polo.

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,320
-Hey, neither do I.
-See?

196
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,639
It really works, huh?

197
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,399
Can I have a napkin?

198
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,039
You really have some balls
showing up here.

199
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,080
I just want to dry off, Omar.

200
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,480
And I want you to go.

201
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,759
For your own good.

202
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,720
Leave!

203
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,559
-Mom!
-Baby, tell me you have a cig.

204
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,679
I'm jonesing for one so bad,
I almost smoked parsley.

205
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,159
So? Aren't you going
to give your mom a hug?

206
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
That's more like it.

207
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,519
Tell me you have my lighter.

208
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,679
Why didn't you say
you were getting out today?

209
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,360
I called you a few times this morning,
but you didn't pick up.

210
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,080
-Shit, that was you?
-Of course it was me.

211
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,600
You smell so nice.

212
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,480
And you're so beautiful.

213
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,399
What?

214
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,519
Nothing.

215
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,440
Come on. I know that look.

216
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,279
I got kicked out of school.

217
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:44,200
What do you mean? When?

218
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Now. Well, earlier.

219
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,240
Why?

220
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,360
What do you think?

221
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,399
Fucking shit.

222
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,159
Well, know what? Fuck school.

223
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,879
If you know what you're doing,
you don't need school.

224
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,919
You've been doing an awesome job
running the family business.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,240
At your own level, on a small scale,
but awesome.

226
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:16,200
From now on,
it's mother and daughter, hand in hand.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
Hi.

228
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,039
Holy shit, Mom.

229
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,000
Get mad at her later.

230
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Let's go outside.

231
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,799
Sorry. I didn't know what else to do.

232
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,639
What's so hard to understand?

233
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,519
We do understand.

234
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,120
Look at you. You got expelled. So what?

235
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,679
Big fucking deal!

236
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:53,080
You'll graduate next year.
I don't have next year.

237
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,480
What don't you get?

238
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,000
Fine, you don't have next year.
What do you want to do?

239
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,639
Your mom says you want time
by yourself. That's a shitty plan.

240
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,240
Guzmán... none of you
will ever understand.

241
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,119
You can do whatever the hell you want.

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,079
If you don't want to study, don't.
I don't even care if you want to skydive.

243
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,960
But don't isolate yourself, please.

244
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,160
Because, if you really are dying...

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
I can't believe
you'd want to spend your time alone.

246
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,799
Without your family, your friends,
and Omar.

247
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,160
Ander.

248
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
-Damn it, Ander.
-Leave me alone, please.

249
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,920
I can't take it anymore.

250
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,960
Hi, Polo. I know you don't want
to talk to me.

251
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
That's fine, but I'm asking you...

252
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,599
please talk to your moms.

253
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,880
They could get them to readmit Valerio
and forgive him because...

254
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,359
there's no sense in punishing him
when he'd already learned his lesson.

255
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Please, whatever you decide, call me.

256
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,279
Please, OK?

257
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you wearing tomorrow?

258
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,359
I'm not going, Mom.

259
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,640
The students who won't be graduating...

260
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,319
got what they deserved.

261
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,839
And Guzmán and Samuel?

262
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,319
They just broke up the fight.

263
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Those bullies have been making
your life hell all year.

264
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,720
If you're not man enough to face them...

265
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,359
you can't expect me to stand by
and watch my son get beaten up.

266
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,559
How about the striped shirt...

267
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,279
with the blue pants?

268
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,079
You'll look so handsome.

269
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,519
What're you doing here?

270
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,559
What's up with you?

271
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,960
How'd you get in?
I don't have a doorman you can manipulate.

272
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,119
From when you asked me
to decorate the place and make it my own.

273
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,039
Yeah...

274
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,319
Those were good times.

275
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Please, take a seat. Get comfy.

276
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,839
Why are you here, Carla?

277
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,680
I came to apologize.

278
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,119
For real.

279
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,359
You're a really great guy.

280
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,519
"Yeray, you're a great guy.
You're really worth it,

281
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
any girl would kill to be with you..."

282
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Except the one who says it, of course.
Been there.

283
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,000
I really mean it.

284
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,799
Carla, the last thing I need now
is your pity, really.

285
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,440
-Please leave.
-All right...

286
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,160
Let's stop playing the victim...
because you don't like me either.

287
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

288
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,240
I don't like you,
and you don't like me either.

289
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,079
What about the last few months?

290
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,440
-What do you call--
-You love what I represent.

291
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,720
How well I fit in
with the image you created

292
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,200
to get likes from people
who hurt the old Yeray.

293
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,359
Your body, your clothes, your attitude...

294
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,400
You even created your own social network
to get them to worship you.

295
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,559
All I am to you is another accessory.

296
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,359
And I'm a walking checkbook
meant to save your wineries.

297
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
That's what I meant!

298
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,920
We don't like each other
the way we pretend to.

299
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,599
Even so, I was lucky enough
to get to know the real Yeray,

300
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,240
the one behind the selfies.

301
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,200
And I can tell you... he's a great guy.

302
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,119
Much better than the one you made up.

303
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,920
And I bet any girl
would kill to be with you.

304
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,400
Any girl but me.

305
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,799
So...

306
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,119
fuck the likes...

307
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,440
and fuck the wineries.

308
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,759
We've already wasted enough time
doing what others want us to do, right?

309
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,559
You have nothing to prove to anyone.

310
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,920
Now... can I give you a hug?

311
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:53,839
As a friend, not trying to manipulate you.

312
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,400
-Are you nervous, honey?
-A little, Dad.

313
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,519
It'll be fine.

314
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
There's Omar!

315
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
-How are you, Mom?
-I'm fine.

316
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,400
You look great.

317
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,039
You too.

318
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,200
How are you?

319
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,680
A bit nervous.

320
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,559
About what? Come on.

321
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,480
Hey.

322
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,079
-Hello.
-Hi, Lu.

323
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,279
I like it.

324
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,519
-Hey, Lu.
-What's up?

325
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,599
Didn't your parents come?

326
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,160
It seems your family knows how
to put problems aside for a while...

327
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,200
to focus on what matters.

328
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,319
I envy you.

329
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,079
In a good way.... and in a bad way too.

330
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,720
You look like a pistachio.

331
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,680
You can't make an exception?

332
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,720
After all I've done
for this fucking school!

333
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,640
-Please!
-I'll take you to court.

334
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,279
Come in, please.

335
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,200
Ventura, do what you think is best,
but the expulsion was justified.

336
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,319
Justified?

337
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
On the last day of the year? Oh, please.

338
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,519
My son's entire year,
thrown away on the last day!

339
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,839
-Laura, Ventura, I--
-Lucrecia, honey, stay out of this.

340
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,440
Actually, I wish you'd done more
to help Guzmán.

341
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,519
-Me?
-Yes. Your father's very influential.

342
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,519
-If we all did our part--
-Okay, that's enough.

343
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm very sorry.

344
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,039
Polo!

345
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,000
How are you? So?

346
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,200
Why are you ignoring me?

347
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,400
They still haven't signed the papers.

348
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
-We'll talk to your--
-Cayetana.

349
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,640
Why are you so set on Valerio graduating?

350
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,160
-So he can come with us and--
-And save our relationship.

351
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,839
Because... without him...

352
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,799
we just don't work.

353
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,880
Polo, don't start.

354
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,440
Don't start.

355
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,599
I get it. You're under a lot of pressure.

356
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
-You don't know what you're saying.
-No.

357
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,079
For the first time in a long time, I know.

358
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,880
What about... London? Our plans?

360
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,359
See? That's all you're worried about.

361
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,160
London, our plans...

362
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,880
You're not in love with me...
but with the life I would've provided.

363
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,799
Why are you using the past tense?

364
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,559
I have to go, OK?

366
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,839
Hey...

367
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,200
What happened?

368
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,400
Nothing.

369
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,440
Hold on... one sec. I won't be long.

370
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,559
Teodoro.

371
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,839
Can we meet at your place later
to close the deal?

372
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,680
Of course.

373
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm glad you reconsidered.

374
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
The ceremony will start in five minutes.

375
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,359
There he is.

376
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
Thank you.

377
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,640
Let's continue.

378
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,319
Shit...

379
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
Let me do it.

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,039
The students I'm about to introduce...

381
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,240
What should we do?

382
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,519
I really don't know.

383
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,079
All I know is I want that scholarship.

384
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,559
So do I. But we're selling out.

385
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,039
So, you don't want it?

386
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,559
At what price?

387
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Can the winners of the first edition
of the scholarship please come up?

388
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,400
A big round of applause

389
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,680
for Nadia Shanaa
and Lucrecia Montesinos Hendrich.

390
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:43,000
Bill McKinley will present the award
on behalf of Columbia University.

391
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
Good afternoon.

392
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,440
I want to thank our parents and friends
who have come to share

393
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,039
in this special moment...

394
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,480
for us and... for our fellow students.

395
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,039
I would like--

396
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,559
I can't.

397
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,839
Can you speak for me, Nadia?

398
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,799
No, you've already started.

399
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,640
Well...

400
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,799
-I was saying that--
-No, wait.

401
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,599
I would just like to say that...

402
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,799
I would like to--

403
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,400
We would like to...

404
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,559
I think I speak for us both.

405
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,599
We dedicate this award...

406
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,039
to our classmates.

407
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,920
Especially everyone in the back...

408
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,720
who, for various reasons,
cannot join us... up here...

409
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,279
in this graduation ceremony.

410
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,799
Not being able to have them
here with us...

411
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,400
makes this moment...

412
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,480
less happy than we would have liked.

413
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,799
That's right.

414
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,359
We should be jumping for joy.

415
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,680
But we're not.

416
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,279
Because we deserve... this award.

417
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,559
We deserve this moment, Nadia.

418
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,759
My friends are there...

419
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,880
due to a series of injustices.

420
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,720
Including the most serious one.

421
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,519
The one that deprived us... of Marina.

422
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,279
These are injustices...
that we both denounce.

423
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,400
That's right.

424
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,680
And one person is responsible
for all those injustices.

425
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,480
Polo...

426
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,880
How are you? Happy?

427
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,839
I cannot believe this.

428
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,880
Look, this award

429
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,799
that she and I are receiving...

430
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,000
was created by your moms
to clean up your image, basically.

431
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,519
And we're accepting it because,
I repeat, we deserve it.

432
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,759
What else should we do?
Because this has become--

433
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,319
If you feel so conflicted, don't worry.

434
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,559
The scholarship's called off.

435
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,680
-Begoña, please.
-No.

436
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,160
We have always wanted to support
Las Encinas and every student in it.

437
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,799
Who went into the bathroom?

438
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,799
Omar, I don't have all day.

439
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,480
And if I did, I don't have the patience.
Give me a name.

440
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,519
Nadia.

441
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,680
You're accusing your own sister?

442
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,880
You know what?

443
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,960
I promised someone I love very much...

444
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,680
that we would celebrate this day together.

445
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,119
And that we would have lots of fun,

446
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,759
and that nothing and nobody
would fuck it up.

447
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,440
Let's go celebrate at Teatro Barceló!

448
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,359
Hello?

449
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,599
Samuel.

450
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,680
You need to come to the police station.
It's extremely urgent.

451
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
Dad, I'm going to the bathroom.

452
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,400
-Wait for me outside.
-OK.

453
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,640
-We don't have the money.
-We'll take out a loan.

454
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,000
So?

455
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,640
You don't need Nadia in New York.

456
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,000
What do you mean?

457
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,799
-I'd never go on my own.
-You'll have me.

458
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:00,599
Wow! I thought we were just hooking up.

459
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,960
Fuck...

460
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,079
-What?
-I'm sorry.

461
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,480
Sorry I didn't react the way you wanted.

462
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,200
And yes, we hooked up.

463
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,880
And that meant a lot to me.

464
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,519
When your sister asked me
if you could come...

465
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,000
it left me speechless.

466
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,839
I thought Nadia's idea was crazy, too.
And it was more than just hooking up.

467
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,960
Maybe that's why we should do it.

468
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
If a suggestion leaves you speechless,
you have to try.

469
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,640
It was all a setup...

470
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,680
to locate your family
and arrest your brother.

471
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,799
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,640
I swear, I knew nothing about it.

473
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,839
They tricked me too.

474
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,519
And they found them?

475
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,240
Your brother will be repatriated.

476
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh, Samuel...

477
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,239
Meanwhile, the killer's
in his suit and tie, about to go free.

478
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,599
-I'm sorry.
-You should be. You're also to blame.

479
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,559
-I told you, they tricked me too.
-Who tricked you?

480
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,119
I'll tell you who.
Your bosses, your colleagues...

481
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,480
the fucking system you work for,
belong to,

482
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,480
and won't do shit about.

483
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,800
That's why it's your fault.

484
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,639
Shit.

485
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,599
I printed the document you sent me.

486
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,000
If you want to review it one last time...

487
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,840
No.

488
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,920
No, I think... you should review it.

489
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,639
Yes.

490
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,639
There's been a change...
in section three of clause four.

491
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,000
About the management of the wineries?

492
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,960
You've been replaced by Carla.

493
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,679
She'll be the sole and exclusive manager
of the wineries and all related assets

494
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,679
as soon as she turns 18,
which won't be long now.

495
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,760
Look...

496
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,320
You'll have nothing to do with it.
Neither will I.

497
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,840
I'll stay out of it.

498
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,079
So...

499
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,400
Carla will be the owner.

500
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,360
Yeray, what you're proposing...

501
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,599
has never been on the table.

502
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,920
It is now.

503
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,199
So, you decide.

504
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,679
Let your daughter support you
as she sees fit...

505
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,360
or your business will go under

506
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,880
and you'll have no way
to support yourself.

507
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,280
She's very young
and has no clue how to run a business.

508
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,159
-Say something, honey.
-I say...

509
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,519
I'm done taking orders.

510
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,960
Excuse me?

511
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,079
I say...

512
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,519
you aren't going to decide
what I can or can't do anymore.

513
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,000
It's over.

514
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,239
I want to do whatever I want...

515
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
be whatever I want...

516
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,079
and be with whoever I want.

517
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,960
You have no power over me.

518
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,559
So, what do you say?

519
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,400
Shall we sign?

520
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,920
You know who's to blame? Azucena.

521
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,360
She doesn't command respect
from her students.

522
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,320
-She fears them and spoils them.
-It was a childish prank.

523
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,519
Canceling the scholarship
was an overreaction.

524
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,239
At least I did something.

525
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
If it wasn't for me,

526
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,480
the bullies who made your son's life hell
would still be in school.

527
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,159
-Maybe I deserved it.
-What do you mean?

528
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,400
Don't be ridiculous.
After everything that's happened...

529
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,119
the bullying, the tweets,

530
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:58,000
everything they wrote, all the hurt.

531
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,000
-To top it off, the person in charge--
-I killed Marina, Mom!

532
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,760
-It was an accident, but I did.
-Enough of this nonsense.

533
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,559
-Begoña.
-I don't want to hear it.

534
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,800
Marina had something
that belonged to Carla...

535
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,880
and I wanted to get it
to get Carla back.

536
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,719
-Polo, enough.
-No!

537
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,519
Fuck, Mom.
You always tell me to be a man.

538
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,360
To face up to things, to be brave.
Well, that's what I'm doing.

539
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,000
I killed Marina...

540
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,199
I can't bring her back.

541
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,320
I can't help Samuel and Guzmán graduate.
But don't cancel the scholarship.

542
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,599
At least let someone have a happy ending
in this awful story.

543
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,760
So, please call now.

544
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,679
Please.

545
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,760
Azucena? Yes, hi. It's Begoña.

546
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,480
I'm sorry to be calling so late, but...

547
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,480
I want to talk... about the scholarship.

548
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,800
Hi.

549
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,199
-Have you seen Samuel?
-Nope.

550
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:47,360
Should we hijack the DJ booth
to liven things up?

551
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,079
No music
can lift the funk hanging over all of us.

552
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
So, I lost the scholarship.

553
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,199
You two just had to play the heroines.

554
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,639
-What now?
-Let me use one of your questions.

555
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,679
Where does that leave us?

556
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,360
Define "that."

557
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,400
The fact that I'm not going.
That I'm staying.

558
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,440
Well, taking inspiration
from your answer...

559
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:19,079
I'd say it leaves us
in a very similar place.

560
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,519
You're here...

561
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,960
And I'm here.

562
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,199
After all the bad stuff that's happened,
that's a good thing, right?

563
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,440
I'd say so.

564
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,960
Hey, sorry, have you seen Ander?

565
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,199
No, but don't stop looking.

566
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:40,280
Everyone's looking for someone tonight.

567
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,599
Luckily, some of us have found
what we were looking for.

568
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,559
Hey, babe.

569
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,119
Hey.

570
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,679
I didn't graduate.

571
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,800
Me neither.

572
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,719
Well... misery loves company.

573
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,000
What will you do?

574
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,239
-Repeat the school year or get a job?
-No.

575
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,840
I got an opportunity to go to New York.

576
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:50,960
Really?

577
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,800
Yeah.

578
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
But not with your sister, right?

579
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
No. I mean, yeah,

580
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:01,760
at first, it was with her,
but after what happened...

581
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,599
well...

582
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
I'm going with Malick.

583
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,760
So, he'll help you get settled?

584
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,360
It all sounds too weird.

585
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,000
Or too perfect.

586
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,960
Yeah, that too.

587
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,639
What do you think?

588
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,039
Me?

589
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,760
Whatever you think.

590
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,840
I think I need your opinion.

591
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:57,159
Only an idiot would let something
that perfect slip away.

592
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:02,880
Right.

593
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,280
OK.

594
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,360
-Omar.
-What?

595
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:17,480
Goodbye.

596
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:00,960
Hey, sexy.

597
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
Not now, Carla.

598
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,599
Why not now?
You don't even know what I'm gonna say.

599
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:14,480
Look...

600
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:18,400
it may surprise you to hear this,
but I was thinking--

601
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,440
What the hell is he doing here?

602
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,119
