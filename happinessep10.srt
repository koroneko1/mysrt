1
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,635
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIONS,

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,638
EVENTS, AND OCCUPATIONS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,994
Mr. Kim.

4
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,301
Mr. Jung.

5
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,311
Does Sae-bom have the antibody?

6
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,188
Unfortunately, she doesn't.

7
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,818
Then why did you suddenly call me?

8
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,361
Let Seo-yoon out.

9
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,489
We decided to accept minors
from the lockdown areas,

10
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,825
in terms of humanitarianism.

11
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,535
But it's dangerous out there too.

12
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,703
We'll keep her
in the safest place available.

13
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,414
But the problem is coming out
of the apartment complex.

14
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,084
Can I let Sae-bom go with her?

15
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,467
If you two come out together,
we're willing to accept you,

16
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,179
but you will have to cooperate
with what I'm doing.

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,184
I'll discuss it with Sae-bom and call you.

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,734
Do we have to keep the truth
from Mr. Jung too?

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,446
Don't you find it odd?

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,242
He asked if Yoon Sae-bom can go out too

21
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,120
while saying
it's dangerous outside as well.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,164
He's someone who's willing
to come out himself if it's dangerous.

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,377
What are you doing?

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,754
Oh, this was at Seo-yoon's house.

25
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,258
I was a Jenga master when I was in school.
9th degree rank in Jenga.

26
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,260
Would you like to join us?

27
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,346
No, I have to go to the 15th floor,
so I'll play later.

28
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,514
Okay?

29
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,765
You mean to Sae-bom?

30
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,559
You saw her just now.

31
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,229
But I miss her,
even if I see her all the time.

32
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,647
Gross.

33
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,237
Yi-hyun, we have trouble.

34
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,995
What is it?

35
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:31,961
This.

36
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,296
It was on the table.

37
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,175
I did something wrong
that cannot be undone.

38
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,385
I tried to hold it in

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,013
by staying home,

40
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,182
but I don't think I can do that anymore.

41
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm going to leave the apartments
and ask for help.

42
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,191
I'll leave the remaining food
and water for all the residents to share.

43
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,198
Here.

44
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,997
Don't they look different?

45
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,957
Well…

46
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,002
Your handwriting does change
when you're anxious.

47
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,632
We need a detective.

48
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,521
But can you believe it?

49
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,149
He's going to go outside and ask for help,
but we can share the food…

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,485
That's weird.

51
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,030
What did he mean by a wrongdoing

52
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,324
that can't be undone?

53
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,705
What can he do
when he doesn't leave his house?

54
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,708
Well, there is something.

55
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,459
The gym.

56
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,128
You're still thinking about that?

57
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,255
I told you, he's not someone
who'd take drugs.

58
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,298
What is this?

59
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,592
WHITE LIMESTONE

60
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,803
Does he grow a vegetable garden, too?

61
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,431
If you put it in the toilet,
it blocks the odor.

62
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm in the SOU, you know.

63
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,772
-I used it during outdoor drills.
-Right.

64
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,238
What's going on?

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,706
He does have a lot of medicine.

66
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,753
But these drugs are all authorized.

67
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,261
It's Next.

68
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,223
-Seriously, this place is…
-What?

69
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,059
What the heck? You two were in there.

70
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,352
-What's the house owner doing?
-Why are you here?

71
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,521
We're here to finish
yesterday's conversation.

72
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,148
We're all struggling now, so…

73
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,028
-You received something.
-This is…

74
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,989
We live in the same building,
so we should help each other.

75
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,701
We're talking to him,

76
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,579
so please wait.

77
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,809
There's no sign of trespassing,
but we found Next.

78
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,562
"Something that cannot be undone."
Maybe that means he's infected.

79
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,399
I don't know.

80
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,028
He takes selfies and he's always happy.

81
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,781
Even if he was infected,
he'd just stay home.

82
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:52,328
There's no way
that homebody would've gone outside.

83
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,372
Then where would he be?

84
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,289
Someone…

85
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,583
must've locked him up.

86
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,586
What about his note, then?

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,005
He wrote that because he was threatened.

88
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,683
Or maybe not.

89
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,495
He's not in the building,
and the lobby door is unlocked.

90
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,080
He might've really gone outside.

91
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,166
But there are soldiers everywhere outside.

92
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,169
He's rich. He might have paid someone
to unlock the door for him.

93
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,132
Come on, open the door, please!

94
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,384
Sir!

95
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,887
I don't hear anything. Are you in there?

96
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,388
What are you doing?

97
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,316
You're here too.

98
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,778
Everyone asked me for help.

99
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,449
I heard he has a lot of water,

100
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,701
so wouldn't it be nice to share some?

101
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,411
I know, right?

102
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,080
So we just want to talk to him.

103
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,210
Someone saw him going outside too,

104
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,212
so we must check if he's infected as well.

105
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,631
-Who saw him?
-Me.

106
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,467
I saw him going out early in the morning.

107
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,384
Really?

108
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,595
Are you sure it was Kim Se-hoon?

109
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,472
I couldn't see his face,

110
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,600
but he's the only person
who wears a quarantine suit.

111
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,901
I'm sorry,

112
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,071
but we do need a plan
because we're short on water.

113
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,952
And the people on the 2nd floor
put a ridiculous price on it.

114
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,578
Gosh.

115
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,179
So you had the key too.

116
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,848
They even brought out
a shopping bag with something in it!

117
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,308
It's mine, okay?

118
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,522
Oh, my goodness.

119
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,238
He said to share the things in his house.

120
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,282
So the house owner gave permission.

121
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,242
Then why didn't you say anything earlier?

122
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:40,037
More than that,
what's "something that cannot be undone?"

123
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,083
Did he have legal problems?

124
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,168
Anyway, it's a finders-keepers situation.

125
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,337
Honey, take this water first.

126
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,255
Take it.

127
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,594
-Let go.
-Please calm down.

128
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,596
Let's share some of the food first.

129
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,347
Not all of them. Just some of them.

130
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,016
We don't know when he'll be back.

131
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,351
And leave some for those who aren't here.

132
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,478
Who are you to decide that?

133
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,233
All right!
Call the others! Tell them to come!

134
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,985
Detective, look at this!

135
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,361
Call everyone!

136
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,780
I said, call them! I got it!
Let me go! Come on!

137
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,913
It's heavy.

138
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,707
I'm glad we got water.

139
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,502
Let's turn this light on
in the bathroom too.

140
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,965
What are you so displeased about?

141
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,010
Hey, we only got this much.

142
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,055
That place had lots
of survival equipment too.

143
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,184
Still, the detective
on the 5th floor divided it fairly.

144
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,061
Hey, did you say "fair?"

145
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,898
If he really wanted to be fair,
he should've given us more!

146
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,734
Those who paid more
to get in here should get more stuff!

147
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,277
Isn't that common sense?

148
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,488
You're talking nonsense.

149
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,698
Right. That's true.

150
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,286
By the way, that guy on the 5th floor…
Wasn't he weird today?

151
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,622
He was stuck to his wife's side like glue.

152
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,000
I guess he loves her very much.

153
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,716
You love me very much too, right?

154
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,885
Hey, it's hot. Get off me.

155
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,347
But there was a lot of food there, right?

156
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,183
Yes.

157
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,978
The house was big,
and it had a lot of weird things too.

158
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,706
What are you looking at?

159
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,043
What brings you two here?

160
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,586
It's about Unit 1501.

161
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,798
The owner left all his stuff behind.
It's a waste to leave them there.

162
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,593
The residents are suffering
from a shortage of necessities.

163
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,181
Hey, leave us.

164
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,976
Are you telling me to go out?

165
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,519
Then should I go out?

166
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,312
Stay outside.

167
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,026
Hurry!

168
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,362
Come in.

169
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,294
So Kim Se-hoon went outside, right?

170
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,795
I think so.

171
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,922
He's not in the building. That's for sure.

172
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
He must've been lonely.

173
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,385
I saw it on TV.
There's this thing called solitary death.

174
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,138
He has neither family nor friends,

175
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,056
so that must be why he went outside.

176
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,561
My mom and dad are together,
so they'd be okay, right?

177
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,189
Of course.

178
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:57,193
We would've been lonely too
if we didn't have you, Seo-yoon.

179
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,652
Your cute dimple!

180
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,287
Thanks.

181
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,126
Isn't it spicy?

182
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,505
You're good
at eating spicy food, Seo-yoon.

183
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,552
You dipped that much?

184
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,012
Isn't it spicy?

185
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,388
It's okay.

186
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,140
It looks spicy.

187
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,287
Mr. Kim.

188
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,457
Mr. Kim.

189
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,168
What?

190
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,714
Yi-hyun isn't here.
When did he go outside?

191
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,216
I don't know.

192
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,887
Do you miss him
even if you see him all the time?

193
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,806
Go back to sleep.

194
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,185
I've been there, so I know.

195
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,257
Will you marry me?

196
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,802
I wanted to have herringbone flooring,

197
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,596
but it's new flooring,
so I can't rip it out.

198
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,974
Still, this is neat.

199
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,601
I can't believe this.

200
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,353
I have a house now.

201
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,943
I thought I was left alone.

202
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,478
Hey.

203
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,647
Where have you been?
Why aren't you sleeping?

204
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,195
-Well…
-Does the walkie-talkie work?

205
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,740
Give it to me.

206
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,702
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok.

207
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,540
Lieutenant Colonel Han.

208
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,753
Hey, Han Tae-seok!

209
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,588
I'm sure he's asleep.

210
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
What did he say?

211
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,386
Do I have the antibody?

212
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,099
You don't.

213
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,727
I knew it.

214
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,189
I've never even gotten 5th in the lottery.

215
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,735
Still, I'm glad that I didn't get
the disease at least.

216
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,658
Hey, did your wound open?

217
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,077
No, it got much better.

218
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,413
No, it didn't.
It'll be awful if it gets infected.

219
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,498
I…

220
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,897
It does look much better, but…

221
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,109
I told you. I'm a human vitamin
and a human antibiotic.

222
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,612
You don't have additional injuries, right?

223
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,114
If you do, tell me. Okay?

224
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,573
Okay.

225
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,866
Good.

226
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,994
What did Han Tae-seok say?

227
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,705
He told us to let Seo-yoon out.

228
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,874
He said they'll take her in.

229
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,376
-Really?
-Yes.

230
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,293
So?

231
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,963
I told him I'll discuss it with you.

232
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,385
Wouldn't it be dangerous outside?

233
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,804
So I was thinking…

234
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,140
Why don't you go outside with her?

235
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,476
If you're with Seo-yoon,
I'm sure she'll feel relieved too.

236
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,271
We should all go out together.

237
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,189
And you should get some antibiotics too.

238
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,567
I think…

239
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,153
it's better for Seo-yoon
not to go outside for now.

240
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,156
We need to know
what it's really like out there.

241
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,744
Right.

242
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,748
Is Kim Se-hoon outside?

243
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,083
Not officially,

244
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,920
but he said he'll look into it
since someone could've helped him.

245
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,714
I thought about it, and…

246
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,218
He may be in here.

247
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,138
But we checked everywhere in the building.

248
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,099
There's one place we didn't check.

249
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,982
He tried to go outside,
but he got scared of soldiers

250
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,984
and the infected, so he came back in.

251
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,236
He's hiding in here now.

252
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,364
I'm sure he doesn't know
the passcode, though.

253
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,700
Still, we have to check.

254
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,345
Sae-bom.

255
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,724
KIM SE-HOON, UNIT 1501

256
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,914
Did you enjoy it?

257
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,167
Of course, I did.

258
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,049
You two.

259
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,009
Stop it and come out.

260
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,899
You just need to keep that in mind.

261
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,402
I was giving some legal consultation.

262
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,574
Don't do that in places
where there are no people.

263
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,159
Legal consultation.

264
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,913
You may run into the infected
if you wander around secretly.

265
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,707
Will you keep this a secret?

266
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,210
Mr. Lawyer, you should tell the truth.

267
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,212
Once trust is broken,

268
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,839
your relationship can't last long.

269
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,842
Can we go now?

270
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,928
You two.

271
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,848
Don't ever come here again.

272
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,769
Wait.

273
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,521
Don't forget to take this.

274
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,484
That's not ours.

275
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,757
Mr. Kim.

276
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,310
Mr. Kim?

277
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,313
Can you hear me?

278
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,279
Are you doing this
because you feel thirsty?

279
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,071
-This powder…
-It's limestone.

280
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,616
It was at Kim Se-hoon's house.

281
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,808
Mr. Oh.

282
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,227
You're a real doctor, right?

283
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,356
Come out. You need to take
a look at someone.

284
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,442
But my license got suspended.

285
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,114
Who is it? Who's sick?

286
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,201
You'll know once you come.

287
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,453
We know nothing. We're serious.

288
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,874
We were just having a legal consultation.

289
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,084
You don't need to talk about that anymore.

290
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,879
Just tell us about
the situation when you got in here.

291
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,589
Didn't you feel anything strange?

292
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,759
Well, I don't remember.

293
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,304
Didn't you go into the master bedroom?

294
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,715
We did go in there, but…

295
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,175
You see…

296
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,011
It smelled like cement,
and flies were buzzing in there,

297
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,387
so we stepped out.

298
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,308
If we knew there was a corpse,
we wouldn't have stayed here.

299
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,144
You're not suspecting us, are you?

300
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,315
I'm a lawyer. Please keep in mind
that I'm not that stupid.

301
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,194
What about Jung-kook?

302
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,571
I told him what happened.
He'll bring people.

303
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,117
What are you doing here?

304
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,536
This way.

305
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,789
Wait here for a moment.

306
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,764
DO NOT ENTER, RISK OF INFECTION!

307
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,560
What are you looking at?

308
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,025
Whenever I see this,
I feel a bit more relaxed.

309
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,405
I can't be a shameful father to my kids.

310
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,369
I only looked at this,
but the battery's running out.

311
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,210
Here.

312
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,339
Hey, don't you need this
to write your novel?

313
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,551
I have paper and a pencil.

314
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,764
That's what's good about being a writer.
It doesn't cost money.

315
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,224
Thanks.

316
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,146
All I do is receive stuff from you.

317
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,567
I'm so ashamed as your older brother.

318
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,903
Hyun-kyung, even so…

319
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
if something bad happens to me,

320
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,453
then please look after my family.

321
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,164
No way.

322
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,375
Just think of getting out of here safely.

323
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,295
Hey, you know I'm ill.

324
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,547
I'm begging you, so please…

325
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,508
You seem much better now.

326
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,930
Hi.

327
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,682
Hi.

328
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,937
You gave us food last time.
I'm repaying you for that.

329
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,486
What? What's all this?

330
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,781
What?

331
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,870
By the way, is it okay
to give us all this?

332
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,414
Of course. It's all mine.

333
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,127
You two were here.

334
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,797
Well…

335
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,466
You should come with me to the 11th floor.

336
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,093
Why? What happened?

337
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,053
You see…

338
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,597
Someone died.

339
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,599
What? Who?

340
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,191
Why would you do this to me
when I've just woken up?

341
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,527
That really scared me. Jeez.

342
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,862
But you're the only doctor
in this building.

343
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,365
Then you should've told me
what was in there.

344
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,826
Wait.

345
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,953
What? Did you suspect me?

346
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,249
Did you make me go into that room
because you thought I killed her?

347
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,959
That doesn't seem to be the case.

348
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,544
Well, you're so good at lying.

349
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,295
You think I'm a murderer?

350
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,672
Forget it.

351
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,881
Just tell us

352
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,217
your opinion as a doctor.

353
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,553
She was obviously bitten to death.

354
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,680
Her neck was completely torn.

355
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,014
It stinks.

356
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,517
Can't you tell us something
more professional?

357
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,353
Professional?

358
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,940
Judging by the blood coagulation
and rigidity of the body,

359
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,692
it's been more than two days
since she died.

360
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,320
The killer tried to get rid
of the smell with limestone.

361
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,490
It's that limestone
from the 15th floor, right?

362
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,368
Damn it. These flies…

363
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,997
These things come first when a human dies.

364
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,250
They lay eggs in their eyes and nose.

365
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,838
This is why it's better to be alive
even if your life's a mess.

366
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,090
Go out there and explain it to the people.

367
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,633
And don't talk about the flies.

368
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,846
That scared the crap out of me. Darn it.

369
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:29,976
By the way, did those two
find the body first?

370
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,186
Together?

371
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,395
It's a misunderstanding.

372
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,691
I felt weird, so I asked him to come here.

373
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,111
Because the cleaning lady
was crying in my dreams…

374
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,907
-I mean it.
-Right. Of course.

375
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,158
Don't.

376
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,367
It's okay.

377
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,247
I'm really okay,
but I'm worried about the lawyer.

378
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,251
Your wife will be really shocked,
won't she?

379
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,589
That superpower jerk
stabbed us in the back!

380
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,678
Detective, Andrew took our food
and ran away!

381
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,096
He's been caught in the act!

382
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,182
Don't you have to arrest him right away?

383
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,142
Please calm down.

384
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,727
Someone died.

385
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,771
That's not important right now.

386
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,523
The food is gone!

387
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,275
The cleaning lady
who was at your house died!

388
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,985
Ms. Lee Deok-soon!

389
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,654
What…

390
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,988
Seriously.

391
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,534
I checked the body,

392
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,786
and it looks like the infected did it.

393
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,871
Her neck was bitten.

394
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,501
It must be the man on the 15th floor.

395
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,002
It was written on the note.

396
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,547
"Something wrong that cannot be undone."

397
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,925
Right.

398
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,302
That was a confession.

399
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,931
That means we can share
the remaining food, right?

400
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,726
We don't have evidence saying
that Kim Se-hoon did it.

401
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,687
Who else can it be, then?

402
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,565
There aren't
any other infected people here.

403
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,483
Now, when you take a look at it…

404
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,195
If there's a victim and a runaway,
we naturally know who the culprit is.

405
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,073
Mr. Jung, you're a detective,
so you'd know, right?

406
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,495
We need to investigate more.

407
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,457
Especially about how the victim left
the second floor and was found here.

408
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,254
We will hear more from you two
as the witnesses later.

409
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,471
Honey.

410
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,100
The corpse was really scary.

411
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:41,149
Unit 1102 is a crime scene,
so no one's allowed in there.

412
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,735
We changed the passcode too.
So keep that in mind.

413
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,486
When will you give out the food?

414
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,614
That bastard Andrew
took ours and ran away!

415
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
Sae-bom, Yi-hyun.

416
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,869
Mr. Ahn and the writer are here.

417
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,579
It's so damn far away.

418
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,541
-What happened?
-Did the cleaning lady really pass away?

419
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,084
You damn thief!

420
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,836
How could you do this?

421
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,464
-Stop it.
-Let go! You jerk!

422
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,299
Honey, are you trying to kill him?

423
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,010
What's wrong with you?

424
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,386
Are you okay?

425
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,560
Hey!

426
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,691
Young-in.

427
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,153
Young-in.

428
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,447
The symptoms won't stop.

429
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,825
-What about the tranquilizer?
-We injected the maximum amount.

430
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,827
Her body won't be able
to hold out anymore.

431
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,123
Do we have samples
of the plasma cure we made?

432
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,751
There's one,
but the higher-ups are taking it.

433
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,128
They told us to submit everything
being tested.

434
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,963
Lieutenant Colonel.

435
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,390
Didn't you say you'll keep it
a secret from Ms. Yoon?

436
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,766
If we take the cure now,

437
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,768
the higher-ups will notice it's important.

438
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,936
I know that.

439
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,288
Leave it here.

440
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,088
Lower your gun.

441
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,049
Lower your gun!

442
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,477
Please calm down.

443
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,937
We're all on the same side,

444
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,107
and Lieutenant Colonel
Han Tae-seok is in charge here.

445
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,027
Ask the Prime Minister's office.

446
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,696
He's doing what he needs to do.

447
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,711
Get out of the way.

448
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,992
Check her condition,

449
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,994
and report right away
if there's a problem.

450
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,205
What happened just now…

451
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,084
The higher-ups will find out.

452
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,879
Also, that you kept it
a secret from Ms. Yoon.

453
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,881
We just need to report it first.

454
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,342
-What?
-Report to the higher-ups

455
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,635
that she has the antibody.

456
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,930
And that we confirmed it
by testing it on my wife's body.

457
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,306
Then…

458
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,517
Tell them I'll take
Yoon Sae-bom out tomorrow.

459
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,019
It will only buy some time.

460
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,813
They will suspect you.

461
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,649
That's what I need.

462
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,110
Time.

463
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,658
Andrew is the last witness.

464
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,201
No one else saw her after him.

465
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,746
So the estimated time of death
is around that time too?

466
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,001
It means she was killed
on her way upstairs.

467
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,003
But…

468
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,463
Do you think Kim Se-hoon really did this?

469
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,260
Sae-bom, give me some water.

470
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,137
I'm thirsty.

471
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,057
Gosh, I'm so tired.

472
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,602
I'm getting a lot of exercise here.

473
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,062
I'm thirsty.

474
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,736
I'm so thirsty. Thanks.

475
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
Where are the other residents?

476
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,041
They're asking why we're doing nothing
when it's obvious who the killer is.

477
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,168
They said we should
just break into Unit 1501

478
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,629
and share the rest of the things in there.

479
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,303
Let's go. If we do nothing,
they'll get more agitated.

480
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,264
But I just sat down…

481
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,903
We're only sharing the food.
You can't take anything else.

482
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,948
And we'll leave some, just in case.

483
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,659
We'll give them out to each of you,
so come in one by one.

484
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,119
Come in.

485
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,250
They said everyone gets a portion.

486
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,628
-Shouldn't we get Andrew's portion?
-We can just take it.

487
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,297
We take Andrew's portion too, right?

488
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,423
We can take it.

489
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,761
But shouldn't they give
Andrew's portion to us?

490
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,806
Why didn't they give it to us?
He took so much!

491
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,225
I won't let this slide. Just wait and see.

492
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:53,062
Gosh, how could he
take everything like that?

493
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,150
Is Dong-hyun here?

494
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,318
What?

495
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,239
He was here, but he left.

496
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,327
I carried all this heavy stuff by myself.

497
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,828
Seriously…

498
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,415
So-yoon…

499
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,252
I really was just giving
that woman legal consultation

500
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,838
in a quiet place…

501
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:04,633
Stop it.

502
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,636
I'm sick of hearing that.

503
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,064
Can I really stay here?

504
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,648
Only for a while.

505
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,358
Don't wander around.

506
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,360
The man on the 2nd floor
is out to get you.

507
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,905
But he won't come up here
to the 15th floor.

508
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,656
This place is too far away.

509
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,242
Thank you.

510
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,787
I'll stay here only until Mr. Kim returns.

511
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,246
Well, if he does return.

512
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,415
Get some rest.

513
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,710
And take those goggles off
when you're alone.

514
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,337
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

515
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,054
Try to stay inside.

516
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,564
Seo-yoon.

517
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,399
Seo-yoon.

518
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,234
Seo-yoon, what's wrong?

519
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,278
Do you have chest pain?

520
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,948
What's wrong?

521
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,163
I just coughed.

522
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,916
If I do this for a bit, it gets better.

523
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,297
But why were you hiding like that?

524
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,008
Don't you have medicine for it?

525
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,139
I get a shot if I go to the hospital,

526
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,058
but it hurts a lot.

527
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,480
I just need to cough a bit.

528
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,663
It'd be better to let Seo-yoon out, right?

529
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,168
It may be dangerous,
but they have doctors and medicine.

530
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,045
I'll talk to Han Tae-seok about it.

531
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,173
Don't worry.

532
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,399
I'm sure my husband

533
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,986
would want me to do something
for this apartment too.

534
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,825
He was worried about all of you
until his last moments.

535
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,828
You all know…

536
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,291
that the infected killed
the cleaning lady, right?

537
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,171
They may still be inside,
so please be careful.

538
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,550
Do your best to stay at home,

539
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,428
and if you need to move,
stay in groups of two or more.

540
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,306
We should discuss securing
the doors of this building

541
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,934
and distinguishing
the infected from now on.

542
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,229
In the case of my husband…

543
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,357
If we had found out a bit earlier…

544
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,658
It's important to actively find
the infected.

545
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,411
And persuade those

546
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,080
who are not coming out
of their houses to test them.

547
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,082
Yes.

548
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,168
Right, we have to find the infected.

549
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,131
Whose blood should we use today?

550
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,426
Should we draw straws?

551
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,679
I think you should just do it.

552
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,224
No.

553
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,686
A doctor should do it.
So you can treat yourself when you bleed!

554
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,812
Get away from me!

555
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,188
Hey, stop!

556
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,107
Don't do this!

557
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,692
-Someone will get hurt!
-Stop it!

558
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,694
Someone will get hurt for real!

559
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,793
Stop this, will you?

560
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,215
More than that,
shouldn't we discuss food and water first?

561
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,384
If you have any ideas, please tell us.

562
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,012
We're going outside.

563
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,514
If Kim Se-hoon really did go outside,

564
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,016
that means there's a way out.

565
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,770
So we're going to go outside
and see if we can get food or water.

566
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,939
There's emergency power
down in the basement.

567
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,775
Rather than going outside,

568
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,819
if you go down
and turn on that emergency power,

569
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,197
the electricity will come back on,
so we can cook,

570
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,907
and the water will start again too.

571
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,034
Building 103 has EPS,

572
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,786
Emergency Power Supply,

573
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,871
in the electrical room
under the senior citizens' center.

574
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,125
It's made to turn on
emergency lights for elevators.

575
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,710
If you turn on the general power,

576
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,754
the electricity and water
will be turned on.

577
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,632
But honestly, I'm more worried that

578
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,969
you could just go outside
and never return.

579
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,389
Right, that's true.

580
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,434
Mr. Detective,
you're close to that military man.

581
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,942
Like Mr. Oh said, it'd be better
to take care of things here first.

582
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,743
Let's do that.

583
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:08,997
We'll go down and turn on
the emergency power.

584
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,590
Mr. Oh.

585
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,469
How did you know
about the emergency power?

586
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,347
Anyone who lives
in an apartment knows that.

587
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,057
I know you hate me,

588
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,394
but this is a time of emergency.

589
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,189
So take a look at things with
a broader point of view and cooperate.

590
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,901
We should live
like civilized human beings.

591
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,449
Are we really going
to the electrical room?

592
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,203
It sounds a bit fishy, but it's necessary.

593
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,913
That's true, but…

594
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,332
It's a chance to let Seo-yoon out too.

595
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,628
Let's send her out
before we go down to the electrical room.

596
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,548
What should we tell her, though?

597
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,133
We can keep that a secret.

598
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,888
She may refuse if we say
that she's getting out alone.

599
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:07,973
That's true.

600
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,976
She's actually quite mature, so…

601
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,273
Going down is one thing,
but how will we come up?

602
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,569
Remember how he said
it's really noisy when it's turned on?

603
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,114
The infected will rush toward us
when they hear the noise.

604
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,158
And they'll chase us here.

605
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,035
If the entrance is breached,

606
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,205
it can get more dangerous.

607
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,373
Then we can come up using a different way.

608
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,751
Let's go.

609
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,846
Get some more sleep.

610
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,880
Get the infiltration team ready.

611
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,049
If they don't call by morning,
we're going in.

612
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,511
There are a lot of severe variant patients
in the apartment.

613
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,265
If we go in without any arrangements,
there will be casualties.

614
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,684
We just need Yoon Sae-bom safe.

615
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,519
Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae-seok.

616
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:20,897
Have you decided?

617
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,524
I will let Sae-bom…

618
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,485
and Seo-yoon out.

619
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:30,032
They will be at the underground
parking lot at 1:00 p.m.,

620
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,450
so get ready to take them.

621
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,202
What about you? Aren't you coming?

622
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,497
Someone has to stay and watch the house.

623
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,876
We may have disagreed with one another,

624
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,962
but I know that you sincerely
tried to stop Mad Human Disease.

625
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,634
Please help us

626
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,053
so Sae-bom

627
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,014
and Seo-yoon can live safely.

628
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,024
Jung Yi-hyun is infected.

629
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,152
That's why he's trying
to let Yoon Sae-bom out.

630
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,946
See?

631
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,908
Let's play one more round.

632
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,119
You want to play again?

633
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,870
Until I win.

634
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,930
-Yi-hyun.
-What?

635
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,223
Let's talk for a minute.

636
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,775
I talked to Han Tae-seok,

637
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,195
and the soldiers are coming
to the underground parking lot.

638
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,782
We can go down to the electrical room
after we send Seo-yoon out.

639
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,870
You have eye boogers again.

640
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,002
We talked about this already.

641
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,591
We promised to tell each other
when we're sick.

642
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,053
If I get infected, feel thirsty,
and want to bite people too,

643
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,722
then I will make sure to tell you.

644
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:00,807
So…

645
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,978
you should also tell me
if anything happens.

646
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,897
Are you okay?

647
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,445
Of course, I'm okay. Why?

648
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,406
Are you worried
my wound might be infected?

649
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,075
I thought about it,

650
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,706
and the wound
on your palm healed too quickly.

651
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,752
You don't drink water, either.

652
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,423
It does look much better, but…

653
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,469
I told you. I'm a human vitamin
and a human antibiotic.

654
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,099
It's not like that.
It still sores like crazy.

655
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,601
I'll show you.

656
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,977
Look.

657
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,482
I was shocked seeing Lee Deok-soon's body,

658
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,692
so I must've not known
that it burst again.

659
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,489
Thank goodness.

660
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,659
I was worried sick, you know.

661
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,037
Then you should've told me.
Why were you worried?

662
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,206
How can I not be worried? We have no cure.

663
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,418
What if the wound gets infected?

664
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,837
I told you to be careful.

665
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,299
Okay, I'll be careful from now on.

666
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,847
Hey.

667
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,563
Lieutenant Colonel Han,
I know you're there.

668
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:34,150
Prepare lots of antibiotics,
disinfectants, and bandages.

669
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,947
Yi-hyun is injured.

670
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,199
We will prepare them.

671
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,996
I'm so glad to hear your voice.

672
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,831
What about Kim Se-hoon?

673
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,959
You have to be careful.
He may be infected.

674
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,628
Kim Se-hoon isn't outside.

675
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:56,840
He may still be there, so be careful.

676
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,967
Once he tastes human blood,

677
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,387
he'll continue to target and hunt people.

678
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,389
Thank you.

679
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,394
Let's look for Kim Se-hoon again.

680
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,690
Sure.

681
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,241
Mr. Kim, don't open the door
for just anyone.

682
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,578
Kim Se-hoon may still be inside.

683
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,163
Okay, don't worry.

684
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,623
I have my gun.

685
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,541
-We'll be back.
-Okay.

686
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,052
Kim Se-hoon may still be here.

687
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:48,725
People can even make bunkers.
He may have a secret space in his house.

688
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,727
But even so…

689
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,604
He may be hiding in here.

690
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,774
We don't even know
the structure of this place.

691
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,443
Andrew.

692
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,514
Why don't we investigate
after letting Seo-yoon out?

693
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,100
What if someone gets hurt again?

694
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,439
I'll go down and look for Andrew.
You look around here.

695
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,024
Okay.

696
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,496
Ms. Yoon, can you hear me?

697
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,377
First Lieutenant, I'm happy
to hear from you, but…

698
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,046
I'm a bit busy right now.

699
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,132
Ms. Yoon, this is something important.

700
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,885
We got the background check results
for those in the apartment,

701
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,387
and something's weird.

702
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,017
Ahn Kook-jin was found dead in his house.

703
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,982
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD: AHN KOOK-JIN

704
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,567
I erased it.

705
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,574
Administrative work is on hold
due to Mad Human Disease.

706
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,285
It took a while
for the report to reach us.

707
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,415
What about his face?

708
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,419
Does he have scars?

709
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:46,069
No, not at all.

710
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,700
Are you in danger?

711
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,125
It'll take four to five hours
to get there,

712
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,584
so wait at your house.

713
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,294
We'll go and take care of things.

714
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,094
Ms. Yoon, are you listening?

715
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,645
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD: KIM SE-HOON

716
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,207
LEE DEOK-SOON

717
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,598
I found…

718
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,434
Kim Se-hoon.

719
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,229
Wait.

720
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,566
Take your time. Relax, okay?

721
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:11,613
What is it?

722
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,908
I saw Kim Se-hoon.
Open the door. He may come after me.

723
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,706
Wait, did he get the disease?

724
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,676
I'll tell you if I need help,
so wait there.

725
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,403
What are you doing? It's your turn.

726
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,428
What do you think you're doing?

727
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,141
My husband…

728
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,104
died because of you two.

729
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,422
Jung-kook!

730
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,673
Jung-kook!

731
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,049
Jung-kook! Wake up!

732
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,718
It's me. I'm here.

733
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,484
Who are you?

734
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,866
I have an offer for you.

735
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:05,411
There's a way
to get rid of those we don't like.

736
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,537
I know who you are.

737
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,164
Go turn the electricity on.

738
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,750
Then I will let Seo-yoon
and that detective out.

739
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,795
The infected will swarm in!

740
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:20,343
We will get out of here alive,
and we will arrest all of them.

741
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,554
Block it again after Ms. Yoon comes out.
Jung Yi-hyun is infected.

742
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,890
Tell them to fire.

743
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:34,649
