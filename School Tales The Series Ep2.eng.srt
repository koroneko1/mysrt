1
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,320
They say

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,200
a senior once put the curse of death on all her classmates

3
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,160
before killing herself.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,000
That senior

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,680
was hiding a secret

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,120
in a box of curses.

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,440
And it's hidden

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,800
somewhere in this school

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
and no one knows about it.

10
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone, please help me.

11
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,480
It won't stop following me. I don't know what to do now.

12
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I don't know what else to do.

13
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
If and when it's opened,

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
it will bring death

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,800
to this school again.

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,320
PANYAPHORNWITTAYA SCHOOL

17
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm so damn sleepy. I was up so late last night.

18
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,880
Did you watch the live stream last night?

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
What happened? Spill it.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,680
It's Mint from Class Two. She was raving on Facebook,

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,400
saying someone was gonna kill her, and then the live stream got cut off.

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,960
That attention seeker must've had a fight with her boyfriend as usual.

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,760
Bitch, if she heard you say that, she'd be mad at you for sure.

24
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,520
You think I'm afraid of her? Come at me.

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Yeah.

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Hey, that's Mint. Did you watch her live video last night?

27
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,800
-Shit, it must be her. -Yeah.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,880
Let me take a picture.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Hey, please don't take pictures.

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
Please put your phone away.

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
No pictures. Put your phones away.

32
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,840
Put your camera away. Hey, do you have permission?

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,280
We're at the scene of the incident now.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,640
I can't show you more because the teacher's keeping us back.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,760
Shit, guys. Look. It's so freaking scary.

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
HAS ANYONE TAKEN MINT'S BODY DOWN?

37
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,960
The teacher said we have to wait for the cops.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
If anyone knows more, leave a comment.

39
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,040
SUN'S EX WON'T LEAVE HIM ALONE.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,720
HE DOESN'T LOVE HER ANYMORE.

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,920
HOW SHAMELESS IS SHE? SO ANNOYING.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A GIRL WOULDN'T KEEP CALLING HER EX SECRETLY IF SHE WASN'T A SLUT.

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,400
MINT

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
CLASS 5/3

45
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
NO ONE COULD HAVE IMAGINED THIS WOULD HAPPEN. REST IN PEACE, MINT.

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,320
Hey.

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
I heard the teachers checked the school's security cameras,

48
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,240
and it looked like Mint was alone.

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
Plus, they saw Mint jumping on her own.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
Why would Mint kill herself?

51
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,800
It'll be okay. Don't worry about it too much.

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
THE PLAY CURSE OF CIRCLE

53
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,400
The script is almost done, Mr. Director.

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Well done.

55
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

56
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,080
JINNIEZZ WRSRZ LIKED YOUR COMMENT.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,160
SHE SHOULD JUST DIE.

58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Here.

59
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
Wow, it's green tea.

60
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
How did you know?

61
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
-It's your treat? -Yeah.

62
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,040
Is this low sugar?

63
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Yes. Why?

64
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,880
It's so sweet. Should I go deal with them?

65
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
No, don't bother.

66
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Are you sure?

67
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
I would if you didn't stop me.

68
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, right.

69
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,720
Everyone in my class was talking about Mint today.

70
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
It's so shocking.

71
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
I walked past her yesterday.

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,360
I watched the video from the livestream.

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
It's so scary.

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,160
You watched it?

75
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,360
I didn't dare. My friends said it was horrifying.

76
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,840
If this scares you, how can you be a horror film director?

77
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not the same, my dear Pleng.

78
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
I guess that's true,

79
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,360
since even cuties like me can write scripts for horror plays.

80
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah.

81
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,040
You really are cute.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,520
We need to finish.

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
You mean the script?

84
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah.

85
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
All right. I won't tease you anymore.

86
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,600
I'm off to the bathroom, okay?

87
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
Can we take a picture with you?

88
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,200
Sure.

89
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Thank you.

90
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,960
-Thank you. -I'm rooting for you.

91
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,120
JINNIE

92
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Pleng.

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,120
Where are you going?

94
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
I have an emergency.

95
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,920
I'll write the rest at home. It's almost done.

96
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,520
BOY CALLING

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
MISSED CALL FROM BOY

98
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
Come here.

99
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Don't try to win me over. You're sleeping outside tonight.

100
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
Bad dog.

101
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
All right, just this once. But that doesn't mean I'm not mad anymore.

102
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
Want some?

103
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,880
Don't make that face.

104
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
I brought flowers for Mint.

105
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,160
Oh, the other day, I saw you with Boy.

106
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
Why? Do you like him too?

107
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,680
Or are you gonna steal someone I like just like your friend stole my boyfriend?

108
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Don't talk shit about my friend.

109
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
How lucky for Mint

110
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
that her best friend's defending her.

111
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,360
You know what?

112
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
You're boring.

113
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
That's why Sun got tired of you

114
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
and went to my friend.

115
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
There's one more thing.

116
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
It's a secret, actually.

117
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Boy and I

118
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,760
have been together for a long time.

119
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,760
I hope you understand, Pleng.

120
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,800
Where are you?

121
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,880
I don't feel like studying. I'm skipping class.

122
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,640
SUN'S EX WON'T LEAVE HIM ALONE.

123
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,320
HE DOESN'T LOVE HER ANYMORE.

124
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,360
HOW SHAMELESS IS SHE? SO ANNOYING.

125
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
So true. She should just die.

126
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,360
Pleng.

127
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Pleng.

128
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,320
FROM DAY ONE IN CLASS 1/1 TO THE END, PRAEWA WAS MY FRIEND.

129
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,200
MY DEAR ING-ORN, YOU'RE AT PEACE NOW.

Hey, that's Mint. Did you watch her live video last night?

136
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,920
Girls, move back. Hey, please don't take pictures.

137

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Stop!

168
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:47,720
Jinnie.

169
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,040
Get it out!

170
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,720
PANYAPHORNWITTAYA SCHOOL

171
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,320
STORAGE ROOM

172
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,640
MODELING.

173
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,400
Why did you follow me here?

174
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,960
If you want the script, check your email.

175
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
I sent you everything.

176
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,440
Wait, Pleng.

177
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,600
What's wrong?

178
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,360
You didn't pick up my calls. You didn't text me back either.

179
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Is there a problem?

180
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560
I don't have one.

181
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
But you do.

182
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,440
What's wrong?

183
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,080
You have a girlfriend.

184
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,120
No, I don't.

185
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,120
It's Jinnie.

186
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Why did you lie to me?

187
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Hold on, Pleng.

188
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,840
Jin is actually my little sister.

189
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,080
She's my sibling.

190
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Why have we never heard of her?

191
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,400
There are no pictures of you together on social media.

192
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,080
Jin wouldn't let me post them.

193
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,920
She said that her man might get the wrong idea.

194
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Jin is always like this.

195
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Last time, she stirred up trouble with my female friends too.

196
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
My friends almost dumped me.

197
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,480
Wait a minute.

198
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,600
How do you know my sister Jinnie?

199
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,160
We went to the same cram school.

200
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
We didn't get along.

201
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,360
Oh, so that's what happened.

202
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,160
Now that you know the truth,

203
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,280
can you stop being mad at me?

204
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,240
Are you still mad?

205
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,600
Perhaps you're not mad after all.

206
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,960
Are you jealous?

207
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,480
No.

208
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm not that close to Jinnie,

209
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,400
so I didn't know you were siblings.

210
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
How was I to know I'd be messed with like this?

211
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,240
Well, that's that.

212
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
I believe you're not jealous.

213
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,840
So what are you doing in here?

214
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I don't feel like going to my last class.

215
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,640
To be honest,

216
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,440
when I walk past this room,

217
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,440
it always sends shivers down my spine. I…

218
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Because you're afraid of ghosts.

219
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,040
No way.

220
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Who's afraid?

221
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,440
Not me.

222
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,200
There's nothing to be afraid of.

223
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,960
Don't you know this room's story?

224
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,920
They say the students in this class

225
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,040
all died

226
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,320
because of a classmate's curse.

227
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,560
And that person killed herself afterward.

228
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,680
Then the room was kept locked

229
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,080
and turned into a storage room, as you can see.

230
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,800
But…

231
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
isn't that

232
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,400
the plot of the play that you wrote?

233
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,800
Yeah.

234
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,600
It is.

235
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,200
Well, I used this story for inspiration.

236
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,400
Well.

237
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,680
I don't have any more classes. Should we go get some food?

238
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
Are you buying? I don't have any money left.

239
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
Okay.

240
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Then let me go get my things first.

241
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
Why don't you stay here until the traffic is lighter?

242
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,160
Okay.

243
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,040
Is no one home?

244
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
No.

245
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,840
My mom's out of town for work. She isn't back yet.

246
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,680
I see.

247
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,840
So…

248
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,240
are you an only child?

249
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,080
I played alone when I was little. It was kind of lonely.

250
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,480
It would've been nice to have a brother like you.

251
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,160
Are you and Jinnie close?

252
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,600
Yesterday,

253
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,120
I didn't know what was up with her.

254
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,560
She locked herself in her room and wouldn't eat anything.

255
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
It's going to be okay, Boy.

256
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm sure she'll be better soon.

257
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you so much, Pleng.

258
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When I'm with you,

259
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,720
I feel so at ease.

260
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,360
Pleng.

261
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,080
I…

262
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,920
like you.

263
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
JINNIE

264
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,560
What the hell?

265
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Why did you write Jinnie's name?

266
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,320
Boy, calm down.

267
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
It's nothing, Boy.

268
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,880
Then why did you write it?

269
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,320
-Boy, calm down. -Why did you write it?

270
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
Answer me.

271
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
-Why did you write it? -Boy, please.

272
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,400
-Calm down. -Why did you write it?

273
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
Boy, help me.

274
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,920
Jinnie.

275
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,720
-What's wrong? -Boy, help me.

276
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,760
Hello?

277
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,520
Boy.

278
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
Can you hear it? It's back again.

279
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
-LOOK AT HER. SO CREEPY. HAHAHA. -WHAT ARE YOU ON? SPILL IT!

280
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,360
Look at it. Look.

281
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,800
CLOUT CHASER.

282
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,360
What is this weird sound?

283
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,240
-GO GET YOUR MEDS. -WHO ELSE IS CONFUSED?

284
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,440
Help me. I can't take it anymore.

285
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
No. I can't take it anymore.

286
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,160
I don't want to hear it.

287
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
JINNIE

288
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,360
Can you hear it?

289
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,280
I'm scared.

290
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,360
No! Don't!

291
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,520
No, I don't want to hear it. Get out!

292
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,600
I can't take it.

293
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,840
Come off!

294
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,120
-IT FROZE. -LOST CONNECTION?

295
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,760
PRIM

296
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
What's with you, Jinnie?

297
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,640
If you're so scared, die.

298
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,280
If you can't go on, die.

299
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,560
You can't even bear this?

300
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,120
Yeah, just die.

301
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,040
Just die.

302
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,640
Get out!

303
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,840
What a loser!

304
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,960
Do you dare to die?

305
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,320
You should just die.

306
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,920
Since you're going to kill yourself,

307
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,160
just die already.

308
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,880
People like you are such losers.

309
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,000
That's not enough to kill you.

310
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,560
You need to do more.

311
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,960
Is that all you can do?

312
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,520
You need to do it harder.

313
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
Just die, Jinnie.

314
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,360
Die now. Do it again. I told you to do it harder.

315
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,360
Just die already!

316
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,240
Jin!

317
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,760
Jin!

318
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,520
Jin!

319
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
Jin!

320
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,840
JINNIE HAS PASSED AWAY

321
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000

"Once the curse is cast, no one can stop it

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,640

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,040
I didn't mean it.

333
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,800
I didn't mean to put the curse of death on you and Mint.

334
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

I'm sorry.

BUSTED. SHE HAS NO SHAME AT ALL.

337
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,040
WHOA! PLENG IS THE WORST BITCH IN OUR CLASS.

338
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,640
I'M SO SCARED. WHAT OTHER NAMES DID SHE WRITE?

339
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,600
HER CONDOLENCE POSTS ARE LIES.

340
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
I'M SO ASHAMED WE SHARE A SCHOOL.

341
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,160
You want to do this, huh?

342
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,120
Get the hell out!

343
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,000
Come at me, you bitch! Come here!

344
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,840
STORAGE ROOM

345
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,960
Thank you, Pleng, for being a part of my life.

346
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,760
I'll always think of the good times we shared.

347
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,080
I don't have any more classes. Should we go get some food?

348
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,720
Are you buying? I don't have any money left.

349
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,200
Okay.

350
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,560
Then let me go get my things first.

351
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Boy.

352
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,080
IF YOU WANT TO CURSE SOMEONE, WRITE THEIR NAME UNDER YOUR FOOT…

353
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,440
PLENG

354
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,200
PLENG
