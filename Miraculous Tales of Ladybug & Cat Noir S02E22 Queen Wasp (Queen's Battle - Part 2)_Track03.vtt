<i>I may be a superhero,</i>

<i>but I'm always happy to share</i>
<i>my thrilling life with all my fans!</i>

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.220
<i>Like today, Ladybug showed up</i>
<i>to ask me for advice.</i>

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.140
<i>I admire Queen Bee so much!</i>

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.580
<i>She's shown me what being</i>
<i>a superhero is all about</i>

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.620
<i>and always fixes the messes</i>
<i>Cat Noir and I get into!</i>

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.660
<i>Oh, please, you would do the same for me.</i>

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.580
<i>Come on! Like you'd ever cause a mess!</i>

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.500
<i>You're right! Ha, ha, ha!</i>

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.100
<i>-Ha, ha, ha!</i>
-Hey! That's not Ladybug!

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.900
That's you, Chloé!

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.780
-Of course that's the real Ladybug!
-But, Chloé, could you tell me

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.940
why you chose to do an assignment about
yourself... I mean, about Queen Bee?

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.340
Our assignment was to choose
an important person in French history!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.940
And I actually saved France!
Even Ladybug says so!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.940
<i>Queen Bee really makes us stronger!</i>
<i>She truly is miraculous!</i>

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.620
Chloé, it's so obvious
that's you dressed up as Ladybug!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
You didn't even bother
to match her hair colour!

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.020
She just dyed her hair blonde
to look like me!

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.140
[laughter]

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.020
Urgh! You're all a bunch of losers!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.700
Except you, Adri-kins!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.620
None of you deserve to see
the rest of my documentary!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.660
-Oh, what a shame!
-Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.300
I saw you laughing with the other idiots!
You're fired!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.340
[wails] I've betrayed my best friend!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.460
How could you not laugh, Sabrina?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.460
The whole superhero sitch
has totally gone to her head.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.020
<i>You're the one who paralysed</i>
<i>the metro driver.</i>

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.940
<i>You created this situation.</i>

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.780
She wasn't the hero!
It was Cat Noir and Ladybug!

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
She had superpowers for five minutes
and went totally outta control!

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.220
We might not deserve
to see your documentary,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.180
-but you're no superhero!
-What?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.020
You will pay for your insulting remarks,
Dupain-Cheng!

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660
-Calm down now, students!
-This is ridiculous!

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.420
Chloé, class isn't over!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.180
You're all ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.980
Seriously? She'll never change.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.660
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.860
-Oh, good, you're married! Now get out!
-Shoo!

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.140
What in the world is going on,
my sweetie pie?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.220
-I demand you close the school down!
-And I want you to banish

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.140
Marinette Dupain-Cheng from Paris!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.380
She hurt your little girl's feelings!

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.540
She got the whole class to gang up on me!
They all have to pay!

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.900
But I just can't! I mean,
I could close the school for a few days,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.100
a week at most.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.340
-Not good enough!
-Shut it down forever!

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.940
Ugh! But that's impossible!

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.700
I love you, but you're asking
too much of me this time.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.540
-I'm only the mayor.
-Precisely!

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.980
What's the use of this stupid sash
if you can't use power?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.660
-This is ridiculous!
-Utterly ridiculous!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.460
You've always been too good
for your classmates.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.820
-Maybe you should switch schools!
-Argh!

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.060
Change schools? Ugh! Forget it.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.060
We need to change cities, that's what!
We'll go to New York!

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.580
But... wait!

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.940
-Don't forget my Toboulin stilettos.
-Of course, Miss.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.140
I can't be the mayor of Paris
if we're living in New York! It's too far!

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.820
Why don't we go and live in Versailles,
instead?

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.140
It won't make any difference,
since you're so powerless anyway!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.780
Not only are you incapable of solving
a problem for your daughter,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.140
you're also refusing to come with us?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.820
No! Not at all! I... I... Ah!

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.500
Look at this, my sweetie. It's for you!

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.220
-What is it? It's tiny!
-Yes, but very expensive!

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.460
It's a diamond-encrusted phone case.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.420
-Are you sure you don't want to stay?
-I don't want that thing!

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.980
What kind of Daddy are you
if you can't even get me what I want?

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.900
But... What more can I do?

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.580
A man of power
feeling helpless as a father.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.180
I sense very strong
negative emotions from him.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.900
Fly away, my little akuma,
and evilise him!

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.100
No!

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.820
[sobbing]

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.140
Malediktator, I am Hawk Moth.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.980
Your wife and daughter
think you're weak and useless?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.580
Well, I shall give you absolute power.
Anything you declare will happen!

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.180
By the power vested in me,
I shall prevail as Malediktator!

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.860
[laughter]

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.980
Hey, there, losers!
I'm headed to New York, with my mom!

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.980
I'm leaving you all behind
in your pathetic school

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.220
and your pathetic little city! Adieu!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.860
-Chloé's leaving?
-Forever?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.980
-Looks like it.
-Yeah.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.620
[cheering and laughter]

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.500
Without Chloé around, Paris will be filled
with a lot less negative emotion.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.660
And less akumatizations!

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.180
Hey, what's going on here?
What are we celebrating?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.100
Chloé's gone! She's moving to New York!

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.580
-Chloé left... for good?
-Yeah! Isn't it great?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.740
Uh... no. I think it's terrible!
How can you celebrate a thing like that?

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.860
But Chloé's a total brat to everyone!
She was useless anyway!

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.940
Nobody's "useless"! Not even Chloé.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.740
When I was little and wasn't allowed out,
she was my only friend.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.020
Oh... well, uh... Shoot!

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.100
She left angry and unhappy.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.420
-I can't celebrate that.
-Uh...

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.900
I'm really sorry, Adrien.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.620
By the power vested in me,
I order you to land!

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.820
Ah! Huh?

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.300
-This is not the airport!
-Chloé, my daughter!

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.660
You are not leaving for New York!

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.700
-Daddy?
-You'll see.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.660
I have the power to shut down the school

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.700
and banish all those nasty students
who were mean to you!

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.420
-Come with me!
-Really?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.700
But... that's... excellent!

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.060
André, getting yourself akumatised
like everybody else in town

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.700
does not make you a "cool"
or "hip" father! In fact--

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.300
By the power vested in me, I declare
you will be devoted to this family,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.580
and remain in Paris with me and Chloé!

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.980
Oh, yes! My dear hubby!
I'm so happy to stay here!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.860
Ew! Just when I thought
things were working out! Ugh!

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.220
How would Ladybug
get out of this ridiculous situation?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.020
Well done, Chloé! Now you just have to--

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.460
[sniffs] Ew! What a stench!

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.820
Come on, you're a hero! You can do this!

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.500
Chloé, sweetie, why don't you come... ?
[gasps]

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.860
-Where did she go?
-Don't worry. I'm sure we'll find her.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.420
Malediktator,
if you want to find your daughter,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.540
you must first cause chaos in Paris!

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.740
Start with the school.
She'll come back of her own accord.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.900
Good idea! Let's go show
those little savages what they get

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.380
for showing my daughter such disrespect!

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.660
Yeah!

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.820
Come on, girl! Just 'cause Adrien's bummed
out doesn't mean you have to be too!

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.860
Yeah, but I think
I was a bit harsh on her earlier.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.060
What if Adrien's right
and Chloé isn't just a brat?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.380
What else could she possibly be?
A super brat, maybe.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.620
By the powers vested in me,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.740
I declare this school a demolition site!

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.540
Come on, students! Let's wreck this place!

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.580
Right, now,
where's that girl Marinette Dupain-Cheng?

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.300
I've got a special declaration
just for her!

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.420
Looks like Chloé managed
one last victim before she left Paris.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.260
Yeah, and I might be partly to blame.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.700
Tikki, spots on!

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.620
Yeah!

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.100
Where is that Marinette?

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.940
Hey, you! Do you have
a demolition permit for this school?

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.780
I don't need a permit! I am Malediktator,
the all-powerful super mayor of Paris

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.820
and this is my city!

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.860
Paris is our city! It belongs to everyone!

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.300
By the power vested in me, I declare
that your Miraculous are my property!

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.060
It's time we impeach him
and declare him powerless!

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.100
The akuma has to be in his sash.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.820
Lucky charm!

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.220
An abacus?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.180
While you figure that out,
I'll take care of Malediktator!

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.500
-Of course! Cat Noir, wait!
-Cata--

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.660
By the power invested in me,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.300
I declare that you are a cat!

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.820
-Meow!
-Oh, no!

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.700
-Oh, what a cutie-pie! Kitty-kitty!
-Take Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.300
[hisses]

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.780
Cat Noir!

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.660
Kitty still has claws!
Hold on, Cat Noir, I'll be right back!

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.980
Let her go. She'll be back to try and save
her kitty, except she'll be too late!

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.540
Grab Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.500
Oh, please, Malediktator-kins,
can't we keep him just a little longer?

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.580
[sighs] If it makes you happy.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.340
Don't let me down, Malediktator,
or I'll take away your powers!

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.260
He's completely harmless now.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.140
Taking his Miraculous would be
like taking candy from a baby!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.780
-Six hundred fifty!
-Master Fu!

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.860
A villain has transformed
Cat Noir into a cat!

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.380
What? Perhaps you shouldn't have left him
by himself. He's at Hawk Moth's mercy!

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.980
-I know! But the lucky charm led me here!
-Hmm. And the lucky charm never fails!

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.940
Marinette Dupain-Cheng,
pick an ally you can trust

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.540
to fight on this mission.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.500
Choose wisely. Such powers are meant
to serve the greater good.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.380
Once the mission is over,
retrieve the Miraculous.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.260
I must choose someone
not impressed by people in power,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.540
who can help me trap Malediktator.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.660
Oh! Of course! That's it!
Wait. What am I thinking?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.380
Follow your instincts, Marinette.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.420
Are you sure you want to
give it back to her?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.900
Don't worry, Master, I know
how to make good use of it this time!

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.980
-Hello... uh...
-Where is your daughter?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.540
-Would you like to place an order?
-By the power vested in me,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.620
I declare that Marinette Dupain-Cheng's
parents will leave Paris forever!

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.140
I've got to find Chloé
before Malediktator!

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.340
-Marinette! Look!
-Huh? What are they doing?

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.300
Hide, Tikki!

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.220
-Mom! Dad!
-Ah, Marinette!

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.580
A man named Malediktator
was looking for you!

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.860
Thanks to him,
we're leaving Paris forever!

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.260
Come with us, honey!
Last one there is a big slow snail!

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.340
Your poor parents! We really have to
stop Malediktator, Marinette!

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.660
I know. But I've got to find Chloé first.
I can't do this alone!

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.100
She talked about her "secret lair,"
in her documentary.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.900
Hmm. Wait a minute...

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.820
Huh! I know where her lair is!

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.620
Chloé! Where are you, sweetie?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.420
I've done almost everything
you wanted me to do!

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.860
Huh? So you can stay here
with Mummy and Daddy!

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.180
Come on, Chloé.
You don't want to upset me, do you?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.020
My patience has its limits, Chloé!

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.900
Don't make me show all of Paris
just how powerful I can be!

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.900
-We can't find her, Malediktator.
-Well, keep looking!

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.220
She must be hiding here somewhere!
Call me as soon as you find her!

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.940
Of course.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.140
-Are you OK?
-Ladybug, finally!

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.060
-You'll help me, right?
-I'm fine with helping you,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.980
but first,
I need you to tell me what happened.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.420
Why is your father,
I mean, Malediktator, so mad?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.900
It's 'cause of this super lame loser
named Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.420
She's this horrible girl and she hates me!

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.420
She's ganged everyone up against me--

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.340
Maybe this Marinette girl
isn't entirely to blame?

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.660
Uh... Oh, OK,
it wasn't totally Marinette's fault.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.580
She is really mean to me sometimes,
but this time...

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.700
-Daddy got angry all by himself.
-All by himself?

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.140
Yeah, because there was something
he couldn't do.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.940
Chloé, it's me, Ladybug.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.380
You can trust me.
You can tell me the truth.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.900
-I... I...
-Mmm-hmm?

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.100
It... It was me.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.060
I hurt my daddy's feelings,
because I want to leave Paris forever.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.380
Because of what happened in school?

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.340
I'm sure Marinette
didn't exactly mean what she said.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.380
Oh, it's not just her.
Actually, I don't even care about her.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.860
It's because I have no reason to be here!
Nobody likes me. I have no friends.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.940
I'm useless!

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.860
A friend once told me nobody's useless,
Chloé.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.100
It's easy for you to say that.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.140
You're Ladybug, a superhero.
You serve a purpose.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.940
Yes, I can fix up all the messes.
You said it yourself in your documentary!

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.060
You saw it? Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.740
That film's ridiculous,
utterly ridiculous! I realise that now!

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.340
Don't worry, Chloé. You can fix
your own messes, if that's what you want.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.220
You too can serve a purpose.
But you have to want to.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.860
I do want to!

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.260
Chloé Bourgeois,
here is the bee Miraculous,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.220
which grants you the power
to immobilise your opponent.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.900
You will use it for the greater good.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.580
At your service, my queen.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.740
Once the job is complete,
you'll return the Miraculous to me.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.260
Can I trust you, Chloé?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.460
I won't disappoint you this time, Ladybug.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.420
Pollen, buzz on!

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.820
I've always dreamed
of doing this with you!

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.380
We must work as a team,
all right, Queen Bee?

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.500
Yes, yes, don't worry.
I've been practising since forever!

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.300
Mr Mayor... I mean, Malediktator...

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.540
you are surrounded!

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.980
Please, renounce your akuma
and we'll forget this ever happened!

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.580
Oh! Would you like some tea?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.060
It's OK,
they've got more important things to do.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.860
By the power vested in me,
I declare that you are my shield!

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.100
None shall pass, Malediktator!

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.100
-Here's the plan...
-Here I am, Daddy!

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.940
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings!

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.700
Stop all this nonsense at once!

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.660
My honey pie!
You look so pretty in that suit!

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.700
Ugh! And please put Mom back to normal.
I can't bear to see her like this!

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.860
Your powers are ridiculous,
utterly ridiculous!

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.180
That's enough! Now, you're going to do
what I tell you to do!

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.380
By the power vested in me,
give me your Miraculous!

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.500
You won't pull it off!
People only respect absolute power!

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.420
You're right, Hawk Moth!

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:08.100
By the power vested in me,
I declare you all my slaves!

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.860
That bubble will be a tough one to dodge!

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.180
He's gonna take over the whole city!

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.900
You need to get past his guards!

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.380
Lucky charm!

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.740
That's an effective lucky charm!

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.860
-No way I'd use one of those!
-Are you sure?

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.060
Yeah, you just need to take the sting out!

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.180
Venom!

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.420
Focus on Malediktator.
I'll deal with the guards!

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.340
[evil laugh]

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.940
Meow, meow, meow.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.460
-Huh?
-Meow.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.500
No, no, no!

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.620
But... but...

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.100
Sorry, Daddy!

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.340
Your turn, Ladybug!

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.340
No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.340
Time to de-evilise.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.380
Gotcha!

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.380
Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.260
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.420
What? What are we doing here?
What have you done this time, André?

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.620
Ah, bummer!
Don't tell me I missed out on the party.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.780
Yup. You missed Queen Bee
and Ladybug saving Paris!

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.580
-For real, this time!
-I understand, Ladybug. Buzz off.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.660
Being a superhero
isn't only about fixing messes.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.580
Pound it!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.900
-Utterly ridiculous!
-Daddy! Mummy! Come on, let's go home.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.940
Sorry, Milady, I feel like I was
pretty useless this time around!

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.780
Actually, you were key
in defeating Malediktator!

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.980
-Really? Tell me all about it!
-Next time! Bug out!

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.540
You took a big risk entrusting
this Miraculous to Chloé Bourgeois.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.740
Do you really think she's got
what it takes to be a superhero?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.180
Yes, I do.
Ladybug has made me a better Marinette.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.980
So, perhaps being Queen Bee
will make her a better Chloé, too!

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.660
That's very noble of you, Marinette.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.980
It's OK, Jean-Yves. I'll take care of it.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.140
Mademoiselle, are you sure?

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.500
Yes. I need to do it myself.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.260
-Chloé?
-Dupain-Cheng?

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.340
All right, I came to your stupid party,
now what?

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.540
Look there. We're having a party
in honour of the girl who saved Paris,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.060
Queen Bee!

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.620
But... Queen Bee is me.
You're... you're having a party for me?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.540
Chloé! I thought I'd lost you!

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.620
OK, no need to make a big thing of it!
Besides you're wrinkling my clothes!

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.660
Sorry!

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.380
All right, all right. Let me go.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.740
I wanna show you
the diamond phone case Daddy gave me!

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.700
Your daddy wouldn't be able
to buy you one of these.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.060
It was cool of you
to throw a party for Chloé.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.820
Well, she did save Paris, so she just
might be able to save herself too, right?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.060
Rena Rouge and Carapace helped Ladybug
save Paris, but nobody threw them a party.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.300
Because we don't know
their true identities, unlike Chloé.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.780
If she feels like she can be useful,
I'm sure she'll change her attitude!

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.300
-Mmm-hmm?
-Well, baby steps, baby steps.
