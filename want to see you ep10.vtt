00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:33.208
Why don't you come inside?

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.799
You just got back from work?

00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:39.007
Is it that obvious?

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.381
Got overtime again?

00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:45.287
I have to take over Thach's role now.

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.064
Do you want to go for a walk?

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:57.601
You look tired. You should get some rest.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.350
I don't feel tired when I'm with you.

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:07.944
It's 6 A.M now. The sunrise must be beautiful.

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:10.358
Um.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940
Why don't you say anything?

00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:33.272
You look so happy, and that makes me happy too.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:40.395
If only I could hear these words from Thach.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.948
Hurry up!

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:49.603
You had a long night working.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:52.468
Do you feel hungry? Should we eat something?

00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:53.615
It sounds good.

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:55.427
Should we have Pho?

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:57.427
Anything will do.

00:02:57.925 --> 00:02:59.481
Anything will do?

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:01.434
Then, we should eat sticky rice!

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.434
If I eat it, I'll get fat!

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:06.071
Yet, you told me anything would do.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:14.001
It's meal time!

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.001
Here you are. 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.953
Huh? Why did you buy sticky rice?

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:21.600
You told me anything would do!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.451
It's hard to digest!

00:03:23.451 --> 00:03:25.451
If you don't want it, I'll eat it!

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.559
Wait! It's mine!

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:31.317
Why did you tell me you wouldn't eat it?

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.790
We have to eat to live!

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:42.913
The sky is beautiful, isn't it?

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:44.594
Uh. 

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:47.763
Hey!

00:03:47.763 --> 00:03:48.734
Yes?

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:50.734
Me and the flower, which one is more beautiful?

00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:53.412
Flowers, of course.

00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:56.936
What about Thach and I? Who's more handsome?

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:59.404
Of course, it's Thach!

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:06.518
Hello?

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:09.454
Did something happen at the restaurant?

00:04:11.746 --> 00:04:13.746
Do you need me to come there now?

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.688
Okay. I'll be there right away.

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:20.871
If you have to leave, just go first.

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.871
I want to walk a little bit more.

00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:24.148
No need.

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:26.148
Let's eat first and then I'll go.

00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:27.636
You can go back now.

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:28.921
Your work is important.

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.921
I want to walk a little bit more.

00:04:33.143 --> 00:04:35.333
Okay. I'll take you out to make it up for you.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.105
Um. You should go.

00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:30.000
You woke up late! I wasn't able to give you a shave till now.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Who was lazy in bed and didn't want to wake up?  

00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:36.227
I don't have any beard to shave anyway.

00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:38.227
You do! It's very long!

00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:43.248
Just sit still and let me do it. Don't move.

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:47.096
Why are you so shaky?

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:49.527
Is it that clear?

00:05:49.527 --> 00:05:51.527
Just trust me.

00:05:52.884 --> 00:05:54.394
I trust you.

00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:56.394
It sounds so unwilling!

00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:03.307
When I was a kid, I took my dad's razor.

00:06:03.307 --> 00:06:05.143
I tried to shave myself,

00:06:05.143 --> 00:06:07.611
and I cut a huge piece of my face skin!

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
Oh!

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840
Poor my Phuc!

00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:14.752
You have facial hair too. Let me shave it.

00:06:14.752 --> 00:06:16.120
No! (similar to "smelly")

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.149
I'm not smelly. I had a shower.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.757
Sit still and let me finish it. Almost done!

00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:26.296
It's done.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.223
Why do your cheeks smell so good? You sprayed perfume on them?

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.790
Not just your cheeks smell good,

00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:38.001
your neck smells good too!

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:42.504
Your shoulders as well!

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:47.138
And your chest too!

00:06:47.138 --> 00:06:49.138
I wonder if somewhere else smells good too.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:51.655
There are many places more.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.789
You think I don't dare or I can't?

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.789
I dare you!

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:01.822
Hey! I can fall!

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:02.723
Thach!

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.723
You'll bump my head! My head!

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.622
Good morning.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.780
Actually, it's afternoon.

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:23.906
Really?

00:09:37.145 --> 00:09:39.145
Do you want to eat something?

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:41.566
Anything will do!

00:09:55.332 --> 00:09:57.870
You didn't "eat" much last night so you're hungry now?

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:01.367
You scold me so hard

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.367
so I didn't dare to do much.

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:09.248
Babe.

00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:13.164
We should do something. It's boring to stay home all the time!

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:17.363
What do you want to do?

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.585
Anything.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.670
It's so cool today.

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:34.208
It's early March, isn't it?

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:36.419
It's ten days before March ends.

00:12:43.319 --> 00:12:45.062
Are we odd?

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:47.062
Not at all.

00:12:49.496 --> 00:12:51.398
I can't see.

00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:54.521
What about you? Are you annoyed by being stared at?

00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:56.521
Just be who we are and relaxed.

00:12:56.947 --> 00:13:00.725
Cherish our lovers and do what lovers normally do.

00:13:00.869 --> 00:13:02.869
That's how to be happy.

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:07.419
I love you.

00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:35.258
Hello, Mrs. Ha!

00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:39.176
I'm good. How are you?

00:13:39.878 --> 00:13:41.556
Are you free tomorrow?

00:13:41.556 --> 00:13:45.358
May I ask you to a coffee shop? I want to talk to you.

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.099
Yes.

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:49.099
Goodbye, Mrs. Ha.

00:14:02.562 --> 00:14:03.580
Phuc.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.691
Yes?

00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:08.141
Help me find posts about foreign and local foods.

00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:22.752
They're all food reviews.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.764
Is there any hot news about current affairs?

00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:29.138
No, there isn't.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:35.391
In the past, I often looked new recipes up online.

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:38.146
Now I can't see anymore.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:40.639
I can't look up anything.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.550
Babe. You should have your eyes treated.

00:14:45.723 --> 00:14:47.068
How?

00:14:47.068 --> 00:14:50.939
I read on the Internet that your eyes can be cured.

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:53.618
But, you need to go abroad.

00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:56.179
My mom wants to take me abroad to have my eyes treated.

00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.179
That's great!

00:14:58.576 --> 00:15:00.576
With one condition.

00:15:04.527 --> 00:15:05.381
Phuc.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:06.914
Yes?

00:15:07.826 --> 00:15:09.826
When you're with me,

00:15:10.332 --> 00:15:11.864
do you feel happy?

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.134
Of course, I do.

00:15:14.344 --> 00:15:16.344
Why do you ask me that?

00:15:39.024 --> 00:15:39.948
Who are you?

00:15:39.948 --> 00:15:41.176
Mrs. Ha wants to see you.

00:15:41.176 --> 00:15:42.328
Who is she?

00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:44.328
Thach's mother.

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:51.784
Hello, madam.

00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:53.971
Hello.

00:15:54.194 --> 00:15:57.036
Two months from now, I'll take Thach to America to have his eyes treated.

00:15:57.036 --> 00:15:59.036
That's so good!

00:15:59.703 --> 00:16:02.422
You know that Thach is a famous chef.

00:16:02.422 --> 00:16:04.422
He's also a son of a politician.

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:08.130
You know how much people care about his private life.

00:16:08.438 --> 00:16:11.116
I hope you understand what I said.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.520
You should discreetly leave him. That will be better.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.315
He doesn't know your face anyway. 

00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:21.461
My words might sound harsh,

00:16:21.593 --> 00:16:24.132
but this would be better for you both.

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:26.451
I will give you an amount of money.

00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:29.574
It's enough for you to have a decent life and care for your family.

00:16:29.574 --> 00:16:33.258
I'm still young. I can take care of that. Thank you.

00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:37.929
You graduated in Communications and Journalism, didn't you?

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:39.602
I can help you get a job.

00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:43.193
Thank you but I can find a job on my own.

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:45.482
It would be great if you were a girl.

00:16:47.353 --> 00:16:49.353
Don't you want to ask for anything? 

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.000
Please give me more time to think.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How long?

00:16:58.503 --> 00:17:00.237
Uh... One day.

00:17:00.564 --> 00:17:03.847
That's okay. Not too long.

00:17:07.758 --> 00:17:10.530
Call me if you need anything.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.731
Oh. Thach hasn't agreed to come to America with me.

00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:17.731
I want you to convince him.

00:17:18.802 --> 00:17:21.761
But you should think carefully.

00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:28.295
Even though he's my son, I still want him to respect our family's reputation.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:10.638
Come and go.

00:18:10.638 --> 00:18:12.638
We can't love forever.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.486
That's life.

00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.486
We all have to move on.

00:18:20.978 --> 00:18:22.978
It's not getting hurt physically.

00:18:23.282 --> 00:18:25.282
It's not crying for being parted either.

00:18:25.962 --> 00:18:27.962
Feeling nothing is the scariest thing.

00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:34.597
Come or go. Can I decide?

00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:49.416
Hello?

00:18:53.252 --> 00:18:55.252
I'll come home right away.

00:19:10.556 --> 00:19:14.240
Hello? I'm Phuc.

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:17.375
My answer is...
