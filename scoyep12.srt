00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:49,677
Huh!?
[Caption: So fat he’s bursting at the seams]

161
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:51,561
[Caption: So fat he’s bursting at the seams]

162
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:52,691
Oh
[Caption: So fat he’s bursting at the seams]

163
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,551
Hand it over

164
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:56,864
Toh!

165
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,077
Toh

166
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,104
Can I see it?

167
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:06,111
- Hm?
- Can I see it as well?

168
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:10,348
Jao, I don’t think you need to see this. It’s…it’s absolutely nonsense

169
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:11,955
- Yeah
- Right?

170
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,153
I wanna see it

171
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:15,997
Let me have a look

172
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:17,957
No

173
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,864
Let me have a look

174
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:24,451
Please

175
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,451
[Intense rhythm plays]

176
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:54,717
Hey

177
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,264
I think this is far off the limit

178
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:58,650
Let’s report it

179
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:00,197
Aha

180
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,184
Give it to me

181
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:05,191
- I’ll report them all. Just you wait
- Yeah

182
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:06,731
I have 5 shadow accounts

183
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:07,861
I have 6

184
00:15:07,861 --> 00:15:09,357
- Good
- Let’s do it

185
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:18,477
Hey, I’ve reported them all

186
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,717
Oh, wait. You’ll have to go meet Sky soon, right?

187
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:27,411
Jao

188
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,421
Do you want me to go with you?

189
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,021
That’s right. Let Toh tag along with you

190
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,091
- Right?
- Yeah, true

191
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,230
It’s all right

192
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,130
I can go there by myself

193
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,006
Jao, hi!

194
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,747
- Fon, hi
- Hello

195
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,261
Are you here for Sky?

196
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,691
He’s at the copy centre

197
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,931
Thank you

198
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:35,978
Then, I’ll go…

199
00:16:37,277 --> 00:16:38,304
Oh

200
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,838
- Hello, Touch
- Hello there

201
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,280
Are you here to see Sky?

202
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:45,738
- Yes
- Hey. This is the one that goes out with Sky

203
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:48,694
- For real? The one whose photos were circulated?
- The one that has become the talk of the town

204
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:50,146
- Such an obese
- So fat

205
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,880
Jao

206
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:57,807
Are you all right?

207
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:00,251
Everyone has a belly

208
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,888
See, I have one

209
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,608
Touch also has it. Look

210
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:07,651
Yeah

211
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,181
Thank you so much

212
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,954
Then…I’ll look for Sky now

213
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,771
- Goodbye
- Yeah. Goodbye

214
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,778
Right. Have you seen Jao’s pic? The one that account posted this morning

215
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,291
Yeah. I saw it

216
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,950
It’s so mean. I think this is way too much

217
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,051
But…he was so plump back then. So cute I wish I could tease him

218
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:40,477
Take a look. Have a look if you don’t believe me

219
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:43,111
Enough already. Stop forcing me to look at it

220
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:44,837
Heh? How come!?

221
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,984
I don’t wanna see it

222
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,517
Hey

223
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,491
Be nice even if you don’t wanna look at it

224
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,611
Sky! Wait up!

225
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,688
Jao

226
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,079
I understand why you walked away

227
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:21,234
However

228
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,012
shouldn’t you have finished listening to their conversation first?

229
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:27,954
I agree with him

230
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:35,170
To be frank, things might not be what they appear to be

231
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:36,244
Correct

232
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:42,285
I don’t quite understand why

233
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,301
but

234
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,254
my feet moved on their own

235
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,171
Jao

236
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:58,051
But you’re not as chubby as you were before

237
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,981
But, does this mean Sky will no longer like me

238
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,637
if I become as fat as I used to be?

239
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,651
Jao

240
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,597
Easy

241
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:17,851
Don’t jump to a conclusion by yourself

242
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:22,491
It won’t do you any good

243
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:25,117
by overthinking things

244
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,661
How about you go to Sky and ask him directly

245
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,045
If he really does say he doesn’t like how you used to look

246
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:41,355
you can come back and consider if you wanna break up with him or look after yourself, so you won’t return to your old weight

247
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:47,637
True

248
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,797
I agree

249
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,375
This is the one that goes out with Sky

250
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:55,105
- For real?
- Yeah

251
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,278
- The one whose photos were circulated?
- The one that becomes the talk of the town

252
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,629
- Such an obese
- So fat

253
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,528
He was so plump back then. So cute I wish I could tease him. Have a look if you don’t believe me

254
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,146
- Enough already. Stop forcing me to look at it
- Heh? How come!?

255
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:08,591
I don’t wanna see it

256
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:50,544
Jao

257
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:55,851
Hm?

258
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,931
What’s wrong? Are you stressed out?

259
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,264
No

260
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,264
How can you still say no?

261
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:09,731
You can tell your friends anything

262
00:21:10,024 --> 00:21:11,864
You don’t have to keep it to yourself

263
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,037
Um

264
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,631
You always have me beside you whenever you’re scared

265
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:26,381
And if you feel like you’re overwhelmed, I’m here to listen to your worries

266
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,491
Toh

267
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,464
Hm?

268
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,611
Thank you

269
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,357
Thank you so much

270
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:43,784
Don’t mention it!

271
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:47,131
What about you?

272
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,677
Are you all right?

273
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,144
You’re dealing with a lot of criticisms as well

274
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:01,741
I’m totally fine

275
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:04,726
because I have a special spell

276
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:09,497
Special spell?

277
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:10,887
Aha!

278
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,586
Do you want to know what it is?

279
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,397
Yeah

280
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:20,584
It’s such a simple way of thinking actually

281
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:24,331
Nobody can escape being gossiped about

282
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:26,717
We are no exceptions

283
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,597
Who knows

284
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:33,557
the people who are gossiping about us right now might be the same people whom we gossiped about in the past

285
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:36,597
So, I say this to myself… “We’re even”

286
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,331
Simple as that, Jao

287
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:40,477
Erm...

288
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,584
We’re even now

289
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:43,864
Like this?

290
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,015
Yup, exactly

291
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:49,984
Shall we go?

292
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:51,371
Yeah

293
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:55,957
Jao

294
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,310
Jao, are you okay?

295
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:15,738
You didn’t reply to my message. You didn’t pick up my calls. You didn’t come collect your worksheets

296
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,553
You scared me

297
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:23,891
Um

298
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,811
I’m okay really

299
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:40,464
It’s just…

300
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,384
there’s something I need to think about

301
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,384
Sky

302
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:50,597
Hm?

303
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,691
I want to ask you something

304
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:55,411
No!

305
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,144
No what?

306
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:00,591
I’m not breaking up with you

307
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:01,997
Breaking up?

308
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:04,624
What did I do wrong, Jao?

309
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,411
Was it because I took so much time photocopying the worksheets?

310
00:24:08,024 --> 00:24:09,677
But there were so many people!

311
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:13,772
I didn’t know you would be so angry. I’ll take over the machine and do the service myself next time [instead of waiting for the staff]

312
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:19,261
Give me a chance, please

313
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:21,782
I’m not breaking up with you

314
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,687
It’s not about that

315
00:24:27,003 --> 00:24:27,643
Oh

316
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,088
What would you like to talk about, then?

317
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:02,314
This

318
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:08,834
What do you think...

319
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:11,861
about this picture?

320
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:14,606
I think you’re cute

321
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,661
We should have met each other since the freshmen welcoming ceremony

322
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:27,973
Are you for real?

323
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,700
I overheard it…

324
00:25:37,396 --> 00:25:39,306
your conversation with Khongkwan

325
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:42,017

It’ll be such a waste if we don’t go now

You put so much effort in fact. You even try to appear and act like him

863
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,602
Cuz it’s Nuea’s fucking taste apparently
