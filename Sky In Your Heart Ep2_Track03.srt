Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:22,360
This batch of volunteers is weird somehow.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,933
If you came up here just to change a place to drink,

6
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:25,962
you better go back.

7
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,560
It’s true we’re here because we did something bad.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,287
But my friend isn’t here just to change a place to drink as you said.

9
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:35,880
I won’t tell the village chief about the other day.

10
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:39,491
But if you do something terrible again, you won’t get away with it.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,561
Keep a close eye on my then, Teacher.

12
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:44,591
Please take care of me.

13
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:54,821
Fah.

14
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,933
Fah, are you up?

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,639
Don’t you have work to get to?

16
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:17,354
I need a few more minutes.

17
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,427
Why don’t you take care of yourself?

18
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,973
All you do is drink. That’s bad for your health.

19
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:28,111
Have you ever got a health check-up?

20
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,171
Why would I?

21
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,600
I am a doctor.

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,752
Just get up. I’m leaving for class now.

23
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:40,407
Don’t be late for work, alright?

24
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,433
Off you go, Dao.

25
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,067
Hi, there.

26
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,331
Are you leaving?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,095
The little brother is.

28
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,733
But the big brother isn’t.

29
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,828
Wow! This is good.

30
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,181
You are so good, baby.

31
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,906
You’re breathing heavily.

32
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:13,407
Baby.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,894
Babe.

34
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,586
Hey!!

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,416
How did you get in here?

36
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,655
Hi, Gong.

37
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,306
You’re here.

38
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,360
Been looking for you.

39
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:27,958
Come on. Let’s go home.

40
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,263
Bye.

41
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:33,741
Goodbye.

42
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:34,523
No!

43
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,599
Wait!

44
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:41,000
How did that pig get into my room?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,329
It’s the children’s pig.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,378
They took him out for a walk.

47
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,317
He must have wandered here.

48
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,888
Take him back then.

49
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:49,666
I’ll continue my sleep.

50
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:51,616
Please deal with him.

51
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:53,402
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,532
Don’t you have to do health check-ups for the villagers?

53
00:02:58,155 --> 00:02:59,391
That’s on the 9th.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,352
And what’s the date today?

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,626
6th.

56
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,422
Today is the 9th.

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,958
The 6th.

58
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:07,642
Just check the calendar there.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,072
The first patient, please come in.

60
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,453
Have a seat.

61
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,680
Open your mouth, please.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,785
Should I take it off?

63
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,183
No! Not that.

64
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,527
I mean…

65
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:30,859
Hey, Wee-ah.

66
00:04:31,085 --> 00:04:33,085
Let’s get on the weighing scale.

67
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,692
I’m 30 kilograms.

68
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,510
30…

69
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:39,527
What?

70
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,051
I’m feeling hot.

71
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:43,419
I might have a fever.

72
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,141
No, Wee-ah.

73
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:50,000
You need to stand on both feet to weigh.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,943
It’s okay. I’ll just go with 30 kilograms.

75
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:52,885
I like it that way.

76
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:54,722
Come on, Wee-ah.

77
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:55,679
No, I won’t.

78
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,021
I don’t want to weigh.

79
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,635
That’s normal body temperature.

80
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,950
No. I’m feeling so hot.

81
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,868
If you don’t believe me, feel it.

82
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,065
Yeah, you’re sweating.

83
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,040
Did you just expose yourself to the sun?

84
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:13,537
- I don’t want to weigh.
- Get up there.

85
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,545
Don’t resist.

86
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:18,494
Wee-ah.

87
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,095
Don’t be stubborn.

88
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,480
Teacher Prince.

89
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,470
We talked, didn’t we?

90
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:27,040
Outside school, you must behave.

91
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:28,218
Yes.

92
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:33,265
I knew this would happen.

93
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,117
The village chief sent me to help.

94
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:46,020
Uncle Phang, please step on the weighing scale first.

95
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,120
This thing keeps moving.

96
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:51,385
It’s making me dizzy.

97
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,518
The problem isn’t with the scale.

98
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,357
It’s with you, Uncle.

99
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,417
How about this?

100
00:05:58,417 --> 00:05:59,470
We do that later.

101
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,589
Let’s just sit him down.

102
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,549
Hey!

103
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:05,561
Hello, Doctor.

104
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:06,416
I’m this way.

105
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:08,807
Why didn’t you tell me?

106
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:11,070
Hello.

107
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,312
Hello.

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,626
Okay then.

109
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,061
Open your mouth, please.

110
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,399
You smell like alcohol.

111
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,753
It’s daytime and you’re drunk already?

112
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:36,360
A drink party with friends once in a while.

113
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,104
Once in a while?

114
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,000
You drink every day.

115
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:42,529
You know me so well, Teacher.

116
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,638
I’m right here, Uncle.

117
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,934
Who moved you here?

118
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:56,282
All right.

119
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:00,502
Please let the next patient in.

120
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:01,781
Hold on.

121
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,787
Aren’t you going to have lunch?

122
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:05,987
There’s a lunch box from the village chief for you.

123
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,441
You go ahead.

124
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,838
I will continue the check-ups.

125
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,363
I will help then.

126
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,376
You should eat now.

127
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:25,169
A kid like you should eat like a horse, you know?

128
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:29,818
If you don’t eat, you won’t have the energy to work.

129
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,300
What about you?

130
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,765
You haven’t even had breakfast yet.

131
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,709
Where’s the source of energy to work?

132
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:42,173
Okay.

133
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,948
If I eat, we’re good?

134
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:49,562
Okay.

135
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,117
This is my lunch, right?

136
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,920
Don’t I get an omelet too?

137
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,822
The village chief made it.

138
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,353
Of course, no omelet.

139
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,909
Seriously,

140
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:10,000
his food is good

141
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,007
but it’s just a bit too spicy.

142
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:15,691
To be honest,

143
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:19,594
your omelet and rice

144
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,890
was really good for my soul.

145
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:26,944
What an overstatement.

146
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:28,990
Let’s eat already.

147
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,760
We need to work, don’t we?

148
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:32,878
Okay.

149
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,357
Come on.

150
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,199
Hurry up. I don’t want to be here.

151
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,199
The other room is available. You can use it.

152
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:48,354
I’m done!

153
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:49,504
Okay. Just a sec.

154
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,326
I’m done here.

155
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,040
What’s the hurry?

156
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,925
Hey. Where have you been?

157
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,284
Don’t you have medical check-ups to do?

158
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,533
I’m here to use the restroom.

159
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,810
Dang! Very smelly here.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,917
Sorry.

161
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:09,732
Fah,

162
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,264
I have a question.

163
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,077
Do you like Teacher Prince?

164
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,210
You’re crazy?

165
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,320
Teacher Prince? Who would like him?

166
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:23,406
Mesa said everyone who sees him will fall for him.

167
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,441
Even you.

168
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:25,623
Mesa,

169
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,742
what is that supposed to mean?

170
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,267
Don’t tell me you…

171
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,127
Yes.

172
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,591
I think I like Teacher Prince.

173
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,520
They teach together.

174
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,575
After spending time together, he’s fallen for him.

175
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,000
Well. He’s cute.

176
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,615
Cute

177
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,208
?He’s so cranky.

178
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:46,000
Not just with the kids, but with me too.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,683
Someone like you deserves all condemnation.

180
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,925
You’re working with him today.

181
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,925
Try to find out of he’s dating someone, will you?

182
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,761
Are you nuts? Why me?

183
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

184
00:09:59,068 --> 00:09:59,911
Well then.

185
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,200
No more borrowing phone for you.

186
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,215
Relax.

187
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:06,004
Think about it.

188
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,443
You can choose to be lonely at night

189
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,387
or call your beloved brother sometimes.

190
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:37,433
No more patients so…

191
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:40,112
Will you excuse me?

192
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:42,442
Hold on for a sec.

193
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,014
Actually,

194
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,808
I still have one patient left.

195
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:54,923
Who?

196
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:00,864
The one in the mirror.

197
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:05,755
No need to speak in riddles. Could’ve just said it.

198
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:10,976
Bring that chair and sit over here.

199
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,663
Open your mouth.

200
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:47,721
Everything seems fine.

201
00:11:48,044 --> 00:11:51,440
I’ll check your heart now.

202
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:04,550
Stop! What are you doing?

203
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,497
Listen to your heart.

204
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,552
I won’t hear it clearly through the shirt.

205
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:15,081
But other people got their hearts listened through clothes.

206
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:16,887
Well.

207
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,791
Other people got general check-ups.

208
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,861
But this is a special check-up.

209
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:28,295
Why?

210
00:12:28,295 --> 00:12:29,297
Are you shy?

211
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,105
I’m not.

212
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,291
Just curious.

213
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:40,713
Do it quickly.

214
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,762
Breathe in.

215
00:12:57,138 --> 00:12:58,073
Breathe out.

216
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,828
(You’re crazy?)

217
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,965
(Teacher Prince? Who would like him?)

218
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:23,758
(Everyone who sees him will fall for him.)

219
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:24,739
(Even you.)

220
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,252
You have a strong heart.

221
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:38,118
I guess it’s well taken care of.

222
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,184
Are you dating someone?

223
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:41,252
What?

224
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,653
What does that have to do with anything?

225
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,469
The doctor asked you a question.

226
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:46,352
You should just answer.

227
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:47,946
Why?

228
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:49,278
Are you hitting on me?

229
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:50,752
Well.

230
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,784
I just want to know my patient’s heart condition.

231
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:57,455
You’ve been here for a while now.

232
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,320
Must be lonely living far from your lover.

233
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,865
I’m not dating anyone.

234
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,160
In case that’s what you want to hear.

235
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,001
And I’m not lonely.

236
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,555
Are we done checking?

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,579
I’ll leave now.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,153
He is just so damn cute.

239
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:40,665
I’m gonna find out what Teacher Prince's weakness is.

240
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:42,518
I have no clue what you want.

241
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:43,524
But if you have that much free time,

242
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:45,813
you should spend it on taking care of the villagers.

243
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,025
Argh!

244
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:21,776
Tag!

245
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:25,891
Look.

246
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,625
He is just so damn cute.

247
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,698
I really want to be those kids.

248
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,150
I want to play tag with him.

249
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:36,617
What an adorable human being.

250
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,172
You’re exaggerating.

251
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,333
Let me tell you.

252
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:09,807
They used to have only him here.

253
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:13,581
But now, they have Dr. Fah up here too.

254
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:16,480
Teacher Prince will surely be forgotten.

255
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:18,167
You’re so confident.

256
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,935
Let me prove it to you.

257
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,517
Girls.

258
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:23,938
Stop. Stop.

259
00:16:24,298 --> 00:16:25,484
Stand here.

260
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,477
I have a question for you.

261
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:28,571
Yes.

262
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:29,872
Between…

263
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,800
Teacher Prince and

264
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,229
Dr. Kuafah

265
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:39,202
who is hotter?

266
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,207
Teacher Prince, of course.

267
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,389
Oh! I got you, man.

268
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:44,804
That’s right.

269
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,846
Teacher Prince is hot, cute, and nice.

270
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,535
Dr. Kuafah has nothing on him.

271
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,237
Let’s go.

272
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:52,968
“Dr. Kuafah has nothing on him,” she said.

273
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:54,688
“Has nothing on him.”

274
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,384
Kids don’t lie.

275
00:16:57,543 --> 00:17:00,578
Kuafah's throne is under threat.

276
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,291
From Bangkok's it boy to the mountain's loser.

277
00:17:06,445 --> 00:17:08,445
No way!

278
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,612
I haven’t lost yet.

279
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:11,868
You’ll see.

280
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:18,658
I’m gonna find out what Teacher Prince's weakness is.

281
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:22,103
BAN KHUN OM HAET NOK SCHOOL

282
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,689
Teacher, I have a question.

283
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,739
Yes, Wee-ah.

284
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:35,741
If 2 + 2 isn’t 4, then what is it?

285
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:38,700
2 + 2 equals a rabbit.

286
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:41,116
You never fall for my joke.

287
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,211
What?

288
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,726
He can be entertaining and academic too.

289
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,306
Aw!

290
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:54,411
He’s smart and doesn’t care about his image.

291
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,066
That’s easy. Anyone can do that.

292
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,205
Watch me.

293
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:02,590
Shit!

294
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,078
I just stepped on pigshit.

295
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:06,955
Help me wash it up.

296
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:08,920
Thank you, Teacher Prince.

297
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,184
You’re such a great help.

298
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,371
You’re welcome. I’m willing to help.

299
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,643
I’m feeling faint.

300
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:14,416
Hey!

301
00:18:14,773 --> 00:18:16,773
Let’s get you inside.

302
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:22,271
Gorgeous, smart, generous, and strong.

303
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:23,965
Nobody is perfect.

304
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,771
You sound envious.

305
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,222
Me? Envious?

306
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:29,831
No way.

307
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,570
I’ll show you

308
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,723
I’m a lot better than he is.

309
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,630
Playing football?

310
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,720
Can I join?

311
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:04,211
How about we make this game more fun?

312
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,439
How?

313
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:13,959
If I goal, Teacher Prince must take off one piece of clothes.

314
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,804
But if your Teacher Prince can goal,

315
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,588
I’ll take off one of my clothes.

316
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,297
You sure about that?

317
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:26,973
I am.

318
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:27,792
Right?

319
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:29,314
Right!

320
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:53,758
Teacher Prince, go go!

321
00:19:56,052 --> 00:20:00,796
Teacher Prince, keep fighting!

322
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:03,820
Dr. Fah, boo!!

323
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:14,366
Teacher Prince, go go!

324
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:27,035
Tired?

325
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,051
I play football often.

326
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:32,648
This game will not tire me out.

327
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,851
I meant are you tired of stalking me?

328
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:39,494
Stalking you?

329
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,971
You think you’re a TV star?

330
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:45,264
I have no clue what you want.

331
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:46,999
But if you have that much time,

332
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,744
you should spend it on taking care of the villagers.

333
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:51,776
Uncle Phang, for example,

334
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,688
who drinks every day.

335
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,651
I know.

336
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,142
We already have an appointment.

337
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:58,021
Yeah?

338
00:20:58,971 --> 00:20:59,778
When?

339
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,343
This evening.

340
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,338
I’ll go see him after this.

341
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:07,309
I’m taking off then.

342
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:11,227
Wait.

343
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:12,184
What?

344
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,971
Uncle Phang’s house is this way.

345
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:18,756
I know.

346
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:20,505
I just forgot.

347
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,292
Dr. Fah, you’re naked.

348
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,326
Why are you following me?

349
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:34,567
Are you trying to pick on me?

350
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:35,698
What?

351
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,331
I’m bringing something for Uncle Phang.

352
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,370
Argh!!

353
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,731
Why are you so shocked?

354
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:02,011
Look closely.

355
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,031
Oh!

356
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,396
That’s Uncle Phang.

357
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,532
I thought it was a body.

358
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:11,130
So…

359
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:14,638
Your hands, when will you let go?

360
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,087
Sorry.

361
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:23,958
Uncle.

362
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,848
He’s always like this.

363
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,714
Drunk every day.

364
00:22:40,183 --> 00:22:42,543
Sometimes he sleeps in water pottery when drunk.

365
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:44,464
Wow!

366
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:46,537
That’s terrible.

367
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:50,154
What if something happens to him?

368
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:54,285
Everyone tries to make him quit.

369
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,260
He just won’t listen.

370
00:22:58,352 --> 00:22:59,680
Then it is hard.

371
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,447
Hm?

372
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:06,386
I’ve met a lot of patients like him.

373
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:09,431
Stubborn type.

374
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:14,143
When I give them advice or warning, they even talk back.

375
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:19,532
I can’t do anything more than give him treatment when he’s ill.

376
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:28,217
Come with me.

377
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:29,469
I will show you something.

378
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,476
Who is this?

379
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:50,242
Uncle Phang’s wife.

380
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,001
Wife?

381
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:58,148
Where is she now?

382
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:00,998
She passed.

383
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:07,222
The village chief told me

384
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:12,698
Uncle Phang and his wife made the best roasted pork around here.

385
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:16,537
They sold it down the hill.

386
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,051
Why did he stop?

387
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,192
After his wife died three months ago,

388
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,881
he’s just lost it.

389
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:30,920
All he does is drink.

390
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,311
What’s up with my patients these days?

391
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,824
When they get hurt, they get drunk.

392
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:44,693
So bad.

393
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:47,170
Right?

394
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,299
Just like someone around here.

395
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:52,661
Oops!

396
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,025
Did I just call myself out?

397
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:05,316
I know it’s hard.

398
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:06,969
But from now on,

399
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,878
please take care of Uncle Phang for us.

400
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,810
A doctor is the only one he will listen to.

401
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:27,453
Good evening, Chief.

402
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,182
Are you visiting Uncle Phang?

403
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:29,873
I am.

404
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:32,890
It’s good you’re here. I have news for you.

405
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:34,647
What news?

406
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:38,921
There will be a ritual slaughter tomorrow.

407
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:43,220
It’s Gong, the children’s pig.

408
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,678
So please inform the children for me.

409
00:25:58,647 --> 00:25:59,470
Wow!

410
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:02,266
That’s a tough job too.

411
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:06,277
Good luck.

412
00:26:11,412 --> 00:26:12,392
Children.

413
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:13,731
I’ve got news for you.

414
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:14,987
What? Slaughter?

415
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,028
Hey!

416
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:17,293
How did you get here?

417
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:20,571
We overheard Teacher Prince say Gong is about to be slaughtered.

418
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:25,688
We brought him here as we know people don’t like to come here.

419
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:26,644
Where is Gong?

420
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:27,789
This is a health center.

421
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,189
How can any pig be here?

422
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:30,420
Enough with the nonsense.

423
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:08,887
Children.

424
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,619
I’ve got news for you.

425
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:15,562
Teacher.

426
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,195
My dad is ready for the slaughter.

427
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:18,568
What? Slaughter?

428
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:23,733
Ah!

429
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,208
She said scissors.

430
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:27,835
The village chief needs scissors to work on something.

431
00:27:29,956 --> 00:27:32,564
Let’s talk outside.

432
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:43,966
Why did you lie to the kids?

433
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:47,739
Because I haven’t told them yet.

434
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,888
You must tell them now.

435
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:54,448
I need to take the pig to shower first.

436
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:56,639
My dad is ready to kill it.

437
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:01,050
Can you give me more time?

438
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:05,789
I’m afraid the kids will be shocked if I’m not careful.

439
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:09,246
Sure. I understand.

440
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,461
But please don’t take too long.

441
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:13,434
Or my dad will yell at me.

442
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:30,933
Hey!

443
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,341
How did you get here?

444
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:37,829
What is happening?

445
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:41,259
We overheard Teacher Prince say Gong is about to be slaughtered.

446
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:42,352
Yeah?

447
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,172
It’s time?

448
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,050
You’re making me hungry…

449
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,824
I mean thirsty.

450
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,453
Why is there no water here?

451
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,712
Why did you bring him here?

452
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:08,656
We brought him here as we know people don’t like to come here.

453
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:14,246
Teacher Prince said he wouldn’t come here if not necessary

454
00:29:14,246 --> 00:29:15,734
because Dr. Fah is not a good man.

455
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:16,376
What?

456
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,402
Teacher Prince said that?

457
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,598
Why did he say that?

458
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:21,514
Children.

459
00:29:21,974 --> 00:29:22,894
Where are you guys?

460
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,382
Teacher Prince is here. Let’s get Gong hidden.

461
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:41,196
Hey.

462
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,461
What are you doing here?

463
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:48,301
Where is Gong?

464
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:49,653
Gong?

465
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:52,169
You mean the pig?

466
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,245
This is a health center.

467
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,660
How can any pig be here?

468
00:29:56,956 --> 00:29:57,535
Yeah?

469
00:29:58,424 --> 00:29:59,558
Then what is it under the tablecloth?

470
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,759
Hey, Gong!

471
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:13,778
When did you get here?

472
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,444
He must have flown here.

473
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:19,151
Enough with the nonsense.

474
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:24,929
HEALTH CENTER

475
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,387
Teacher, can we spare Gong’s life?

476
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:30,083
Please. He is so lovely.

477
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:31,403
Children,

478
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:32,555
let me ask you something.

479
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,861
What do you study for?

480
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:36,902
It’s our duty.

481
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,544
When we grow up, we can lighten our parents' burdens.

482
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:43,509
I want to be smart and make money to support my parents.

483
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:44,635
See?

484
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,461
We all have our duties.

485
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:49,499
Gong has his duty too.

486
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:55,842
The village chief raises him so that one day he can be our food.

487
00:30:56,627 --> 00:31:03,047
Aren’t you going to let Gong perform his duty?

488
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,271
Goodbye, Gong.

489
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:26,591
We should commence now.

490
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:33,925
Guys, you’ve done great.

491
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,590
Now close your eyes.

492
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:40,912
We thank you so much, Gong.

493
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:44,147
We wish you a heavenly afterlife.

494
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,156
Hey!

495
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:15,308
Teacher Prince.

496
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,420
Teacher.

497
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,116
Hey.

498
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:30,125
What is this?

499
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,879
Welcoming party for the four of you.

500
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,648
It’s our tradition.

501
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:38,142
We throw a party to officially welcome new visitors.

502
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:40,944
Thanks for taking care of me when I passed out.

503
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,675
Thank you for helping me with the check-up the other day.

504
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:25,990
I guess he'd never seen anything like that.

505
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,158
That’s why he passed out.

506
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:34,666
You can continue what you left off.

507
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:36,032
I’ll take it from here.

508
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:36,693
All right.

509
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:38,210
Thank you, Doctor.

510
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:40,175
Thank you.

511
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:57,581
Mesa should see you now,

512
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,577
Mr. Perfect.

513
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,713
Wow!

514
00:34:17,703 --> 00:34:19,420
Expensive perfume.

515
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:25,433
It smells authentic.

516
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:36,309
A designer bag.

517
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:41,007
Who exactly is this guy?

518
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:48,799
What’s wrong?

519
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,752
I’m worried about Fah.

520
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,530
Fah has never lived a tough life like this before.

521
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,037
They don’t have electricity.

522
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,125
They barely have phone reception.

523
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,002
Do you think he will make it?

524
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:05,095
Don’t overthink it.

525
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:08,615
Should I call his dad?

526
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:11,170
Tell him to move Fah back here for the community service.

527
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,129
Dao,

528
00:35:13,522 --> 00:35:15,956
I know you’re so concerned about Fah.

529
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,062
But you said it yourself

530
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,730
Fah should spend more time for himself.

531
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,661
It might be his true rest time.

532
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:27,977
Right?

533
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:30,197
Yeah.

534
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,549
I hope so.

535
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,095
Don’t you worry.

536
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:41,508
I made lots of your favorite food today.

537
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:45,842
Can I get a reward?

538
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,261
No.

539
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,427
No?

540
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,045
Fine.

541
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:23,096
Phang.

542
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,641
The pig has been slaughtered.

543
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,979
Don’t you want to make roasted pork for everybody?

544
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:32,439
You guys go ahead.

545
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:34,090
Please do.

546
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,727
I know you’re the best when it comes to roasted pork.

547
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:38,336
Right.

548
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,170
Please do it for Gong.

549
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,273
He must be happy if you’re the one that cooks him.

550
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,367
Phang.

551
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,292
Please, Uncle Phang.

552
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:54,267
- Please, Uncle Phang.
- Please. I want to eat your roasted pork.

553
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,908
The villagers love your roasted pork.

554
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,631
You’re the best around here.

555
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:13,468
Be confident.

556
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:17,770
I love you because of your roasted pork, you know?

557
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,468
Stop talking. Starting roasting now.

558
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,260
Finally awake?

559
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,185
Did I faint?

560
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:08,965
You did.

561
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:15,986
If you have a fear of blood, don’t look at it.

562
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:19,330
No more acting cool and watching people kill pigs.

563
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:22,749
What time is it?

564
00:38:23,246 --> 00:38:24,228
7 p.m.

565
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,049
What?

566
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:26,949
We’re late.

567
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:28,403
For what?

568
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:30,305
Come on. Follow me.

569
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:31,224
We’re late for the party.

570
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,507
Took you long enough to come.

571
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:48,980
What is this?

572
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,350
Welcoming party for the four of you.

573
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,162
It’s our tradition.

574
00:38:57,162 --> 00:39:00,605
We throw a party to officially welcome new visitors.

575
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,654
Let’s join them.

576
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:03,843
The party is about to start.

577
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:04,980
Come on.

578
00:39:08,249 --> 00:39:10,025
Why don’t you wait for me?

579
00:39:24,244 --> 00:39:25,523
Come dance with us.

580
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:28,690
There.

581
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,563
You look cool.

582
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,264
Dance with me.

583
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,530
Only him?

584
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:51,420
The locals are so nice.

585
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:55,573
They are.

586
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:58,449
Are you done dancing?

587
00:40:03,529 --> 00:40:04,683
Dance with me.

588
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,471
Dao.

589
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:48,448
Uncle Phang’s roasted pork is so good.

590
00:40:48,832 --> 00:40:53,717
When I go back to Bangkok, I’ll ask him to make some for you.

591
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,692
Would you like that?

592
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,108
Really?

593
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:59,090
This is odd.

594
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:02,855
You sound happy somehow.

595
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,580
Because Uncle Phang’s pork is just so good.

596
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:07,763
(Yeah?)

597
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,330
(But I think there’s more to the story.)

598
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:12,567
Tell me honestly.

599
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:15,810
You’re not flirting with someone up there, are you?

600
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,717
Are you crazy?

601
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:17,342
Oops!

602
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,729
I’m being loud again.

603
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:22,995
Dao, I gotta go.

604
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:24,345
The house owner is coming.

605
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,226
(Sure.)

606
00:41:25,226 --> 00:41:26,423
Okay.

607
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:27,302
Talk to you later.

608
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:33,672
Hey.

609
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:35,728
Is this your house?

610
00:41:36,658 --> 00:41:37,460
Of course.

611
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:40,553
You brought me here this evening.

612
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:42,008
Don’t you remember?

613
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:44,757
Really?

614
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:47,542
I don’t remember.

615
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,876
So…

616
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:54,129
Did you just talk to your lover?

617
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:55,569
Why do you want to know?

618
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,725
Are you hitting on me?

619
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,805
No.

620
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:05,203
You talk to someone so sweetly every night.

621
00:42:06,497 --> 00:42:07,515
I’m just curious.

622
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:12,701
A fainted guy can talk back now.

623
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:14,843
I guess you’re feeling better.

624
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:19,320
Of course.

625
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,030
I ate Uncle Phang’s roasted pork.

626
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,930
I’m completely healed.

627
00:42:24,494 --> 00:42:25,438
That’s good.

628
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,578
Uncle Phang said he’d quit drinking.

629
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,669
And you’re fully recovered.

630
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:37,103
That means nobody in this village is sick now.

631
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:39,859
No.

632
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:41,446
Who?There’s one person left.

633
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:43,369
Who?

634
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,759
This one.

635
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,006
You meant me?

636
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:05,276
Yes.

637
00:43:06,694 --> 00:43:07,841
You take care of other people

638
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:09,836
but forget to take care of yourself.

639
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:15,034
It's hard to convince people to take care of themselves

640
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:18,136
when you drink a lot

641
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,253
and don't eat when you work.

642
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:26,556
I get it now.

643
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:28,662
I will take care of myself.

644
00:43:30,702 --> 00:43:31,484
So…

645
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:33,563
Will you excuse me now?

646
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:39,410
Thanks for taking care of me when I passed out.

647
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:47,072
Thank you for helping me with the check-up the other day.

648
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:53,451
Hey!

649
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,056
Hold on.

650
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:06,669
I saw a branded perfume in your room.

651
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,770
Is it yours?

652
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,131
What?

653
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:12,706
You saw it?

654
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:14,239
Why?

655
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,011
Are you afraid people will know you’re rich?

656
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:17,966
It’s the opposite.

657
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,130
It’s a fake one from a market.

658
00:44:21,694 --> 00:44:22,779
Only 300 baht.

659
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,689
I don’t support fake perfumes but…

660
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,495
the merchant kept pushing me to buy.

661
00:44:28,788 --> 00:44:30,250
Will you excuse me now?

662
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,862
Almost busted.

663
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:22,564
When our minds are at ease, all we want is for time to slow down.

664
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,621
Directed by Siwaj Sawatmaneekul

665
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:50,727
The villagers say Dr. Fah and Teacher Prince are dating.

666
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:52,610
The locals are saying you’re dating Teacher Prince.

667
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,180
What?

668
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,780
What if I really like him?

669
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:56,996
Will you be mad?

670
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,086
I wish the pain…

671
00:46:01,086 --> 00:46:02,732
turns into butterflies

672
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:04,597
and fly away.
