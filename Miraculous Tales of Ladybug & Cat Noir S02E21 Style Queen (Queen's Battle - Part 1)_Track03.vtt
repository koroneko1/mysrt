00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.820
&lrm;<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.900
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.900
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.660
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.700
&lrm;♪ &lrm;<i>Miraculous! Simply the best! </i>&lrm;♪

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.700
&lrm;♪ &lrm;<i>Up to the test when things go wrong! </i>&lrm;♪

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380
&lrm;♪&lrm;<i> Miraculous! The luckiest! </i>&lrm;♪

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
&lrm;♪&lrm;<i> The power of love, always so strong! </i>&lrm;♪

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
&lrm;♪&lrm;<i> Miraculous! </i>&lrm;♪

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.380
&lrm;[lively music]

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.540
&lrm;-They're so in sync with each other!
&lrm;<i>-You're right!</i>

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.900
&lrm;<i>Someday I hope I'll find someone I can</i>
&lrm;<i>share everything with, like they do.</i>

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.500
&lrm;[sighs]

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.860
&lrm;But till my father
&lrm;starts letting me go out more often,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.260
&lrm;that probably won't be happening.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.700
&lrm;<i>Are you sure your dad won't let you come?</i>
&lrm;<i>It's such a bummer.</i>

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.460
&lrm;<i>You know how overprotective he is.</i>

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.700
&lrm;<i>One day, he'll realise I'm not a child,</i>
&lrm;<i>but we're not there yet!</i>

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.380
&lrm;[Nino] Big finish... here we go!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900
&lrm;You don't wanna miss this.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.540
&lrm;Yeah!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.220
&lrm;[laughter]

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.380
&lrm;[Nora] Oh, shoot! Did I miss the ballet?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.220
&lrm;Nora, is your match over already?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.060
&lrm;First round, total knockout!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.820
&lrm;As usual!

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.380
&lrm;And I've told you not to call me
&lrm;Nora in front of people, little sis!

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.460
&lrm;The name is Anansi, like the spider!

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.940
&lrm;Sure, I'll call you Anansi,
&lrm;when you stop calling me "little sis".

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.180
&lrm;Anyway, what are you all still doing here?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.100
&lrm;Don't you have school tomorrow?

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.140
&lrm;We're waiting for it to get dark.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.500
&lrm;It's the World Cup Fireworks show tonight.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.540
&lrm;[Alya] We'll watch it from
&lrm;the Place de la Concorde ferris wheel!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.940
&lrm;Oh, no! Baguette and Cappy can go
&lrm;with Cellphone Boy if they want,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.580
&lrm;but you're staying here!
&lrm;It's way too dangerous!

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.860
&lrm;But, Nora... I mean, Anansi...
&lrm;you can't do that!

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.380
&lrm;Yeah, no way, dude!
&lrm;We're not going without Alya!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.180
&lrm;I appreciate you worrying about me,
&lrm;but I'm not a little girl any more.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.780
&lrm;Besides, Mom and Dad
&lrm;are totally cool with it!

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.340
&lrm;There have been too many akumatised
&lrm;peeps in Paris these last weeks.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.780
&lrm;Look how many times
&lrm;you've been in direct danger!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.820
&lrm;So, you're staying home, safe and sound.
&lrm;Period!

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.420
&lrm;That's so ridiculous! The twins
&lrm;were akumatised right here, at home!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.660
&lrm;That would have never happened
&lrm;on my watch!

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540
&lrm;I won't let anybody mess with my family.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.580
&lrm;Like the other day at the square?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.060
&lrm;<i>What happened?</i>

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.500
&lrm;We came across a man handing out flyers.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.620
&lrm;[Marinette] Nora thought the man
&lrm;was akumatised

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.820
&lrm;and wanted to turn Alya
&lrm;into a banana zombie!

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.180
&lrm;Uh... Er... How was I supposed to know
&lrm;it was some stupid costume?

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.940
&lrm;What would happen
&lrm;if the ferris wheel stopped working

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.460
&lrm;because some akumatised dude
&lrm;refused to pay?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.420
&lrm;Once you flyweights can actually defend
&lrm;yourselves, like me,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.460
&lrm;we'll talk about it!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.380
&lrm;But Ladybug and Cat Noir would save us
&lrm;if there were any problems!

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.260
&lrm;Uh-huh! And what if Mr Whiskers
&lrm;is catching a mouse

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.380
&lrm;and that beetle's been sprayed
&lrm;with bug spray? What then?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.620
&lrm;I can protect Alya if I have to!

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.540
&lrm;Oh, yeah? And how are you planning
&lrm;to defeat the villain?

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.580
&lrm;A dance-off?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.700
&lrm;[mocking laugh]

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.340
&lrm;I'd do anything to protect Alya!

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.980
&lrm;Hmm... Ha!
&lrm;OK, Alya can go out with you guys...

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.940
&lrm;if you beat me at an arm wrestle.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.020
&lrm;Please, don't arm wrestle on my account!

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.780
&lrm;I don't need to be protected!

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.660
&lrm;<i>You don't stand a chance against Anansi!</i>
&lrm;<i>She's way too strong!</i>

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.900
&lrm;Hey! Dude!

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.580
&lrm;<i>Sorry, Nino!</i>
&lrm;<i>I'm sure we'll work something out?</i>

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.020
&lrm;We gotta go
&lrm;or else we'll miss the fireworks!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580
&lrm;Forget it. You guys go without me.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.620
&lrm;-Huh?
&lrm;-Huh? No way!

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.540
&lrm;-OK, Nino will arm wrestle you!
&lrm;-What?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.820
&lrm;Nino will prove to us that he can defend
&lrm;Alya and every one of us, because...

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.580
&lrm;-Marinette, what are you doing?
&lrm;-I got this!

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.500
&lrm;Because, uh... because love
&lrm;and friendship make your muscles bulge!

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.460
&lrm;Yeah! Thanks, Marinette!

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.420
&lrm;<i>All right! In position!</i>

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.620
&lrm;<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.620
&lrm;[battle cry, then groans]

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.900
&lrm;Really? Is that all you got?

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.860
&lrm;She's gonna rip his arm off!

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.940
&lrm;[yawning]

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.340
&lrm;-Oh! Over there, an akuma!
&lrm;-What?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.860
&lrm;<i>And the winner is... Nino!</i>

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.420
&lrm;-Huh?
&lrm;-Oops, my bad! It was just a fly!

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
&lrm;[Marinette laughs]

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.860
&lrm;You rock, Nino! Come on, let's go!

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.700
&lrm;[Marinette] If we leave now,
&lrm;we'll get there just in time!

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.420
&lrm;Cheaters! There's no way I could have
&lrm;been beaten by that flyweight!

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.740
&lrm;If I hadn't been distracted, I--

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.100
&lrm;That's it, Nora!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.020
&lrm;You lost the challenge. Deal with it!

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.740
&lrm;I've had it
&lrm;with your over-protective smothering!

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.060
&lrm;I'm going out with my BFFs,
&lrm;and I don't care what you think! Alya out!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.140
&lrm;Uh... See you, Nora! Uh, I mean Anansi!

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.460
&lrm;[nervous laughter]

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.340
&lrm;Grr!

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.140
&lrm;A big sister with the best of intentions,
&lrm;unappreciated and unwanted,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.780
&lrm;ideal prey for my akumas.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.340
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her broken spirit!

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.700
&lrm;They don't understand.
&lrm;They have no idea of the dangers.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.740
&lrm;They're so clueless!

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.820
&lrm;Anansi, I am Hawk Moth.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.300
&lrm;They didn't want
&lrm;your support and protection.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.220
&lrm;I'm giving you the power to show them

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.740
&lrm;just how dangerous the world really is!

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.540
&lrm;In return, you must defeat
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.140
&lrm;and bring me their Miraculous.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.940
&lrm;Let the match begin, Hawk Moth!

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.420
&lrm;Just in time! Look at that!

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.140
&lrm;Whoa!

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.460
&lrm;-What's up?
&lrm;-Oh! Uh! Nothing...

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.500
&lrm;<i>Whoa! It's beautiful!</i>

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.260
&lrm;<i>Thank you, guys!</i>

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.020
&lrm;<i>Marinette, behind you!</i>

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.820
&lrm;<i>I saw something go by. What was it?</i>

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.220
&lrm;I don't see anything. Maybe it was a bird.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.140
&lrm;Dude! Please don't tell me
&lrm;we're gonna be stuck up here!

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.460
&lrm;I thought you said you'd protect us.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.380
&lrm;Over there! A supervillain!

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.220
&lrm;Uh... Maybe you shouldn't film her, Alya.
&lrm;You don't want to attract her over here!

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.620
&lrm;A new scoop for the Ladyblog.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.140
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;should be showing up any minute!

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.860
&lrm;<i>I think my wi-fi is losing signal!</i>

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.740
&lrm;My friends are in danger!
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.220

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.020

&lrm;[screaming]

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.700
&lrm;[Anansi] Well, well,
&lrm;there you are, flyweights!

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.700
&lrm;Nora?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060
&lrm;Nora's not here to protect you any more!

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.100
&lrm;I am Anansi, Super Spider!

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.140
&lrm;[screaming]

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.780
&lrm;[Cat Noir] All those arms. Convenient!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.260
&lrm;But you destroyed my scratching post.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.420
&lrm;Need a hand, kitty cat?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.620
&lrm;Nora! No!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.420
&lrm;You're no match for me, kitten!

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.700
&lrm;[grunting]

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.540

&lrm;-Go fetch the ferris wheel!
&lrm;-Huh?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.220
&lrm;[screaming]

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.220
&lrm;Now that you can't cheat any more, Cappy,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.580
&lrm;show us just how you plan
&lrm;to protect your friends!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.980
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.140
&lrm;Come and get her,
&lrm;if you're not a flyweight!

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.100
&lrm;-Alya!
&lrm;-Nino!

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.060
&lrm;[suspense music]

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.460
&lrm;Nino, wait!

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.700
&lrm;I'm not a flyweight
&lrm;and I don't need your help to prove it!

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.380
&lrm;Tikki, I think I messed up,
&lrm;we've gotta stop Nino... and save Alya!

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.620
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.180
&lrm;[lively music]

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.860
&lrm;Thank you, Cat Noir!

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.220
&lrm;You do pretty well without me, I see!

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.620
&lrm;But it's so much nicer
&lrm;when you're here, milady!

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.820
&lrm;Let's go show that spider
&lrm;what two superheroes are capable of!

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.460
&lrm;[Ladybug] Ha!

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.180
&lrm;Alya!

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.500
&lrm;Nino! Don't stick around!

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.980
&lrm;Well, well, well! Look who it is!

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.620
&lrm;Anansi! You let Alya go right now!

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.980
&lrm;Oh, yeah?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.700
&lrm;And how exactly is a weak little flyweight
&lrm;gonna force me to release my prisoner?

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.380
&lrm;[battle cry]

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.420
&lrm;[Anansi laughs]

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.020
&lrm;[Nino screams]

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.820
&lrm;Watch out! You need to leave this
&lrm;to the professionals!

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.140
&lrm;This isn't over, Spider!

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.020
&lrm;So, it's two versus one now?
&lrm;Fine with me! Round two! Fight!

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.340
&lrm;-Cat Noir!
&lrm;-On the floor already? We just started!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.260
&lrm;-Are you OK?
&lrm;-Everything except my pride.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.340
&lrm;The akuma must be in her headgear!

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.580
&lrm;Yeah, but she's so strong
&lrm;we can't even get near her!

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.820
&lrm;OK, change of plan.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.180
&lrm;I take care of Anansi.
&lrm;You release the prisoner!

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.380
&lrm;It'll distract her enough
&lrm;to drop her guard.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.540
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Look out!

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.980
&lrm;Ding, ding, ding!
&lrm;Bell's ringing! Round three! Fight!

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.100
&lrm;[dynamic music]

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.340
&lrm;Seriously? Oh!

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.660
&lrm;[Anansi laughs]

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.860
&lrm;Er, milady? I think I got myself
&lrm;into a sticky situation!

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.540
&lrm;Looks like I've already got a catch!

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.140
&lrm;You'll be next, beetle!

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.500
&lrm;I don't think so!

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.620
&lrm;[Ladybug screams]

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.100
&lrm;You're like a cat
&lrm;caught in a spider's web!

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.700
&lrm;Technically,
&lrm;spiders don't actually eat cats.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.540
&lrm;I suggest we make an exception for you,
&lrm;kitty-cat!

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.860
&lrm;Anansi, grab his Miraculous from him!

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.580
&lrm;Are you OK, dude? Er, I mean, Ladybug!

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.220
&lrm;Yeah, but we'll need some help!

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.820
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.100
&lrm;[lively music]

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.220
&lrm;A candle? Of course! But I don't have
&lrm;enough time to do a round trip!

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.700
&lrm;Maybe I could help you?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.420
&lrm;I get it. It's cool. I'm no superhero.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.260
&lrm;I tried to save Alya,
&lrm;but I guess I'm not strong enough.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.980
&lrm;[Ladybug] Let me tell you
&lrm;a secret... Uh...

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.220
&lrm;Nino! The name's Nino!

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.660
&lrm;Nino, when you're facing a villain,
&lrm;strength makes no difference,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.220
&lrm;courage and determination do!

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.980
&lrm;[Ladybug] We can't let her get
&lrm;Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.980
&lrm;Use this to distract her.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.180
&lrm;I won't be long!

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.500
&lrm;[Cat Noir grunts]

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.180
&lrm;Where did you hide your earrings?

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.860
&lrm;Anansi, the earrings
&lrm;are Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.660
&lrm;Cat Noir's magic jewel is a ring.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.500
&lrm;Why didn't you just say so?

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.220
&lrm;[Nino] Hey, arachnid!

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.700
&lrm;Ah, so you're back, Cappy!

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.340
&lrm;I trust you, Nino!

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.140
&lrm;Master,
&lrm;Nino won't hold off Anansi for long!

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.300
&lrm;She's about to get Cat Noir's Miraculous.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.660
&lrm;We can't let that happen!

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.340
&lrm;[suspense music]

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.300
&lrm;[Master Wang Fu] Marinette Dupain-Cheng,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700
&lrm;pick an ally you can trust to fight
&lrm;alongside you on this mission.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.700
&lrm;Choose wisely.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.460
&lrm;Such powers on hand
&lrm;to serve a greater good.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.460
&lrm;Once the mission is over, you must
&lrm;retrieve the Miraculous from them.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.300
&lrm;[Ladybug] I need a protective Miraculous.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.620
&lrm;That's the one I need, Master!

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.580
&lrm;If it's OK with you.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.140
&lrm;Do you have someone in mind, Marinette?

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.220
&lrm;Actually, I think I've found
&lrm;just the right person!

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.900
&lrm;Wow! Be careful! What are you trying
&lrm;to do with that little stick?

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.180
&lrm;On your left! No! On your right!
&lrm;No, the other right!

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.420
&lrm;You're gonna hurt yourself!

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.820
&lrm;Anansi, enough toying with you prey!

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.220
&lrm;Concentrate on seizing
&lrm;Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.540
&lrm;[Nino screams]

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.820

&lrm;[suspense music]

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.140
&lrm;So, who's the flyweight now, huh?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.140
&lrm;Grr! All right, big boy!

&lrm;[battle cries and groans]

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.140
&lrm;I suggest you stay down, Cappy!

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.820
&lrm;You're gonna regret this big time!

&lrm;[he laughs]

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.980
&lrm;You shouldn't have
&lrm;underestimated me, Legs!

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.540
&lrm;Your friend's good at this!

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.940
&lrm;Yeah, but I sure hope Ladybug
&lrm;comes back before he gets bad at it!

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.180
&lrm;Game over! Time to fly, lightweight!

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.980
&lrm;Thanks, Ladydude! Uh, I mean Ladybug!

&lrm;Ha, ha, ha, ha!
&lrm;It's just you and me, kitty-cat!

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.540
&lrm;Hey, Spider! Guess what?

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.780
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Cataclysm!

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.460
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] No! Don't touch his ring!
&lrm;It's charged with destructive energy!

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.340
&lrm;Hey! Make up your mind, Mothy!

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.380
&lrm;I couldn't care less about it!

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.780
&lrm;You're the one
&lrm;who's been nagging me all evening.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.900
&lrm;Cat Noir has called on his power,
&lrm;but he can't use it.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.420
&lrm;Just be patient and wait for him
&lrm;to transform back.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.860
&lrm;Then the ring will be uncharged again
&lrm;and you'll be able to take it from him.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.540
&lrm;Whatever. If you say so!

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.860
&lrm;Hurry up, Ladybug!

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.300
&lrm;I'm gonna need your help again!
&lrm;Do you still want to save your friend?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.820
&lrm;I'll do anything for her!

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.580
&lrm;Nino Lahiffe,
&lrm;this is the Miraculous of the turtle,

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.420
&lrm;which grants the power of protection!

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.100
&lrm;[Ladybug] You will use it
&lrm;for the greater good!

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.900
&lrm;[dramatic music]

&lrm;but I can give you superpowers!

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.380
&lrm;Once the job is done, you must return
&lrm;the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?

&lrm;You bet, dudette!

&lrm;Then all you have to say is,

&lrm;to protect us, me, Cat Noir and Alya.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.500
&lrm;Throw like a Ladybug, scratch like a cat!

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.420
&lrm;[Ladybug] No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little akuma.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.100
&lrm;Time to de-evilise.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.460
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.620
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.500
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.740
&lrm;The beetle and Mr Whiskers!
&lrm;What's going on here?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.380
&lrm;[alarm goes off]

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.260
&lrm;Uh... sorry guys, but I've gotta split!

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.020
&lrm;Cat Noir! You know you're irreplaceable!

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.300
&lrm;[soft music]

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.340
&lrm;Uh, uh.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.620
&lrm;[Ladybug and Nino] Pound it!

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.980
&lrm;Whoa! This is a first for the Ladyblog.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.940
&lrm;A brand new superhero! What's your name?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.100
&lrm;Uh...

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.780
&lrm;Carapace, call me Carapace!

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.900
&lrm;See you later, bugheads!

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.260
&lrm;And stay connected!

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.020
&lrm;[Nino] Shell off!

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.420
&lrm;Thank you for trusting me.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.260
&lrm;You were a true superhero, Nino.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.340
&lrm;Uh...

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.300
&lrm;You're gaining more allies, Ladybug,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.420
&lrm;but don't rush to rejoice,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.620
&lrm;soon you might just be outnumbered!

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.260
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.220
&lrm;Hey! You OK?
&lrm;You weren't too scared, were you?

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.380
&lrm;I'm fine! I saw that you tried to save me.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.860
&lrm;Uh... actually, no... I didn't do much.
&lrm;It's not like I'm a superhero or anything!

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.260
&lrm;I know perfectly well what you're like.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.380
&lrm;[embarrassed laugh]

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.340
&lrm;Flyweights!

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.940
&lrm;[sighs]

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.540
&lrm;Truth is, I did lose the match
&lrm;and my cool.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.820
&lrm;[Nora] Sorry about everything
&lrm;that went down.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.020
&lrm;Nor... uh... Anansi... I... actually...

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.300
&lrm;you didn't lose the game!

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.060
&lrm;I helped Nino to win by distracting you.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.180
&lrm;I'm sorry.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.140
&lrm;Hey, we're cool, Marinette.
&lrm;It's no big deal.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.420
&lrm;Cappy proved
&lrm;that he doesn't need muscles to be strong!

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.380
&lrm;[laughter]

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.820
&lrm;Want a scoop? You're the best!

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.820
&lrm;What if Nora came with us
&lrm;to the ice rink next week?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.540
&lrm;-It'd be more fun with her.
&lrm;-You're right, Nino.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.500
&lrm;Besides, I don't even remember
&lrm;the last time I hung out with my big sis!

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.780
