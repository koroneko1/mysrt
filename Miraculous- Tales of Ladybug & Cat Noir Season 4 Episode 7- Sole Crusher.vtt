00:29.640 --> 00:31.920
You'll discover for yourself

00:31.920 --> 00:34.240
that one can never
see too much of Paris!

00:34.240 --> 00:36.960
Does the Eiffel Tower
need an introduction?

00:36.960 --> 00:39.240
To think that when it was built,
the Parisians thought

00:39.240 --> 00:41.040
it stuck out like a sore thumb!

00:41.040 --> 00:43.120
And over there
are the Trocadéro Gardens!

00:43.120 --> 00:45.400
Underneath there is an aquarium.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.280
The first in the world,
built in 1867!

00:48.280 --> 00:50.880
The Louvre!
The largest museum in the world!

00:50.880 --> 00:54.280
So huge that it would take
100 days to see everything!

00:54.280 --> 00:56.960
Originally, it was a fortress
built to protect our city.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.080
These days, it protects our art.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.840
Speaking of protecting the city,
there are our miracles,

01:01.840 --> 01:04.880
‐ Ladybug and Cat Noir!
‐ Can we stop here?

01:04.880 --> 01:07.520
I've always dreamed of eating
a Parisian croissant!

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
You couldn't have picked
a better place!

01:09.520 --> 01:11.080
It's the best bakery in Paris!

01:11.080 --> 01:13.440
My kids adore
their croissants!

01:13.440 --> 01:16.440
You're lucky,
they're fresh out of the oven.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.480
Sorry, I got held up!
Here are the appl ‐‐

01:18.480 --> 01:20.400
‐ Aaah!
‐ Oh!

01:20.400 --> 01:22.000
Is everyone all right?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.200
‐ Sorry, sorry, sorry!
‐ It's totally OK!

01:24.200 --> 01:26.280
But maybe
I should be asking if you're OK?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.600
‐ That was quite a fall!
‐

01:28.600 --> 01:30.400
Don't worry about me!
I'll be fine.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.320
I'm pretty clumsy,
so I'm used to it!

01:32.320 --> 01:34.520
Come to think of it,
I fall a lot.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.880
Fall flat on my face,
fall asleep, fall out of bed,

01:36.880 --> 01:39.240
fall apart at the seams,
fall in love...

01:40.520 --> 01:41.640
I am sorry about all this.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.080
How can I make it up to you?

01:43.080 --> 01:45.240
‐ It's nothing, don't worry!
‐ It is!

01:45.240 --> 01:47.800
Mom, could you put together
a dozen more croissants for...

01:48.680 --> 01:50.200
‐ Zoé!
‐ Hello, Zoé!

01:50.200 --> 01:52.520
I'm "Miss Walking Disaster!"

01:52.520 --> 01:54.840
Where's your accent from?
It's really pretty!

01:54.840 --> 01:56.920
‐ I'm from New York!
‐ Wow, cool!

01:56.920 --> 01:58.320
And what are you doing in Paris?

01:59.480 --> 02:02.440
I'm, uh,
here to be with my family.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.080
Then it's gonna be a great trip.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.200
If you're
with the ones you love,

02:06.200 --> 02:07.160
you feel right at home.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.520
Sorry!

02:11.240 --> 02:15.240
Wow! Your sneakers are awesome!
Did you decorate them yourself?

02:15.240 --> 02:16.920
Yeah. I've written
every nice thing

02:16.920 --> 02:18.480
anyone's ever said to me,

02:18.480 --> 02:19.920
to keep them with me
all the time.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.600
But there's only one message.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.400
I only had one friend.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.680
Oh!

02:29.320 --> 02:31.320
If you're free tonight,

02:31.320 --> 02:34.080
my friends are performing
a concert on a river barge.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.800
Let me give you my number.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.920
I can give you mine, too,
if you want.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.640
This way,
I won't lose it for sure!

02:48.840 --> 02:51.280
‐ Bye!
‐ See you tonight, then.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.880
‐ Share it with your kids.
‐ Wow! Don't you want

03:06.880 --> 03:07.800
to keep some for your family?

03:07.800 --> 03:10.560
Nah, they prefer sour to sweets.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.800
Well, thanks, Miss.
Enjoy your journey.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.680
Oh, welcome, Mademoiselle Zoé.
Please follow me.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.800
Pardon me, Madame,
but your daughter has arrived.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.000
Zoé! Ugh! You look terrible!

03:29.000 --> 03:30.720
I'm guessing
the flight was horrific?

03:31.640 --> 03:35.640
Someone in Economy class, uh,
smelled like disgusting cologne,

03:35.640 --> 03:39.240
and they refused to open
a window to air out the plane!

03:39.240 --> 03:41.400
Your father forgot
to provide a private jet?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.600
Too busy for anyone, as usual.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.480
It's fine that you want
to come live with us, but...

03:46.480 --> 03:49.280
what exactly was wrong with
your boarding school, again?

03:49.280 --> 03:52.720
I found roaches in my locker.
Can you believe it?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.760
Well, that's nice, dear.
Jean‐Quentin!

03:54.760 --> 03:56.040
Take her to see her sister!

03:59.520 --> 04:05.040
So, you're Zoé.
Blonde hair, blue eyes...

04:05.040 --> 04:07.880
Good. You're measuring up
to the family standards.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.880
You could make an acceptable
sister, physically at least.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.040
Cellphone!

04:13.840 --> 04:15.920
You'll have to change the case.
Not enough gold or diamonds.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.680
Aaah! What are those?

04:20.280 --> 04:23.160
See these? These shoes are life.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.160
And in life
there are winners and losers.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.200
Winners have their perfect
little feet in these shoes,

04:29.200 --> 04:32.600
while losers
get crushed under the soles.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.800
So, you want 'em?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.080
Ah, ah, ah!

04:36.080 --> 04:37.440
If you wanna be a winner

04:37.440 --> 04:38.800
and be part of this family,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.440
you're gonna
have to earn your place.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.760
But don't worry.
I'll be your mentor!

04:42.760 --> 04:45.120
And if you prove worthy enough
to be my sister,

04:45.120 --> 04:48.600
well, then, maybe
I'll let you borrow my shoes.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.320
Rule number one.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.800
Your father only exists

04:51.800 --> 04:53.040
to give you everything you want,

04:53.040 --> 04:54.320
whenever you want.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.200
‐ Daddy!
‐

04:57.200 --> 04:59.560
I want the limo painted pink
before I go to school.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.480
Huh? What? But, sweetheart...

05:02.280 --> 05:04.720
Since your father isn't here,
you'll use mine!

05:04.720 --> 05:06.920
If you become my sister,
of course.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.640
Rule number two. You need
a minion. Where's yours?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.200
Uh... I left them in New York!

05:12.200 --> 05:13.720
Fatal mistake!

05:13.720 --> 05:15.200
You never go anywhere
without them!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.080
Don't confuse a minion
for a patsy.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.520
I'll teach you later.
A minion is someone

05:20.520 --> 05:22.120
who does everything for you.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.960
Aren't you done
with that homework?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.720
Sorry! It's taking me longer
'cause it's so dark in here,

05:26.720 --> 05:29.640
but now my eyes are used to
having no light it'll go faster!

05:30.400 --> 05:34.240
Now, a patsy is there to suffer
for your own entertainment.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.640
If you're good enough,
a patsy can last you a lifetime.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.080
I have an old one, but
it hasn't been working so well

05:39.080 --> 05:41.560
since I became a superhero.
I got too soft.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.520
She's yours if you can do
something with her!

05:51.120 --> 05:53.880
Another super important rule,
number 72.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.640
All the boys have to be
crazy about you!

05:56.640 --> 05:59.760
Carrying your schoolbag should
be the highlight of their day.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.200
Not you.
Not you either... or you.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.000
But you can shine my shoes
in your dreams tonight! You!

06:06.080 --> 06:07.160
Here.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.120
Sorry!

06:13.640 --> 06:14.880
Hey, you nobodies!

06:14.880 --> 06:16.760
Stop your chatter
for a minute

06:16.760 --> 06:18.480
and listen up! This is...

06:18.480 --> 06:20.000
Uh, what's your name again?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.520
Zoé.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.200
We'll buy you a new name later.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.040
This is Zoé. She's only
my half‐sister for now,

06:27.040 --> 06:30.800
but you must still treat her
with respect. So, bow down...

06:30.800 --> 06:33.880
uh, I mean, give her the welcome
her status deserves!

06:34.160 --> 06:36.840
Her sister? Chloé has a sister?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.520
Hopefully, she's less horrible!

06:38.520 --> 06:40.880
Relax, girls,
I met her at the bakery earlier.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.640
She's totally
nothing like Chloé!

06:42.640 --> 06:44.280
She's actually really nice!
And besides,

06:44.640 --> 06:46.400
why make judgements
about people

06:46.400 --> 06:48.040
before we know them?

06:48.960 --> 06:52.040
‐ Hey, what's up, man!
‐ Ah! Rule number 148.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.280
You need a guy BFF
to wrap around your finger,

06:54.280 --> 06:56.240
preferably gorgeous and rich.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.240
That one over there, is mine.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.760
Adrikins!
He's the best there is.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.520
So keep your hands off,
you hear?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.240
We'll find you
a less handsome one,

07:04.240 --> 07:06.080
because you're less pretty than me.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.200
Ah! Here comes the patsy
I mentioned.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.560
If you can do a number on her,

07:10.560 --> 07:12.440
then I'll make you
my <i>real</i> sister!

07:12.440 --> 07:16.120
Watch and learn. Still
loafing around, Dupain‐Cheng?

07:16.120 --> 07:19.040
Loaf!
She's a baker's daughter.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.360
‐ Get it? Ha, ha, ha!
‐ Hey, Zoé.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.520
What'd you think
about the macaroons? Good, huh?

07:23.520 --> 07:27.640
‐ What? You know Dupain‐Cheng?
‐ Yeah, we've met.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.600
This clueless klutz
knocked me down.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.600
So she gave me some super,
uh, disgusting macaroons,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.680
trying to make up for it.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.000
But since I have good taste,
I threw them out.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.240
Can I do your homework?

07:44.200 --> 07:46.200
Find a spot, find a spot.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.680
Mid‐year admission
is not so easy!

07:48.680 --> 07:51.280
‐ There's a lot of paperwork ‐‐
‐ Rule number 38.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.720
Would you like me
to call my stepfather

07:53.720 --> 07:55.680
and let him know
how useless you've been?

07:56.080 --> 07:58.680
So useless that this school
would surely run

07:58.680 --> 08:01.480
‐ just as well without you!
‐ Uh...

08:01.480 --> 08:04.040
May I introduce
your new schoolmate, Zoé!

08:04.040 --> 08:06.520
Please obey... I mean,
give her a warm welcome!

08:08.280 --> 08:10.760
I don't understand.
When I met her this morning,

08:10.760 --> 08:12.760
‐ she was so nice!
‐ That's just crazy!

08:12.760 --> 08:14.640
Chloé's influence is so toxic

08:14.640 --> 08:17.160
that she's corrupted
her sister in a few hours?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.200
‐ Let's get her out of there!
‐ Who'll take her in?

08:19.200 --> 08:22.280
‐ Can we adopt her?
‐ Let's just talk to her first.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.640
I'll handle it.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.240
Needs improvement,
but not such a bad start!

08:28.240 --> 08:30.680
As a reward, I'll let you
touch my diamond shoes

08:30.680 --> 08:33.200
‐ when we're home.
‐ Thank you?

08:33.640 --> 08:35.160
See you later!

08:38.520 --> 08:41.360
Why did she become so nasty
when she was so nice before?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.840
Maybe she was... hungry?

08:43.840 --> 08:46.480
I'm sure the real Zoé
is the one I met the first time.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.400
I hope I can get
to the bottom of this.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.720
As long as you're acting with
kindness, you can't go wrong.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.600
No, no!

08:58.560 --> 09:01.560
<i>I can tell that something is
keeping you from being yourself</i>

09:01.560 --> 09:04.440
<i>If it's Chloé, we can talk
about it tonight if you want.</i>

09:04.440 --> 09:06.480
<i>You're still welcome
to come to the barge.</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:10.280
‐ Ridiculous!
‐ "Sorry, I'll explain tonight."

09:12.520 --> 09:15.880
Are you texting Dupain‐Cheng?
I warned you!

09:15.880 --> 09:18.280
Either you walk over people
or I walk over you.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.640
Either you're proud
to be a part of <i>my</i> family,

09:21.640 --> 09:25.000
and walk in my footsteps,
or you clear out!

09:25.000 --> 09:28.640
Are you through? This is
all just part of my plan.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.560
I tricked her
into thinking I'm her friend

09:30.960 --> 09:32.440
and tonight on the barge,
I'll throw

09:32.440 --> 09:34.280
her macaroons
into the Seine

09:34.280 --> 09:35.880
in front
of all her friends.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.800
Total humiliation!

09:37.800 --> 09:40.840
Oh! Brilliant!
Utterly brilliant!

09:40.840 --> 09:43.360
So, how about stick a wad
of chewing gum on her chair?

09:43.360 --> 09:44.560
No! Done that!

09:44.560 --> 09:45.800
Oh! Get her punished

09:45.800 --> 09:46.720
for something she didn't do?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.200
Too easy.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.480
Roaches!
Roaches in her locker!

09:51.480 --> 09:53.360
Yes! How amazing am I?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.280
Hey, where are you going?

09:55.120 --> 09:57.200
I'm going
to try them on outside.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
I want to see the diamonds
sparkle in the sunlight.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.080
Is everything OK, Zoé?

10:16.120 --> 10:19.320
When I was young, I wanted
to make movies, tell stories...

10:19.320 --> 10:22.080
Ah! That was the real me!

10:22.080 --> 10:25.000
But it was made very clear to me
that in order to earn my place,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.280
I had to let certain dreams go.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.120
What about you?
What are your dreams?

10:30.120 --> 10:34.520
At first I... I wanted to be
an actress. I'm good at acting.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.640
Then I found myself
acting all the time,

10:36.640 --> 10:40.480
trying to please everyone,
until I couldn't do it anymore.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.000
I just want to be accepted
for being me, the real me.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.040
And now it's happening
all over again. I just can't.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.480
Let me show you something.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.960
I call this my cellar of dreams!

10:53.960 --> 10:55.600
It can be lonely
when even your own family

10:55.600 --> 10:57.480
can't accept you.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.200
We end up burying our feelings

10:59.200 --> 11:02.000
deep, here and here.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.800
If you want, I can make
some space for you.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.760
<i>I warned you!
Either you walk over people</i>

11:08.760 --> 11:10.040
<i>or I walk over you.</i>

11:19.640 --> 11:22.440
Never being accepted
by your loved ones,

11:22.440 --> 11:26.000
travelling across the ocean
only to be rejected once again!

11:26.520 --> 11:28.960
Welcome to Paris, Mademoiselle.

11:34.400 --> 11:39.160
Fly away my little akuma,
and evilize that fragile heart.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.640
Sole Crusher, I am Shadow Moth.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.520
Your sister challenges you
to measure up to her?

11:57.520 --> 12:00.920
I give you the power
to crush her soul instead!

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
From now on, every person you
crush will make you stronger.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.680
They'll be crushed
under the soles of my shoes,

12:07.680 --> 12:08.640
all the same!

12:09.040 --> 12:10.720
All I ask for in return

12:10.720 --> 12:13.240
are Ladybug and Cat Noir's
Miraculous.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.640
Start walking, Sole Crusher!

12:17.800 --> 12:18.720
No!

12:23.600 --> 12:26.880
‐ Mademoiselle... Chloé?
‐ Wrong, John‐Something!

12:26.880 --> 12:28.520
I am Sole Crusher!

12:43.280 --> 12:47.240
Hey! How come you're using my
image without my authorization?

12:47.240 --> 12:49.800
The student
has become the master, Chloé,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.840
and now I'm going to crush you!

12:51.840 --> 12:52.960
Zoé?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
‐ Hey! That's our cab!
‐ Not anymore!

12:58.200 --> 12:58.960
Hey!

13:02.440 --> 13:04.560
Hey, you!
Watch where you put your feet!

13:06.600 --> 13:07.960
Chloé!

13:08.920 --> 13:10.400
You! Hide me!

13:14.640 --> 13:15.880
Quick, hide!

13:18.480 --> 13:20.040
Chloé? What's going on?

13:20.040 --> 13:22.200
Don't just sit there!
Help me block this door!

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
Found you!

13:26.280 --> 13:26.920
Aaah!

13:28.440 --> 13:31.280
‐ Who are you?
‐ I'm Sole Crusher!

13:32.080 --> 13:34.000
You can't escape me!

13:35.600 --> 13:38.400
Kaalki! Teleport to Plagg!
We'll need Cat Noir's help!

13:38.400 --> 13:40.480
Are you sure?
You know how dangerous it is?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.920
We have no choice! Hurry!
I'll look for Marinette!

13:43.440 --> 13:44.360
Voyage!

13:48.840 --> 13:50.960
‐ My cheese!
‐ There's a villain in Paris,

13:50.960 --> 13:53.200
and the Guardian
can't take care of it!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.920
Sorry, Mr. Noir,
about your room.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.200
Don't worry. Ladybug
will fix everything later.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.880
Plagg! Claws out!

14:07.200 --> 14:08.720
Chloé...

14:17.040 --> 14:20.640
If you want to be my sister,
if you want to be like me,

14:20.640 --> 14:23.200
then I'm not the one
you should crush. They are!

14:23.200 --> 14:26.080
Those losers! Otherwise,
you'll go back to New York!

14:26.080 --> 14:27.840
You may be bigger,
but you're still just

14:27.840 --> 14:29.760
a ridiculous copy of me!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.480
‐ Utterly ridiculous!
‐ That's not true.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.320
You don't have to crush anyone.
There are no winners or losers!

14:36.320 --> 14:39.760
There's just people, with their
differences and individualities!

14:39.760 --> 14:41.800
Did someone start off
on the wrong foot?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.000
I'm not finished!

14:43.000 --> 14:44.800
Zoé, no one will judge you here!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.080
You can just be yourself.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.600
You might trip, you might fall.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.240
Someone will always help you up.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.600
I'll always be there for you.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.680
Sole Crusher, I can sense
that you're weakening.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.160
You wouldn't want me
to remove your powers

14:56.160 --> 14:58.080
and leave you stuck
with the losers, would you?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.320
No one
will tell me what to do!

15:00.320 --> 15:01.120
No!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.440
Aaah!

15:11.880 --> 15:14.760
‐ Marinette!
‐ You followed me? Way to go!

15:16.400 --> 15:18.280
Tikki, spots on!

15:18.280 --> 15:18.960
Yeah!

15:33.760 --> 15:35.320
The big fall the hardest.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.520
‐ Sorry, I got held up!
‐ Grr!

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
We're not getting anywhere!
I might have to cataclysm her

15:58.800 --> 16:01.280
‐ before she destroys the city!
‐ No way!

16:01.280 --> 16:03.920
We don't know what would happen!
It could be fatal!

16:04.720 --> 16:06.320
Lucky charm!

16:11.440 --> 16:13.960
A shoe horn?
Of course.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.960
The akuma
must be hiding in her shoes!

16:15.960 --> 16:17.720
Let me trip her up a bit,
Milady.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.800
‐ Cataclysm!
‐

16:29.280 --> 16:30.920
Where is the akuma?

16:30.920 --> 16:33.200
Even as a supervillain
you're still a loser!

16:33.640 --> 16:35.360
Just look
at how you're treating my shoes!

16:36.040 --> 16:38.120
Go back to your sad,
ugly sneakers!

16:38.120 --> 16:41.960
Why, when I finally know what
it's like to be in your shoes?

16:41.960 --> 16:44.520
Sneakers? What if the akuma
wasn't in these shoes,

16:44.520 --> 16:47.440
but in the sneakers Chloé
was talking about? Follow me!

16:47.440 --> 16:48.600
I'm right on your heels!

16:50.320 --> 16:53.520
If Chloé lent her those shoes,
the sneakers must be here.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.080
Five more minutes!
I'm almost done!

16:56.080 --> 16:57.880
Where are
Chloé's sister's sneakers?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.360
Huh? What? I don't know!

17:00.080 --> 17:02.920
‐ She must have her own room.
‐ Ladybug! Cat Noir!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.160
You'll save us again, won't you?

17:04.560 --> 17:06.240
‐ Mr. Mayor?
‐ I hid in here

17:06.240 --> 17:08.360
when I witnessed poor little Zoé
getting akumatized.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.520
You saw everything?

17:10.520 --> 17:12.040
Do you know
where her sneakers are?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.560
Isn't it strange Sole Crusher
didn't follow us here?

17:16.240 --> 17:17.080
Let's make a run for it.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.640
Promise you won't tell
my wife about this.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.160
You can't measure up to me!

17:26.560 --> 17:29.200
I'm going to crush you all!

17:31.840 --> 17:33.280
Of course.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.800
No more evil‐doing for you,
little akuma.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.560
Time to de‐evilize!

17:54.040 --> 17:54.760
Gotcha!

17:56.400 --> 17:57.760
Bye‐bye, little butterfly!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.680
Miraculous Ladybug!

18:10.280 --> 18:11.000
‐ Pound it!
‐ Pound it!

18:18.920 --> 18:20.400
This is a magical charm, Zoé.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.360
With it, Shadow Moth
can't get to you any longer.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.040
Keep it with you to remember
what you overcame today.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.520
Thank you, Ladybug!
You really are Miraculous!

18:30.120 --> 18:31.080
Bug out!

18:35.240 --> 18:36.960
You may run fast, Ladybug,

18:37.560 --> 18:39.920
but I will have you at my feet
one day.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.320
And then I will crush you!

18:57.120 --> 18:57.960
Welcome aboard, Zoé!

18:58.640 --> 19:00.880
Zoé's about to toss
Dupain‐Cheng's macaroons

19:00.880 --> 19:02.880
into the Seine!
It'll be spectacular!

19:02.880 --> 19:04.400
Let me introduce you
to everyone.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.640
Guys, this is Zoé! She just
arrived here from New York.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.600
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi!

19:09.600 --> 19:11.560
‐ Hello!
‐ I'm...

19:11.560 --> 19:14.000
really sorry about today.
I thought that if I did

19:14.000 --> 19:15.640
everything Chloé wanted me to,

19:15.640 --> 19:18.040
she'd accept me.
I just wanted to meet

19:18.040 --> 19:20.400
my family's expectations,
which is why I left New York

19:20.400 --> 19:22.800
in the first place.
At the boarding school

19:22.800 --> 19:24.840
I was playing a part,
being someone else,

19:24.840 --> 19:26.560
hoping they'd accept me.

19:26.560 --> 19:29.320
But finally,
I just couldn't anymore.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.160
That's when everyone
turned against me.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.720
And then one day
I found roaches in my locker.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.320
They all said I was a loser.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.720
Maybe they were right.
I get that I'm different.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.880
And I'd understand if you guys
didn't want me as a friend.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.640
We're all one big happy family!

19:46.640 --> 19:47.680
You'll be fine with us!

19:48.760 --> 19:51.240
You'll never have to leave
again, Zoé. Welcome to Paris.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.680
Wait. Wait. What is she doing?

19:54.680 --> 19:56.480
Ew! Don't eat that!

19:56.480 --> 19:58.080
You'll get infected
with their lameness!

19:58.480 --> 19:59.920
I order you to fire her!

20:09.240 --> 20:11.960
Daddy! Order her
to return my shoes at once!

20:13.800 --> 20:14.960
And I demand that she be sent

20:14.960 --> 20:16.680
back to New York immediately,

20:16.680 --> 20:17.800
exactly the way she came!

20:17.800 --> 20:20.040
Of course, of course.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.200
‐ However...
‐ Is there a problem, André?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.160
Well, what I mean is,
with all the paperwork needed

20:25.160 --> 20:27.040
to enroll her in another school,

20:27.040 --> 20:29.000
we won't be rid of her
for months!

20:29.000 --> 20:31.160
Maybe we could just...
put her somewhere else?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.360
‐ In the cellar.
‐ Excellent idea.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.960
Or at least, in a room
in another wing of the hotel!

20:36.960 --> 20:38.600
Well,
a smaller room than mine!

20:38.600 --> 20:40.360
Oh, of course! Minuscule!

20:40.360 --> 20:41.720
Barely the size
of a junior suite!

20:42.120 --> 20:44.400
And see to it
that we never cross paths again!

20:44.760 --> 20:47.040
She'll take the service elevator
with the staff!

20:48.200 --> 20:51.600
Thank you! Promise me that you
won't leave your dreams too long

20:51.600 --> 20:55.120
‐ down in that cellar.
‐ I promise. Come on.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.560
You're going to love
your new room.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.400
Zoé sent me a text!
"Thank you for everything!

21:04.400 --> 21:06.520
You were right.
I can be myself here,

21:07.320 --> 21:09.720
'cause you and the others
will always be there for me.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.480
For the first time in my life,
I actually feel at home!"
