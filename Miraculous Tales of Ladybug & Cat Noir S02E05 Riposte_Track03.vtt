&lrm;Marinette!
&lrm;This is quite a special day for you.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.780
&lrm;Yes, Tikki, it sure is!

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.740
&lrm;Hmm. Still no call.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.380
&lrm;There's a ritual
&lrm;we kwamis perform on a day like this.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.940
&lrm;Oh! Really? That's nice!

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.460
&lrm;But I don't know
&lrm;if you humans would like it.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.900
&lrm;I wonder if you guys even give each other
&lrm;presents on your birthday.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.540
&lrm;Oh! Really, Tikki?
&lrm;You got me a birthday present?

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.100
&lrm;-A kwami specialty.
&lrm;-Oh, that's so awesome! What it is?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.100
&lrm;[sings]

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.100
&lrm;Miraculous birthday, Marinette!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.780
&lrm;Ugh!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.860
&lrm;-Oh, no! You don't like it, do you?
&lrm;-Yes, yes! I love it!

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.780
&lrm;It's amazing, it's... What is it?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.700
&lrm;A kwagatama! A great symbol of friendship
&lrm;among us kwamis!

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.980
&lrm;We take a hair from our Miraculous holder,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.860
&lrm;and join it to the hairs
&lrm;of all former Miraculous holders

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.860
&lrm;and, with them, we grow a magic resin
&lrm;for a few months and...

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.020
&lrm;I know you don't want to tell me
&lrm;not to hurt my feelings,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.140
&lrm;but it's obvious you don't like it.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.620
&lrm;I'm sorry, Tikki! I really love your gift!
&lrm;It's just that...

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.660
&lrm;Alya should have called me by now!

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.700
&lrm;We're supposed to be taking her little
&lrm;sisters to the dentist at four o'clock!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.260
&lrm;Do you humans always celebrate
&lrm;your birthday by going to the dentist?

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.660
&lrm;No, of course not, Tikki!
&lrm;It's a secret code!

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.580
&lrm;They're throwing me
&lrm;a surprise birthday party!

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.860
&lrm;But how can it be a surprise,
&lrm;if you know about it?

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.060
&lrm;You know about the surprise,
&lrm;but you pretend you don't,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.540
&lrm;so you won't spoil it
&lrm;for those organising it!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.180
&lrm;-What about the dentist?
&lrm;-It's a fake-out!

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.940
&lrm;See, Alya's gonna pretend
&lrm;to take me to the dentist's,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
&lrm;but she'll&lrm;<i> really</i>&lrm; be taking me
&lrm;to my surprise party!

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.420
&lrm;But what if you're wrong?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.220
&lrm;Impossible!
&lrm;All the signs are there, Tikki!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.620
&lrm;<i>Juleka jumped when I caught her</i>
&lrm;<i>holding a bicycle pump!</i>

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.100
&lrm;-Perhaps Juleka has a bicycle?
&lrm;-No, Tikki!

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.340
&lrm;Obviously, she was planning
&lrm;to use the pump to blow up balloons!

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.940
&lrm;A surprise birthday party always
&lrm;has balloons!

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.460
&lrm;Also, yesterday, I caught Nino
&lrm;listening to&lrm;<i> my</i>&lrm; favourite song!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.460
&lrm;Perhaps it's his favourite song too?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.060
&lrm;Are you kidding? He hates it! He has
&lrm;no reason to listen to it unless...

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.860
&lrm;he's making a playlist
&lrm;for my surprise party! Elementary!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.260
&lrm;OK. If you don't believe me, why was Alya
&lrm;having a secret convo with Adrien, huh?

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.540
&lrm;Yes, Alya, I know a very good dentist
&lrm;and here's his number!

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.860
&lrm;Which means he's going to be there!

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
&lrm;Or it means Alya is taking her sisters
&lrm;to see Adrien's dentist!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.140
&lrm;Ugh! Fine. You know what?
&lrm;There's one no-fail way to find out

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.460
&lrm;if there's a surprise party in the making!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.740
&lrm;Watch their faces.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.980
&lrm;Mom! Dad! Do you know anything about
&lrm;Alya planning a party for my birthday?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.100
&lrm;Uh...

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.300
&lrm;Oh! Party? Uh... what party?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.420
&lrm;Uh, which Alya again?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.580
&lrm;You're overdoing it.
&lrm;We're talking about her best friend!

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.820
&lrm;Alya! Of course! Alya!
&lrm;We haven't seen her in years!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.980

&lrm;[groans]

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.180
&lrm;See? Parents always know
&lrm;when there's a surprise party!

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.740
&lrm;[door bell rings]

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.420
&lrm;And now, on the other side of this door,
&lrm;check out who's coming to get me,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.140
&lrm;just in time for the party. It's...

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.020
&lrm;Grandma?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.940
&lrm;-Mom?
&lrm;-Gina?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.100
&lrm;Marinetta! You're so tall for your age!
&lrm;Did you get my letter from Patagonia?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.020
&lrm;Yes. And the ones from Australia,
&lrm;Bali and Estonia, too!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.540
&lrm;-Did you really get chased by a bear?
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha!

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.340
&lrm;Yes, but we wound up
&lrm;good friends in the end!

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.500
&lrm;-Mom, it's her birthday, remember?
&lrm;-Why do you think I'm here?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.380
&lrm;Happy birthday, my fairy!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.660
&lrm;My Inuit friend knitted it
&lrm;especially for your tenth birthday!

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.420
&lrm;-Uh... She's 14.
&lrm;-My! How time flies!

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.940
&lrm;That's OK. I'll ask my friends
&lrm;to make another one.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.340
&lrm;No, no, it's... awesome! I can make this
&lrm;work. It's perfect, Grandma. Thank you!

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.300
&lrm;Ah! Your nonna has also brought you
&lrm;your favourite candy!

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.300
&lrm;Oh! [nervous laugh]

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.380
&lrm;-You still love them, right?
&lrm;-Yes, yes, of course!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.700
&lrm;And that's not all, my fairy!
&lrm;We'll have a wonderful day, you and I,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.580
&lrm;just like the last time!
&lrm;We'll go to the merry-go-round,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.980
&lrm;-then to the zoo, then...
&lrm;-Uh... Mom? Can I have a word, Mom?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.940
&lrm;-Just the two of us?
&lrm;-What, Tom?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.140
&lrm;That I don't know Marinetta
&lrm;any more 'cause I'm always away?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.980
&lrm;No, Mom, it's just...

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.340
&lrm;You think she doesn't want to spend time
&lrm;with her nonna, is that it?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.060
&lrm;No! Of course
&lrm;I want to spend time with you!

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.540
&lrm;-Besides, it's not four o'clock yet!
&lrm;-There. You see?

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.860
&lrm;Come on, let's go, Marinetta!
&lrm;We're going to have a ball!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.140
&lrm;It's four o'clock. Maybe you were right.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.620
&lrm;I jumped to conclusions
&lrm;and there really is no surprise party.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.860
&lrm;Why don't you tell your grandmother
&lrm;you don't like this candy?

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.700
&lrm;Not to hurt her feelings.
&lrm;We don't see each other often.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.220
&lrm;-[phone rings]
&lrm;-Aaah! Alya!

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.100
&lrm;Sorry, I'm running late.
&lrm;Can you meet me at the park?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.260
&lrm;We'll jam straight from there
&lrm;to the... uh... dentist!

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.820
&lrm;Yes... yes, awesome! "To the dentist".
&lrm;Totally! I'll be right there!

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.060
&lrm;Oh! I'm so sorry, Grandma.
&lrm;I have to go to the dentist with Alya.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.100
&lrm;Surely you're not going to the dentist
&lrm;on your birthday?

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.260
&lrm;I still have to take you to see
&lrm;the trains at the station!

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.100
&lrm;Well, it's because Alya
&lrm;has sisters who are twins and

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.740
&lrm;as there are two of them,
&lrm;Alya needs my help and...

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.300
&lrm;Wait. What am I saying?
&lrm;That's all a fake out!

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.260
&lrm;You know what I think? Alya might
&lrm;be throwing me a surprise birthday party.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.740
&lrm;I get it, my fairy! Don't worry about me.
&lrm;Run along, now, and go meet your friend!

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.860
&lrm;-Are you sure?
&lrm;-Go on. I'll hold on to all this.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.300
&lrm;-We'll catch up later.
&lrm;-Thank you!

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.420
&lrm;You really&lrm;<i> are</i>
&lrm;the best grandma in the world!

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.820
&lrm;Tom! That's the motorcycle. They're
&lrm;coming back! Marinette can't see the cake!

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.180
&lrm;-Uh... Where's Marinette?
&lrm;-Tom was right.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.900
&lrm;She's too old now
&lrm;to spend time with her nonna.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.500
&lrm;What? No, no, Tom never said that!

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.220
&lrm;That's sweet of you, Sabine,
&lrm;but it's not a big deal. That's life!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.820
&lrm;I'll be up in the apartment
&lrm;if you need me.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.860
&lrm;You should go and speak to your mother.
&lrm;She's... Oh, no!

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.300
&lrm;I know!
&lrm;And it's almost time for the party!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.060
&lrm;OK. I'll help you. We can manage!
&lrm;And we'll take Gina to the party with us.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.180
&lrm;What could be more powerful than
&lrm;a grandmother who has been deserted?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.420
&lrm;Perfect fodder for disappointment
&lrm;and misunderstanding.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.420
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her ailing heart!

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.500
&lrm;You will use these candies to reward
&lrm;the deserving and punish the ungrateful!

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.700
&lrm;As for my reward,
&lrm;you will bring me the Miraculous

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.500
&lrm;of those pesky little kids,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.140
&lrm;You're right, Hawk Moth. The time
&lrm;has come to teach them all a lesson!

&lrm;So now, tell me. Marinette
&lrm;isn't at the dentist, is she?

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.700
&lrm;-No, Mistress.
&lrm;-Then take me to her.

&lrm;-You lied to your grandma, Marinetta.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.500
&lrm;No, I... I didn't know Alya
&lrm;was throwing a surprise party for me.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.900
&lrm;-She's for real, ma'am.
&lrm;-And all those candies

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.620
&lrm;you pretended to be eating?

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.780
&lrm;I'm sorry, Grandma. It's just that
&lrm;I didn't want to upset you.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.380
&lrm;I'm not your grandma any more.

&lrm;No!

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.940
&lrm;We didn't even get in on the buffet!

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.060
&lrm;The party's over, my friend!
&lrm;Plagg... claws out!

&lrm;It's rude to leave

&lrm;Hey! I never knew
&lrm;grandmas could be so nasty!

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.980
&lrm;You'll look wonderful in white,
&lrm;my pretty kitty!

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.420
&lrm;Not convinced. I'm much more into black.
&lrm;Makes my eyes stand out, don't you think?

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.700
&lrm;Take care of this pesky pussycat!

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.180
&lrm;Hey! I thought fairies
&lrm;were supposed to be nice!

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.220
&lrm;You're not getting away unpunished,
&lrm;Marinetta!

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.580
&lrm;You don't deserve all these presents,
&lrm;you spoiled brat!

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.100
&lrm;Now for what you really deserve...

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.420
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;You'll get what's coming to you!

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.820
&lrm;This isn't how I envisioned
&lrm;my birthday party!

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.660
&lrm;You need to transform!

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.820
&lrm;-Do you lie only to me?
&lrm;-Cat Noir!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.540
&lrm;Stay put. I'll be right there!

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.860
&lrm;Uh... Soon!

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.620
&lrm;Or do you also lie to your parents,
&lrm;and your friends, too?

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.540
&lrm;-We gotta help Marinette!
&lrm;-Yeah.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.180
&lrm;The time has come to teach you a lesson!

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.500
&lrm;-Marinette is not a liar!
&lrm;-Someone has to teach you table manners.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.780
&lrm;Alya!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.860
&lrm;No, Kim!

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.460
&lrm;That's what you get for stealing candy,
&lrm;you bunch of ill-mannered kids!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.060
&lrm;Don't touch Marinette! She's only
&lrm;the nicest person in the world!

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.420
&lrm;Hmm. It's very disrespectful
&lrm;to speak up without permission.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.660
&lrm;But it's quite noble of you
&lrm;to stick up for your friends.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.860
&lrm;OK, I shall make you... a fairy!

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.380
&lrm;You are going to help me
&lrm;discipline your friend! Ha, ha, ha!

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.300
&lrm;Tikki...

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.980
&lrm;Sorry I kept you waiting.
&lrm;We need to find you a better hiding place.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.980
&lrm;Marinetta's getting away with the kitty!
&lrm;Catch them!

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.860
&lrm;Marinette is cool, so don't touch her!

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.980
&lrm;-We won't let you hurt Marinette!
&lrm;-Is that how you speak to your elders?

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.860
&lrm;How rude!

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.340
&lrm;Maybe this way,
&lrm;you'll learn to keep quiet.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.060
&lrm;You must be real cool if all your friends
&lrm;are protecting you like that!

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.900
&lrm;-Why's your grandma flipping out?
&lrm;-She wanted me around more.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.220
&lrm;Don't worry.
&lrm;I'll get your real grandma back.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.940
&lrm;Oh, I almost forgot.
&lrm;Happy Birthday, anyway.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.460

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.140
&lrm;The candy bag! The akuma must be in there.

&lrm;OK, you win, Befana.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.340
&lrm;I did lie. I'm sorry.
&lrm;Your granddaughter is here.

&lrm;Never too late to tell the truth, right?

&lrm;-Phew!
&lrm;-What is the meaning of this?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.660
&lrm;-She isn't here!
&lrm;-I guess I'm a compulsive liar.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.860
&lrm;There you are! Nice try, Marinetta!
&lrm;But she won't get away that easily!

&lrm;Don't worry, Cat Noir. Marinette is safe.

&lrm;I'm waiting for you, Marinetta!

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.260
&lrm;What?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.020

&lrm;you've escaped punishment yet again!

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.380
&lrm;Do you have anyone in particular
&lrm;to share your ice cream with?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.820
&lrm;Well, actually, I have yet to find

&lrm;I fixed it up. I've been sewing
&lrm;since the last time you came to visit.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.580
&lrm;You're so grown up, Marinette.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.820
&lrm;You know what? There'll be
&lrm;no more merry-go-rounds or zoos.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.300

&lrm;I'll take you on one of my trips!

&lrm;I mean, I'll wear the charm!

&lrm;With luck... uh...
&lrm;Basically, uh... Thank you?

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.380
&lrm;Aw!

&lrm;No weirder than yours, Tikki!

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.620
&lrm;But that doesn't mean
&lrm;they're not both precious to me.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.260
&lrm;-So, you really did like the gift, then?
&lrm;-Of course I did!

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.100
&lrm;The most important thing about a present,
&lrm;Tikki, is the person who's giving it.
