00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.920
[Episode 2]

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.520
What do you want?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.660
I just want to take this body to repay

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.200
for what you did last night.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.020
No need!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.380
Do you really not need this?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.540
What kind of prank is this?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.400
Hello, Phuc.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.660
Who are you?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.660
Duy, Thach's younger brother.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.880
When did you get back?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.040
Just recently.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.060
Where are you planning to stay?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.020
Here, of course.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.980
You're hiring a male domestic helper?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.220
Linh brought him to me.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.180
I thought when she saw you like this,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.760
she would have run so far away.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.600
She wants me to sign the restaurant transference.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.220
Can you leave the room and let us talk for a while?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.620
You haven't said sorry to me...

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.660
Why do I have to?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.040
What did my brother do to you?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.860
He groped me! He even pinched...

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.640
You're wasting my time with that tiny thing.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.180
What? Tiny thing?

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340
He tried to r*pe and then k*ll me!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.580
Are you a girl?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.700
You have multiple personalities?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.440
Do not try to cross the line.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.080
This kid!

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.540
He's kinda interesting, huh?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.180
Perverse, stubborn,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.720
and his words are uncivil. What kind of interesting? 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.040
You'll see.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.900
Don't talk nonsense.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.980
What did you do to him?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920
I've told you already.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.140
You'll find him interesting.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.680
How are your legs?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.480
Are they hurt?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.680
I can walk normally.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.000
I think you need physical therapy.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.860
It's painful enough for the eyes.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.040
I know.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.320
Have you eaten?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.680
No, I haven't.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.280
I planned to eat at the restaurant.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.800
You should go early. Take your time.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.180
Then, I'll go now.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.220
Brother.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.360
You are my only relative, you know?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.800
Do what you want but put your health first.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.660
Hello!

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.420
Actually, I'm also your boss, little brother.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.980
Who is your brother? 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.660
You're such a mean mouth!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.620
How is it?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.480
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.820
But, tell me.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.720
You were really enjoying it, weren't you?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.040
Stop talking nonsense!

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.640
What?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.640
Who were in your dream?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.880
Was that my elder brother?

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.780
Hey!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.780
Hold on!

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.940
Use words only, not violence!

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.880
Mess around somewhere else!

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.120
So annoying!

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.520
Hey boy! Come here!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.520
Your boss is calling you.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.260
He can't even remember my name!

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.100
What is it?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.000
Even a child knows how to use subjects and predicates.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.340
Do you have a goldfish brain? You can't even remember my name!

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.740
What's your name?

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.760
Oh gosh!

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.540
You really don't remember it?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.440
Why do I have to?

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.080
Okay!

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.400
Just keep it that way!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.340
Maybe tomorrow there will be tons of ones

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.540
who will take your orders!

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.720
You're the most perverse one. There's no the second one. 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.960
Who's perverse?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.240
Why did you keep throwing it carelessly?

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.560
Did you take all of them at once?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.000
Are you crazy?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.620
Open your mouth!

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.500
I can't see anything.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.480
Spit it out! Spit!

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.840
You like me, don't you?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.400
You're overconfident!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.240
I am never wrong.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.900
Now you are!

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.360
"Thump."

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.820
"Thump!"

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.300
"Thump."

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.720
"Thump!"

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.720
Do you have any words to justify that?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.820
Hey!

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.660
If you weren't my boss, I would have punched you in the face!

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.060
Self-overconfidence can lead to self-killing!

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.500
Open the door!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.980
Open it!

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.060
Phuc!

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.000
You remembered my name now, huh?

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.660
But I won't do that!

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.720
Open the door.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.980
Open it!

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.940
Phuc!

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.660
Why's he so quiet?

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.220
Are... Are you okay?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.560
Why did you suddenly fall?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.660
It's your fault!

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.080
Why was it my fault?

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.860
Why did you close the door?

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.520
I was polite! I had to close it when I went out!

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.680
But we don't, in this house. Got it?

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.640
No.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.580
This kid!

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.300
What happened to your legs?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.260
You look extremely pale with the pain!

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.840
I haven't done anything!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.640
I'm okay.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.120
Hey! Don't think I'm gentle that you can bully me!

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.500
I'm sorry. Okay?

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.860
I can make soup with your legs.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.880
Not funny.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.000
Hey, do you have any therapy

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.300
or take pills?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.200
I think you can't underestimate this.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.800
You don't need to care about it.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.000
Will you die if someone cares about you?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.180
Yes. I'll die of shame.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.620
What happened, brother?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.340
I'm fine.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.260
Why do you have to hide it?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.500
You should get physical therapy.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.400
You can't leave it for too long.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.100
Now, you're on an outsider's side?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.320
Hey! Can you say something less harsh?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.720
Whatever you say, I won't agree with that.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.980
I'm not a busybody,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.980
but I can't just stand there and see you dying.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.220
Try to stand as usual!

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.320
Trust yourself.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.600
It's okay.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.300
Put the stick away.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.400
Let me hold it.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.440
You can do it.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.120
Won't you steal my stick? 

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.380
Do I look like I will need that?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.420
You think I can look?

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.580
I mean that I'm an honest person.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.980
Give it to me.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.580
Okay.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.980
Very good.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.720
You can do it.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.180
I don't want to do it.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.760
What's wrong?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.420
You're doing well!

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.860
You call that walking?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.420
Can you find someone else walking like me?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.300
There's no one who's both blind and lame!

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.840
You tell me.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.100
You can't heal something that is already broken!

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.500
You know nothing!

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.340
You all know nothing!

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.560
I understand what you're feeling.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.500
But you won't know if you don't try.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.520
The key thing is to get up after you fall.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.500
I believe you can make it.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.820
Just stand up.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.280
Please stand up.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.700
I told you...

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.920
I believe you can do it.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.840
Stand up, brother.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.560
Just need to stand up.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.400
Get your hands off me. I can do this.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.740
Is that you, Duy?

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.380
Yes.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.880
It's for you.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.380
Huh, why do you give this to me?

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.720
How can I do anything when I'm like this?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.520
Sign it.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.180
It's all yours now.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.780
No, I won't!

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.720
What's wrong?

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.940
Don't want it?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.940
There'll be so much pressure.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.580
I want to work with relaxation.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.400
Don't worry. You'll get better soon.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.260
When is that?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.180
Trust me. Everything will be okay.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.020
Now, just leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.300
Okay. Follow your words

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.340
Brother,

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.160
no matter it is for me, or it is for you,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.000
please, we can get over it together. 

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.000
Is it too hot?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.760
Did you study medicine?

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.560
Why do you think so?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.520
You are good at taking care of sick people.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.440
If not doctor, you're a nurse.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.040
Who do you mean to a sick one? You're in good health.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.280
Am I not a sick person?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.580
You can walk, speak, and eat normally.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.880
You're very strong.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.540
Stop being insecure or anxious about yourself.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.760
Your life is still better than so many people's.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.500
I believe that, one day, you can regain your sight.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.020
At that moment, I want to see you.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.060
If you want me to call me that way, use another tone. 

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.860
Because your tone doesn't sound suitable. 

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.920
Let me...

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.000
Oh... I'll get the door.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.320
Welcome to all subscribers of Ai Linh's charitable fanpage!

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.300
- Today, I'll show you my ex-boyfriend. 
- What are you doing?

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.660
This is Thach, my ex-boyfriend.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.240
Months ago, he had a traffic accident.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.120
He became disabled and couldn't walk again.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.640
- He's blind, also! 
- Shut up!

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.760
Give it back!

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.020
Let me go!

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.540
Give it back!

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.380
Even this house is going to be sold, guys!

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.520
Everyone, just think.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.640
A poor man

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.400
will never be able to walk again,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.500
and he's even blind.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.120
How can he continue this life?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.920
Are you happy? Get lost!

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.000
Son of a b*tch! Stop! Son of...

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.020
Did you forget to lock the gate again?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.460
I've told you before.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.640
Just one more time and I won't forgive you.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.300
It's also not good if you always lock it.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.120
We have visitors, and we need to go in and out.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.080
Open it so anyone can get in here more easily?

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.320
I've told you before.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.160
Please do as I told you.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.580
Don't act on your own!

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.740
Yes. I know.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.840
Just one more time and I'll fire you.
