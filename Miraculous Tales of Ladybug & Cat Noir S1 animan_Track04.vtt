&lrm;Only the finest for my baby.

&lrm;Wow! Look at the size
&lrm;of that piece of meat.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.260
&lrm;Typical diet for a feline

&lrm;60mph? Is that all?

&lrm;Your friend's right. Now leave.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.980
<i>&lrm;I can fix a date for you.</i>

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.260
&lrm;Say what! Seriously?
&lrm;You didn't even ask me!

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.340
&lrm;No way. Nino's like a brother to me.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.540
<i>&lrm;No! End of discussion.</i>

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.420
&lrm;-He'll be so sad.
&lrm;-What did you say?

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.260
&lrm;I said...
&lrm;it'll be sad not to tell her.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.140
&lrm;Animan,

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.660
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.540
&lrm;I offer you the power to seek revenge...

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.060
&lrm;for a small price.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.780
&lrm;[evil voice] Yes, Hawk Moth.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.220
&lrm;[growling]

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.260
&lrm;Hey, kiddo, still up for a race?

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.740
&lrm;Go ahead, I'll give you a head start.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.820
&lrm;[roaring]

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.100
&lrm;[screaming]

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.380
&lrm;He's mine.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.340
<i>&lrm;This whole date thing with Nino</i>
<i>&lrm;is not happening!</i>

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.780
&lrm;[screaming] He's coming!

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.860
&lrm;[Nino screams]
&lrm;[elephant trumpets]

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.500
&lrm;[roaring]

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.460
&lrm;We'd better ditch this place.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.180
&lrm;Why didn't you listen to Alya?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.900
&lrm;I couldn't help it.
&lrm;I didn't want Nino to be sad.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.980
&lrm;We'll deal with that later.
&lrm;It's time to transform.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.980
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.260
&lrm;We've got to do something.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.420
&lrm;[sigh]

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.260
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.980
&lrm;You lost, kiddo.
&lrm;What do you think of panthers now?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.540
&lrm;[whimpering] That panthers are the best.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.820
&lrm;What do you think about ladybugs?

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.260
&lrm;And another black cat?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.620
&lrm;I think I'm higher on the food chain.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.660
&lrm;Animan, take their jewels.
&lrm;their Miraculouses.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.940
&lrm;Bring them to me!

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.700
&lrm;If you value your life,
&lrm;get out of here now.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.500
&lrm;Cat Noir,
&lrm;the Akuma must be inside his bracelet.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.620
&lrm;You hold him. I'll grab the bracelet.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.700
&lrm;[roaring] Attack!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.620
&lrm;We need to get them back in their cages.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.180
&lrm;Really?
&lrm;I'm sure they won't put up a fight.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.900
&lrm;We'd better split up.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.700
&lrm;What the...?

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.340
&lrm;Stay put, you'll be safe.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.340
&lrm;Hey, what's up?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.140
&lrm;[Ladybug] There are too many.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.820
&lrm;We can't capture them all.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.540
&lrm;What are we gonna do?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.900
&lrm;Back to plan A.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.860
&lrm;If we can destroy his bracelet,
&lrm;I can capture the Akuma.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.820
&lrm;-Everything will go back to normal.
&lrm;-Good idea.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.180
&lrm;-But it's unbreakable.
&lrm;-He didn't break it.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.300
&lrm;-How did he get away?
&lrm;-I don't know.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.780
&lrm;We'd better find Kim...
&lrm;I mean that boy, before he does.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.260
&lrm;Over there.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.660
&lrm;[Kim whimpers]

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.460
&lrm;[growling]

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.660
&lrm;It's down to the two of us, kiddo.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.260
&lrm;[Animan] And then there was one.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.740
&lrm;You're not getting away this time.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.100
&lrm;Quick,
&lrm;hide in the first place you come to.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.700
&lrm;You'll never get me.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.820
&lrm;[bubbling]

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
&lrm;[eagle screams]

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.700
&lrm;-Now we know how it got away.
&lrm;-Where's Kim?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.300
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.100
&lrm;Good job, kitty.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.660
&lrm;[sobbing] Help! Rescue me, please.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.100
&lrm;It's OK. Come this way.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.660
&lrm;[snarling]

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.700
&lrm;He's safe here.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.660
&lrm;Panthers can't open doors.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.860
&lrm;But what if he morphs
&lrm;into a smaller animal, like a mouse?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.260
&lrm;Right...
&lrm;but we have an advantage over him.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.340
&lrm;We know where to find his prey.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.140
&lrm;He'll sniff him eventually
&lrm;but it's bought us some time.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.060
&lrm;[bear groans]

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.780
&lrm;[he screams]

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.860
&lrm;We must stop Animan
&lrm;before Paris becomes a jungle.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.980
&lrm;[Ladybug] Follow me.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.980
&lrm;Hi, mo... madam.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.380
&lrm;But you're...

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.460
&lrm;You're Ladybug.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.260
&lrm;Yeah, exactly.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.980
<i>&lrm;This is a special news flash.</i>

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.180
<i>&lrm;Animals are invading Paris.</i>

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.140
<i>&lrm;The police are hard at work</i>
<i>&lrm;trying to contain the situation.</i>

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.780
<i>&lrm;Stay indoors and remain calm.</i>

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.580
<i>&lrm;Mayor Bourgeois will...</i>

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.180
&lrm;You're safe here.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.620
&lrm;Can I borrow this?

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.980
&lrm;Sure.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.780
&lrm;Come on, Cat Noir.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.780
&lrm;Lock the doors and windows.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.740
&lrm;We'll do the rest. You'll be safe.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.260
&lrm;Thanks, da... sir,
&lrm;for all your help.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.140
&lrm;You're welcome, Ladybug.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.620
&lrm;And voilà.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.740
&lrm;What's that stuff?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.820
&lrm;Air freshener. It'll cover our scents.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.180
&lrm;Thanks, I always wanted
&lrm;to smell like an ocean breeze.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.740
&lrm;Could we capture him in this?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.500
&lrm;Only until he turns into something bigger.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.660
&lrm;[she gasps]

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.020
&lrm;Would that be big enough?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.500
&lrm;Yes, but how do we get him inside?

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.620
&lrm;He's coming.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.820
&lrm;[eagle screams]

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.700
&lrm;It's working. He's sniffing out Kim.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.660
&lrm;[sniffing]

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.420
&lrm;[he giggles]

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.660
&lrm;Follow me.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.700
&lrm;[eagle screams]

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.940
&lrm;A ladybug? Smart choice.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.340
&lrm;Couldn't he have chosen a slower animal?

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.500
&lrm;[growling]

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:49.060
&lrm;[snarling]

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
&lrm;Where's the button for the doors?

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.420
&lrm;Of course,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.860
&lrm;there's no key.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.340
&lrm;Take his Miraculous, the ring, the ring!

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.620
&lrm;The transformations are tiring him out.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.140
&lrm;It'll be easier to get his Akuma.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.860
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.940
&lrm;[bleeping]

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.540
&lrm;[explosion]

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.060
&lrm;It's not exactly a cage but... it'll do.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.580
&lrm;I don't think he can "bear"
&lrm;to listen to that noise.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.420
&lrm;You're too much to bear.
&lrm;Now we wait.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.380
&lrm;Ready to free the Akuma?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.060
&lrm;It's working.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.860
&lrm;[gasping]

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.780
&lrm;[crashing]

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.780
&lrm;Since when do extinct animals count?

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.780
&lrm;T-Rex might be extinct
&lrm;but it's still an animal.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.780
&lrm;I know some other animals that will soon
&lrm;be extinct, the cat and the ladybug!

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.020
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.100
&lrm;A car jack?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.620
&lrm;Too bad he doesn't have a flat tire.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.300
&lrm;Look how small his front arms are.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.140
&lrm;So he can't play basketball.
&lrm;What are you getting at?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.700
&lrm;Climb on top of him
&lrm;where he can't get you.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.340
&lrm;While you're distracting him
&lrm;I'll floor him.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.620
&lrm;Sounds like a plan.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.020
&lrm;I can be very distracting.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.180
&lrm;[she groans]

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.900
&lrm;[Cat Noir] It's gonna be tight.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.860
&lrm;[Cat Noir yells]

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.900
&lrm;It's weird we didn't need this.
&lrm;What does it mean?

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.100
&lrm;I guess it means we rock as a team.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.300
&lrm;Wait!

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.140
&lrm;I know what to do.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.580
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.940
&lrm;Enjoy your meal!

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.900
&lrm;[roaring]

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.620
&lrm;No!

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.020
&lrm;You'll pay for this!

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.980
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.460
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.020
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.780
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.380
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.300
&lrm;-Pound it?
&lrm;-Ladybug!

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.220
&lrm;That was a wild ride.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.940
&lrm;[they chuckle]

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.340
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;Woops.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.180
&lrm;Better take off.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.460
&lrm;See you next time, Cat Noir.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.380
&lrm;-What happened to me?
&lrm;-Everything's OK.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.940
&lrm;Go back to the zoo
&lrm;to check on your animals.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.860
&lrm;You ruined everything, Ladybug.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.300
&lrm;This is not how it was supposed to end!

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.820
&lrm;But, I promise you,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.060
&lrm;one day it will be me
&lrm;at the top of the food chain

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.260
&lrm;and you'll be nothing!

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.780
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.540
&lrm;No, I forgot about Alya.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.420
&lrm;She's gonna be so mad.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.700
&lrm;Imagine if she knew

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.660
&lrm;you shut her up in the cage with Nino.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.180
&lrm;[phone continues]
&lrm;Yeah, she'd kill me.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.060
&lrm;Guess I'll take mad.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.300
&lrm;Listen Alya, I'm sorry about earlier.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.900
&lrm;I shouldn't have told Nino
&lrm;I'd set up a date.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.460
&lrm;I wasn't thinking.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.860
&lrm;I'll explain everything to him
&lrm;so don't worry.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.180
&lrm;Do you forgive me?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.380
&lrm;[they giggle]

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.020
&lrm;Thanks, Nino.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.060
&lrm;Do you want one?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.500
&lrm;What's he doing here?

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.460
&lrm;Ladybug shut us
&lrm;in the same cage all afternoon.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.340
&lrm;Turns out, we've tons in common.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.300
&lrm;You know, the girl I've a crush on...

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.700
&lrm;Oh, yeah.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.460
&lrm;Actually, it was you.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.460
&lrm;That's what I thought
&lrm;but after being with Alya,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.140
&lrm;We don't have to give her all the details.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.500
&lrm;My bad.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.900
&lrm;The funniest part
&lrm;was that Nino was being coached

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.540
&lrm;-by Adrien.
&lrm;-Adrien was there?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.140
&lrm;Yeah, lol.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.140
&lrm;Alya tells me
&lrm;you're crushin' on some dude.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.300
&lrm;He doesn't know who,
&lrm;pinkie swear because...

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.220
&lrm;I don't make decisions for other people.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.780
&lrm;If you want I can make it happen.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.540
&lrm;-That is if I know the dude.
&lrm;-Nino!

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.660
&lrm;Fine, forget I said anything.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.180
&lrm;But if I can help...

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.620
&lrm;[Alya] Nino!
