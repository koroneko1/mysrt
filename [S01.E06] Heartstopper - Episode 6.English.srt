I had a best friend at the time,

and I didn't feel weird about it.

I didn't feel like
it was an odd thing to do.

for girls up to that point,

Um, some people were surprised,
a couple of people already knew…

160
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,000
-Darcy!
-[laughs] Triumph at last.

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,120
Come on, girls. We're running
through it again in a minute.

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,519
We're here all day
if you want to meet us for lunch.

163
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Yeah, that'd be nice.

164
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,919
[Miss Hyder] Okay, everyone. From the top!

165
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,120
Oh, my God, we've found another one.

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
You can't tell anyone.
She won't tell anyone.

167
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah, I, um…

168
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,240
[Harry] Not having lunch
with your boyfriend?

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,799
[Tao] No, I'm waiting
for your mum, actually.

170
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
[boy] Classic!

171
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
[Harry] Yeah, whatever.

172
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm not really… out yet, or anything.

173
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,720
Do you want to be?

174
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,879
I don't know.

175
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
I mean, I don't even know
what my sexuality is.

176
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
[Darcy] That's okay.

177
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Tara didn't know she was a lesbian
until we'd kissed, like, six times.

178
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,320
It was two times.

179
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
[all laugh]

180
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,879
Oh, my God, do you know
what we need to do? Double dates.

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Us and Charlie, tomorrow night,
before the concert, milkshakes.

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,159
-I like milkshakes.
-[Tara] Good.

183
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,919
Don't feel like you have to come out
to anyone before you're ready.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Oh. Yeah.

185
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Being out is hard.

186
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,720
A lot of people
will see you in a different way,

187
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,279
and it is a lot to deal with.

188
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
Can I ask you something?

189
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,279
Yeah.

190
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,919
Are you, like…

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,360
definitely gay?

192
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Or do you think you're bi, or…

193
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,120
I mean, when we were 13,
I think I did like you.

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,320
I mean, I think I have liked girls before,
so I wondered if you felt the same.

195
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm definitely gay.
Kissing you was actually one of the things

196
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,120
that made me realize
I don't like kissing guys.

197
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,039
[laughs] Okay…

198
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Um…

199
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,919
-Happy to help.
-[Tara and Darcy chuckle]

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Uh, see you tomorrow?

201
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,559
Yeah, that sounds really good.

202
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,919
Um…

203
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,279
You're kind of the first people
I've told about Charlie.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,919
Really?

205
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,159
Yeah.

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,679
And does it feel good
to have told someone?

207
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah.

208
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,720
Really does.

209
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,559
You can't come in here.
Nick's coming round.

210
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,559
Oh.

211
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,399
I didn't realize you were
in a committed relationship.

212
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

213
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
We're not…

214
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
He's not…

215
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Shut up.

216
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,960
Wow. So not ready
to tie the knot yet then?

217
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,879
[laughs] Shut up.

218
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Even if we were together…

219
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,159
[knocking at door]

220
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,559
[soft pop music playing]

221
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,919
What?

222
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,759
What?

223
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,039
You're staring.

224
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,919
-No I wasn't.
-Yeah, you were.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
-Do your homework.
-[chuckles]

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,159
You know, I was talking
to Tara at the rehearsal today…

227
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,399
Yeah?

228
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,080
-You heard she came out, right?
-Yeah, she put it on Insta.

229
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,879
I told her we're together.

230
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,799
What?

231
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,679
I told her we're going out.

232
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,200
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

233
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,039
[laughing] You're amazing.

234
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,720
Wait. Are you sure you wanted to?

235
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,679
Um, yeah.

236
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,000
You didn't force yourself
because I'm out--

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,720
No, I wanted to tell them.

238
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,919
[Nick grunts]

239
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,960
[Nick] So, how about
the concert tomorrow night?

240
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,600
You really don't have to come.

241
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,919
-It'll be boring.
-No, I want to support you.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,120
[laughs softly] Um…

243
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay, but if you change
your mind, that's fine.

244
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,759
And Tara and Darcy want us to go

245
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,639
and get milkshakes
with them before it starts.

246
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,639
Like a double date.

247
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,919
I've never been on a date.

248
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Me neither.

249
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,639
Want to go on one?

250
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,559
Yeah.

251
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,360
[both laugh softly]

252
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,039
Cool. Um…

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,159
I'll…

254
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

255
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,440
Okay.

256
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,720
Bye.

257
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Bye.

258
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,759
[cell phone chimes]

259
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,639
[chuckles softly]

260
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,080
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Ooh, ooh.

262
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,559
Oh. Oh!

263
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,480
[Tao] Oh, no. Oh, no.

264
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,759
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

265
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
[both chuckle]

266
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,559
Since when were you coming to this?

267
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,080
I thought it was bribery
to get me to come to his boring concert.

268
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,120
-You're here for the milkshakes then?
-I said what I said.

269
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,480
[laughs]

270
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,360
[Elle] Come on.

271
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,879
[whirring]

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,720
[Tao] Do you ever play film music?

273
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,559
-[Tara] Yeah, sometimes.
-Well, then it's not boring.

274
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,559
Why'd you agree to come then?

275
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,919
Because I'm a very nice
and supportive friend.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
No, he came for the milkshakes
and the milkshakes only.

277
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,240
-I said that to you in confidence.
-How did you two become friends?

278
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,000
I was friends with Charlie first
and Tao came along as a package deal.

279
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
-[exclaims]
-[laughter]

280
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,960
[rolling tongue] Rude!
You're lucky to have me.

281
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,639
You make a cute little pair.

282
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,240
So, we're ordering a second round, right?

283
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,360
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

284
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,279
-We can go and get them.
-[Tara] Can I have a strawberry one?

285
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,879
-Strawberry.
-Banana again.

286
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,600
Oh, my God, no, that is a crime!

287
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,399
I cannot believe you're disrespecting
bubblegum flavor in front of me.

288
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,200
Right. Let me try yours.

289
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,519
Wow.

290
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,519
See? I make good choices.

291
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,679
-We should swap.
-No, you made your choice.

292
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,759
Okay, well, we can share.

293
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,519
We are on a date.

294
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Is that the official rule of dating?

295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,159
Sharing drinks?

296
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

297
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
We should go on a date, just us.

298
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
I mean, if you want to.

299
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,399
It's all right if you don't want to.

300
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
Actually, no, sorry, that was stupid.

301
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,440
We should.

302
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I'd like that.

303
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,480
[laughs softly]

304
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,920
After we'd kissed, like, six times…

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
-It was two, but sure.
-…Tara agreed to be my girlfriend.

306
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,200
That's a really cute story.
You two seem good together.

307
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah, I think
it's because we're friends too.

308
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,279
Seems obvious. You should be good friends
with the person you're dating.

309
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah.

310
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,720
That makes sense.

311
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,759
Yeah.

312
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,200
Tao, can you come
help us carry the glasses?

313
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,200
Yeah.

314
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,119
[grunts]

315
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,759
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

316
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,039
You're clearly trying to set something up
between me and Tao.

317
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,319
We thought if we could hint to him
that you'd make a good couple…

318
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,319
-But I didn't ask you to do that.
-But you like him, so--

319
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't want him to know that.
Just because you two came out,

320
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,960
doesn't mean I also want
to share all my secrets.

321
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,400
Friendship is more important.
If he knew, things would change,

322
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,079
and I've had to deal
with enough changes in my life lately.

323
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,039
I don't want anything else to change.

324
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,759
Yeah. Sharing stuff
like that changes everything.

325
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,680
Not always for the better.

326
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,480
Bubblegum's more interesting.
It's more interesting.

327
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,240
-Not interrupting anything, am I?
-Um, what?

328
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,559
No, we were just chatting.

329
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,880
Okay then.

330
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,839
[blender whirring]

331
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,839
You take those back,
I'll wait for the last two.

332
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
-Are you sure?
-[Tao] Yeah.

333
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay.

334
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
-Thanks.
-[cashier] Cheers.

335
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,799
[Nick] Here we are.

336
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,519
Is this some sort of
"no boys allowed" conversation?

337
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,920
Did you know this too?

338
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,880
The me and Tao thing.

339
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
Um…

340
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,599
Yeah.

341
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,480
So this whole thing was just a setup?

342
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,440
We thought it would be fun
to go on a triple date.

343
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,519
A triple date?

344
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,079
Yeah. You and Tao, Tara and Darcy, and…

345
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,359
You and Charlie?

346
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,119
Yeah.

347
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
You two are together?

348
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,079
-Yeah.
-[gasps] Charlie! I'm so happy for you.

349
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,960
I mean, I'm happy for you too,

350
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,440
but you didn't have to witness
all the months of intense pining--

351
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,559
[Charlie] Elle!

352
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,240
Do Tao and Isaac know?

353
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,680
I think Isaac guessed, like,
almost immediately after we got together.

354
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,319
And what about Tao?

355
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Not yet.

356
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm going to tell him.
I need to find the right time.

357
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,359
But he's the only one who doesn't know.

358
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,359
[Tao] Um…

359
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
Just so you know,
the concert's starting in 15 minutes.

360
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,279
[all] Oh!

361
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
[indistinct conversation]

362
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,240
-I really love you.
-Aw, I love you too.

363
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
[indistinct chatter]

364
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,240
Tara, Darcy, hurry up, you're late.
Sit down, chop chop. Thank you.

365
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,920
[laughter]

366
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,799
Uh, can I have less chatting,
more tuning, please? Thank you.

367
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,799
[girl] Don't look at her,
you'll catch the lesbian disease.

368
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,839
[giggling]

369
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,480
[Miss Hyder] It went well last time,
but we'll do it better today, aren't we?

370
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,039
Come on, put your foot under.

371
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
[both chuckle]

372
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,599
Take it. And that one.

373
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
[Nick] Okay. [clears throat]

374
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,680
And then, um…

375
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,799
I'm glad you came.

376
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,880
-It seemed like you didn't want me to.
-No, I did. I just…

377
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,880
I thought you were trying not to be rude.

378
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,839
No.

379
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,079
I just…

380
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,519
I like being with you.

381
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,519
Also, we've been hanging out a lot and…

382
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,599
If people guessed we were together,

383
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
if they started
saying stuff about you then…

384
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,319
Well, I really don't want you
to have to deal with that.

385
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,240
I, um…

386
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,759
I've been researching about

387
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,000
being bisexual.

388
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,759
Uh…

389
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,519
I think that might be me.

390
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,920
But I… I'm not sure.

391
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,279
Has anyone seen Tara and Darcy?

392
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm about to open
the doors for the audience.

393
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,960
I just want some peace and quiet.

394
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,880
The door!

395
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,319
[handle jiggles]

396
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,480
[Darcy groans]

397
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, no.

398
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,680
No signal.

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,880
Can't believe this is the second time
we've been locked inside here.

400
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,839
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

401
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,720
Didn't want to do
the concert thing anyway.

402
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,720
Talk to me.

403
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,319
Everything's changed.

404
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,960
-Since we came out?
-Yeah.

405
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,319
Do you regret it?

406
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,720
No. [hesitating] I just wasn't prepared
for things to change.

407
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,079
I didn't… I didn't think
so many people would suddenly think

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm a completely different person.

409
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,240
-They don't think that.
-They do.

410
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,720
It's different for me.
You came out years ago.

411
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm not loud and confident
about being a lesbian.

412
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,279
I could barely say the word lesbian
when we started going out,

413
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,039
and now I've got people on my Instagram,
like, "Oh, my God, you're a lesbian."

414
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,960
People giving me funny looks
in the corridors.

415
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,480
I wasn't prepared for any of it.

416
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,839
I don't know how to behave anymore and…

417
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,359
I just want to live my life.

418
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,000
You're so confident about your sexuality,
and I still feel like I know nothing.

419
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey, I don't know anything either.

420
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,240
I don't know anything about anything.

421
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,279
I just want to live my life.

422
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,240
[Darcy] We can do that.

423
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,680
You seem gay enough to me.

424
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,119
Shut up. [laughing]

425
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,519
I think it will get easier.

426
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah.

427
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
I know.

428
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,000
-[Nick] Tara!
-[Charlie] Tara!

429
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,640
Tara?

430
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,559
[Nick] Tara!

431
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,200
Homophobia.

432
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,759
We're in here, we got locked in!

433
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,200
-Darcy!
-Tara!

434
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,279
Tara!

435
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,960
[Tara and Darcy] We're in here! In here!

436
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
Hey.

437
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,759
You guys are supposed
to be on stage, like, right now.

438
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,519
Hurry up!

439
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,880
[Tao] You know I can't run,
it's not my fault!

440
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,759
[Tara] Thanks, "boy I kissed one time."

441
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,039
No problem, "girl I kissed one time."

442
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,079
You going to be okay?

443
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,359
Yeah. I'll be okay.

444
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,279
You?

445
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.
