4

To return to the old universe, you must find your portkey.

5
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:24,657
Pakorn!

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,152
Stay away from me.

7
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:27,104
I hate you.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,322
Talay.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,800
Like to share your story?

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,008
You’ve never shared it with us.

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,452
Me?

12
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,120
Sure.

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,667
How do I start?

14
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,598
I woke up in a rich boy’s body.

15
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,808
His family runs a huge filmmaking company.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,395
It matches my career.

17
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,133
That sounds pretty nice.

18
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,485
It does.

19
00:00:58,729 --> 00:00:59,608
But…

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,972
They are not my family.

21
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:05,623
I have my own family,

22
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:07,260
friends,

23
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:11,425
and a dream to be a colorist waiting for me.

24
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:16,789
I’ll go to any length to get home as soon as possible.

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,861
Everyone here shares the same hope.

26
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,719
Have you found anyone who seems right?

27
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,560
There is one.

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,633
But there’s one problem.

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,258
He’s always avoiding me.

30
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,000
Let’s put it this way.

31
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:39,275
It’s the same as hitting on someone.

32
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,040
You must keep pushing and pushing.

33
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,263
Come on, guys.

34
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,311
Let’s transfer our energy to Talay.

35
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,000
We hope the person is your portkey.

36
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:52,843
We hope the person is your portkey.

37
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:57,600
We hope the person is your portkey.

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,374
We hope the person is your portkey.

39
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,848
Stop following me.

40
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,272
I told you I don’t want to talk to you.

41
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:39,151
But I do.

42
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,535
I will keep following you around until you agree to talk to me.

43
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:46,288
Oops! Amateur.

44
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,649
I thought you were good.

45
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,035
You missed.

46
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,287
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,984
You hit the outermost ring, you get the full score.

48
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,323
Look.

49
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,632
Hit the edge and get 10 points?

50
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,120
Rules in this universe are too easy.

51
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,029
What’s wrong with you?

52
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:06,788
Hitting the center is easy. Anyone can do that.

53
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,819
But if you miss the edge just a little, you get zero point.

54
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,200
I’ll show you how easy it is.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,155
Give it here.

56
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:19,160
Move. I need space.

57
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,066
There!

58
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,647
If I competed under this rule, I’d be an Olympic gold medalist.

59
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,596
Shit!

60
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,448
When did he leave?

61
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,458
Hi, Pakorn.

62
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,417
You’re a cameraman today?

63
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,475
I’m working. I don’t want to talk.

64
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,114
Wait.

65
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,828
Shoot my photos.

66
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:08,422
Do your job.

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,195
Yes?

68
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:20,385
Hey. Hold on.

69
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:22,591
Hey!

70
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,014
You’re here too.

71
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:27,930
Didn’t expect to see you here. Amm said you weren’t coming.

72
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,612
I changed my mind.

73
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,597
Have you talked to Tun?

74
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:37,533
Not yet.

75
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:39,888
Don’t know what the hell is wrong.

76
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,680
He won't talk to me.

77
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,434
Surely, he is still mad at you.

78
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,007
I’m not surprised.

79
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,926
What you did to him was shitty.

80
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Huh?

81
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:50,381
Me?

82
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:51,731
What did I do?

83
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:52,852
Whoa.

84
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,316
How dare you forget?

85
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,538
You hit on someone he liked.

86
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,934
Not just that.

87
00:05:58,438 --> 00:05:59,920
You even dated her.

88
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,987
If I were him, I wouldn’t speak with you ever again.

89
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,014
What can I serve you today?

90
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:20,727
An iced latte, please.

91
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,598
Hi, Pakorn.

92
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:26,119
Wait.

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,276
You can’t run from me today.

94
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,415
I’m your customer.

95
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,816
Customer,

96
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,713
I’m working here.

97
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,405
I don’t discuss anything personal while working.

98
00:06:38,184 --> 00:06:39,911
Just one question then.

99
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,335
Do you believe in reincarnation?

100
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,369
I do.

101
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,597
Why?

102
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,080
I’m a screenwriter. I must believe in anything.

103
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,230
Do you…

104
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,238
have any other reason to?

105
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:05,554
Not telling.

106
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,142
Come on.

107
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,980
We’re alone here.

108
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,929
No one can hear us.

109
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,840
Anything you’d like to tell me?

110
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,683
A secret you can’t tell other people.

111
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,148
I’m all ears.

112
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:23,840
Actually, there is.

113
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,552
Go ahead and tell, my friend.

114
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,846
This is my first day here. The coffee should taste like shit.

115
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,449
Damn you, Pakorn.

116
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,772
What’s taking him so long?

117
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:43,617
Hey!

118
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,103
It took you forever to come.

119
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:49,997
I’m starving.

120
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:51,497
Sorry.

121
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,880
There’s a guy messing with me a little but…

122
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:57,845
Forget it.

123
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:58,561
Let’s order.

124
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,892
Hold on.

125
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:02,432
What about the screenplay you offered to 26 Pictures?

126
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,340
What did they say?

127
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,597
I…

128
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:09,318
Well…

129
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:12,000
Um…

130
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,835
He sold it.

131
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:24,854
You.

132
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,319
Don’t be confused.

133
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:27,697
Your screenplay is bought.

134
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:29,055
I talked to my brother for you.

135
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,584
Wait a minute.

136
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,914
I’m so lost here.

137
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,207
Tun,

138
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,760
when are you friends with someone from 26 Pictures?

139
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,148
Sorry, I didn’t introduce myself.

140
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,461
My name is Tess.

141
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,143
A son of 26 Pictures owner.

142
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,905
Also a friend of Tun from high school.

143
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:48,788
Huh?

144
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,344
Wait.

145
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,350
You have a big connection.

146
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:54,200
Why didn’t you tell us?

147
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:55,324
No.

148
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:56,407
We’re not close.

149
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,152
Not at all.

150
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,595
Come on.

151
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,791
We are close.

152
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,237
Freakin’ close.

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,185
Hey.

154
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:15,455
My name is Up.

155
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,089
First name Preeda.

156
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,804
Friends call me Up-Pree.

157
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,584
I have expertise in writing comedy plays.

158
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,000
If you want comedy, let me know.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,870
I’m the master.

160
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,298
And my name is Aou.

161
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,551
I write every genre or style.

162
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:33,232
How did you three become a team?

163
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,320
It’s a very long story.

164
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,004
Let’s make it short.

165
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,723
We ran into each other when trying to sell our screenplays at your father’s company in our freshman year.

166
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,680
We became a group since then.

167
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,417
Right.

168
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:50,914
We tried selling our plays to 26 Pictures.

169
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,654
But we never made it.

170
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:55,847
This is the first time they are interested.

171
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:56,994
Right?

172
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:57,960
Damn!

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,570
I just wanna cry.

174
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:01,865
Let’s cheers.

175
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,065
To our first project accepted!

176
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:04,638
Yes!

177
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:06,713
Come on.

178
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,246
You get the whole jar.

179
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:13,587
Cheers!

180
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:16,224
Why not raise your glass?

181
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:17,288
Come on.

182
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,312
Looking forward to working with you, screenwriter.

183
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,765
Get in. I’ll drive you home.

184
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,694
It’s too late to get a taxi.

185
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:26,809
Hey.

186
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:28,600
I’m sorry.

187
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,941
Sorry I did a horrible thing to you.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,101
What do you mean?

189
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:39,760
Pakorn.

190
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,333
Pramote told me everything.

191
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:45,171
About me stealing someone you liked.

192
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,427
Stop following me.

193
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,204
I’m trying to apologize here.

194
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,816
I said stop following me.

195
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,316
You just don’t know a damn thing.

196
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,139
Take that stupidity to your grave.

197
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:03,631
Hey.

198
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:17,086
I’m sure Pakorn is the one I’m looking for.

199
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:19,365
I’m sensing

200
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
he’s traveled between universes like us.

201
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,751
He’s just afraid to tell the truth.

202
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,013
The best thing to do.

203
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:32,702
You check if he’s traveled between universes like us or not.

204
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:35,815
If not, you can move on

205
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,377
and search for someone else.

206
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:38,932
Trust me.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,760
Hey.

208
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,730
Can you make the light pinker?

209
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:53,911
You got it.

210
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:54,836
Awesome.

211
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,073
Hey, bro!

212
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,075
Have a seat.

213
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:03,464
Are you here to appreciate the pink lighting I just put up?

214
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:04,590
It’s gorgeous.

215
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,298
No.

216
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,869
I’m here to see Tun.

217
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,676
Will he come?

218
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:10,969
No.

219
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,208
He said his screenplay was sold.

220
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,288
So he’s taking a time off to develop it with his team.

221
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:17,582
Where are they?

222
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:18,502
Do you know?

223
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,165
No idea.

224
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,929
I think they went out of town. Some place quiet.

225
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,929
They do this often.

226
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,633
And don’t bother to call them.

227
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,062
Because their phones…

228
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:33,714
are all with me.

229
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,532
They are being artists.

230
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,778
They said they didn’t want anything to distract them from their screenplay.

231
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,770
And do you happen to know how long they spend time in their hideaway?

232
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,337
Shouldn’t be that long.

233
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,112
Around a month.

234
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:49,352
A month?

235
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,640
ONE MONTH LATER

236
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:02,851
You keep checking your phone?

237
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,730
Whose call are you expecting?

238
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,360
I’ve been through a lot, man.

239
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,400
You’re being dumped.

240
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,543
Come on. Let’s drink.

241
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:27,108
Guys!

242
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:27,999
Right there.

243
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:28,923
Who is picking a fight?

244
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,152
No.

245
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,329
That’s your history, Tess.

246
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,533
Who?

247
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,708
You can’t remember Anna?

248
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:43,290
The ex-girlfriend you bragged to us that you stole from someone in high school.

249
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,174
That girl?

250
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,721
That’s Anna.

251
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,649
The one.

252
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,210
How dare you forget?

253
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,120
You hit on someone he liked.

254
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,520
I did?

255
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,031
Tess.

256
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:07,712
Hey, Anna.

257
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,101
How are you doing?

258
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,816
Doing okay.

259
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,850
Uh…

260
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,186
Tess.

261
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,093
I talked to Tun.

262
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,262
About what?

263
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,844
The reason I broke up with you.

264
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,318
The truth is I was being selfish.

265
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,266
Anna, it wasn’t your fault.

266
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:37,995
It’s me.

267
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,680
I knew Tun liked you yet I still did it.

268
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,687
Huh?

269
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,229
No?

270
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:46,332
No.

271
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,482
Tun didn’t like me.

272
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,840
He likes you, Tess.

273
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:52,268
What?

274
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,719
This is the reason I broke up with you.

275
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:02,117
Not only that we couldn’t get along,

276
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:05,247
but I also felt bad for Tun.

277
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,050
Here.

278
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:32,365
It’s on me.

279
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,664
You’ve been making a sad face all alone.

280
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,272
Heartbroken?

281
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,184
Not really.

282
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:43,107
I’m just shocked to learn something.

283
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:50,251
I thought he avoided me because we’re both universal travelers.

284
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,482
But it turns out…

285
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,486
he just likes Tess.

286
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:57,523
Hey.

287
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,258
Are you drunk?

288
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,268
What are you saying?

289
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,428
I’m all confused.

290
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,418
Exactly.

291
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:08,627
I’m sorry.

292
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,115
That’s fine.

293
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,363
Shit!

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,963
Holy shit!!

295
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:15,483
Let’s request a song.

296
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:16,944
It might make you feel better.

297
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:17,767
Here.

298
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:18,817
Write down.

299
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,528
(Dear everyone,)

300
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,436
(My name is Talay.)

301
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:36,609
(If you’re reading this letter,)

302
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,413
(that means I lost my hope to go back to my universe.)

303
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:42,000
(Farewell to all beings.)

304
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,179
This is a song title?

305
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,979
Why so long?

306
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,023
Pong, hello!

307
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:56,902
Hi, guys.

308
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:58,033
You’re back.

309
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,263
Keep walking.

310
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,792
Take a look at your friend here.

311
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,917
Comfort him.

312
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,278
He is falling apart here.

313
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,276
Comfort what?

314
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:06,129
Look.

315
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,520
Leave the job to Tun.

316
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,607
There he comes.

317
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:25,484
Is that really Tun?

318
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,720
Of course, he is.

319
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,879
I don’t know what’s happened to him lately.

320
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,256
The guy just keeps cool all the time.

321
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:32,232
Right?

322
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:33,425
Right. Look.

323
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,717
I see you’re finally back.

324
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,463
The stage is not taken.

325
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,419
And your guitar is left in the same spot.

326
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,576
Go ahead.

327
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:44,434
Yes!

328
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,160
You’re gone for a month.

329
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,730
You have no idea how much I missed your off-key singing.

330
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:50,903

336
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,281
Let’s leave that question for later.

337
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:33,840
I’m just wondering whose song it is.

338
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,000
I’ve never heard of it.

339
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,044

♪ It’s the greatest miracle I’ve ever witnessed ♪

348
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:22,317
♪ Oh, you are the miracle ♪

349
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,240
You’re not Tun, are you?

350
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,473
To our universal-traveling friendship.

351
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:51,414
Cheers!

352
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,510
Shit.

353
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,280
What happened here?

354
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,440
What?

355
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:30,734
You guys didn’t finish the screenwriting

356
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,529
because Tun had a car accident?

357
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:34,515
Yes.

358
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,308
He was driving to buy things.

359
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:37,525
A cat cut him off.

360
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:40,183
He loved that cat more than his life, apparently.

361
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,236
So he turned the steering wheel right to the utility post.

362
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:43,912
He was in a hospital for days.

363
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:45,620
He’s blessed to be alive.

364
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,377
Right, my friend?

365
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:47,369
Yeah.

366
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,664
After he recovered, we headed back to Bangkok asap.

367
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,214
We’re afraid his parents would be worried.

368
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:52,976
Yeah.

369
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,875
Sorry to interrupt.

370
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,661
I’m making a new cocktail here.

371
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:01,174
I need lab rats.

372
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,464
Anyone interested?

373
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:03,308
- Me.
- Me.

374
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:05,154
I’ll go first.

375
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,268
You’re not Tun, are you?

376
00:22:27,862 --> 00:22:28,960
What are you talking about?

377
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:34,409
The song Miracle you just played doesn’t exist here.

378
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,261
It’s from our universe.

379
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:46,961
You know.

380
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:49,229
I’m like you.

381
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,281
I died and traveled between universes too.

382
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,522
Damn! You don’t say!

383
00:22:58,656 --> 00:23:00,041
You traveled between universes too?

384
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:01,515
Yes.

385
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:05,972
Shit! I’m freakin’ happy.

386
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:11,670
I’m Talay by the way.

387
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:15,342
How did you die?

388
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,449
I was drunk and had a car crash.

389
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:23,058
Then I woke up in this body.

390
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,803
I was so stunned.

391
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:29,468
I don’t even know how to go back to our universe.

392
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,217
Yeah. I get you.

393
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,009
There is a way

394
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,433
with conditions.

395
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:40,850
I’ll explain it to you when I have time.

396
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:44,620
Hey,

397
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:48,012
what did you do for living in that universe?

398
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:50,912
I was an actor.

399
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:53,093
For real?

400
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:56,146
Which company?

401
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,488
GGN.

402
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:02,202
Damn!!

403
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,364
That’s so dope.

404
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:06,349
What’s your name?

405
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:07,707
I might know you.

406
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:10,023
I’m not telling you.

407
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:11,668
I don’t want a die-hard fan.

408
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,145
Oh, please.

409
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:15,742
Being secretive for what?

410
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,923
Like you’re so famous.

411
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:20,424
I’m pretty famous.

412
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,004
Let’s do this. You call me Tun.

413
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,986
And call this guy Pakorn so we don’t get confused.

414
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,693
Fine.

415
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,022
Oh.

416
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,108
How long have you been in this universe?

417
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,514
Over a month.

418
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:44,300
It might not be that long, but you can ask me if you have questions.

419
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:45,966
I might have answers.

420
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,189
I’ll just ask you now.

421
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,492
Shoot.

422
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:57,140
If I want to search for something, which search engine should I use?

423
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,781
Judging from what you asked,

424
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,286
you couldn’t find Google, could you?

425
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:05,028
In this universe, they use Qooqle.

426
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:10,404
What if I want to be an actor?

427
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:12,404
Don’t go to the GGN building.

428
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:13,850
Because here,

429
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,659
GGN is a company that makes toys.

430
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:19,164
Yes.

431
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:23,389
If you want to be an actor, come to my dad’s company.

432
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,068
26 Pictures.

433
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,478
Which doesn’t really belong to my real dad.

434
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:29,085
It belongs to this guy’s dad.

435
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,743
And…

436
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,444
what if I have problems one day?

437
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,173
Who should I go to?

438
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:52,017
Me.

439
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,955
Fine.

440
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,073
I’m glad it’s you.

441
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,468
Let’s celebrate then.

442
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:07,701
To our universal-traveling friendship.

443
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,569
Drink!

444
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:11,308
Cheers.

445
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:55,289
Shit!

446
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,132
What happened here?

447
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,822
What a relief.

448
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,573
He still has pants on.

449
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:23,973
Why are you looking at my pants?

450
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,639
What happened last night?

451
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,228
Why did you crash here?

452
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:41,532
You drank like a fish last night.

453
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:44,072
So I took you home.

454
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,642
Why are we leaving?

455
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:54,856
I can drink more.

456
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,654
More, my ass.

457
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,196
Come on. I’ll take you home.

458
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:00,417
No.

459
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,199
I’ll stay and celebrate with you.

460
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:05,668
To be honest,

461
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,819
I’m so happy I met you.

462
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,417
Ouch!

463
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:15,371
It hurts.

464
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,719
Stand on your feet.

465
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,052
I’m taking you home.

466
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:19,831
Yes.

467
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:21,563
Home.

468
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,067
Let’s go back to our universe.

469
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,751
But how do we do that?

470
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:29,574
Can we go back if we kiss?

471
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:34,354
What?

472
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:36,828
It doesn’t work.

473
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:38,911
Let me try again.

474
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,098
What?

475
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,492
Damn it.

476
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,530
We’re still here.

477
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,904
Hey.

478
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:58,851
Talay.

479
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,255
Talay.

480
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,751
I have visions of many bad things.

481
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,986
But can’t remember exactly.

482
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:13,708
It’s good you can’t remember.

483
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:15,018
Why?

484
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,388
Did I hurt you in any way?

485
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:19,868
No.

486
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:26,975
But me hurting you sounds more like it.

487
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:28,993
Stop it.

488
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,654
You’re giving me goosebumps.

489
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,671
Why did you mention it in the first place then?

490
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:39,599
I’m hungry.

491
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,777
Any food here?

492
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,245
This room was so hot last night.

493
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,408
Wow.

494
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:03,875
It’s weird they have cone bread here.

495
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:08,719
Oh,

496
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:10,809
but it’s pretty convenient to eat.

497
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:13,386
Tun.

498
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:15,400
Seriously.

499
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,841
What’s your real name?

500
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:19,487
Take a guess.

501
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:23,727
I can’t even guess what happens in my life.

502
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,074
I can’t guess yours.

503
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:29,183
Let me give you a clue.

504
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:31,885
My mom named me after a character in a movie.

505
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:34,079
It’s the movie that came out the year I was born.

506
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,890
Which is the same as yours, right?

507
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:36,561
Right.

508
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,310
1998.

509
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:40,887
Oh!

510
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,902
Are you Jack?

511
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,742
Titanic was a hit that year.

512
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,151
Wrong.

513
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:47,536
Rose then.

514
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:49,638
No.

515
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,994
Maybe you’re refusing to tell me because your mom likes this movie.

516
00:30:56,665 --> 00:30:57,951
2499. (Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters)

517
00:30:58,243 --> 00:30:58,957
Your name is Dang.

518
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:01,533
Dang, my ass.

519
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:04,884
Besides, 2499 didn’t come out in 1998.

520
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:07,745
But I think Dang Bireley is cool.

521
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,808
Don’t you know the famous quote from the movie?

522
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,308
‘To be my wife, you must endure.’

523
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:39,888
I know.

524
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:44,706
You could’ve just said it normally.

525
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,783
No need to poke your face so close.

526
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:48,880
You bugged me first.

527
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,136
I just got a little payback.

528
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:54,554
Like I felt anything.

529
00:31:55,544 --> 00:32:02,394
Do you know what the first thing I'll say to you if we meet in our universe?

530
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:03,982
What?

531
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,310
Dang!

532
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:11,308
Dang!

533
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:13,125
Shut your mouth and eat.

534
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,549
They said I could get a taxi here.

535
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,082
Where is the taxi?

536
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:28,243
There’s none.

537
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,092
Come on.

538
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,604
You live in a fancy condo.

539
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:32,912
Don’t you have a car?

540
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:34,253
I do.

541
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,676
It’s in the garage.

542
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:39,267
Tess, the owner of this body, didn’t go soft on his car.

543
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,211
Need a tuk-tuk ride?

544
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:53,336
It’s budget-friendly.

545
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:55,948
How much to Charoen Krung Road?

546
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:57,665
Free of charge

547
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:01,098
if this man agrees to have a meal with me.

548
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,143
I like you.

549
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:06,532
Uh.

550
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:09,157
I’m good.

551
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:10,433
I’m already taken.

552
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,468
Oh, come on.

553
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:15,104
The excuse I’ve used a million times.

554
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:18,373
If you’re really taken, then where is the lucky one?

555
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,879
Here he is, my boyfriend.

556
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,541
What are you freakin’ doing, Tun?

557
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,978
No need to hide.

558
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,469
We are boyfriends.

559
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,982
We’ve been together forever.

560
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:41,423
Holding hands? Anyone can do that.

561
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,388
I dare you to kiss your boyfriend’s cheek.

562
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:47,286
Don’t do it.

563
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:49,884
Don’t.

564
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:50,609
Stay put.

565
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:51,448
- Don’t.
- Don’t move.

566
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:54,314
Okay!

567
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:56,308
I believe you.

568
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,451
Come on. I’ll give you a special discount.

569
00:33:58,451 --> 00:33:59,530
- Thank you.
- Come on.

570
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:03,641
See?

571
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,836
Trust me and things will be fine.

572
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,148
Well, well.

573
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:09,828
I already believe you. No more sweetness shown.

574
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:11,145
Get in.

575
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:16,244
Hold tight.

576
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,847
My ride is fast.

577
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,671
If you’re scared, hug each other. I don’t mind.

578
00:34:20,671 --> 00:34:21,635
Sure.

579
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:27,114
You fill in your info in this form.

580
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:29,090
It might help you find the portkey faster.

581
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:31,746
I hope they find your match soon.

582
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,169
Me too.

583
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,276
(If I can make you my wife…)

584
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,395
Your gear badge is also mine.

585
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:31,976
Damn!

586
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:34,730
There’s a password too?

587
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,128
What is this, a spy movie?

588
00:35:36,382 --> 00:35:37,174
Shut up.

589
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,081
Get in.

590
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,762
Why so grumpy?

591
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:50,091
Ah, I get it now.

592
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:53,051
I need to dream about a place and go to that place.

593
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,447
Then I’ll be able to go back home, right?

594
00:35:57,549 --> 00:35:58,530
That’s correct.

595
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,611
You’re right, handsome.

596
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:10,229
I just want the matching system we just built matches you and me.

597
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:12,968
Wait.

598
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:15,911
What matching system?

599
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:18,157
This.

600
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:19,018
Here.

601
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:28,128
You fill in your info in this form and it will match people with similarities.

602
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:30,721
It might help you find the portkey faster.

603
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,632
I will go prepare it for you.

604
00:36:35,795 --> 00:36:37,016
As for me,

605
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:43,092
anything questions at all, feel free to ask.

606
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:47,602
Ask away.

607
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:51,371
Show your face.

608
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,198
Shit.

609
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:56,691
It asks about your favorite movie director.

610
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,495
Who should I input?

611
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,516
Just answer.

612
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,120
Pick the one who directed your favorite movie.

613
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:05,171
Do you like Wes Anderson?

614
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:07,950
I do.

615
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,146
Really?

616
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:13,008
Which of his films is your favorite?

617
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:17,963
The Grand Budapest Hotel.

618
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:20,291
Like you read my mind.

619
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:22,425
Why do you like it?

620
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,012
I just like it.

621
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:31,187
Have you seen Her by Spike Jonze?

622
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:32,579
I have.

623
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:33,637
I like it too.

624
00:37:34,677 --> 00:37:35,445
We also match here.

625
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:38,885
Do you like the song Love by Paradox?

626
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:45,219
Does it sing…

627
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:50,248
♪ Oh dear love ♪

628
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,231
♪ Please look at me ♪

629
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:57,993
♪ Sometimes we meet on a heartbreaking day ♪

630
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:16,951
Am I right?

631
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:20,236
Precisely.

632
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:26,009
♪ You come in and embrace me softly ♪

633
00:38:26,363 --> 00:38:27,444
Yeah.

634
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,007
I like it too.

635
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:30,764
Shit!!

636
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:33,619
Do you seriously like everything I like?

637
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:35,557
No.

638
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:36,908
I just said what you wanted to hear.

639
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:39,691
You seem so happy when you know we share the same interests.

640
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:43,055
It’s like you truly believe I’m your portkey.

641
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:45,278
Asshole.

642
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:47,360
I was happy for nothing.

643
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:08,385
Once the system completes,

644
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:11,975
we should know who has the potential to be your portkey.

645
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,013
We will meet again then.

646
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,392
Okay. Thank you so much.

647
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:16,424
Thank you.

648
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:26,195
We should go live our lives then.

649
00:39:28,144 --> 00:39:30,456
I hope they find your match soon.

650
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:32,884
Me too.

651
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:35,570
I hope you find the right one.

652
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:38,871
See you.

653
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,891
See you.

654
00:39:42,612 --> 00:39:43,343
Good luck.

655
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:12,254
Tess.

656
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,886
What are you standing there for?

657
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:14,955
Come down here and study.

658
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,033
Yes.

659
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,502
Quickly.

660
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:24,614
Why does he look confused?

661
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:50,137
Hey.

662
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,406
I’ve been meaning to ask.

663
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:57,618
Why is nobody wearing a university uniform?

664
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:01,646
Where on earth have you been?

665
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:05,040
Uniforms were canceled ages ago.

666
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:07,930
Why?

667
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,862
It doesn’t have anything to do with study, does it?

668
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:12,510
It’s good they were canceled.

669
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:13,801
Guys!

670
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,290
The mid-term exam result just came out.

671
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,683
How is it?

672
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:21,342
Kita and I pass by a whisker.

673
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:23,750
And me?

674
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:25,525
Let me check.

675
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,221
Wow, Tess.

676
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,095
You’re awesome.

677
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,092
Number one of the class?

678
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:35,439
2 out of 30 scores.

679
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:37,943
Damn you, Tess.

680
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:40,300
Why are you so dumb?

681
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,580
Just realized that?

682
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,279
Do your best on the final exam.

683
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:45,639
You might still have a chance.

684
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:47,857
Though it’s very small.

685
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:04,399
Yes, Dol?

686
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:07,239
What?

687
00:42:08,096 --> 00:42:09,371
The matching is done?

688
00:42:43,202 --> 00:42:44,831
(Wait at the stairs in the middle.)

689
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,808
(Your match will come see you.)

690
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,750
Hey.

691
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:14,156
Are you sure your system works?

692
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,293
I don’t feel like we match at all.

693
00:43:16,718 --> 00:43:17,701
Stay put.

694
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,245
Eyes on me.

695
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:08,294
What’s the matter with you?

696
00:44:09,235 --> 00:44:10,533
The bees.

697
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:14,363
Be still.

698
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,757
Stay put.

699
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:21,749
I don’t want to get stung.

700
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,165
Eyes on me.

701
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:32,213
Don’t look at them.

702
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:52,089
See?

703
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:52,895
They’re gone.

704
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:57,113
Right.

705
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:03,061
How about a thank you?

706
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,476
Thank you, Mr. Smart.

707
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:09,469
Next time, stay still when you’re surrounded by bees.

708
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,561
The more you move, the bigger chance you’ll be stung.

709
00:45:12,392 --> 00:45:13,224
Yeah.

710
00:45:19,227 --> 00:45:20,004
Here.

711
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,251
For you.

712
00:45:22,061 --> 00:45:23,089
Hey.

713
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:25,749
Just what I want.

714
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:27,392
I’ll drink it now.

715
00:45:33,502 --> 00:45:34,758
That’s it?

716
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:36,140
You said you wanted it.

717
00:45:37,514 --> 00:45:39,515
I don’t want Tess’s body to get fat.

718
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Worried about your look, huh?

719
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:44,272
Don’t use Tess’s body as an excuse.

720
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:46,682
Worried about my health.

721
00:45:47,128 --> 00:45:51,032
Besides, Tess only has a small size of clothes.

722
00:45:51,343 --> 00:45:53,343
This drink has no sugar.

723
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:55,866
Don’t be afraid he’ll get fat.

724
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:58,217
Seriously?

725
00:45:58,597 --> 00:45:59,633
Yes.

726
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:01,009
You can drink it all.

727
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:02,780
Do it.

728
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,444
I bought it for you.

729
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:05,634
That’s it.

730
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:06,995
Drink it. Gulp.

731
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:09,248
Good job.

732
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:22,378
Stop that.

733
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:24,088
No.

734
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:26,655
I’ll keep knocking.

735
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:29,794
It’s annoying.

736
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:20,250
Bye. I’m leaving.

737
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:21,648
Hey!

738
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:23,091
Wait for me.

739
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:33,198
Hi, Dol.

740
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:35,231
So is Tun my match?

741
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:37,770
(Where are you guys?)

742
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:39,856
(Your matches can’t find you.)

743
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:41,217
Huh?

744
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,606
Our matches?

745
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:46,709
I thought Tun was my match.

746
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,918
(No! You have your own match.)

747
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:53,451
(I just told you guys to meet at the same place.)

748
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:04,787
So no?

749
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:06,771
No.

750
00:48:07,392 --> 00:48:09,202
I bet you’re happy you’re not my match.

751
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:10,731
Who told you?

752
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:13,014
I think…

753
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,231
- Hello.
- Hi.

754
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,144
My name is Som.

755
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:20,325
I’m Tun’s match.

756
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:21,802
Which one of you is Tun?

757
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:26,632
That’s me.

758
00:48:29,018 --> 00:48:30,471
Don’t use formal language with me.

759
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:31,963
We’re friends.

760
00:48:32,153 --> 00:48:33,567
Just call me Som.

761
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:35,567
I’ve been here for two months already.

762
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:36,462
I’m so lonely.

763
00:48:36,676 --> 00:48:39,223
Lucky us they have the matching system

764
00:48:40,062 --> 00:48:41,705
that brought me to meet a hot guy like you, Tun.

765
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:44,535
Should we go?

766
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:45,866
Come on. Let’s go.

767
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,111
Good luck to you.

768
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,832
And you…

769
00:49:09,485 --> 00:49:10,390
Prae.

770
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:12,626
What?

771
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:15,354
Prae.

772
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:18,653
Still can’t hear you.

773
00:49:19,605 --> 00:49:20,310
Forget it.

774
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:22,392
I’m Talay.

775
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:25,191
Nice to meet you.

776
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:28,083
Sure.

777
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,057
Okay.

778
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:39,632
Well?

779
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:42,392
I saw you have fun talking to her.

780
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,062
She’s the only one having fun.

781
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:47,167
She didn’t give me the chance to speak.

782
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:51,054
But my match didn’t even say a word.

783
00:49:51,974 --> 00:49:53,974
I don’t think the matching system works.

784
00:49:55,347 --> 00:49:56,229
Let me check.

785
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:01,840
Hello, Dol.

786
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,660
Are you sure your system works?

787
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:07,197
I don’t feel like I match her at all.

788
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:10,197
(Hey, it should work.)

789
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,260
(I was the one who submitted the data into the system.)

790
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:15,363
But I have a weird feeling.

791
00:50:15,942 --> 00:50:17,490
I don’t think it works.

792
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:21,556
(If you’re not sure, there is a way to check.)

793
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,440
How?

794
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,519
(People in the association have this rumor.)

795
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,756
(If you and your match enter the maze from a different entrance)

796
00:50:30,756 --> 00:50:34,738
(and wind up meeting inside, you might be each other’s portkey.)

797
00:50:37,797 --> 00:50:39,250
Sounds like a fantasy.

798
00:50:40,088 --> 00:50:41,208
Is it reliable?

799
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,072
(Better than not trying at all.)

800
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:01,466
This is exciting.

801
00:51:01,466 --> 00:51:03,130
The walk to find the true match.

802
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:05,020
Tun.

803
00:51:05,543 --> 00:51:07,392
I hope to see you inside.

804
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:08,447
Um.

805
00:51:10,615 --> 00:51:11,441
So…

806
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:13,400
Should we start from different entrances?

807
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:14,408
Sure.

808
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,148
I’ll use this entrance.

809
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:18,130
Bye, guys.

810
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:23,511
I’ll go that way.

811
00:51:37,488 --> 00:51:39,203
I’ll go in from here.

812
00:51:40,605 --> 00:51:41,398
Good luck.

813
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:42,712
Good luck.

814
00:54:29,956 --> 00:54:34,357
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

815
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:58,020
I'm starting to lose hope of ever finding the portkey.

816
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,824
It's extremely difficult to match someone.

817
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:02,018
When he comes,

818
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:04,001
he comes.

819
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:08,152
Don’t tell me after spending time together,

820
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,227
we turn out to be each other’s portkey.

821
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:14,182
That’s not a problem.

822
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:15,522
If it’s you,

823
00:55:16,409 --> 00:55:17,392
I’m okay.
