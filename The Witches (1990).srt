1
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:46,111
Ha ha ha ha!

2
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,798
Helga: When your father
was a boy like you

3
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
and living with me
here in Norway,

4
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,803
I told him
about witches, too,

5
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,806
so that he would
always be aware.

6
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,941
Now, the most
important thing

7
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:27,146
you should know about
real witches is this--

8
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,381
now listen
very carefully--

9
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,017
real witches dress
in ordinary clothes

10
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,254
and look very much
like ordinary women.

11
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,556
They live
in ordinary houses,

12
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:41,660
and they work
in ordinary jobs.

13
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,499
Every country
in the world has witches.

14
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,469
And there is a leader,

15
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,371
a high witch

16
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,772
of each country.

17
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:58,076
And the ruler
of all the witches

18
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,347
is the most evil woman
in creation--

19
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,784
the grand high witch...

20
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,553
Herself.

21
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,426
Witches spend their time

22
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,195
plotting to kill children,

23
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,463
stalking
the wretched child

24
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,100
like a hunter stalks
a bird in the forest.

25
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,735
Did they hunt you?

26
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,510
You said
it was an accident.

27
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,947
A very unpleasant
accident.

28
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,849
You know,
when I was younger,

29
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:42,120
I traveled the world in search
for the grand high witch,

30
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,555
but I never found her.

31
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,591
I don't really believe

32
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,759
that anyone
has ever found her.

33
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,762
So if no one's seen
the grand high witch,

34
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,764
how are you sure
she exists?

35
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,366
Nobody's ever seen
the devil,

36
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,368
but we know he exists,
don't we?

37
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,369
Yeah.

38
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,770
For all you know,

39
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,474
a witch might be living
next-door to you.

40
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,710
When I was little,

41
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,579
I lived beside a girl
called Erica,

42
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,616
who was taken
by a witch.

43
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,151
Erica had very
strict parents.

44
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,622
But even that
didn't save poor Erica,

45
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,991
because when a witch
chooses a victim,

46
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,494
there is only
one hope of escape--

47
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,197
knowing everything
about them

48
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,765
that I am telling you.

49
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm warning you.

50
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,436
Erica. Come in.

51
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,838
What makes her
dangerous

52
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,774
is the fact that she
doesn't<i> look</i> dangerous.

53
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,442
You can never be sure

54
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,778
if it's a witch
you are looking at

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,047
or a kind lady.

[Ribbet ribbet]

57
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,785
Ah, Erica.

58
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,721
How do you like
my new painting?

It's<i> magnifique,</i>

60
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,925
Go to Larsen's

61
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,327
and buy...

62
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,663
A liter of milk.
Hmm?

Come straight home.

<i> Ja, da.</i>

66
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,273
Real witches
hate children.

67
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,947
Real witches
are quite bald,

68
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,116
although, of course,
they wear wigs...

69
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,918
That itch...

70
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,421
And cause them
scalp rash.

71
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,589
Do you know
what scalp rash is?

72
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,191
No.

73
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,959
Itching under the wig.

74
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,595
It must drive them crazy.

75
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,498
They look quite hideous

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,301
behind their human
face masks

77
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:39,971
and can only be distinguished
from ordinary women

78
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,973
if you are sharp enough

79
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:46,445
to spot the purple tinge
to their eyes.

80
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:50,148
Real witches
have no toes.

81
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,851
Their feet
have square ends,

82
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,655
revolting stumps where
their toes should be,

83
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:00,625
so they never wear
pointed or pretty shoes--

84
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,662
just plain,
sensible shoes.

85
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:08,533
Remember these things.

86
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,471
Perhaps if Erica
had known them...

Ha ha!

00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,320
Helga: Oh, my poor Erica.

91
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,056
For weeks
they searched,

92
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,658
but witches
don't murder children

93
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,494
with knives or guns.

94
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:38,163
That's for people
who get caught,

95
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:42,768
and witches
never get caught.

96
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,970
They searched
for miles around.

97
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,773
Everyone in the town
searched,

98
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:52,077
but she had completely
disappeared.

99
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:02,654
I was there in Erica's house
six weeks later.

100
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,855
Good day,
frau Larsen.

101
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,258
Come in, Helga.
Have some cake.

102
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,861
Helga: I was her best friend
when it all happened.

103
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,864
Then that day,

104
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,867
while Erica's mother
was pouring the coffee,

105
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,137
her father came
walking towards us.

106
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,741
It was as though
he had seen a ghost.

107
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,743
His face
was all twisted up

108
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:28,346
as he walked towards
the painting behind me.

109
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,684
There, as if it
always had been there,

110
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,820
was Erica,

111
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,389
locked in the painting,

112
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,691
gazing at us.

113
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,294
Papa.

114
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,429
Papa.

115
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,831
I don't believe it.

116
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,899
You saw her in
the painting, grandma?

117
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,401
Many times.

118
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,636
But the peculiar thing

119
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,507
was that little Erica kept on
changing her position

120
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:56,908
in the picture.

121
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,444
So one day she'd be
feeding the ducks,

122
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,047
the next day she'd be
inside the farmhouse,

123
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,682
looking out of a window.

124
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,685
Did you see her
moving in the picture?

125
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,553
Nobody did.

126
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,556
She was always
just a figure

127
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,493
motionless
in the painting.

128
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:17,162
As the years went by,

129
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,765
Erica grew older,
too.

130
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,002
And only
five or six years ago,

131
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,005
the old woman
that Erica had become,

132
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,608
bent and frail
in the painting,

133
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,478
began to disappear...

134
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,715
Until one morning,

135
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,317
she was gone.

136
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,619
You mean she died?

137
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,953
Who knows?

138
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,757
Mysterious things go on
in the world of witches.

139
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,895
Hey,
it's almost 9:00.

140
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,130
Grandma's been tellin'
me about witches, mom.

141

And frightening you before
you're supposed to go to sleep.

142
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,068
Good night,
darling.

143
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,803
Everything all right,
mother?

144
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,138
Helga:
Very all right.

145
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,007
Go off. Enjoy
yourselves.

146
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,675
Good-bye,

Good night, son.

Good night, dad.

150
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,448
No more stories, ok?

151
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,919
Oh, no.

152
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,713
Come on, grandma.
Just one more story.

153
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,782
All right, then.
One more.

154
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,517
But very short.

155
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,553
Witches...

156
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,589
Are very cruel.

157
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,493
And they have a highly-developed
sense of smell.

158
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,697
A real witch could smell you
across the street

159
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,065
on a pitch-black night.

160
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,068
She couldn't smell<i> me.</i>
I just had a shower.

161
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,736
Oh, yes, she could.

162
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,104
The cleaner you are,

163
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,707
the more a witch
can smell you.

164
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,108
That doesn't make sense.

165
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,509
Oh, yes, it does.

166
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,512
A dirty child,
it's the dirt she smells.

167
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:18,183
A clean child,
it is the child.

and for giving you
a fright.

336
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,383
Is it all right

337
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,953
if I play with
William and Mary now?

338
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,621
Yes, of course.

339
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,963
[Squeak squeak]

340
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,140
Listen, Mary mouse,

341
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,276
when grandma gets better,
we're goin' with her

342
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,344
to a hotel by the ocean.

343
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,312
You've never been
to the ocean.

344
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,081
I'll tell you, it's big.

345
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,650
Ha ha ha ha!

346
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,027
Wow! Look
at the hotel, grandma.

347
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,163
It's not half bad.

348
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,643
Welcome, madam.

349
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:39,710
Thank you very much.

350
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,345
I think it'll be
a nice day, yes?

351
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,947
Can you manage,
Luke?

352
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:43,948
Yeah.

353
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,016
Yes.

354
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,100
Luke...

355
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,137
Come on.
There we go.

356
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,375
Oh, welcome,
miss Ernst.

357
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,510
Nicola Cole.

358
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,111
I've been so
looking forward

359
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,313
to meeting you.

360
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,514
You look
marvelous.

361
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,283
Wish I could say
the same for you.

362
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,585
Ah, miss Ernst.

363
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,554
I am the owner
of the hotel.

364
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,889
We're very happy
to have you.

365
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,959
Delighted. Shall I sign
or something?

366
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,560
No. Everything
will be fine.

367
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,162
This is my secretary.

368
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,164
Oh, yes.
How are you?

369
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,465
Ah, ladies.

370
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,200
Ina Clay
Beckman.

371
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,201
Indeed.

372
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,502
Julia Whitman.

373
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,504
Julia, yes.
Where are you from?

374
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,505
Dallinger.

375
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,540
Ah, yes.

Lois leffour
from southampton.

377

Lois.

[Excitedly]
Ohh! Ohh!

379
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,257
In there, I think.

380
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,959
That's where
you must live.

381
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,563
Oh, um, the carpetbag
on the bed, please.

382
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,598
I'll have
a wash and brush-up

383
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,967
while you explore
the place, Luke.

384
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,936
And then we shall
have tea together,

385
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,538
and you'll show me
around, yes?

386
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,539
Thank you.

387
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,141
Don't
lock me out.

388
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,844
I promise I won't.

389
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,520
Hmph.

390
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,123
You look wonderful,
miss Ernst.

391
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,925
Oh, we<i> are</i> looking forward
to this afternoon!

392
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,327
Mmm.

393
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,230
<i> Allez.</i>

394
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,533
What are you doin'?

395
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,668
Oh! The raisins
are all around

396
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,670
the edge of these cakes.

397
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,272
They're really good!

398
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,340
Thanks.

399
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,976
My name's Luke.

Bruno Jenkins.

401
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,882
The cucumber sandwiches
are all right, too--

402
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,852
except when they use
margarine instead of butter.

403
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,822
How much pocket money
do you get?

404
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,925
My dad's rich,
but he's very tight.

405
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,560
We've got three cars.

406
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:43,861
Hello, boys.

407
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,630
I hope there's butter
in the sandwiches today.

408
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,633
I really do
hate margarine.

409
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,670
Ah, you've got those
excellent cakes again.

410
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,572
There should be
14 of--

411
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,273
aah! Aah!

412

Mr. stringer!

413
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,542
Oh! Oh!

414
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,944
Shh, shh.
What happened?

415
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,947
I went in
to turn down the bed,

416
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,548
and they were there.

417
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,549
What?

418
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,951
White and disgusting
little--

419
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,552
now, look. Calm down.

420
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,821
[Sobs]

421
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,097
[Knock on door]

422
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,668
Is this<i> your</i> room?

423
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,669
Yes.

424
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,670
Yes?

425
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,672
I see.
I'm sorry, madam,

426
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,675
but I cannot permit
mice in my hotel.

427
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,344
How dare you
say that

428
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,946
when your rotten hotel
is full of rats anyway?

429
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,083
Rats? There are no
rats in this hotel.

430
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,718
I saw one
this morning

431
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,287
running along the corridor
into the kitchens.

432
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,424
Madam, you only
arrived in the hotel

433
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,625
this afternoon.

434
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,926
Ahh, morning,
afternoon.

435
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,929
I saw a rat
in your hotel,

436
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,532
and if matters
do not improve,

437
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:55,900
I'll shall have to
report you

438
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,269
to the public
health authorities.

439
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:00,805
Look...

440
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,373
Madam,
I'm not prepared--

441
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,307
the cakes
in the lounge

442
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,242
are nibbled
around the edges, too.

443
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,377
I can show you.

444
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,212
Helga: If you are not
careful, the health people

445
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:12,383
will order the whole hotel
closed before everyone gets

446
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:13,184
typhoid fever.

447
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,119
You can't be
serious, madam.

448
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,388
I have never been
more serious in my life.

449
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,459
Now, will you or will you
not let my grandchild

450
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:25,963
keep his hygienic and
perfectly harmless pet mice?

451
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,670
Uh...Well...

452
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,405
Well, if they are
kept in the cage

453
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,706
and only
in this room,

454
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,575
nowhere else
in the hotel...

455
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,709
Agreed.

456
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,478
Very well.

457
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,956
Grandma, I can't
train my mice

458
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,958
if they're
in a cage.

459
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Nibbled cakes, indeed.

460
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:59,697
There were, only it was
a boy called Bruno Jenkins.

461
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,699
I'm teaching
William and Mary

462
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,634
how to be
tightrope walkers.

463
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,002
Mm-hmm!

464
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,571
I brought some of the circus
I'm building with me.

465
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,273
Good. Show me.

466
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,010
Let's see.

467
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,713
Look. I'm planning
them a major house.

468
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,715
Rampways here.
A bathtub.

469
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,116
This elevator's
pretty neat.

470
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,119
You really did this
yourself? It's good.

471
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,088
It's really good.
I'm impressed.

472
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,257
Of course you must
train your mice,

473
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,424
but you must not
get caught,

474
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,893
and you must not
do it in here,

475
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:32,696
'cause if that hysterical
maid comes back...

476
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,965
Well, now it's teatime.

477
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:38,702
I just love
English hotel teas.

478
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,372
Cream cakes
and shortbread

479
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,373
and, uh--

480
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,240
no, grandma.

481
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,742
No cream cakes.
No cream cakes.

482
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,143
No shortbread,
either.

483
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,279
It's full of sugar.
I shall end up eating

484
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,180
the same diet
as your mice.

485
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,416
That's the trouble
with this country.

486
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,617
A queue for everything.

487
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,220
They wouldn't think
to have two tea trolleys.

488
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,822
That'd be too convenient
for the paying guests.

489
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,958
They'll want
two lumps of ice

490
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,359
in their whiskey
next. Ha ha ha!

491
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,729
They'd queue for their own
funerals if they could.

492
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,132
I know that woman
from somewhere,

493
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:12,036
but I can't for the life
of me remember where.

494
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,440
Her face
is so familiar.

495
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,009
Which one?

496
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,411
My memory's going.

497
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:23,414
But it's as if
i met her before.

498
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,050
She's probably

Oh, no. Sugar.

504
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,065
Grandma,
sugar can kill you.

505
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,533
I know, but
it was very little,

very little,
my dear.

Something very odd
is going on.

Are you listening to me?
You'll have some fresh air

509
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,044
if I have to take you
out by your ear.

510
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,646
We didn't come here
for you to sit eating

511
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,047
and watching telly
all day.

the lovely sunshine.

there playing in the water.

your knife.

515
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,354
Just like your father.

516
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,662
Good afternoon,

all right now?

Yes, yes.
Fine, fine.

520
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,406
And what are you
going to do now?

521
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,907
I'm going to take
William and Mary

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,275
and explore
this place.

523

All right. Just don't get
into trouble, will you?

524
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,246
I won't.

Come on.

Excuse me, please.

All right,
that's fine.

Carry on with
the rest of them.

will go back
to your homes

629

and resign
from your jobs.

what these shops are worth.

when all our plans
are prepared,

647
00:34:56,995 --> 00:35:01,965

with free sweets,
candies, and chocolates

getting caught?

00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:34,558
that prevents it from
working until two hours

But more
than five doses

breaks
the delay barrier,

691

works instantly.

at precisely 4:15,

719

I put one dose
of my formula

on a bar
of chocolate.

721
