Nope. No girl back in Texas.

Took me my entire freshman year
to get a water.

312
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,745
‐ This is my sister, Pilar.

313
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,497
‐ Hi, I'm Mia. Uh, may I?

314
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,251
So, uh, how's day one going?

315
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,337
‐ Great. I made a ton of friends.

316
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,380
People here are so nice.

317
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,716
‐ Somebody trolling you? Who?

318
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,386
[inaudible]

319
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,724
[chuckles] Alison King and Katie Ellis.
Don't worry about them.

320
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,977
They're gonna get pregnant
and drop out. Trust me.

321
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,439
Anyway, yeah, forget about those losers.
You'll find your people.

322
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,608
‐ My people are back in Texas.

323
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,945
And even though that sounds like
a bad country song, it's true.

324
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,404
[beeping]

325
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,949
[clattering]

326
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,286
‐ She seems really upset.

327
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,456
‐ Yeah. Yeah, she always is.

328
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,624
‐ I get it.

329
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,585
I mean, I was a total disaster
my freshman year.

330
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,213
I can't imagine transferring
on top of everything.

331
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,007
‐ Hey. Victor, right?

332
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,635
I just donated to your GoFundMe.
Good luck, man.

333
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,220
‐ What GoFundMe?

334
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,724
Who started it?
BOY: Andrew started it.

335
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,936
To help you join the basketball team.
'Cause you're poor, or whatever.

336
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,354
No offense. [chuckles]

337
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,274
My GoFundMe was the best.
It helped me fund my trip to Israel.

338
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,239
‐ Excuse me.

339
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,744
Yo, what the hell?

340
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,204
ANDREW:
Oh. Hey, man. How ya doin'?

341
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,622
‐ You started a GoFundMe?

342
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,709
‐ It sounded like those basketball dues
were gonna be a little steep, so...

343
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,712
I sent a link around,
and people actually donated.

344
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:04,298
‐ Just shut it down.

345
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,134
ANDREW: Shut it down.
[laughing]

346
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,471
Listen, man. There is nothing
that you need to be ashamed of.

347
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,849
Yeah, I heard you're living
in Lone Stone's building.

348
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,893
I know money's a little tight
on that side of town,

349
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,978
so really, anything I can do
to help out the needy...

350
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,521
‐ You're just trying to humiliate me

351
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,565
because I destroyed you
in that basketball game.

352
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,567
‐ [laughs] Oh, you think I give a shit
about some stupid

353
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,569
gym class basketball game?

354
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,571
‐ Yeah. I do.

355
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,410
‐ He's crazy.
[students chattering]

356
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,245
‐ Just give everyone their money back.

357
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,747
‐ You got it.

358
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,582
CROWD:
Ooh!

359

[indistinct chatter]

360
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,050
‐ You okay?

361
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:55,057
‐ Ow, ow! Get it, new kid!

362
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,392
‐ I'm fine.

363
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,353
BOY:
Whoo!

364
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,278
‐ Hey, I'm sorry about what happened.
Andrew is a dick.

365
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,655
‐ Yeah.

366
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,282
‐ I did think you should probably
know that Lake, um,

367
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,661
she published a post about you
on Creek Secrets.

368
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,500
‐ Perfect.

369
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,505
‐ I think you could still
come back from this.

370
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,257
You just gotta show everyone
it was a one‐off,

371
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,968
and no better way to do that
than to hit up the Winter Carnival.

372
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,678
So, what time should we head over? Seven?

373
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:33,971
I can swing by your place,

374
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,514
or we could just hang out till then‐‐
‐ Please, just stop talking.

375
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,016
I don't want to go to
the Winter Carnival with you, Felix.

376
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,018
I don't know you. We're not friends.

377
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,895
We're just two guys that happen
to live in the same building.

378
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,272
‐ Okay.

379
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,732
Yeah. Totally.

380
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:47,818
ARMANDO:
...on the move!

381
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,195
ISABEL: God, you're making me
feel like I'm a crazy person!

382
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,031
[Armando speaking Spanish]

383
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,700
ISABEL:
[sighs] Please don't tell me to calm down.

384
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,661
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

385
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,454
We pull them out of school
in the middle of the year.

386
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,583
We take them away from everyone
that they love‐‐
ARMANDO: You are so dramatic.

387
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,209
ISABEL: Okay...
ARMANDO: Please, I just need you
to be positive.

388
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,254
Remember, this is for our family.
ISABEL: [chuckling] Oh, my G‐‐

389
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,174
Victor. Hi.

390
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,801
‐ Papi, why are you home so early?

391
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,344
‐ Because of the fight.

392
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,848
‐ Oh, yeah.
Your sister shoved a girl into a wall,

393
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,058
and now she's got a week of detention.
‐ What?

394
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,310
ISABEL: Yeah.
‐ Why?

395
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,104
‐ This girl and her friends wouldn't stop
calling Pilar these terrible names.

396
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,981
She had it coming.
‐ She had it coming?

397
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:29,318
‐ Yeah. Yeah.
‐ This is why she's like this.
She gets it from you.

398
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,236
ARMANDO: [scoffs]
Wait, now what is that supposed to mean?

399
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,447
Really, no. [speaking Spanish]
‐ Guys, guys, guys. Come on, come on.

400
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,073
It was just a rough first day.

401
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,034
She takes a while to get adjusted
to new things.

402
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:39,578
Like, like, you remember
when Adrian was born?

403
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,205
She would call him "the creature."

404
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:45,709
And then three weeks later,
he was "her creature."

405
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,461
She wouldn't put him down.

406
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,635
‐ You're right. You're right.
She just, she needs some time.

407
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,512
Thank you.

408
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,263
And...

409
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,224
how was your first day?

410
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,392
‐ Yeah.

411
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,357
‐ Ah... [exhales] It was, it was great.

412
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:10,567
Um, I really like it here.

413
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,653
‐ Oh.

414
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,988
Well, that makes me happy.
‐ [laughing] Yeah.

415
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,657
[distant loud rock music playing]

416
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,618
‐ What part of
"quietly think about your actions"

417
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:22,829
did you not understand?
‐ I, I'll talk to her.

418
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,790
ISABEL: Thank you.
ARMANDO: Of course.

419
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,921
‐ It looks great in here, Mama.
ISABEL: Yeah?

420
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,674
[distant music stops]
Yeah, I spent today trying to fix it up.

421
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,843
Make it feel like us, you know?

422
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,514
‐ Hey, is everything okay?

423
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,516
Between you and Dad?

424
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,063
It's just, like, these last few months...

425
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,067
I don't know.
You just didn't used to fight so much.

426
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,865
‐ Well, marriage is hard sometimes,
mi amor.

427
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,867
Even the really good ones.

428
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,538
I don't know, I just spend so much time...

429
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,707
pretending that I'm not...

430
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,459
worried about what's gonna happen to us.
And...

431
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,339
I don't know.
All that pretending, it can just be so‐‐

432
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,757
‐ Exhausting.

433
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,134
‐ Yes.

434
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,806
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't burden you with this.

435
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,727
But you've always been my strong one.

436
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:33,650
For everyone else in this family,
I pray for guidance.

437
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,694
I pray for help.

438
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,782
But for you, mi lindo,
I just say thank you.

439
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,493
Thank you, Jesus, for my rock.

440
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,539
At least I never have to worry about you.

Dear Simon,

444
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,969
you don't know me,
but my family just moved to Atlanta,

445
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,013
and today was my first day
at Creekwood High,
