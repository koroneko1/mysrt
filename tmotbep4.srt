1
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,840
Do you want to be an actor?

2
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,960
If I play a character written by you,

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I'll get to see you more, won't I?

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,879
Not to crush your dreams,

5
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,960
but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

6
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,639
Now that I have the opportunity,

7
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,680
I want to give it a shot.

8
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Which one is your dad then?

9
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,879
Who does he think he is

10
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,919
to poke his nose into our business?

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
Before you lay blame on other people,

12
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,960
why don't you ask yourself

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,680
who it is

14
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,039
that's causing her the most distress.

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,080
Does that mean--

16
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,759
Na's husband is not Saen.

17
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,560
I only found out later
that he was dating Na.

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,759
You think

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
that I stole Saen from Na, don't you?

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I…

21
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,439
Well…

22
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
That's okay.

23
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,759
A lot of people think like that.

24
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,599
But the truth is,

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,800
it was Na who left Saen.

26
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,039
She chose to marry Sibmeun.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,879
She left him?

28
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,560
She seemed to love him very much.

29
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,560
I think I know why she did it.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,199
She was dealing with many problems

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,919
with her house and her grandmother.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,639
Saen was too busy working.

33
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,000
She ended up turning to Sibmeun.

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,439
He was a dependable military man.

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,360
He was someone she could rely on.

36
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,360
That's how they became close
and got married.

37
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,319
When I married Saen,

38
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Nut was around two years old.

39
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,039
I don't know how to describe
the way I'm feeling.

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,879
It's like the world
has suddenly turned upside down.

41
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,319
Bottom becomes top.

42
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,560
Left becomes right.

43
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
Like a tree

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,120
whose branches grow into the ground,

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
pointing its roots to the sky.

46
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,959
Like rain

47
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,199
which pours reversely to the sky.

48
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,680
Like a cocoon that turns into a dragonfly.

49
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,639
The human world is different
and more much complicated than my world.

50
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,600
One person's truth might not be another's.

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,720
When I was a teddy bear,
I never knew what pain was.

52
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,199
But I know it now.

53
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,959
It is this kind of pain

54
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,480
that makes Mrs. Na wish
to forget the past.

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,680
Come eat and take your pills, Grandma.

56
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,759
Grandma!

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Grandma!

58
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,279
Grandma.

59
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
What's wrong, Na?

60
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,519
I don't know. Please help her, Sibmeun.

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,959
Thanks again for your help.

62
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,199
Without you, who knows
what would have happened?

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,079
I'm glad I could help.

64
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,120
Luckily, Saen called and told me
he was caught up at work.

65
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,040
He asked me to check
on your grandmother for him,

66
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
so I got there in time.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,639
He said

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
that he wanted to come and see her
once he was finished working,

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,040
but he said something else came up.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
He may not be able to come.

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
In that case,
let me buy you dinner to say thank you.

72
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,759
I insist.

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
This dish is really delicious.
Here are their recommended dishes.

74
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,519
This one is really good.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Right.

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,959
Here's what I owe you.
This is the first installment.

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
I'll pay you back

78
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,399
all the money you loaned me.

79
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,120
You knew?

80
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,839
Who told you?

81
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,680
It doesn't matter who told me.

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Just know I won't take advantage of you.

83
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,680
But I wanted you to have this money.

84
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't want it back.

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
But I must repay you.

86
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,759
Thank you…

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,319
for the trouble you went to.

88
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
You paid my mortgage

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,839
and my grandmother's medical bills.

90
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,920
You must be sick of helping me.

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
You won't have to anymore.

92
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,959
I'm returning this to you.

93
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
What do you mean?

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,600
It's Sibmeun, isn't it?

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,360
It has nothing to do with him.

96
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,439
I made this decision on my own.

97
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,480
The other night,
Grandma's condition got worse.

98
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,839
Sibmeun promised her
he would take care of me.

99
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,800
And I think it makes sense.

100
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,439
We're getting married,
so Grandma won't have to worry.

101
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,360
Here he is.

102
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,560
Please excuse me.

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
Bye.

104
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,720
Whether you are separated
in life or by death, the pain is the same.

105
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,799
It's because of this torture and pain

106
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,600
that humans choose to forget.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
-Where are you?
-Mrs. Na.

108
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,240
When you face
the worst kind of grief like that,

109
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,399
the only way to survive

110
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,200
is to forget and create a new reality.

111
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,799
One where you won't get hurt
or be upset ever again.

112
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,080
Don't worry.

113
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,320
Thank you, both of you,

114
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,919
for convincing Mom to go see a doctor.

115
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,279
Na isn't a stranger to us.
We're happy to help.

116
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,200
I didn't know that she had stopped
taking her medication.

117
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,679
She always goes by herself

118
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,559
for her appointments.

119
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,159
But she lied to the doctor.

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't blame yourself.

121
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
Now that you know about it,

122
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,559
you can take better care of your mom.

123
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,600
And her condition isn't as bad
as it was before.

124
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,919
I think that's a good sign.

125
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,360
But I still don't get it.

126
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
Why won't Mom accept the truth?

127
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,200
Some truths are not easy to accept,

128
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,279
especially the ones that left scars.

129
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,120
You want to bury them as deep as possible.

130
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,480
Those who are strong can handle the truth.

131
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,159
It doesn't affect them.

132
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,840
But for some people,

133
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,360
it's just too much to bear.

134
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,679
In order to accept the truth,

135
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,759
you must first accept
that you have been scarred.

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,960
Your mom may have some scars

137
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,759
that she can't bear to face right now.

138
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,519
You've got to give her time.

139
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,879
Give her some time, Nut.

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,960
Hang in there.

141
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,120
-Mom.
-Na.

142
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Na.

143
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Come to our house sometime, Nut.

144
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,679
Bring your mom with you
for a change of pace.

145
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,679
I'll cook you guys something nice.

146
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,679
I'll take your offer for that.

147
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,240
Don't bail on us,
or I'll have to eat everything.

148
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll take my mom home, then.

149
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,759
Thank you.

150
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,519
Na.

151
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Excuse me.

152
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,519
Mr. Saen?

153
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,200
-You are…
-I'm Sitha.

154
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,679
Have some coffee.

155
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,279
Thank you.

156
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,879
Long time no see.

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,279
It must be eight or nine years
since Sibmeun passed away.

158
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,679
I don't come around this way very often.
Just once in a while.

159
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
I had some business today.

160
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,919
I just saw Nut and Na.

161
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,159
Is Na sick?

162
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, it's her old condition.

163
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
It has come back?

164
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,600
I've heard she got better.

165
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,879
She is better, but she's still sick.

166
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,720
Nut just found out
that she stopped taking her pills,

167
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,360
so her condition got worse.

168
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,120
But she's seeing a doctor now.
That should help.

169
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,159
Nut found someone to look after her.

170
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,639
If you're worried about her,
go visit her sometime.

171
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,639
She would be happy to see you.

172
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:01,919
Are you hungry, Mom?

173
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,960
I'll order you something.

174
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
You can eat and take your pills.

175
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Mom.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
I have to get back to work.

177
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,320
Call me if you need anything.

178
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,759
Your mom

179
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,879
may have some scars

180
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,679
that she can't bear to face right now.

181
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,919
Give her some time, Nut.

182
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,000
Have you told Nut about this?

183
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,559
He wouldn't want to hear it.

184
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,879
You know when I talk about Saen,

185
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,080
Nut always gets angry.

186
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:25,039
I wonder if he's angry
because he doesn't believe me…

187
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,919
or that he doesn't like me.

188
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,480
Everything I do seems to be wrong.

189
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Mom.

190
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,679
I'm sorry…

191
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,480
Although she isn't ready
to see the picture,

192
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,559
I still think you should keep it.

193
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,799
She might want to see it someday.

194
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,720
Before you worry about me,

195
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,319
worry about yourself first.

196
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,200
I know what happened

197
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,519
between your mom and Mr. Saen.

198
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,039
Jan told me everything.

199
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,279
Didn't I tell you

200
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,279
not to talk to her
as long as you're living here?

201
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,119
I know that.

202
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,799
But she's telling the truth, isn't she?

203
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,960
Your mom has the wrong idea about Saen.

204
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,839
That's why you try to make her forget him.

205
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,079
But I can't do it.

206
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,920
Now, my mom is in love
with someone else's husband.

207
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,119
It's too bad.

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You know about it,
but you can't do anything.

209
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,880
That's worse than not knowing.

210
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,319
You must have been shocked
when you found out.

211
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,480
I was so shocked
that I didn't know what to say.

212
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,400
I don't know what to do about it.

213
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,839
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,680
What for?

215
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,599
I've always thought
that you were mean to your mom.

216
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,920
But she was mean to you too,

217
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,559
even if she didn't mean it.

218
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,279
I'm sorry too.

219
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,039
Why?

220
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,880
I hurt you,

221
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,599
though you did nothing wrong.

222
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,279
You just didn't know.

223
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,200
Everyone who comes near me gets hurt.

224
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,240
It's all right.

225
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,200
I wasn't hurt or angry with you.

226
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,279
I know how much pain you're in.

227
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,960
It must be a hundred times
worse than this wound.

228
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,319
How come you get me,
even with your amnesia?

229
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,640
Even my friends and family don't get me.

230
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,200
It's all right, Nut.

231
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
Even if the world doesn't get you,

232
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,039
I'll always try to understand you.

233
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,200
I will be here for you.

234
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
You don't have to be strong all the time.

235
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,519
Don't fake a smile

236
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,480
when you want to cry.

237
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,640
When you're sad,
don't think that no one is there for you.

238
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,839
Although that teddy bear is gone,

239
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,279
you still have me.

240
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,880
I will hold you in its place.

241
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,400
Horrible things happened
to Nut and his mom yesterday,

242
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,759
but at least something good came of it.

243
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,559
Hang on.

244
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,039
It's not what Jan and Nhong
always gossip about.

245
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,160
The good thing that happened

246
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,519
is I got to hug Nut last night,

247
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,920
and he hugged me back.

248
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,720
I hope it cheered him up a little.

249
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,599
That would make me so happy.

250
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,559
Why am I thinking about him?

251
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,680
I'm going crazy.

252
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
Come on, son.

253
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,119
Here's some hot shrimp porridge.

254
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,920
Wow.

255
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,079
It looks great, Dad.

256
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,599
Eat up, then. Isn't it your favorite?

257
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,960
It was Neung's favorite.

258
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,440
But…

259
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,279
But I like it too.

260
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,799
If Neung was still here,
there wouldn't be any left for me.

261
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,440
It has been ten years now.

262
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,559
Time flies.

263
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,640
Dad, let's go make merit for Neung.

264
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,480
Sure, choose where we'll do it.

265
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
I already have an idea.

266
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,240
What is it?

267
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,319
I want to donate some sports equipment

268
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,440
to a school that needs it.

269
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,720
Neung loved basketball.

270
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,559
How about we donate some basketballs?

271
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,519
Sure, son.

272
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,599
I know a guy
who owns a basketball factory.

273
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,559
He should give us a discount.

274
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,920
That's great, Dad.
We can get a good price.

275
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,480
All right. Eat your food
before it gets cold.

276
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,680
No. You eat up.

277
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,480
Won't you season it?

278
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,960
No need, Dad. Your cooking is the best.

279
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,160
Wow.

280
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,839
It's delicious, Dad.

281
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,640
Whoa.

282
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
You just appeared like a ghost.

283
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,599
No ghost is this handsome.

284
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,759
Hey.

285
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,880
What do you want?

286
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,000
I came to see if you were up.
Did you sleep well?

287
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,960
I did.

288
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,519
What about you?

289
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,319
Does your wound still hurt?

290
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,519
Seeing you happy takes my pain away.

291
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,480
If you need someone to hold you again,

292
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,119
just let me know.

293
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,039
I will happily volunteer.

294
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,519
Mom.

295
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,319
I woke up late and got flustered.

296
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,079
I guess we should give him a bath.

297
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,680
What a drag.

298
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,440
I'll help.

299
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,799
I'm ready, Nut.

300
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,839
What are you doing with a toothbrush?

301
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,200
Well…

302
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,599
You told me to brush my teeth
after a bath.

303
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,839
I'm giving Kuenchai a bath, not you.

304
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,640
Put that away and get me the hose.

305
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,680
I'll get back at you later, Kuenchai.

306
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
What did you say?

307
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,759
Nothing.

308
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,400
Turn the water on.

309
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Okay.

310
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,599
Stop it, Tofu!

311
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,680
Hose Kuenchai down, not me.

312
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Okay.

313
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
Tofu! Stop it!

314
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,640
That's it.

315
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,359
I'll do it myself. You hold Kuenchai.

316
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Go on.

317
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,240
Hold him down.

318
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,799
Nut, Tofu.

319
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,839
What are you guys doing?

320
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,160
It was nothing.

321
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,880
We were giving the dog a bath
and we slipped.

322
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
That's all.

323
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,319
Really?

324
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,440
Yes, Nut slipped.

325
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,119
I was going to help him up,

326
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,079
but then he got up.

327
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,319
And then…

328
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,559
And then?

329
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,799
And then what?

330
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,839
And then you walked in.

331
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,759
It's always like this.

332
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,279
Kuenchai won't stay still,
and he's very strong.

333
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,680
Nut and I always fall on our faces
when we give him a bath.

334
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,759
You must have been shocked.

335
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,799
Stay and have dinner with us.

336
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
It's my treat.

337
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,079
Okay, Mrs. Na.

338
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,599
Hey.

339
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,519
What are you doing here?

340
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't tell me you don't have food at home.

341
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,000
Come on. Dinner is just a bonus.

342
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,799
I need you to check my work.

343
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,200
Pribpree.

344
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,839
Why can't we speak inside?

345
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,960
I need to clear things up with you.

346
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,679
I want to know
whether you like Nut or not.

347
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,159
What?

348
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,920
Why are you surprised?

349
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,559
Nut is so irresistibly charming.

350
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,039
No man or woman can resist his charm.

351
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,079
Plus, you've lost your memory.

352
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,840
I don't know if you were into men
or women before this.

353
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,480
I don't trust you.

354
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,039
So, do you want Nut to be your boyfriend?

355
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,159
Boyfriend?

356
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,199
What do you mean?

357
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,000
I only want to be a bear.

358
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,719
A bear?

359
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
I guess your memory is still hazy.

360
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,679
Let's put it like this.

361
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,719
Seeing someone romantically…

362
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,679
it's that feeling you get
when you really like someone.

363
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
When you're near them

364
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,119
and lock eyes with them,

365
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,199
your heart starts beating fast.

366
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,199
But my heart is beating right now.
Does this mean I like you?

367
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,440
Come on. Everyone has a heartbeat.

368
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,440
Or else you would be dead.

369
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,480
It's another kind of heartbeat.

370
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,159
It's like your heart will beat
through your chest.

371
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,679
You feel like you're floating on air,

372
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
and you're the only people in the world.

373
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,800
When I locked eyes with Nut earlier,

374
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,480
-my heart was beating really fast.
-What?

375
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,679
But I think it was from chasing Kuenchai.

376
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,880
I saw a documentary.

377
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,119
When you're tired,
your heart beats a little faster.

378
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,079
I don't think I like Nut like that.

379
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,679
Really?

380
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,079
Really.

381
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,760
If he's not your type,

382
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,800
can you do me a favor?

383
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,280
What favor?

384
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,000
Can you get Nut to like me?

385
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,039
Make him want to be my boyfriend.

386
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,519
Of course.

387
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,639
Really?

388
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,920
You're the sweetest.

389
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,679
Thank you so much.

390
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
So tell me,

391
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,119
what's a boyfriend?

392
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,440
Do I have to explain it all over again?

393
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yes.

394
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,800
Whatever you know about Nut, spit it out.

395
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,280
I'm ready to hear it.

396
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,880
Then let's start.

397
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,239
Nut likes to read.

398
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,039
He likes to read everything.

399
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,280
He likes poems, novels,
history, and travel guides.

400
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,119
He also likes picture books.

401
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,159
I remember there's one book
he really likes.

402
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,599
He once told me

403
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,079
that besides reading books,

404
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,280
you can also read people who read books.

405
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,880
That's cool. It sounds like something
a writer would say.

406
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,519
What else does he like, other than books?

407
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,960
Well…

408
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,559
He likes to watch TV series.

409
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,119
He enjoys watching everything.

410
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,840
He can stay up all night
watching something he likes.

411
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,679
Sometimes he even forgets about his mom.

412
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,880
I see.

413
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
That's why he never replies
to my late-night texts.

414
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,920
And things he doesn't like?

415
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,920
He doesn't like vegetables.

416
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
He doesn't like anyone
going into his room.

417
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,920
He doesn't like the lady next door.

418
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,360
And…

419
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,800
he doesn't like having me around.

420
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
Come on. You're overthinking it.

421
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,519
Who wouldn't want
a cute little guy like you around?

422
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,800
Am I right? Don't be so dramatic.

423
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,119
Let's continue.

424
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,079
Okay.

425
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,280
Do you know any of his secrets?

426
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,119
Something nobody else knows.

427
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,679
Things he does in the bedroom
or what he keeps under his bed.

428
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,119
There's nothing under his bed.

429
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,199
I mean…

430
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,760
I mean that kind of stuff.

431
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,519
You know?

432
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,960
I see. Nut likes to sleep shirtless.

433
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,519
Shirtless?

434
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,199
When he's drunk, he sleeps
with no pants on.

435
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,199
No pants?

436
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,320
He gets hot easily.

437
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,519
He always comes out of the shower naked.

438
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,519
But when I do it, he gives me an earful.

439
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,239
Pribpree.

440
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,000
Pribpree.

441
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,960
Do you both take your pants off?

442
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,880
That's right.

443
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,480
Wait a minute.
I thought you didn't remember anything.

444
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,119
You know so much about him.
It's like you've known him for years.

445
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,519
And that shower thing,

446
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,360
how did you see that?

447
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,519
-Well--
-Spit it out.

448
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,599
I…

449
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,119
I heard about it from his mom and Gen.

450
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I haven't been here long.

451
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,880
I don't know him as well as you do.

452
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,679
I don't know what he likes

453
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,000
or how he is when he's at work.

454
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:38,440
These things take time.

455
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,119
I've worked with him for three months.

456
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,199
But it feels like three years.

457
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,880
Is that so?

458
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,079
So what is Nut like at work?

459
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,000
He's very focused on his work.

460
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,199
When he's working,

461
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,760
he's all cool and serious.

462
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,920
He looks ten times cooler than usual.

463
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,239
But when there's urgent work,

464
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,719
he likes to go off and work by himself.

465
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,599
When he has writer's block,

466
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,719
he likes to make himself strong coffee.

467
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,239
No milk, no sugar.

468
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,639
He made coffee for me once.

469
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,639
That's right. He likes coffee.

470
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,679
I should make him coffee.

471
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,480
Where's the coffee maker, Tofu?

472
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,079
Here's some strong, hot coffee

473
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:49,719
with a little sweetness
from the maker for you.

474
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,159
Nut.

475
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,199
That's Nut's shirt.

476
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,360
Kuenchai. No.

477
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,840
Don't you think you went too far?

478
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,880
Pribpree bought me that shirt.
I can do whatever I want with it.

479
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,559
She bought you that shirt
because she adores you.

480
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,400
But I'm not into her.

481
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,840
It's my day off and she's at my house.

482
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,519
I sneaked out here to work.
Can you be quiet?

483
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,960
Jeez, Nut.

484
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,559
Whose house are you at? Mind your manners.

485
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,719
It's my house.

486
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,559
Eat up. Let me know if you want more.

487
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,559
-Thank you.
-Gosh, Mom.

488
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,199
I'm your son and you never do this for me.

489
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,519
Is he actually your son,
and I'm just adopted?

490
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,400
Have you worked it out just now?

491
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,599
What?

492
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
Gosh. Mr. Sitha.

493
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,039
Don't come crying
when I'm not around anymore.

494
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,119
-Gosh.
-How fierce.

495
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,079
I think I would be glad.

496
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,679
-Dad.
-Hey.

497
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,760
You should start looking
for your real parents.

498
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,239
Have you found your parents yet?

499
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,960
Stop it, Dad. You too, Mom.

500
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,119
-You're adopted.
-Stop.

501
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,039
I opened the door one day
and found you in a box.

502
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,199
Come on, Mom.

503
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,440
Nut and I have chosen our actor.

504
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,360
I want to do the fitting today.

505
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,039
Here, Pribpree. Pitch this to the clients.

506
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,480
This actor is the best.

507
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,320
Ask for a lot of money.
This actor is extraordinary.

508
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,559
Tell them to pay up front as well.

509
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,760
-All right.
-Right on.

510
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:09,639
Juea.

511
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,760
Are you really going
with this little punk?

512
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,119
What's wrong?

513
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Juea.

514
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,320
You can pick anyone you want.

515
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,199
You can pick this one, this one,

516
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,599
or this one.

517
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,280
But you can't pick this guy.

518
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,960
-Why not?
-Yes, why not?

519
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,360
He's male, aged 17 to 18.

520
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,000
He's friendly, he plays basketball,
he plays instruments,

521
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,360
and he can ride a motorbike.

522
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,599
-He's perfect.
-That's true.

523
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,159
What's the problem?

524
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,599
-Shut up.
-What's wrong with him?

525
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,159
Listen. He's just a kid.

526
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:49,920
And he has no experience.

527
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,639
Can we really trust him?

528
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:55,360
Haven't you heard people say
that you should never work with kids?

529
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,679
If you don't trust me…

530
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:02,119
you could try going out with me.

531
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,119
Hey!

532
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,119
What is he doing here?

533
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,559
-Surprise!
-Juea.

534
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,599
I'm just kidding. You're way too serious.

535
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,599
-Hello, everyone.
-Hi.

536
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,360
Hello.

537
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,760
-Hello, Juea.
-Long time no see.

538
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,639
This is my guy.

539
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,800
Prepare the set. Get the costumes.
Get the cameras ready.

540
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,559
I want everything ready. Go.

541
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:34,800
Let's go.

542
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,239
-Juea, no.
-Knock it off.

543
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,599
-No, Juea.
-Stop it.

544
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,159
-Juea, please.
-Calm down, Gen.

545
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,000
Gen, calm down.

546
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,599
You should keep work
and your private life separate.

547
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,320
Keep that in mind.

548
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,960
Can you even do that, Pribpree?

549
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,280
Sure, I can.

550
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,760
Honey, can you hand me the shovel?

551
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,119
Thank you.

552
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,400
Okay.

553
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,880
Isn't it pretty?

554
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:19,400
It's like the one
in my grandmother's house.

555
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,599
Honey.

556
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,639
Where should I put this?

557
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,039
Honey!

558
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,960
Honey!

559
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,079
Mrs. Na, what's wrong?

560
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,639
Little Prince.

561
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,320
I can't find Saen.

562
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,840
Did you see him?

563
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,360
Did he say where he went?

564
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,679
Do you know where he is?

565
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,360
If Mom takes her medication,

566
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,960
the doctor said
she will gradually stop hallucinating.

567
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,639
She might be frightened sometimes.

568
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,519
Please look after her for me.

569
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,199
If she mentions my dad,

570
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,559
just listen to her

571
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:21,559
and then change the subject.

572
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,599
Take her mind off him.

573
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,000
I haven't seen him.

574
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:36,119
It's almost noon. No wonder I'm so hungry.

575
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:38,960
Can you make me something delicious?

576
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,519
Is that the time?

577
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,159
-I'll see what we have in the fridge.
-Okay.

578
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:08,199
Next one.

579
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,280
Good job.

580
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Hey…

581
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,159
Song, are you good at basketball?

582
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,239
-I'm pretty good.
-Okay.

583
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,239
Give the script a read.
We'll continue next week.

584
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,159
-Okay.
-Listen.

585
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:25,639
Study the script.
Immerse yourself in the character.

586
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:28,760
Also, you need to work on your skills.

587
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,960
You've got to look cool
while you're dribbling.

588
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:32,239
It will be awesome.

589
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,519
-Okay.
-Show me what you can do.

590
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,000
Thank you, guys.

591
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,440
I'll go get changed and take off, then.

592
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,480
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

593
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,039
Goodbye.

594
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,519
I'll borrow your partner to train.

595
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,239
What partner?

596
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,119
Did he mean my wife?

597
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:05,239
Do you miss Neung?

598
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,400
I think of him all the time.

599
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,519
He passed away so suddenly.

600
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,039
Who would have known

601
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,800
that I would never get to hug him again?

602
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,519
Why did you love him so much?

603
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,760
Is it because he was always there for you
to help you with things?

604
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:35,960
Love is not about just being around

605
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,559
or doing things for your partner.

606
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,880
When you love someone,

607
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,760
you do things for them
because you care about them.

608
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,599
Saen has always cared for me.

609
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,960
You're just like him, Little Prince.

610
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,239
You really care for me.

611
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,199
Thank you.

612
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,920
Someone else cares about you.

613
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,880
He may not always be around,

614
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,119
but he always cares about you.

615
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:22,320
Who's that?

616
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:24,400
Nut.

617
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,039
He might not show it,

618
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,239
but he loves you very much.

619
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,239
He always looks after you when you sleep.

620
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
When he hears you scream,
he's the first one to run and see you.

621
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,159
When you cry,

622
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:06,679
he secretly cries with you.

623
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,639
When you smile,

624
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,880
I think it makes him smile too.

625
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,280
That's not right.

626
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,039
You only need one.

627
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,079
Mrs. Na.

628
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,880
It's good to think about someone

629
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:40,960
who's far away.

630
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,559
But you should also think of those

631
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
who are close by.

632
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,559
If someone is far away,

633
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,119
all you can do is think about them.

634
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,320
It's those who are close by

635
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,280
that you can do things for.

636
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:12,719
It's time to take your medicine.

637
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,159
Who's at the door?

638
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:25,719
I'll go check.

639
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,559
Song.

640
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,440
Who is it, Tofu?

641
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,079
-Hello, Mrs. Na.
-Hello.

642
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,360
This is Song.

643
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,960
He's Neung's brother.
Neung was at school with Nut.

644
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,599
Are you here to see Nut?

645
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,480
No, I came to see Tofu.

646
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:09,760
Are you busy? I need your help.

647
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,599
You said you've never played before.

648
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,920
I don't remember playing before.

649
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,440
My hands moved on their own.

650
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:32,639
You're quite good.

651
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,920
Let me ask you something.

652
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,440
Sure.

653
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:41,679
Did Neung ever buy
a teddy bear for anyone?

654
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,760
Neung's girlfriend
didn't like teddy bears.

655
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,480
She liked flowers.

656
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:51,960
Flowers?

657
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,599
Nut doesn't like flowers.

658
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,800
Nut?

659
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:01,159
Do you mean Donut?

660
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
No. Neung's girlfriend was Nhing.

661
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,960
She's Donut's best friend.

662
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,360
Nhing was really pretty.

663
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,039
-Nhing?
-Yes.

664
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,679
I can't really remember
what she looked like.

665
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:20,000
I only remember that she was gorgeous.

666
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,880
I was in second grade back then.

667
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,519
If you want to know more,

668
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,360
you'll have to ask my dad.

669
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,400
Let's play some more.

670
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:46,920
This is Tofu, a friend of mine.

671
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:53,239
You look just like him.

672
00:56:58,719 --> 00:56:59,719
Hello.

673
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:06,920
Dad.

674
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,000
Come on. Let's play.

675
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
-Here.
-Okay.

676
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:22,159
Come on.

677
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,199
Bring it on.

678
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:58,280
Are you tired, Dad?

679
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,800
I'm a police officer.

680
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,519
-This is nothing.
-No.

681
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,920
I mean are you tired from smiling?

682
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,519
You son of a gun. Are you teasing me?

683
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:12,719
It has been a while
since I heard you laugh this loudly.

684
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,480
Gosh. Are you mocking me?

685
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,639
I'll teach you a lesson.

686
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,480
-Mom.
-Yes?

687
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:37,920
-Where's Tofu?
-He went to his friend's house.

688
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,119
-His friend?
-Yes.

689
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:42,239
What friend?

690
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,719
His name is Song.

691
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,199
He asked Tofu to play basketball with him.

692
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,239
Tofu said he would text you.

693
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,960
Don't bother if it's too much trouble.

694
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,760
What was that?

695
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,239
It's nothing.

696
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,719
Take a shower and then come eat.

697
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,519
Okay.

698
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:25,079
The bulb is gone again.

699
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:27,199
Come on.

700
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,000
Go on, shoot!

701
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:29,920
Hey!

702
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,960
-Yes!
-Oh, wow!

703
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:32,679
Wow!

704
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,599
You're good.

705
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,159
You don't look sick
like Song told me you were.

706
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,199
I just do what Song taught me.

707
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,599
Tofu, don't you want
to ask my dad something? Go on.

708
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,000
What is it?

709
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,559
Tofu wants to know
about Neung's girlfriend.

710
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,039
You see, Tofu's living with Nut.

711
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:12,920
He's the screenwriter
for the series I'm going to be in.

712
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,719
He was also Neung's junior at school.

713
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,239
I know Tofu through Nut.

714
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,159
Tofu probably wants to know
about Neung's girlfriend,

715
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:24,800
so he knows how to act

716
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,239
in case they meet each other.

717
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,960
Is that right, Tofu?

718
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:33,400
That's right.

719
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,320
I met Neung's girlfriend
a couple of times.

720
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,119
She was quite sweet.

721
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,079
She was chatty,
and she was a good influence on him.

722
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,119
They got into the same college.

723
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,480
I was hoping they could help each other
study in college.

724
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
It's too bad

725
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,079
that Neung had an accident.

726
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,679
Other than his girlfriend,

727
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,239
did Neung ever bring anyone else here?

728
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:06,880
Just his friends.

729
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,360
They're all grown up now.

730
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,639
But he never brought
any of his juniors home.

731
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,639
Not even Nut?

732
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,079
He's the guy I just told you about.

733
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:21,719
I see.

734
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,320
I've never heard of Nut before.

735
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,079
And Neung never mentioned him.

736
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,119
How is that possible?

737
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,360
Neung was the most important person
in Nut's life.

738
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,159
But to him, Nut didn't exist at all.

739
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,360
Could it be

740
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,000
that Neung wasn't the one
who brought me to life?

741
01:01:58,159 --> 01:01:59,159
Tofu.

742
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,119
Tofu.

743
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,440
We're here.

744
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,199
Right.

745
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:13,199
Thank you.

746
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,920
Please tell your dad that I'm sorry

747
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:20,559
if I asked anything inappropriate.

748
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:22,800
He was actually glad to see you.

749
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,159
You should come by again.

750
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:28,960
My dad would be thrilled
to see your face more often.

751
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,239
Why is the front gate open like that?

752
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,039
Isn't Mrs. Na home alone?

753
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:42,000
It's very dangerous.

754
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,079
You don't know who might pass by.

755
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,639
No.

756
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:34,920
Be careful!

757
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,159
Saen.

758
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Na.

759
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,199
It's really you, Saen.

760
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:51,079
It's me.

761
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,079
I have to go.

762
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:11,920
Where are you going?

763
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:16,159
Hey, kid.

764
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,960
Take care of her.

765
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:20,719
I will.

766
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Wait.

767
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,079
-Where are you going, Saen?
-Mrs. Na.

768
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,519
Please go after him.

769
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:40,159
Where is he going this late at night?

770
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,519
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

771
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,239
You should go inside.

772
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,199
Nut will be angry if he sees you outside.

773
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,679
Weren't you going to come see your wife?

774
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,960
Come sit down.

775
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,239
Are you hurt?

776
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,400
I'm fine.

777
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,199
Can you go after Saen?

778
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,480
Please.

779
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,119
Please go after him.

780
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,280
All right.

781
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,760
What's wrong, Mom?

782
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,760
I heard you scream.

783
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,719
She fell off a ladder.

784
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,639
Why would you climb a ladder?

785
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,760
The lightbulb burned out.
I thought I could change it, but I fell.

786
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,840
Why didn't you ask me?

787
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,960
You were in your room.

788
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,519
I didn't want to disturb you.

789
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
As for you, you jerk.

790
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,559
You were busy flirting outside.

791
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,760
Don't tell him off.

792
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,360
And don't call him that.

793
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,000
What should I call him?

794
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,800
Baby brother Tofu?

795
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,719
That's cute, actually.

796
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,840
Sweet baby brother Tofu.

797
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:37,960
Has your ass…

798
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,280
Have you eaten yet?

799
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,119
No.

800
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:44,800
Please cook something for him.

801
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,119
You little shit… I mean…

802
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:49,599
my dear Tofu.

803
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,440
Help me change the lightbulb.

804
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:52,760
Let's go.

805
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,440
Please don't be mad at your mom.

806
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,960
It was my fault for leaving her alone.

807
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,880
I thought I wouldn't be gone too long,

808
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,639
but I got carried away
chatting with Mr. Anik and Song.

809
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:16,239
Mr. Anik?

810
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,039
He's Song's dad.

811
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,479
When he first saw me, he was shocked.

812
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,600
Just like Song was.

813
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,840
Anyway,

814
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,479
aren't you curious

815
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,760
why I look exactly like Neung?

816
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,960
If I weren't,

817
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,119
I wouldn't have let you live here

818
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,680
or taken you to Neung's house.

819
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,600
I used to think
that you might be a relative,

820
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:56,159
even a sibling.

821
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,439
But Neung's father doesn't know you.

822
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:01,239
So, you're not their family.

823
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,399
Now that you know
I'm not related to Neung,

824
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,439
you won't kick me out, will you?

825
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,039
If I wanted to,

826
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,720
I would've left you
at the temple that day.

827
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:22,800
Gosh.

828
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,319
I'm a bear, not a dog.

829
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,199
What did you say?

830
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,239
I said…

831
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,279
I'm a nice guy, not an asshole.

832
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,880
Anyway, Tofu.

833
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,079
When I was upstairs,
I saw a guy rushing out.

834
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:48,359
Was it Uncle Saen?

835
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,520
Yes, he saved your mom.

836
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,159
But it's strange.

837
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,159
He seemed to be in a hurry.

838
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,000
It was like he was avoiding someone,
but he was also worried about her.

839
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,600
You haven't had dinner, have you?

840
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:08,479
Go eat something.

841
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:11,479
Where are you going?

842
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,359
Hey.

843
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:43,720
The food is cold. I'll warm it up for you.

844
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,960
I'll help.

845
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:58,119
Is Nut getting his dad to have dinner?

846
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,760
Take your medicine.

847
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:28,079
You shouldn't drink so much.

848
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:30,800
You're not young anymore.

849
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:32,640
You might fall ill.

850
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,640
Are you worried or are you jinxing me?

851
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:39,479
Think what you will.

852
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:43,520
I know. You want me dead, right?
So you can go back to her.

853
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,159
You got back and went straight to her

854
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,640
when your wife was right next door.

855
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,399
Are you that worried about her?

856
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:52,760
Yes.

857
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,159
I came to see a doctor in Bangkok
because I was worried about her.

858
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,359
Are you happy now?

859
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,039
In that case,

860
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:03,880
the doctor must have told you

861
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,720
that your little angel has gone insane.

862
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,520
Even if I agreed to a divorce,

863
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,199
you couldn't go back to her,

864
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:13,399
unless you want a lunatic for a wife.

865
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:15,680
What difference would it make?

866
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,359
I already have a crazy wife.

867
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,960
Saen!

868
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:23,960
Go back to her, then.
You've already slept with her.

869
01:13:24,039 --> 01:13:26,239
Are you crazy?

870
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,520
Na and I never did that.

871
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,800
If you didn't,

872
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,439
why did your brother get jealous
and lock you out?

873
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,880
Enough with this love affair nonsense.

874
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:39,520
Stop being paranoid and open your eyes.

875
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Your nephew is in a coma.
Do you ever think about him?

876
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,239
Why should I?

877
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,439
I didn't put him in a coma.

878
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:55,279
Even if I do think of him, what can I do?
I'm not a doctor.

879
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:58,359
And your company is taking care
of his medical bills.

880
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,920
In fact,

881
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,640
he's better off dead.

882
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,840
-Then I'll get the money my dad gave him.
-Jan!

883
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,520
I'll pretend that
this is the drink talking.

884
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,439
I'm not drunk.

885
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,399
I meant what I said

886
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,199
about Tarn and your mistress.

887
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:14,960
You better show me some respect.

888
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:16,439
We're not divorced yet.

889
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,640
You're still my husband.

890
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,159
Then give me a damn divorce.

891
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:22,159
How many times have I sent you
the papers? Just sign them.

892
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,600
No. I won't let you be with her.

893
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,199
You can hold on
to that marriage license, then.

894
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,760
Saen, where are you going? Come back here.

895
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,159
Saen, stop!

896
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,680
-Saen.
-Hey.

897
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:41,840
You can't leave me like this.

898
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:44,439
You're drunk. Get back inside.

899
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,800
-Have you no shame?
-No!

900
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:49,039
You're one to talk.

901
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:50,640
Do you think I don't know?

902
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,239
You love Nut because he's your son.
Isn't that right?

903
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:54,760
-Jan!
-Ouch!

904
01:14:57,279 --> 01:14:58,199
Nut.

905
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,640
Where are you staying?
I'll give you a ride.

906
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,439
Saen.

907
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,039
Don't go.

908
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,079
We're done here.

909
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,560
Saen.

910
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,239
Saen, don't go!

911
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:15,840
Get back here, Saen!

912
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,960
-Come back!
-Stop it!

913
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,000
Saen.

914
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,720
Saen.

915
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,319
Saen!

916
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:33,880
Nut.

917
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:41,000
It's late. Where has Nut gone?

918
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:43,640
I don't know.

919
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,720
I'll go and see if Jan is okay.

920
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,079
Jan.

921
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,159
Mr. Saen.

922
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,079
What's all the commotion about?

923
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:03,399
Jan is home, but her husband left.

924
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,520
I wasn't prying.

925
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,800
-Hey.
-I just poked my face out and saw her

926
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,479
having a fight with her husband.

927
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,319
Then he left in a car with Nut.

928
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,199
Nut went with Mr. Saen?

929
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:18,159
That's right. I may be old,
but my eyes are like an eagle's.

930
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,520
Should we go check on Jan?

931
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,760
There's no need for that.

932
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,199
Jan is a strong woman. She's fine.

933
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:28,000
She probably just threw a tantrum.

934
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,319
Don't be too quick to judge
who's strong or weak.

935
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,479
You're not in their shoes.

936
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,319
So don't judge them, okay?

937
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:38,960
-Okay.
-All right?

938
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,680
Let's go before they run out
of deep-fried dough sticks and soy milk.

939
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,560
-It's already late. Don't be so nosy.
-Okay.

940
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,920
Stop poking your nose in others' affairs.

941
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:51,319
-Aren't you sick of soy milk yet?
-Never.

942
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,159
I could have it every day.

943
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,720
I've done so much for you.

944
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,039
Are you really going to leave me?

945
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,720
Thank you, Nut.

946
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,880
It's fine.

947
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:07,760
I barged into your house today.

948
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,079
I'm sorry about that.

949
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:10,479
You don't have to be sorry.

950
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,840
You should visit us sometime.

951
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,079
We're family after all.

952
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,279
And my dad is already gone.

953
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:36,199
I forgot.

954
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:39,960
Jan doesn't want you to see us.

955
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,279
I don't care what she thinks.

956
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:46,840
She's mistaken
and she has the wrong idea about things.

957
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:49,920
But I don't want her
to pick a fight with your mom.

958
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,399
Your mom is a poor soul.

959
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,159
I don't want to cause her
any more trouble.

960
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,680
How is she doing?

961
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
Uncle Saen.

962
01:19:36,119 --> 01:19:36,960
Hello.

963
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,920
How's your mom? Is she doing okay?

964
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,479
She's fine.

965
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,880
Do you want to come inside?
Dad is also home.

966
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:49,880
I've got an errand to run.

967
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,079
-Can you give this to your mom?
-Sure.

968
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,720
Thank you.

969
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,039
Take good care of your mom.

970
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,880
I will.

971
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,760
Who was it?

972
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,039
It was Uncle Saen.

973
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,239
Here's a gift from Chiang Mai.

974
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,560
Do not accept anything
from Saen from now on.

975
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,560
Why did Dad do that, Mom?

976
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:44,159
Uncle Saen is his brother.

977
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,920
You ask the same question
every time we meet.

978
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,560
You've seen how she is.

979
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,279
I asked Tofu to help look after her,

980
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,359
but he had gone out
when she fell off the ladder.

981
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,720
Thank God you got there in time.

982
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,119
Is that kid a houseboy?

983
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,079
He's a friend of mine, not a houseboy.

984
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,439
He's a little bit goofy.

985
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,800
Don't mind him if he does anything weird.

986
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:37,600
From what I've seen,

987
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,920
he seems like an innocent,
trustworthy kid.

988
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,439
You work hard.

989
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,720
It's good he's helping you
look after your mom.

990
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:55,119
It would've been nice

991
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,520
if she had married you.

992
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,239
She would have you to care for her.

993
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,840
If I had a loving father like you,

994
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,800
my mom and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

995
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:20,800
If we could see the future,

996
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,800
no one would ever make a mistake.

997
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,479
But once you make a mistake,

998
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:34,159
you're bound to do it again.

999
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,319
I'm home, Dad.

1000
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:57,840
You were gone a long time.

1001
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:01,000
I stopped by a popular porridge stall
and got you some.

1002
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,319
It's near Tofu's house.

1003
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,479
The queue was so long I almost gave up.

1004
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,039
Thank you, son.

1005
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,680
You're welcome.

1006
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,600
You're not home very often.

1007
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,960
I just wanted you to have a good meal.

1008
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:22,520
I wasn't thanking you for the porridge.

1009
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:24,680
I meant Tofu.

1010
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,119
Thank you for introducing him to me.

1011
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:35,720
I know you did it because I miss Neung.

1012
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,159
Hey, Dad.

1013
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,359
Let me ask you something.

1014
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:55,119
What is it?

1015
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,239
Did you have a lovechild
with a secret mistress?

1016
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:01,039
You little devil. Watch your mouth.

1017
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,960
Look at me. I'm working my ass off.

1018
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,079
Would I have time for a mistress?

1019
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,520
It's strange.

1020
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,399
Tofu looks exactly like Neung.

1021
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,199
Wait a second.

1022
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,279
Maybe Neung has been reincarnated.

1023
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,239
Dad. You watch too much TV.

1024
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:19,800
Neung has only been dead for ten years.

1025
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,920
There's no way he could be reincarnated
as someone my age.

1026
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,520
That's true.

1027
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
Hey, Dad.

1028
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,960
Why don't you do some digging into Tofu?

1029
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,000
Do you think I have time for that?

1030
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,359
Please, Dad.

1031
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:44,439
Aren't you a tiny bit curious?

1032
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,239
I'll look into it.

1033
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,600
Enough chit-chat. Eat up.

1034
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:54,279
Here.

1035
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,800
-Take a spoon.
-Thank you.

1036
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,720
I got it.

1037
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,239
Eat up. Don't wait for me.

1038
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,479
The ones who love each other
aren't together.

1039
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,199
And the ones who are together
don't love each other.

1040
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,520
Who do you mean, Ms. Left Slipper?

1041
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,760
You've been a human for ages,

1042
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,840
but you're just as dumb as before.

1043
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:35,119
Why do you have to be mean to Tofu?

1044
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:38,119
Are you jealous that he got to be human?

1045
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:41,880
Why would I be jealous of a teddy bear
who lives a pathetic life

1046
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:46,159
without any vision, ideology,
nor the spirit of a free man.

1047
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,239
That's enough.

1048
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:50,279
What I just said…

1049
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:54,880
I was talking about Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen,

1050
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,159
and Jan.

1051
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:00,680
Do you mean Mr. Saen loves Mrs. Na,

1052
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:02,760
but he can't be with her?

1053
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:06,199
Does that mean he doesn't love Jan?

1054
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:10,520
You've been married to Mr. Saen
for a long time.

1055
01:26:11,319 --> 01:26:13,600
How come I've never seen him here?

1056
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,880
My husband works in Chiang Mai.

1057
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,119
He rarely flies back home.

1058
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,640
But I fly over there quite often.

1059
01:26:25,319 --> 01:26:29,000
You must be lonely
since you rarely get to see him.

1060
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:32,239
Why don't you move to Chiang Mai with him?

1061
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:36,880
Well, I guess it's my bad luck.

1062
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,239
Soon after we got married,
our company started failing.

1063
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:43,880
My dad had to let other investors
help run the company.

1064
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,720
Saen took responsibility by quitting

1065
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,600
and he got a new job in Chiang Mai

1066
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:51,399
even though it wasn't his fault.

1067
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,680
The economy was just bad.

1068
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,479
In the end, we couldn't hold on
and we had to sell our factory.

1069
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,720
I heard Sibmeun had invested his money
in a house in this neighborhood.

1070
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,319
It was in a good spot
and the price was reasonable,

1071
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:08,119
so I bought one for myself.

1072
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:12,520
I spent all my savings on this house.

1073
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,800
How can I leave it?

1074
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:18,760
I never thought that one day,

1075
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,239
Nut would move in next door with his mom.

1076
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,279
Actually, I feel just as sorry for Jan
as I do for Mrs. Na.

1077
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,720
There must be something else
between Mrs. Na, Mr. Saen, and Jan

1078
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:39,399
that I don't know about.

1079
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:42,399
But it goes to show
that everyone has problems to deal with.

1080
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:45,079
And their problems

1081
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:48,520
are way too complicated for me
to understand in such a short time.

1082
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:58,800
About life in high school?

1083
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,640
And it's not an odd thing anymore.

1084
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,760
But it's still not normal.

1085
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,800
If for you, normal means
only thinking the way you do,

1086
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,640
then half the world would be abnormal.

1087
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:11,239
That plot of land and your house
should have gone to me,

1088
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:14,399
not a brat like you who has never
contributed to the family business.

1089
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:15,640
If you want it,

1090
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,560
wait until I'm dead.

1091
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,640
Tofu!

1092
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,279
Where did you get a key to my room?

1093
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:24,439
Well…

1094
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,039
Well, the best way
to get over your old love

1095
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:28,920
is to find a new one, right?

1096
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:31,600
If you're happy,

1097
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,760
those romantic scenes
you're struggling with

1098
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:36,600
will come to you naturally.

1099
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,119
Shall I find someone for you?
They're crazy about you.

1100
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,399
It's either Prib or Tofu.

1101
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:41,279
