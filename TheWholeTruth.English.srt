1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,166
IN THIS WORLD, THERE ARE THREE THINGS
THAT CANNOT BE HIDDEN:

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,208
THE SUN,

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,541
THE MOON,

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,083
AND…

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,708
THE TRUTH.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,125
Truth is sometimes like a small hole
camouflaged by darkness.

7
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,041
It's always been there.

8
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,416
We just can't see it.

9
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,041
But as soon as a light shines on it,

10
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,041
it reveals itself for all to see,

11
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:12,000
making us wonder how long
it has been hidden there.

12
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,500
Putt.

13
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,708
Look at you!

14
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,708
Did you cause any trouble at school?

15
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,625
Your teacher called,
he wants me to go see him tomorrow.

16
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,333
I didn't do anything.

17
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,541
Too much schoolwork?

18
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:26,000
If you can't catch up,
I'll hire a private tutor.

19
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,333
Pim, can you feed Latte for me?

20
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,916
I've got cheerleading practice
this afternoon, ask Putt.

21
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,291
Putt, you heard us?

22
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,208
I'll write you a note then.

23
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:50,875
Give Latte four spoonfuls,
and refill the water bowl.

24
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,333
I have good news.
We're going to celebrate this evening.

25
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,666
What good news?

26
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:07,208
I've been promoted
to head of international sales.

27
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,125
Congratulations, Mom!

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,541
That's awesome!

29
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,583
This calls for a celebration!

30
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,000
Pick a place, whatever you want.

31
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,000
-Really? I'll start looking!
-Yes!

32
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm hungry already.

33
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,958
So many places I want to try.

34
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,333
How about this one?

35
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,791
-No, try this.
-This one?

36
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,708
Congratulations.

37
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

38
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,041
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much. Cheers!

39
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,208
All right guys, that's it!

40
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
Get back to work now.

41
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,208
Mai, congratulations again.

42
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,708
Thank you so much
for trusting me to take the job.

43
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,875
I promise I'll do my best.

44
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,875
No need to thank me.

45
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,375
I've promoted you
so you'll have to work harder for me.

46
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,625
Alright.

47
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,041
Let's start right away then.

48
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,458
Could you go through this contract for me?

49
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,416
Also, I want you to join
a video conference

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,875
with our Chinese partners
at 7 p.m. as well.

51
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:17,333
Mr. Lee wants to discuss
the detail of our new project.

52
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,666
-It won't take more than an hour.
-Yes, Boss.

53
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,041
One, two, three, four…

54
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,791
Five, six, seven, eight…

55
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,416
One, two, three, four…

56
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,041
Five, six, seven, eight…

57
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,666
One, two, three, four…

58
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,375
Five, six, seven, eight…

59
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,041
One, two, three, four…

60
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,708
Five, six, seven, eight…

61
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,500
One, two, three, four…

62
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,833
Five, six, seven, eight…

63
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,583
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight…

64
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,041
One, two, three, four…

65
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,375
Five, six, seven, eight…

66
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,000
One, two, three, four…

67
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,500
Five, six, seven…

68
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,500
That was great, girls.

69
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,541
The competition
is coming up in a few weeks.

70
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,916
We'll have to vote
for our new team captain.

71
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,791
Right now,
Pim is handling that responsibility.

72
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,750
But as is our practice,
we pick a new captain every year.

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,708
If you'd like to nominate
one of your teammates,

74
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,250
you can leave a note in my office.

75
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,458
Alright, good job. That's it for today.

76
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,458
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, ma'am.

77
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,583
I'm beat.

78
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,291
Let's get ice cream.

79
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,041
I thought you were afraid of getting fat.

80
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,250
Shut up.

81
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,833
Pim.

82
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,833
Ma'am.

83
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,416
Do you think you can be team captain
for another year?

84
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:50,375
I can… But will the girls nominate me?

85
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,375
Don't worry, leave that shit to me.

86
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,541
Paew, watch your language!

87
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,791
Sorry, ma'am.

88
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,458
Thanks, Pim.
Everyone wants you to take the job.

89
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,458
Yes.

90
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:10,458
Do you think they'll hate me
if I'm captain again?

91
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,416
I really want to do it.

92
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,916
Who would hate you?

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,333
Don't worry.
They are all going to vote for you.

94
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:21,208
I heard Mint is going to run against me.

95
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,041
Mint? She won't get it.

96
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,375
She's a bitch, nobody likes her.

97
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:29,958
Hey!

98
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:35,041
Relax, I got your back.
I'll handle everything.

99
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,041
Come on!

100
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,458
You jackass!

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,875
Hey!

102
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,375
What the fuck.

103
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,916
Do you want a piece of me?

104
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,416
Hey! Where are you going?

105
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,458
Just keep playing.

106
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,208
Hey!

107
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,708
What are you doing?

108
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,583
Get away from the door! You pervert!

109
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,291
I'm just looking, I haven't done shit.

110
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,833
Get out!

111
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,166
Putt! Help me!

112
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,541
-Pim!
-Get out!

113
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,666
-Shit
-Get out!

114
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,500
Hey, I know a secret. It concerns you.

115
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,458
Aren't you curious?

116
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,791
What secret?

117
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
Bitch!

118
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,750
Fuck!

119
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,000
Your sister's a bitch!

120
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,083
Look what she did!

121
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,333
I have a soccer match tomorrow.

122
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,583
Did you forget what you've promised?

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,416
Do you want the whole school
to see the clip, huh?

124
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,041
Do you want it to go viral?

125
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
Watch this! Watch!

126
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,375
Everyone will go wild when they see this!

127
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,875
It'll get a thousand shares!
Take a good look at it!

128
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,500
Don't ever forget
your end of the deal, cripple.

129
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,875
MOM

130
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,708
Mom, where are you?

131
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,833
Putt and I've been ready for hours.
We're starving.

132
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,708
Pim, I'm sorry
but something urgent came up.

133
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,250
We'll do it another time.

134
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,708
That's okay, Mom.

135
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,583
I'll find something in the fridge.

136
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,875
Make sure Putt eats something too.

137
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,916
Sorry, I have to hang up.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,291
Wait!

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,291
I want to ask you something.

140
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,250
Can you tell Fame
to stop coming here to see Putt?

141
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,541
What happened?

142
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,083
You know Putt doesn't have many friends.

143
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,125
Fame takes Putt in

144
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,458
and he doesn't bully him
like the other boys.

145
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,291
It's for your brother's good.
Have pity on him.

146
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,958
But today he spied on me
while I was changing.

147
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,458
Do you want that pervert
hanging around our house?

148
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,250
He did what?

149
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,666
I'll go home and talk to Putt then.

150
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,166
Wait up for me.

151
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,958
Okay, Mom.

152
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
I love you, Pim.

153
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,083
Latte, your dinner.

154
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,833
Mr. Lee is such a flirt.

155
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,250
He just wasted five hours of our lives,
damn it!

156
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,291
Right.

157
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,916
It's pouring. Drive safely, okay?

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,166
You too. Good night.

159
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,333
See you tomorrow.

160
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,583
MISSED CALL: PIM

161
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,291
Fuck!

162
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,625
Who's that?

163
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,708
It's me, your grandpa.

164
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,208
Open the door.

165
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,583
You're Pim, right?

166
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,041
You probably don't know me.
I'm your grandfather.

167
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,833
Mai's father.

168
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,416
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

169
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,958
Who's that?

170
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
You must be Putt.

171
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,708
I'm your grandpa.

172
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,958
Grandpa…

173
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,458
Well, Grandpa.

174
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,541
Mom's not home.

175
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,791
Hold on.

176
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,708
No one has told you?

177
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,958
Told us what?

178
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,208
Mom…

179
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,875
Mom…

180
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,166
It's me, Pim. Can you hear me?

181
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,166
Can you hear me?

182
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,333
Mom…

183
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,333
Grandpa, what did the doctor say?

184
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,375
Well…

185
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:55,833
He said she's out of critical condition.

186
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,125
But…

187
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,416
She has to remain in the ICU.

188
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,583
She had a severe concussion
and is in a coma.

189
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,833
Mai.

190
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,166
You're Pim, right?

191
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,666
My dear Pim, come here.

192
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,333
And who's this?

193
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
Krit, right?

194
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,583
He's Putt, your grandson.

195
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,416
Did you take your pills today?

196
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,041
Putt…

197
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,375
Of course, Putt.

198
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,375
My dear, come to me.

199
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,541
Come closer, let me look at you.

200
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,500
My boy, it's been ages.

201
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,666
You two should come to stay with us
in the meantime,

202
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,625
so your mom doesn't have to be worried

203
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,291
Right, you should.

204
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:48,625
They can stay in Mai's old bedroom,
what do you think?

205
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,416
You want us to come with you?

206
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,708
Pim.

207
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,375
Come with us.

208
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,125
Our house is like your house.

209
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,958
You lived there as a child,
don't you remember?

210
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,791
No, I don’t. Mom never told me that.

211
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,125
It's been a long night,
we should probably go.

212
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,291
You can come back for a visit later.
Let's go.

213
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,541
Let's go.

214
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,708
Mai, my child.

215
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,458
Fate is so unkind to me.

216
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,333
Wan…

217
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,208
Wan…

218
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,041
Come.

219
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,916
Where's my sketchbook?

220
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,750
Putt, we forgot Latte.

221
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,125
Pim, Putt, come sit down.

222
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,583
Grandma has made breakfast for you.

223
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,333
Won't she join us?

224
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,166
She usually doesn't have breakfast.

225
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,750
She's probably out
talking to the neighbors.

226
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,708
Putt, Grandma wants you
to finish your milk.

227
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,958
Before we start,

228
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,375
there's something
I want to discuss with you.

229
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:47,291
Last night, you saw
how your grandma was becoming senile.

230
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,291
She couldn't even remember Putt.

231
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,791
There are days when she's perfectly lucid,

232
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,291
then the next day her memory slips away.

233
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,708
From now on, I'd like to ask you a favor.

234
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,791
If she says or does something that
frustrates you,

235
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,125
please don't take it to heart.

236
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,458
What's exactly wrong with her?

237
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,375
She has dementia.

238
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:22,083
You two can help me look after her.

239
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:26,458
Make sure
she takes her medication on time.

240
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:36,375
So, did you sleep well?
Is the room too small for two people?

241
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:42,000
Not at all, we'll be fine.

242
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,375
But…

243
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,708
Do we really have to stay here?

244
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,916
It's for your own good

245
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,833
until your mother can leave the hospital.

246
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:07,583
Can I go home later?

247
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,333
I have to get some stuff.

248
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:18,333
I don't want to leave Latte alone either.

249
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,833
Latte?

250
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:22,333
Mom's cat.

251
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:23,958
I see.

252
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:25,958
Well, of course.

253
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,666
Now, eat your breakfast.

254
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:49,125
Mr. Somphong,
may I have a word with you in private?

255
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:53,541
You can talk to me here,
these two are old enough to understand.

256
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,458
In that case…

257
00:25:56,125 --> 00:26:00,625
The patient's internal organs
did not sustain any injuries.

258
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,791
That’s good news.

259
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,416
But her brain…

260
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,458
Her chance of waking up
is only 50 percent.

261
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,958
And I can't tell you
how long she'll remain in this state.

262
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,750
What we can do is
monitor her condition closely

263
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:23,333
to prevent any complications
and infection.

264
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,125
This is all I can tell you right now.

265
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,541
You take this.

266
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,250
Alright?

267
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,791
Pim, take this.

268
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,875
This is your home for now.

269
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,500
You two get some rest.

270
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,791
I have to go out
and will be back in the evening.

271
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,875
-Yes.
-Take care of Grandma.

272
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:16,125
Putt, what are you doing?
Help me with the bags!

273
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,125
Pim, look at this.

274
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,250
Shit! You did that?

275
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,916
No, it was already here when I came in.

276
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,833
Perhaps the house next door
is doing a repair.

277
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,208
Show it to Grandpa when he gets home.

278
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,916
Come on.

279
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:45,416
You haven't finished it.

280
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,458
I don't eat greens, Grandma.

281
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:50,291
In this house,
we finish everything on our plates.

282
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,958
Finish it.

283
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,041
Has anyone seen Latte?

284
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,416
I haven't seen it around.

285
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,000
It's normal for cats to wander off.

286
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,958
I saw it here a little while ago.

287
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,375
And where did it go?

288
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,916
It was going through the trash
and making a mess,

289
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,000
so I let it outside.

290
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,291
Outside?

291
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,583
It will come back when it's hungry.

292
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,166
But it's been here less than a day.

293
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,666
Maybe it got lost.

294
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,250
Or it went back to our house.

295
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:39,125
Nonsense. Your mother's house
is way across town.

296
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,208
Let it stay outside. It's not a big deal.

297
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:46,791
Latte is a house cat.
It can't survive outside.

298
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:52,583
Grandpa, you might want
to call a repairman.

299
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,333
-What for?
-There's a hole in the wall over there.

300
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,958
A hole?

301
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,208
What hole?

302
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:05,416
You haven't seen it? I'll show you.

303
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Putt, come back and finish your milk.

304
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,708
The house next door
is probably drilling something.

305
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:34,166
I don't see a hole.

306
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,958
Right here.

307
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,875
You really don't see it?

308
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:44,041
Are you two pulling my leg?
There's no hole!

309
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,708
Wan, come here!

310
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,666
-Do you see a hole?
-What?

311
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:02,083
What hole? I don't see any.

312
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,083
Grandma, it's right here.

313
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,916
I can't see it.
It must be a very small hole.

314
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,916
What are you two playing at?

315
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,125
First the cat, and now an invisible hole.

316
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,750
Calm down.

317
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,250
You two aren't making this up, are you?

318
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:33,791
We are not! We're telling the truth!

319
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,208
Your mother didn't raise you
to become kids who cry wolf, did she?

320
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,625
That's enough.
Keep arguing about your stupid hole.

321
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,041
I'm done here.

322
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,083
It's already 8 p.m.
You two should go to bed.

323
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,500
How come they didn't see that hole?

324
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,833
I don't get it.

325
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,500
Did they really not see the hole

326
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,541
or did they lie to us?

327
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,041
Why would they lie?

328
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:34,208
Maybe we're seeing things
that aren't there.

329
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,541
No.

330
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,791
Our eyes didn't play tricks on us.

331
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,125
I think it's this house.

332
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:47,583
No wonder Mom never brought us here.

333
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,833
What's wrong with this house?

334
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,666
I don't think so. You're imagining things.

335
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,250
Putt, what's wrong?

336
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,750
Pim…

337
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,333
Do you think
they're really our grandparents?

338
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,291
Of course, they are.

339
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,666
They know our names, they know Mom,

340
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,083
and have family photos everywhere.

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,625
You're being paranoid.

342
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:35,083
It's really bugging me.

343
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:41,250
How come Mom never said a word about them?

344
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,750
It's because…

345
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,041
Well, you have a point.

346
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,750
Pim, breakfast's ready. Come.

347
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,291
Putt, have your breakfast.

348
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,958
Yes, Grandma.

349
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,500
Pim.

350
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:10,541
Is Latte back?

351
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,291
No.

352
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,583
Did you check the wall?

353
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,208
What are you whispering about?

354
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,291
Putt.

355
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,500
Your hair is a mess.
You can't go to school looking like this.

356
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,291
And button up, will you?

357
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:46,416
Here's your milk. Finish it.

358
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,208
Drink up.

359
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,208
I don't like milk.

360
00:35:55,708 --> 00:36:00,625
Milk is good for your health.
Especially your bones.

361
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,083
Can you do something for me?

362
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,416
Don't upset Grandpa again.

363
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:35,083
Where have you been, cripple?

364
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,666
I haven't seen you in days.

365
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,500
Well, my mother…

366
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:42,166
Your mother what? Whatever.

367
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,625
I just want to know when I can come over
to your house again.

368
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,000
I want to see your sister.

369
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,541
Not possible.

370
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,083
We're living with our grandparents now.

371
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:54,333
I don't care where you live.
I'm coming over this afternoon.

372
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That's not a good idea.

373
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:57,875
Why not?

374
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,958
You want to shut me out?

375
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,875
Do you want me to spread the clip?

376
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:06,125
Do you want to see it? Look here!

377
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,458
-No.
-Good stuff, man.

378
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,083
-Here.
-No.

379
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,375
Come on.

380
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,375
Fame, leave him alone!

381
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,583
What? I didn't do anything.

382
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:23,875
I was telling him
I'll drop by his house after school,

383
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,375
right?

384
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,125
I'm okay, Pim.

385
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,625
Who's inviting you?
You're not welcome in our house.

386
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,583
Hey.

387
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:37,083
That's so mean.

388
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:40,333
Mom doesn't want Putt
to hang out with an asshole like you.

389
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:42,250
That hurts.

390
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,833
You mean a handsome guy like me.

391
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,041
Handsome

392
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,291
but still an asshole.

393
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,750
Satisfied?

394
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,791
Very. At least you call me handsome.

395
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:56,125
Now get this into your skull.

396
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,833
Don't come near Putt again.

397
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,458
Can I come near you then?

398
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,250
Well?

399
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:09,916
I never knew what Putt had to go through.

400
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:13,208
He never told me anything.

401
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:17,958
He confides in you

402
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,500
because you're the only one
who understands him.

403
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,541
I can see how much he misses you.

404
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,250
Please wake up. I want to go home.

405
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:46,750
You know, it's terribly suffocating

406
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:49,125
having to live with Grandpa and Grandma.

407
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,041
It's like…

408
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,791
we're living with strangers.

409
00:38:56,666 --> 00:39:02,833
Grandpa and Grandma
don't understand us at all.

410
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,708
I know it's not their fault.

411
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,666
We'd never spent time together before.

412
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,416
I have to go now, Mom.

413
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,041
I'll come again tomorrow.

414
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,791
I'll bring Putt along.

415
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,875
Love you, Mom.

416
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,291
Damn it.

417
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:41,958
You're such a dumbass.

418
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,875
Why didn't you bring the X-Box with you?

419
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,500
I told you not to come,
you didn't believe me.

420
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,208
So how long do you have to stay here?

421
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,833
I don't know. I guess…

422
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,666
until Mom is discharged.

423
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,208
Gosh.

424
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,166
And when will your sister come?

425
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,833
Why does it take her so long?

426
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,083
Leave her alone, please.

427
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,583
Shut the fuck up.

428
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:21,083
Do you want me to show her the clip?

429
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,791
Maybe she'll take me seriously then.

430
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,958
What the fuck is it?

431
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,916
Did you hear the noise?

432
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,166
What noise?

433
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,125
Are you messing with me?

434
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,791
What have you been smoking?

435
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,583
Putt.

436
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,750
What noise? I didn't hear anything.

437
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,416
Hey, Putt. Where are you going?

438
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:05,416
Hey.

439
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,833
Damn it. He's ignoring me.

440
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,458
What is it?

441
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,208
Do you see this hole?

442
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,666
What hole?

443
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,666
-This hole. Right here.
-There's no fucking hole.

444
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,291
Do you think I'm blind?

445
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,666
What the hell is wrong with you?

446
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,333
Putt.

447
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,125
Putt.

448
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,916
What now?

449
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,291
In there.

450
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,166
Take a look.

451
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,500
In what?

452
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,458
You wouldn't believe me.

453
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,416
See it for yourself.

454
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,208
Move. What the hell?

455
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,208
Here?

456
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,666
Lower.

457
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,041
More to the left.

458
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,958
Right there.

459
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,708
You've gone nuts, man.

460
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,333
Damn it!

461
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,458
Fuck!

462
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:00,875
You shoved me!

463
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,666
I didn't!

464
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,000
Hold on.

465
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:09,375
Asshole. My nose!

466
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,625
Fuck!

467
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,125
Damn it.

468
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,250
How dare you, fucking cripple!

469
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,833
I didn't even touch you.

470
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,333
You little shit!

471
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:22,958
Fame, what are you doing here? Get out!

472
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:23,916
Pim.

473
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,708
What the…

474
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,250
Look at what your brother did to me!

475
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,041
What? What's going on here?

476
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,791
Fame peeked through the hole.

477
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,000
What hole?

478
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:34,458
There's no fucking hole there.

479
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,458
He tricked me
and slammed my head against the wall.

480
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,833
I didn't do anything!

481
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,208
You will pay for this. Both of you.

482
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,500
Mark my words. Your life is over, slut.

483
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,166
You're fucking finished.

484
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,291
Fuck!

485
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,166
What is he talking about?

486
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,166
Tell me, Putt.

487
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,458
Fame…

488
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,041
took a video clip of you.

489
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,208
What clip?

490
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,416
A clip of you taking a shower in the gym.

491
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,875
What?

492
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,875
When? Are you sure it's me?

493
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:30,958
Yes.

494
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,375
What do you mean?

495
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,250
Did you watch it?

496
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,083
Only briefly.

497
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,125
Who else has seen it?

498
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,333
I don't know.

499
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:47,166
He blackmails me into helping him
get a date with you,

500
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,125
or he'll share the clip
to the whole school.

501
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:52,958
Why did you hurt him?

502
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,125
Now he's going to spread the clip!

503
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:57,541
I really didn't touch him.

504
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:08,708
That's why he said my life is over.

505
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:23,666
I wonder how Latte is doing.

506
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:28,166
It's a smart cat, it'll find a way home.

507
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,333
What happened? Is someone hurt?

508
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,458
No one's hurt, Grandma. We're okay.

509
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:43,250
Mai!

510
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,166
Please do something. Get rid of it!

511
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,666
I can't stand this anymore.

512
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,166
Grandma, it's me, Pim.

513
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:57,083
Clean it up. Do it now!

514
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,375
It's all your fault, Krit.

515
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,041
Look at what you've done.

516
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,000
-Grandma, I'm Putt.
-Look!

517
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,458
That's Putt. And I'm Pim.

518
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:11,291
Get him out! I can’t take it anymore.

519
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,708
Calm down, Grandma.

520
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,416
Pull yourself together, I'm your grandson.

521
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,208
Putt.

522
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:33,458
Pim.

523
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,958
My grandkids.

524
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:43,875
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

525
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,541
Sorry.

526
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,583
Time for my medicine.

527
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,708
Get me some water.

528
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,916
Go get it, Putt.

529
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,083
Let me help you, Grandma.

530
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,500
Grandpa, do you hear it?

531
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,750
Yes.

532
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,041
I'll go check.

533
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,500
Go back to your room.

534
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,541
Wan.

535
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,500
Wan.

536
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Wan!

537
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,958
What happened?

538
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,833
What have you done, you bastard!

539
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,416
I will never forgive you.

540
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,875
Go back to bed. I'll get your pills.

541
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,333
What happened to you?

542
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,208
Wan!

543
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,125
Wan!

544
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:02,958
Are you alright?

545
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,916
Children, let's have breakfast.

546
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:17,083
This jug of milk
is especially for you, Putt.

547
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,375
Well…

548
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,083
Did you both sleep well?

549
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:45,125
I slept like a log.

550
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,708
Well, where's Grandpa?

551
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:02,166
He left earlier this morning.

552
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,416
He said he was going to see a friend.

553
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,166
I'm here about my daughter's case.

554
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,916
Yes, sir. Please have a seat.

555
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,708
LT.GEN. SOMPHONG CHAIYAWAN.

556
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:16,291
HEAD OF CRIME SUPPRESSION DIVISION
2007-2011

557
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,375
How is your daughter doing?

558
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:25,916
She's still in a coma.

559
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,750
If there's anything I can do to help,
don't hesitate to ask.

560
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,416
I want to see the case file.

561
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,166
Don't think of it as an order
from your ex-boss.

562
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,541
Think of it as a favor for an old friend.

563
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:06,458
Here it is, sir.

564
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,166
Who was the driver?

565
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,000
That boy and his girlfriend, right?

566
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:23,958
Both of them testified that
another friend was driving.

567
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,708
But was it the boy's car?

568
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:28,708
Yes, sir.

569
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,625
It's registered under his father's name.

570
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,083
His father?

571
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:40,416
You mean Apiwat, the real estate tycoon?

572
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,375
Yes.

573
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,708
The boy's name is Chaiyut.
His friends call him Pop.

574
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,500
But records clearly show that
Chaiyut and his girlfriend

575
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,916
had blood alcohol levels
over the legal limit.

576
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:58,333
How can you be so sure that
Chaiyut wasn't the driver?

577
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:03,166
He probably paid his friend
to take the fall.

578
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,958
Let's not make any rash judgments.

579
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:13,041
You're right.

580
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,958
However,

581
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:20,833
the real driver must be caught
and convicted.

582
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:26,291
Whether it's Chaiyut or not.

583
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:29,208
I don't care if his father is a big shot.

584
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:36,166
My only daughter has been in a coma
for almost a month.

585
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:38,958
If anything happens to her,

586
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:43,166
my grandkids will become orphans.

587
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:50,500
I will drag that bastard out
and punish him.

588
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,125
Mark my words.

589
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,000
I don't care how influential
his family is,

590
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,583
I won't let him get away.

591
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,083
What? Does Fame really think
he has a chance with me?

592
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,458
That asshole should just drop dead.

593
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,583
What if he insists? What will you do then?

594
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,000
Whose phone is this?

595
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,791
It's Fame's.

596
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,541
He must've dropped it.

597
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:39,250
Really?

598
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:42,750
Great. I'll check if my clip is in it.

599
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,833
What's that noise?

600
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:21,416
Putt, what are you doing?

601
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,291
I've looked through this hole once.

602
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,750
And what did you see?

603
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:30,791
I saw the house next door.

604
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,833
And there was this creepy girl.

605
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:35,416
A girl?

606
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,083
Yes, but I didn't see her parents.

607
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,041
Do you know when Grandpa will be back?

608
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:55,500
Don't know, both of them
are at the hospital.

609
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,291
Then watch out for me.
I'll look into the hole.

610
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:03,000
Let me know when they come back.

611
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:04,791
-Okay.
-Now, go.

612
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,916
What happened?

613
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,541
We have to help her!

614
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,541
Help who?

615
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,250
What did you see?

616
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:58,958
The girl!

617
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,875
Shit!

618
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:22,583
She's in danger, we have to help her!

619
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,041
-Let's go.
-I'm not going anywhere.

620
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:28,500
What are you saying?
Are you going to let her die?

621
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,500
She's not going to die.
She's a ghost, Pim!

622
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:35,791
We're going to die
if we set foot in that house!

623
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,416
Why? What did you see in the hole?

624
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:44,083
Wait. Didn't you see the same thing I saw?

625
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:51,666
Hold it, Pim.

626
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:53,708
Don't do that.

627
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:13,666
What's in there?

628
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,458
Putt, stay away from the hole.

629
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,541
Something's seriously wrong
about the house next door.

630
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,750
But you just said
you wanted to go in there.

631
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:25,250
Do you think what you've seen is real?

632
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,208
I don't think so.

633
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:28,166
Why not?

634
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:31,166
It's nighttime in that house.

635
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:36,958
The girl is standing in the dark.

636
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,000
But it's all bright and sunny here.

637
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,666
Yes.

638
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,625
It's just not possible.

639
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:47,750
So this hole isn't real.

640
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:51,125
And that girl is a ghost.

641
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,666
Putt, promise me.

642
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,833
You won't peek through
that hole ever again.

643
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,458
Promise me!

644
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,541
Hey, Latte.

645
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:18,666
You're back!

646
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:25,375
You stupid cat, where have you been?
I was worried about you.

647
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,375
Putt! Latte is back.

648
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,000
Yummy, right?

649
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:37,250
Eat some more.

650
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,083
Putt! What's wrong?

651
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,916
Putt!

652
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:37,791
It…

653
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,416
-It's in this room.
-What?

654
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,666
What is in this room?

655
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,333
It was standing right there.

656
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,750
-What!
-I saw it there just now.

657
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,875
Here? Where?

658
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:51,583
What are you talking about?
There's nothing here!

659
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:56,625
I saw it with my own eyes.
It's right by my bed!

660
01:00:56,708 --> 01:01:00,125
Maybe it's just a nightmare.
Go back to sleep.

661
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:14,708
Putt, wake up.

662
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,458
Putt, wake up. You'll be late for school.

663
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,375
I'm not feeling well.

664
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,916
Lame excuse. Get up.

665
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,041
Putt!

666
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,041
You're bleeding.

667
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:32,083
Are you hurt?

668
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,000
Putt.

669
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,958
I don't know, I feel feverish.

670
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,041
I'll get Grandma.

671
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,083
Don’t!

672
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,833
I'm going to school.

673
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,916
In that state? No way! Just wait here.

674
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,250
Grandma.

675
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,250
Can you come up here? Putt is sick.

676
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:06,458
TYCOON'S HEIR WALKS FREE
FRIEND CONFESSED TO HIT AND RUN

677
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:39,958
Mai, my child…

678
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:47,041
Every time you were in trouble,

679
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:50,708
I was always there to pull you through.

680
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:53,333
But…

681
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,500
this time…

682
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,666
I don't know what else I can do.

683
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:12,333
I had been a policeman all my life.

684
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,666
I have served the public.

685
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,208
But today,

686
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,583
the law allows a bad man to walk free.

687
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:35,000
I swear…

688
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:41,791
I will get that son of a bitch
who did this to you.

689
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,333
I'll go after him and make him pay!

690
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,291
Have some warm milk, Putt.

691
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:01,875
Feeling better?

692
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,875
Not really.

693
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,083
Soon you will.

694
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,250
Grandma.

695
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:33,166
When Mom was living here,

696
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,458
what was she like?

697
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,125
Your mother?

698
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,833
Mai was a perfect girl.

699
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,208
The queen of her campus.

700
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,541
And she was a cheerleader, like Pim.

701
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,333
In fact,

702
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:59,291
Pim takes after Mai as if
they were the same person.

703
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:05,541
Grandpa and I
had high expectations of your mom,

704
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,583
until…

705
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,625
Until what?

706
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:15,708
Let's not bring that up.

707
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:20,208
Hey, what are you drawing? Can I see?

708
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,916
Let me see it.

709
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,583
You're talented.

710
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,750
Why did you draw
something horrible like that?

711
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
I didn't draw this one.

712
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,041
Liar. It's your sketchbook.

713
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,833
Yes, but I didn't draw that picture.

714
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:02,541
What did I carry into the room?

715
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,458
Oh, that jug of milk.

716
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:17,875
Why didn't you drink it?

717
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:19,500
Drink up now.

718
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Putt, drink it.

719
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:37,000
Go on!

720
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:36,625
Alright, it's time to vote
for our new captain.

721
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:40,958
We have three nominations.

722
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:44,666
The first one is our current captain, Pim.

723
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,375
The next candidate

724
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:55,250
is Mint.

725
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:06,333
And finally,

726
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:09,458
we have Paew.

727
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,958
I had no idea!

728
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,500
Who the hell put up my name?

729
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:20,541
Listen up, girls.

730
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:26,583
I'd like to inform you that
even though we have three candidates,

731
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:31,791
there's only one
who meets all the requirements.

732
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,083
And that person is…

733
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:37,208
Pim.

734
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,875
That's it for today. You're dismissed.

735
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,083
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

736
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,625
Congrats.

737
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:03,333
Paew.

738
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,291
Stop playing innocent.

739
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:12,166
What are you talking about?

740
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:13,708
Why are you doing this?

741
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:17,541
Doing what? I have no idea
what you are talking about!

742
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,791
WHEN WILL YOU RELEASE THE CLIP?
I SENT IT TO YOU WEEKS AGO!

743
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,458
I WILL SOON!
ONCE PIM IS MINE AND I'LL SPREAD IT

744
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:28,875
FAME, YOU ASSHOLE.

745
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:31,000
I LET YOU SLEEP WITH ME
AND YOU WANT TO GET PIM TOO?

746
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,125
TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE HAHA

747
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,291
I know that you filmed that clip
and sent it to Fame.

748
01:09:42,375 --> 01:09:44,416
And he's using it to blackmail me.

749
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,208
You're such a two-faced bitch.

750
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,041
Who do you call a bitch?

751
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,750
Look around you.

752
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,541
They all fucking hate you.

753
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:02,000
"Hi, I'm Pim. I'm beautiful and smart."

754
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:05,625
"I'm the perfect girl,
the brightest star of the school."

755
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:07,416
You're the real bitch here.

756
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:13,416
Do you want to know
what they say behind your back?

757
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,666
Well, I guess you don't care anyway.

758
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:23,250
Because you're a snooty little queen
stuck on your high horse.

759
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:30,208
Oh, and I bet the whole school
has already seen the clip.

760
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,750
So it's really you.

761
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,500
What are you talking about?

762
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,416
Paew,

763
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,750
Pim already told me about the clip.

764
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:54,416
Your plan was to release the clip today
to humiliate Pim

765
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,166
so she would give up her position.

766
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:57,958
I didn't do any of that.

767
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:01,041
I made Pim team captain again

768
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,958
in order to expose you.

769
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,458
I don't know what you're talking about.

770
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:09,458
You can't accuse me just like that.
Do you have any proof?

771
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:12,291
The proof is in here.

772
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,083
Give me your phone.

773
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,666
Now.

774
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,333
Sorry, go back to sleep.

775
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,750
It's alright.

776
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:05,208
I was waiting for you.

777
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,208
How are you doing?

778
01:12:11,458 --> 01:12:14,916
You're not getting any better.

779
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:19,666
Pim, I don't want to stay here any longer.

780
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,041
I want to go home.

781
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:27,291
It's this house. It makes me sick.

782
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:29,833
Putt.

783
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,166
Did you look through that hole again?

784
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:41,166
The hole keeps calling out to me.

785
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,708
I can't fight it, so yes, I did look.

786
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:52,583
You're sick because of that stupid hole
and the ghost girl.

787
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,333
You must stay away from it.

788
01:12:58,916 --> 01:12:59,875
Here.

789
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,333
Putt, this is serious,
you need to go to a hospital.

790
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,291
Hello. Pim, I'll call you back.

791
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:48,625
Grandpa, Putt is very sick.
What should we do?

792
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:51,250
What's wrong with him?

793
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,000
He's coughing blood.

794
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:54,166
Where are you?

795
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,750
I'm in the middle of something.

796
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:57,458
Have you told Grandma?

797
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:58,916
I knocked on her bedroom door.

798
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,208
She didn't respond,
so I guess she's sleeping.

799
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,083
I didn't want to disturb her.

800
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:06,541
Okay, I'll be right home.

801
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:37,125
What do we do now?

802
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,583
I'm done with it.

803
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:47,083
Right, you shouldn't take any more risks.

804
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,166
What did you see?

805
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,708
Tell me, what did you see?

806
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,500
The girl…
She died right there in that house!

807
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,583
That man didn't even try to help her.

808
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:31,083
There's a man?

809
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:34,666
Yes, he was drunk sleeping
like nothing happened.

810
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,000
Putt, don't look!

811
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,375
How did she die?

812
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,625
Maybe everything happened

813
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,791
because the girl is trying to tell us
how she died.

814
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:53,166
Wait a minute.

815
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:56,666
Did it ever occur to you

816
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,291
that the room we see through the hole

817
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:00,791
looks exactly like this room?

818
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,875
How's that possible?

819
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:10,458
At one time
there must've been a clock on that wall.

820
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,166
Haven't you noticed

821
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:15,375
that Grandma keeps glancing there

822
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:18,000
even though it's just an empty wall?

823
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:22,041
Old habit,
because she used to check the time there.

824
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:29,333
Yes, that means that room is this room.

825
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:33,458
But at two different times.

826
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,250
But it's impossible!

827
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:40,791
Have you heard of the wormhole theory?

828
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,916
Wormhole theory? No.

829
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,958
A wormhole is a portal
that connects different dimensions.

830
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,083
What we saw in that hole

831
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,375
already happened in the past.

832
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,833
Are you serious?

833
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,958
Dead serious.

834
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,458
You said it yourself

835
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:07,708
that it's always a different time
of the day in that room.

836
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,500
And there are other things
that aren't logical.

837
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,666
What are you doing?

838
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:26,791
It's late. Why aren't you in bed already?

839
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:31,458
Didn't you just tell me Putt is very sick?

840
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:36,083
Grandpa,

841
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,625
do you know anything about the girl
who died next door?

842
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,875
What girl? There's no dead girl anywhere.

843
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:48,375
That house has been abandoned
a long time ago.

844
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,916
But there was a girl who once lived there.

845
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,958
And she died some time ago.

846
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,041
We saw everything through the hole.

847
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:03,875
Stop it, not the goddamn hole again!

848
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,250
Where is it, then?

849
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,666
If there's a hole, how can I not see it?

850
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,583
Did you two see that hole?

851
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,208
Jeez.

852
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,208
Come help me.

853
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:32,500
-That's enough.
-Alright.

854
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,375
Alright.

855
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,583
That's it.
You won't see a damn hole again.

856
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:41,875
Now go to bed.

857
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,625
Yes. Let's go.

858
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:58,625
CRIME SUPPRESSION DIVISION

859
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,041
What's going on here?

860
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:54,791
No checkpoints around here, don't worry.

861
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:57,708
The district police
is on my father's payroll anyway.

862
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:00,291
Right.

863
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,750
I'm almost home, bye.

864
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,291
Shit.

865
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,625
What the fuck.

866
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,791
How much do you want?

867
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,291
Shut up.

868
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:52,041
Who the fuck are you?
My father will kick your ass.

869
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,125
Have you been drinking?

870
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:55,583
None of your fucking business.

871
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:29,291
Pim… Putt…

872
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:42,958
You are now charged with
attempted murder of a police officer.

873
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,583
Thai law can't touch me,
don't you know that?

874
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,500
Go to hell, you worthless cop.

875
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:50,458
You're finished, man.

876
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:54,541
When I get out of this
I'll fucking kill you!

877
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:10,166
You love drinking?

878
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:13,541
I'll pour you the whole bottle!

879
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:30,458
Burn in hell, scumbag.

880
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,125
No answer. That's weird.

881
01:23:56,541 --> 01:24:02,375
He kept reminding me
to call him immediately if you wake up.

882
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,583
Who are you talking about, doctor?

883
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,041
Mr. Somphong, your father.

884
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:13,833
He's worried sick about you.
He's here every day.

885
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,375
Careful.

886
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,750
My father?

887
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:24,250
That's right

888
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:30,333
You just came out of a coma,
things may seem a little blurry.

889
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:33,041
What about my kids?

890
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,000
They come almost every day.

891
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:41,125
Don't worry. They're staying
with their grandfather now.

892
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,041
What?

893
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,416
-Miss. You can't go now.
-Please lie down.

894
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,791
-I have to go get my kids.
-You're not fully recovered.

895
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,125
Your kids are safe
with their grandparents.

896
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:56,083
Miss!

897
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:58,291
-Please don't resist.
-No.

898
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:02,541
You don't understand!
I have to get them out of that house!

899
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:03,916
Let me go!

900
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:18,583
Grandma, why don't you get some rest?

901
01:25:18,666 --> 01:25:21,375
Putt and I will clean up everything.

902
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:24,375
We'll finish it before Grandpa gets home.

903
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:10,791
No.

904
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:16,625
Grandma, you can see the hole, right?

905
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:23,083
And you can hear the noise.

906
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:29,166
Grandma, do you hear it?

907
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,125
Fifteen years…

908
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,125
For 15 years

909
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:43,375
that noise has been tormenting me.

910
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:50,708
What? So you do hear it.

911
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:58,458
How come you never said a word about it?

912
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:06,208
You know how irascible your grandpa is.

913
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:10,041
Because he has never heard that noise.

914
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:14,041
And he has never seen that hole
like we have.

915
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:18,666
He thinks I've lost my mind.

916
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:23,375
For years he's made me take those pills.

917
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,750
So I'll forget

918
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:36,333
everything I have seen

919
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:39,208
and everything I have heard.

920
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:43,541
Did you ever look through the hole?

921
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:55,750
Grandma, that girl died in our house,
didn't she?

922
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:10,500
No, Pim.

923
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:15,000
Don't look! I beg you!

924
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:20,958
Believe me, Pim! Get away from it!

925
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:26,208
Get away from it!

926
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,333
Pim.

927
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:47,666
Pinya.

928
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:53,208
Pinya.

929
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:59,291
Krit, wake up. Where's Pinya?

930
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,791
Where's Pinya?

931
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,458
Mai, what's going on?

932
01:29:05,541 --> 01:29:07,916
-Mom, my daughter is missing.
-What?

933
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:16,375
Pim, what did you see?

934
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:19,916
Mom. I saw Mom.

935
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,583
She's young and pregnant.

936
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:28,291
Exactly as I thought. It's a wormhole.

937
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,208
What?

938
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:33,250
I saw you and Grandpa too.

939
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:35,833
But you two weren't as old as you are now.

940
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:38,250
Nonsense. I told you not to look.

941
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:41,375
Go back to your room. Go!

942
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:44,833
Grandma, who is Pinya?

943
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,583
Why did Mom call her "daughter"?

944
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:51,458
No, Putt!

945
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:54,166
Don't look in there!

946
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:58,583
Pinya, my child, don't leave me!

947
01:29:58,666 --> 01:30:01,458
-Wan, take them upstairs.
-Pinya!

948
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,125
I'll take care of everything here.

949
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:06,125
Pinya.

950
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:11,041
Pinya, please don't leave me!

951
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:17,458
You let our daughter die, Krit!

952
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:27,000
-That's enough! Stop looking!
-Grandma.

953
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:29,125
That man is my father?

954
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:30,708
-Just forget it!
-Calm down, Grandma.

955
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:32,625
What happened to my father?
I want to know.

956
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:33,791
You don't need to know.

957
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:44,791
Sir, where are you going?

958
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,708
Mr. Somphong.

959
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Doctor, where's my daughter?

960
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:04,125
There's a problem. Mai has run away.

961
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,541
What? Did she run away?

962
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:13,291
It's been 15 years since it happened.

963
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:19,000
Grandpa and I went out with your mother,

964
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:27,666
leaving Pinya with your father.

965
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,583
We never thought
something bad would happen.

966
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:39,958
If I could turn back time,

967
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:47,625
I would never leave Pinya
with that good-for-nothing.

968
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,750
Dad.

969
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:32,166
Yes.

970
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:33,458
Dad.

971
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:36,000
Come play with me.

972
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:39,208
Okay. What do we play?

973
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,541
Hide-and-seek.

974
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:46,416
Okay. You go hide, I'll be the seeker.

975
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:08,625
God knows how long Pinya was trapped

976
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:13,666
in the closet under the stairs.

977
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:19,125
That bastard got drunk and fell asleep.

978
01:33:19,791 --> 01:33:21,958
He forgot about his daughter.

979
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:30,750
When we found her, it was too late.

980
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:34,041
How did she die?

981
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:43,041
Rat poison. She drank rat poison.

982
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:49,875
RAT POISON

983
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,041
Why did she do that?

984
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:56,125
The child wasn't normal.

985
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:01,875
She saw the rat poison I kept in there.

986
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:05,666
I think…

987
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:12,791
She must have thought
it was some sort of syrup.

988
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:15,083
What about my father?

989
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,541
That bastard…

990
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,916
What happened?

991
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,958
Krit!

992
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:30,041
He snatched my gun and shot himself.

993
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:33,583
He must have felt guilty
over Pinya's death.

994
01:34:39,291 --> 01:34:43,625
Putt, you're coughing blood again!

995
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:47,000
We have to take him to a hospital.

996
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:50,708
How do you feel?
Why don't you go get some rest?

997
01:34:51,416 --> 01:34:53,666
-Come on.
-His condition worsens!

998
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,875
-He needs to see a doctor right away.
-No.

999
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:58,750
Let him lie down and he'll be fine.
Come on.

1000
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:00,958
Trust me. Putt, get over here.

1001
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:04,958
Please Grandma,
we have to take him to a hospital.

1002
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:21,791
I'm calling an ambulance.

1003
01:35:23,666 --> 01:35:24,875
Putt.

1004
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:30,583
Have some warm milk
and you'll get better in no time.

1005
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:34,000
He's terribly sick.
Forget the milk for God's sake!

1006
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:43,625
-Pinya, drink up. Do it.
-Grandma, no!

1007
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:45,041
-Grandma.
-Pinya, drink.

1008
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:46,916
-He's Putt, not Pinya.
-I don't want to drink it.

1009
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,833
-Stop it, Grandma!
-Pinya, drink up.

1010
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,500
Stop it! Leave my kids alone!

1011
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:56,625
-Mom.
-Mom.

1012
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:03,000
Mai, my dear daughter.

1013
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,291
Mom!

1014
01:36:23,083 --> 01:36:27,250
Mai, you woke up.

1015
01:36:27,833 --> 01:36:31,583
When were you discharged?
How come nobody told me?

1016
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:32,875
Mom…

1017
01:36:32,958 --> 01:36:36,666
Back off, Mom. I'm taking my kids home.

1018
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:41,250
Home? This is your home.

1019
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:45,291
I've kept your room exactly the same
since you left us.

1020
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:51,958
Come live here. Come back to me.

1021
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:56,666
I will never let my kids
live in this house.

1022
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:57,958
Move.

1023
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,333
Pim, Putt, let's go home.

1024
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,625
-Let's go. Back off!
-No.

1025
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:05,833
Please don't go, Mai. Please.

1026
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:09,500
Please don't go.

1027
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:23,458
Mai, why did you run away
from the hospital?

1028
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,375
The doctor said you need to remain
under observation.

1029
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:27,208
Back away, Dad.

1030
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:32,083
You two go upstairs.
I have to talk to your mother.

1031
01:37:32,166 --> 01:37:33,916
Kids, stay here.

1032
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:37,916
If you have something to say, say it now.

1033
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,708
I want my kids to know the truth as well.

1034
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:43,291
I never hid anything from you.

1035
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:49,333
Really? Look at your hand.

1036
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:52,166
You're still holding the same gun.

1037
01:38:06,916 --> 01:38:10,791
Tell me,
what happened while I was in the hospital?

1038
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:17,125
As soon as I got here,
I knew something wasn't right.

1039
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,458
It's all in your head.

1040
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:26,708
Please stop her.
Don't let her run away again.

1041
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:27,958
Please.

1042
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,416
Are you hiding something from me?

1043
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,458
No, I'm not.

1044
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:36,458
Then let me ask you something

1045
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,500
I've been wondering about for a long time.

1046
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,708
That day,
did Krit really force the gun out of you?

1047
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:53,625
Mom, Pim and I already know about Dad.

1048
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:58,083
Don't listen to your children.
They're talking nonsense.

1049
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:00,416
We know about Pinya too.

1050
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:05,791
How did you…

1051
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:10,125
How did you know about Pinya?

1052
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,583
Enough.

1053
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:20,708
Your kids are inveterate liars!

1054
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:24,666
-Putt!
-Putt!

1055
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,833
He has been coughing blood for days.

1056
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,875
We have to take him to a hospital now.

1057
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:30,791
I've already told Grandma.

1058
01:39:30,875 --> 01:39:33,416
But she kept urging him to drink milk.

1059
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,750
Milk?

1060
01:39:34,833 --> 01:39:39,000
Yes. Before you got here,
she forced Putt to drink that milk.

1061
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:46,791
Get up.

1062
01:39:47,875 --> 01:39:48,791
What?

1063
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:55,750
How did she die?

1064
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,041
Rat poison.

1065
01:39:57,125 --> 01:39:59,916
Pinya drank rat poison.

1066
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:02,625
Grandma, no!

1067
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:07,458
Grandma, what have you been giving Putt?

1068
01:40:08,083 --> 01:40:12,000
Milk, of course. What's wrong with that?

1069
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:15,458
Then let me try it.

1070
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:19,041
-Can I?
-No, you can't drink it!

1071
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:24,583
Why not? Why can't I drink this milk?

1072
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:28,416
No! You can't drink it! Don't do it!

1073
01:40:52,625 --> 01:40:55,458
Pinya.

1074
01:40:58,416 --> 01:40:59,625
Stop it, Pinya.

1075
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:01,500
Here, your milk.

1076
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:10,000
My dear Pim.
You're the most beautiful girl.

1077
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:12,833
Pinya…

1078
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:16,833
Pinya.

1079
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,375
Pinya.

1080
01:41:33,291 --> 01:41:34,291
Mom.

1081
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:39,333
Mom…

1082
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,666
You poisoned Pinya.

1083
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,666
And…

1084
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,625
And you poisoned Putt.

1085
01:41:58,125 --> 01:42:02,625
How could you do this to my children?

1086
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:05,916
What are you talking about?

1087
01:42:06,541 --> 01:42:08,916
Your mother will never do such a thing.

1088
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:13,125
Everything that happened was
because of that scumbag Krit.

1089
01:42:13,208 --> 01:42:14,625
You know it.

1090
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,791
That's not true.

1091
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:20,166
Not everything is Krit's fault.

1092
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:28,541
You had a hand in it.
You sat there pretending to be innocent

1093
01:42:31,125 --> 01:42:36,833
and let us think Pinya died
because of Krit.

1094
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:43,416
But it's you.

1095
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:47,333
It's because Pinya wasn't a normal child.

1096
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:54,166
How could you do this to my daughter?
How could you?

1097
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:13,208
Mai, are you blaming me?

1098
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:18,000
Everything I did, I did it for you.

1099
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:21,875
You're a perfect girl.

1100
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:25,500
But you chose to marry that asshole.

1101
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:34,500
Then your first child was a freak.

1102
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:39,833
Born ugly and crippled, like Putt!

1103
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:46,458
This family is cursed.

1104
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:51,708
A perfect daughter

1105
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:58,125
married a drunk and gave birth
to a crippled child.

1106
01:44:04,333 --> 01:44:08,041
It's not this family.

1107
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:11,500
It's just me who is cursed.

1108
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:16,375
The curse of having a mother like you.

1109
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:23,791
A mother who took everything
I ever loved from me.

1110
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:33,250
I did this family a favor
by cleansing bad karma off it.

1111
01:44:34,291 --> 01:44:36,625
Now you can have a better life!

1112
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,958
That's all I did.

1113
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:47,208
For everything that already happened,

1114
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,916
I won't blame anyone.

1115
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:58,791
After all,
you are my father and my mother.

1116
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,833
But I'm warning you.

1117
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:09,208
From now on, leave my family alone.

1118
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:17,208
Or I will expose what you did.

1119
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:28,041
Pim, Putt, come with me.

1120
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:37,500
Let's go.

1121
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:42,083
Mai, come back.

1122
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:43,791
Don't leave me!

1123
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:47,375
Mai, don't go!

1124
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:49,958
-Wan.
-Don't leave me!

1125
01:45:50,041 --> 01:45:53,791
Please don't leave me!

1126
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:56,625
Don't leave me!

1127
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:26,916
I'm sorry I never told you
about Pinya and your father.

1128
01:46:29,958 --> 01:46:31,041
Putt.

1129
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,125
You look a lot like him.

1130
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:42,166
Your father is an artist,
he used to paint every day.

1131
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:50,875
He never told me about his problems.

1132
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:54,000
He turned to alcohol and it ruined him.

1133
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:01,333
Your father loved you so much, Pim.

1134
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:06,625
And he was so thrilled
when I was pregnant with a son.

1135
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:13,666
Pinya also loved you so much.

1136
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:22,000
She would hold you and hum a lullaby
until you fell asleep.

1137
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:28,958
That's why the melody is so familiar.

1138
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:33,416
Even now I can still hum that tune.

1139
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:44,166
Mom,

1140
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:52,125
what if what we know

1141
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:55,833
is not the whole truth?

1142
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:01,333
What do you mean?

1143
01:48:05,666 --> 01:48:10,500
Sometimes what we think we know

1144
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:13,458
is only a fraction of the truth.

1145
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,333
Not the whole truth.

1146
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:26,083
She's talking about Dad.

1147
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:31,541
What?

1148
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:36,041
How do you know anything about him?

1149
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:42,000
We looked through the hole
in the wall at Grandpa's.

1150
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:46,875
You can see that hole?

1151
01:48:57,541 --> 01:49:03,041
That hole made me
want to get out of that house.

1152
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:10,166
So you could see it too?

1153
01:49:12,166 --> 01:49:15,375
After your father killed himself,

1154
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:20,416
Grandpa tried to cover the hole.

1155
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,958
But it never goes away.

1156
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Did you ever look into it?

1157
01:49:39,708 --> 01:49:43,833
No. Never.

1158
01:49:53,416 --> 01:49:54,708
That noise.

1159
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:56,958
That noise again.

1160
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,458
What?

1161
01:50:01,166 --> 01:50:04,208
-It's that noise.
-What are you talking about?

1162
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:06,500
Hey.

1163
01:50:06,583 --> 01:50:08,333
I don't hear anything.

1164
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:12,291
I've heard it for 15 years now.

1165
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:15,958
I can't stand it anymore. Enough already!

1166
01:50:16,041 --> 01:50:18,791
Stop it!

1167
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:24,291
-Stop it!
-Wan!

1168
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:26,958
Damn it.

1169
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:34,291
CAPTAIN POL

1170
01:50:36,416 --> 01:50:37,291
Hello.

1171
01:50:37,375 --> 01:50:40,208
Sorry to disturb you
in the middle of the night.

1172
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:44,375
Have you heard about Chaiyut?

1173
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:45,750
What about him?

1174
01:50:46,791 --> 01:50:49,250
That boy was murdered last night.

1175
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:53,041
Someone dragged him out of his car

1176
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,791
and set fire to him.

1177
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,458
Sir,

1178
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:05,541
where were you last night?

1179
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:07,500
Last night?

1180
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:10,875
I was at the hospital with my daughter.

1181
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:12,416
Right.

1182
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:18,208
But, sir,
I'll have to ask you to come down

1183
01:51:18,791 --> 01:51:20,666
-and answer a few questions.
-Listen.

1184
01:51:21,208 --> 01:51:23,333
I know you're doing your job.

1185
01:51:23,416 --> 01:51:25,333
You're taking the heat
from the top brass, right?

1186
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,958
Please don't say that.

1187
01:51:28,791 --> 01:51:31,875
On your son-in-law's case 15 years ago,

1188
01:51:32,541 --> 01:51:35,125
I did my best to help you, didn't I?

1189
01:51:36,541 --> 01:51:39,250
Oh, I almost forgot.

1190
01:51:41,208 --> 01:51:44,708
A new witness has turned up.

1191
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:50,125
And we have images
from a dashboard camera.

1192
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:54,250
Chaiyut was telling the truth.

1193
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:08,458
Fuck, we're in deep shit!

1194
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:26,000
Fuck! It's my dad's car!

1195
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:28,458
I told you not to go in the opposite lane.

1196
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:30,125
I didn't mean it!

1197
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:36,666
Chaiyut didn't lie to us.

1198
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:39,750
His friend was really the driver.

1199
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,833
No! Stop it.

1200
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Who is it?

1201
01:53:12,166 --> 01:53:17,000
Who's in there?

1202
01:54:11,375 --> 01:54:15,291
Dearest Grandma.

1203
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:19,500
I already drank the milk.

1204
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:22,458
Am I a good girl?

1205
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:33,208
Grandma, hold me.

1206
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,375
-I'm cold.
-No.

1207
01:54:35,458 --> 01:54:37,333
It's cold in there.

1208
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:40,291
I love you.

1209
01:54:40,375 --> 01:54:42,041
-Get off me.
-I love you.

1210
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,250
Get off me.

1211
01:54:55,333 --> 01:54:56,250
Wan.

1212
01:55:04,625 --> 01:55:08,041
Wan!

1213
01:55:12,791 --> 01:55:13,750
Wan!

1214
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:19,791
RAT POISON

1215
01:55:19,875 --> 01:55:20,958
Wan!

1216
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:47,333
Why did you kill me?

1217
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:08,666
Wan!

1218
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:11,250
Wan.

1219
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:14,750
Wan.

1220
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:59,791
Truth is sometimes like a small hole
camouflaged by darkness.

1221
01:57:00,333 --> 01:57:02,166
It's always been there.

1222
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,916
We just can't see it.

1223
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,208
But as soon as a light shines on it,

1224
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,250
it reveals itself for all to see,

1225
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:17,750
making us wonder how long
it has been hidden there.

1226
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,916
They left it unlocked again.

1227
01:57:36,916 --> 01:57:40,083
Dad, open the door.

1228
01:57:40,166 --> 01:57:45,000
I'm in here. Open the door!

1229
01:57:45,666 --> 01:57:46,750
Dad!

1230
01:57:48,541 --> 01:57:50,083
Pinya!

1231
01:57:50,708 --> 01:57:54,375
Pinya, my child, don't leave me!

1232
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:57,125
-Wan, take them upstairs.
-Pinya!

1233
01:57:57,208 --> 01:57:58,958
I'll take care of everything here.

1234
01:58:04,416 --> 01:58:10,583
You let our daughter die, Krit!

1235
01:58:17,416 --> 01:58:19,041
You love drinking?

1236
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:23,500
I'll pour you the whole bottle!

1237
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:27,833
What are you doing?

1238
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:31,291
A scumbag like you
doesn't deserve my daughter.

1239
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:34,708
No.

1240
01:58:40,791 --> 01:58:42,833
You let our daughter die!

1241
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:46,750
Mai, what have you done?

1242
01:59:01,333 --> 01:59:02,458
Krit.

1243
01:59:03,208 --> 01:59:04,416
Krit.

1244
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:07,458
Krit.

1245
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:08,875
Krit.

1246
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:18,333
Pim, you're so pretty.

1247
02:00:19,333 --> 02:00:20,916
I love you.

1248
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:23,125
