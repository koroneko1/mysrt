1
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,500
The locals here have believed
in spirits for ages.

2
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,666
Maybe even before there was any religion.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,083
But the meaning of spirits for Isan people

4
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,958
might not be the same as for most.

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,583
We believe everything
that goes beyond nature

6
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,291
is all called spirits,

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,291
not just the souls of dead people.

8
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,500
We believe
spirits are in every single thing.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,291
In houses,

10
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,291
in forests, in mountains,

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,875
in trees,

12
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,750
in rice fields.

13
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,208
Every area has spirits. All of it.

14
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,500
IN 2018, A DOCUMENTARY TEAM
TRAVELED ALL OVER THAILAND

15
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,708
TO STUDY THE LIVES OF SHAMANS.

16
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,791
AFTER INTERVIEWING MANY SHAMANS,

17
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,583
THE TEAM DECIDED TO STUDY NIM'S LIFE.

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,041
THE SHAMAN OF GODDESS BA YAN.

19
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,375
For Isan people, spirits have many types

20
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:54,000
such as Phee Fah, Phee Tan,

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,166
Phee Chua, Phee Ban, Phee Muang,

22
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,458
Phee Pop, and Phee Ka.

23
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,458
They're all spirits.

24
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,791
There are good spirits that protect us,

25
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,625
and evil spirits

26
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,333
that haunt us and make us sick.

27
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,458
And the spirit within you, who is it?

28
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,083
Let me say it in central dialect.

29
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,333
They call it "possessing."

30
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,000
In Isan, they call it Ma Tiam.

31
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,333
I'm the shaman for Goddess Ba Yan.

32
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,250
Ba Yan is an ancestral spirit.

33
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,583
She's a good spirit

34
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,375
who has protected the villages
for a long time.

35
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,625
Actually, no one knows
who She is or where She's from.

36
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,708
But they've paid respect to Her
for many generations.

37
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,583
SHAMAN BLOODLINE

38
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,708
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE SHAMAN
INHERITANCE IN A FAMILY.

39
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:49,666
My family has been Ba Yan's shaman
for many generations.

40
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,375
Ever since I was born,

41
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,458
I saw my grandmother as Her medium.

42
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:57,625
Ba Yan only chooses women
to be Her medium.

43
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,041
Lots of locals would come to see us.

44
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,875
Every year we have a ceremony.
A very big one.

45
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,500
The locals will ask

46
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,500
how the village
will fare for the coming year.

47
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,125
After my grandmother died,

48
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,500
the next person to inherit Ba Yan
was my aunt.

49
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:26,083
After my aunt, the next shaman
was supposed to be Noi, my elder sister,

50
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,250
but Noi declined the inheritance.

51
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,750
Ba Yan then chose…

52
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,958
me instead.

53
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,583
Don't shamans have to shake their bodies
or change their voices?

54
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,375
You might have watched too much TV.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
It doesn't have to be like that.

56
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,875
As you've seen,
people come and see me every day.

57
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,416
Some come to heal their sickness.

58
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,875
Some ask for blessings or wishes.

59
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,875
Some repay their wishes

60
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,708
with offerings of a jar of liquor
and a chicken.

61
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,041
Tell me what happened?

62
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,958
My husband found this cobra
and made liquor out of it.

63
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,750
I told him not to drink it, but he did.

64
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,375
His arms and legs went numb.
He doesn't have any strength.

65
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,791
Where did you get it from?

66
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,166
I got it from the cemetery.

67
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,708
This is the cause of your misery,
paying for your bad karma.

68
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,166
Because you've drunk the soul
that resided in this animal.

69
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,625
Can you treat every illness?

70
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,041
If someone has cancer
and they come to see me…

71
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,458
they will die for sure.

72
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:49,958
I can only treat illnesses
that happen from the unseen

73
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,875
such as black magic,

74
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,375
or if a spirit has harmed you,
I can cure it.

75
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,583
But if it's a normal illness,
I advise you to go see a doctor.

76
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,416
I never thought of being a shaman before.
Actually, I didn't want to be one.

77
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,166
There was a period when I was always sick.

78
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,416
No matter what, I couldn't get better.
It was so painful

79
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,458
to the point that I wanted to run away,
to get away from it all.

80
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,083
Why does it have to be me?

81
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,208
But I didn't succeed.

82
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,916
So I agreed to let Her take me.
Actually, it is great.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,083
Now I get to pray every day
and do ceremonies.

84
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:33,958
And people come to see me,
asking for help when they have troubles.

85
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,875
Now I consider it to be really good.

86
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,458
I'm at ease.

87
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,833
I can't even remember
why I first didn't accept Her,

88
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,125
why I was mad at Her.

89
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,083
SEAMSTRESS

90
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,250
We're going to Wiroj's funeral. Who is he?

91
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,041
Wiroj is…

92
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,333
the husband of my elder sister, Noi.

93
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,541
He found out last year that he had cancer.

94
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,916
I'm sorry for your loss.

95
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know why
all the men in the Yasantia family

96
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,750
die under bad circumstances.

97
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:53,250
Wiroj's grandfather was stoned
to death by laborers.

98
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,458
Wiroj's dad,
when his factory went belly-up,

99
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,583
he burned the factory for insurance money.

100
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,666
When he was caught,
he poisoned himself to death.

101
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,125
As for Mac, Wiroj's eldest son,

102
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,791
he died in a motorcycle accident
several years ago.

103
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,500
Huh?

104
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,750
How have you been?

105
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,041
I haven't seen you for so long.
Have you forgotten your family?

106
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,625
If no one died, we'd never see each other.

107
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,416
-Is this tray ready?
-Yeah, you can take it inside.

108
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,750
-You always forget your relatives.
-Can you stop nagging?

109
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,125
He's the pastor
from the church Noi goes to.

110
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,500
Thank you for coming.

111
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,333
Mink, please get a chair for the pastor.

112
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,083
Mink.

113
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,291
How are you?

114
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,083
Your mom told me
you were the first one to find his body.

115
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,291
I'm okay.

116
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,750
My family has three siblings.

117
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,291
There's Manit, the eldest.

118
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,625
If you smoke a lot,
you can't tell one thing from another.

119
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,750
Water? Want some water?

120
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,958
Noi is the middle child,
and I'm the youngest.

121
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,791
See…

122
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,750
Wiroj, Noi's husband, just died.

123
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:49,166
Before this, Mac, Noi's son, passed away.

124
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,666
Now, Noi is left with Mink,
her only daughter.

125
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,875
Actually,
Noi and Wiroj married a bit late.

126
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,541
Once they married…

127
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:07,541
Noi took over the dog meat shop
from her mother-in-law,

128
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,875
Wiroj's mother.

129
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,416
I don't know why she did that.

130
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,750
The government doesn't allow it,
but Noi secretly does.

131
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,541
My sisters,
they don't get along very well.

132
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:23,041
They have had some kind of disagreement
ever since who knows when.

133
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:29,333
I've tried to talk to them
to get them to reconcile, to make up.

134
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,916
Come on. Go get your shoes.

135
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,958
As if I would take anyone's shoes.

136
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

137
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
Auntie.

138
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,500
Mom wants you to get stuff from my house.

139
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,083
She wrote it all down
and where everything is.

140
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,541
Hello, Auntie Nim.

141
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,625
Here.

142
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,375
-Have you closed the door?
-Yes.

143
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,875
-Lucky won't go outside, right?
-It won't.

144
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:31,625
You brought the wrong cloth.
I wanted the thicker one.

145
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,500
Why don't you go get it yourself then?

146
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,708
Uncle, what the hell are you saying?

147
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,875
No one said anything.

148
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,958
-What the fuck did you say?
-Mink!

149
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,416
I didn't say anything.

150
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,375
Just mind your own business.
Are you talking shit about me?

151
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
Who? No one said anything.

152
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,208
-He cursed at me.
-I haven't done anything…

153
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,375
You called me a whore!

154
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,000
-Mink! Stop it!
-Hey!

155
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,666
-Mink, don't!
-Damn you!

156
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,541
-I didn't call you that!
-You just said it!

157
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,416
Get him out of here, Mom!

158
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,458
Mink, let's go.

159
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,125
-Mink, go. Leave first.
-I'm not leaving. He cursed at me!

160
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,125
No one said anything at all.

161
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,875
-Dammit! Get out of here!
-Mink, calm down.

162
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,958
-Mom, let go of me!
-Calm down, Mink.

163
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,375
He cursed at me.

164
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,500
He didn't.

165
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,666
Does Mink usually drink a lot?

166
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,583
I know she drinks,
but I didn't know it was this much.

167
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,458
This is the first time
Mink's caused a scene.

168
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,458
I see.

169
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,541
Go ahead.

170
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
See you around.

171
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,708
Drive safely.

172
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,916
Mink.

173
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,250
Mink.

174
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,125
Mink.

175
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,125
Mink.

176
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,416
Who died?

177
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,333
The blind old woman
whose house is behind the temple.

178
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,541
How did she die?

179
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,541
I don't know.

180
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,666
Mink.

181
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,041
Mink!

182
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,791
WIROJ YASANTIA

183
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,333
Nim, what are you doing here?

184
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,958
What are you doing in Mink's room?

185
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,875
Why are you going through her things?

186
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,625
I asked you a question.
Why don't you answer?

187
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,541
Why aren't you saying anything? Gosh!

188
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,833
What are you looking for? Tell me…

189
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,666
Here.

190
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,416
See?

191
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you know what this is?

192
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,000
What?

193
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,333
What are you doing? Both of you get out.

194
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,708
-Mink, hold on.
-Mom, leave.

195
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,291
Mink, you've started to have nightmares

196
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,750
-and hear strange things, right?
-No! Nothing! Mom, get out.

197
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,333
-Mink…
-Get out.

198
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,541
Get out!

199
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,000
Must you film everything, seriously?

200
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,958
You know what the turmeric is for, right?

201
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,250
You must tell me
if Mink shows any strange symptoms.

202
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,291
Noi!

203
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,000
I can take care of my child.
You should leave.

204
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,208
What is it that Mink hangs in her closet?

205
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,875
It's a turmeric called Pa Ta Ba.

206
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,625
We believe it can protect us from spirits

207
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,333
and other evil things.

208
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,750
Why the hell did they come
into other people's rooms?

209
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,833
They went through my stuff, too. Damn it!

210
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,125
It's so freaking lame.

211
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
Right?

212
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,083
Why did you put the Pa Ta Ba in your room?

213
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,083
What they did, it's so childish.
They're supposed to be the adults here.

214
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,541
At the funeral the other day,
why were you staring at that blind lady?

215
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,750
What blind lady?

216
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,250
Do you see someone standing over there?

217
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,250
Yes.

218
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,791
I see someone there.

219
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,916
Why?

220
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:51,250
THE TEAM WENT OVER THE FOOTAGE

221
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,583
AND FOUND MINK SHOWING
SOME STRANGE BEHAVIOR.

222
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,958
What do Mink's recent symptoms mean?

223
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:10,250
From what I've gathered,
they can be several things.

224
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,791
Does that mean Ba Yan will move to Mink?

225
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,958
I don't know.

226
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:28,583
THE TEAM HAD AN IDEA.
IF A SHAMAN INHERITANCE IS REAL,

227
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:34,125
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO RECORD THE MANIFESTATION.

228
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,708
THEY DECIDED TO FILM MINK
AND HER FAMILY, TOO.

229
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,458
Hey.

230
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,083
Are you going to film me all the time?

231
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,000
Most of the time.

232
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,166
Just make yourself comfortable.

233
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,375
Tell me about your job.

234
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,333
Sure.

235
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,750
I work at the Recruitment Center.

236
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,458
RECRUITMENT CENTER

237
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,583
All day I assign work for people to do.

238
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,958
NUMBER 13

239
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,125
Number 6.

240
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,916
Hello.

241
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,208
I wake up at 5 a.m. I wake up early.

242
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,208
I eat and get to work around 7, 8 a.m.

243
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,583
In the afternoon there aren't many people.
So I have some free time.

244
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,250
I'm not that tired with my work.

245
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,250
And do you like your job?

246
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,333
Yeah.

247
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,416
I think I'm happy
helping others find jobs.

248
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,666
Do you really mean it?

249
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,875
Of course!
I sound like a beauty queen, huh?

250
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,625
How do you feel towards people
who are shamans, like your aunt?

251
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,625
Shamans?

252
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,875
To be honest,

253
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,333
I think it's nonsense.
I don't think it's real.

254
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,458
Out of the blue, they make weird moves.

255
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,125
Acting like Hanuman. It's so weird.

256
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:09,041
I've also heard people say that
there's a Doraemon shaman.

257
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,041
Hilarious!

258
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,958
What's a Doraemon shaman?

259
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,666
Well, it’s a Doraemon shaman.

260
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,291
I guess when they're taken over,
they sing the theme song.

261
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,083
I can speak in tongues too.

262
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,166
I'll show you.

263
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,875
See?

264
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,333
Anyone can do it. Have you seen
those clips? This is how they speak.

265
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,458
-What would you like?
-100 baht of meat.

266
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:42,875
Thank you.

267
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,250
I don't know
why they won't let us sell it.

268
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,958
People around here have eaten
dog meat for ages.

269
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,416
Oh, but you sell dog meat
and also have a pet dog.

270
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,875
Doesn't it feel strange?

271
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't find it strange at all.

272
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:59,375
Those who raise goldfish and carp,
don't they also eat fish?

273
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,291
NOI
MINK'S MOTHER

274
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,250
May I ask about Ba Yan?

275
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:07,541
When Ba Yan tried to enter into you,
can you remember how you felt at the time?

276
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,250
Back then,
I remember I was in my twenties.

277
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,416
I started to have weird symptoms.

278
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,416
Locals call it Shaman Fever.

279
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,000
At the time, I had severe headaches,

280
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,666
and my period came every day straight
for five full months.

281
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,541
My aunt was already a shaman.

282
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,041
She advised me to do
an Acceptance Ceremony to be a shaman.

283
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,875
But I didn't want to.
I didn't like the idea of it.

284
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:34,833
So…

285
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,000
I converted to Christianity.

286
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,125
I prayed to God

287
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,083
that I would not become a shaman.

288
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:44,166
For if you forgive others
their trespasses,

289
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,166
your heavenly Father
will also forgive you.

290
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,125
But if you do not forgive
others their trespasses,

291
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:53,208
neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses.

292
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,500
But something happened with Nim,
my younger sister.

293
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:00,000
Nim went to study dressmaking in the city.

294
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,375
They said that she fainted and blacked out

295
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,916
without knowing the cause.

296
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,041
We had to go get her
and bring her back home.

297
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,458
After that,
Ba Yan entered into Nim instead.

298
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,250
No one knows what happened.

299
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,000
Thinking about it now, I do feel guilty…

300
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,125
Nim took my place as the shaman.

301
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,083
And what if now…

302
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,958
Ba Yan wants to move to Mink.
What will you do?

303
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,333
If you're going to ask me
stupid questions,

304
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,458
then you can stop asking.

305
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,708
And stop filming.

306
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,333
Wow, Mink. You're beautiful.

307
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,708
Why are you wearing baby shoes?

308
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,708
Girl, on parade day,
you're going to be the prettiest.

309
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:12,958
Is it comfortable?

310
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,875
It's fine. But it's a bit loose.
They'll take it in for me.

311
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:16,833
Oh, I see.

312
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,916
Lisa, have you noticed Mink
acting strange lately?

313
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,458
Recently,
I guess you could call it strange.

314
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:37,333
It's like she's faking or something,
like she's not her real self.

315
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,291
Here, just a second.

316
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,583
Mink, where are you going?

317
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,541
Girl, it's for kids. You can't play.

318
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,875
I want to.

319
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,416
Are you out of your mind? Get out.

320
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,500
Mink.

321
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,416
Cray-Cray.

322
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,166
Mink!

323
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,833
What the hell is wrong with you?

324
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,166
Mink!

325
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,250
What are you doing?

326
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:40,916
Hey.

327
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,291
Hey.

328
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,583
Can you not film me all the time?

329
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,708
I'm a mess right now.

330
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,583
Stop filming.

331
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,750
RECRUITMENT CENTER

332
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,125
Mink, you bitch.

333
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,250
You ditched me to go with some guy again?

334
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,791
If you get messed up again,
don't come to me for help.

335
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,125
Mink?

336
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,875
RECRUITMENT CENTER

337
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,333
I'm here.

338
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,083
Oh, Mink.

339
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,708
Mink.

340
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,000
Why are you sleeping here?

341
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,500
Wake up. Go wash your face and start work.

342
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:40,833
Mink.

343
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,000
Mink.

344
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,125
What's wrong?

345
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,750
Mink?

346
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,250
Where did you sleep last night?
I called, but you didn't pick up.

347
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,833
It's time you stop drinking.

348
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,625
Mink.

349
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,083
What's with you?

350
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,333
It's just my period.

351
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,791
-Why are you nagging?
-How long?

352
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,791
Wait, talk to me first. For how long?

353
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:06,708
Mink!

354
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,583
Talk to me.
Has it been long since you've had it?

355
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,666
-Pang, where's Manit?
-He went out to meet friends.

356
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,958
-Do you know who?
-No idea.

357
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,541
Manit!

358
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,208
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:36,625
Don't you give a shit
about your wife and kid?

360
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,708
-Come with me. I need to talk to you.
-You're embarrassing me.

361
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,708
Now!

362
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:48,291
Mink's symptoms are like yours
and Nim's back then, right?

363
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,083
That's right.

364
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,833
You must have Nim
do the Acceptance Ceremony for Mink.

365
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,916
You know I don't want her to be a shaman.

366
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:59,958
But if Ba Yan really wants Mink,
what can you do?

367
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:07,958
-I don’t know what I have to do.
-Think it over.

368
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,875
What the hell is wrong with you?

369
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,291
Calm down, sweetie.

370
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,791
-Stop being nosy, hag!
-Hey! What are you doing?

371
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,583
-What are you doing?
-She messed with me.

372
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,083
-Stop the car. Get off!
-She cursed at me!

373
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,833
-Stop!
-Get off!

374
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:04,583
I said I'm not getting off!

375
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:07,208
-Have you lost it?
-Damn all of you!

376
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:10,500
You!

377
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,000
-Get lost!
-Come on, let's go.

378
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,000
Damn you!

379
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,208
Damn all of you.

380
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,375
Shit.

381
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,750
Dammit.

382
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:30,250
Why the hell did they chase me off?
Assholes.

383
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,000
Huh?

384
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,083
I hope you all die.

385
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,208
I hope all of you die.

386
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:10,500
Is this all you got?

387
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,875
Yes.

388
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,833
Has Mink ever acted strange,
like she's someone else?

389
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,833
Well, she sometimes acts like a kid.

390
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,291
Anything else,
aside from acting like a kid?

391
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,291
From our footage,
there isn't anything else.

392
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,583
Have you seen my beaded bracelet?

393
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,333
It might have fallen off
when I came to get things for Noi.

394
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:49,375
-What bracelet?
-My brown bracelet.

395
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,375
-The one you always wear, right?
-Yeah.

396
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,625
Where did you go that day?

397
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:56,083
I came to get the meds and went up
to Noi's room to get the scarf.

398
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:59,583
It might have fallen off there.
Noi, go take a look.

399
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,125
It isn't around here.

400
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:04,125
I really need it.
Please take a look for me.

401
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,125
Look thoroughly.

402
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,500
Mink.

403
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,333
Mink.

404
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:18,333
Mink.

405
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:22,750
Mink.

406
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,750
Mink.

407
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,541
Mink, are you okay?

408
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,833
Recently,
have you heard someone calling you?

409
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:35,625
And did you happen to answer them?

410
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,166
Huh?

411
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,500
-There has been, right?
-Nim! What are you talking to her about?

412
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,791
Nothing. Just small talk
between aunt and niece.

413
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,083
What did you say to her?

414
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,041
Nothing.

415
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,208
-You told her to come?
-What are you talking about?

416
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:54,208
She came looking for her bracelet.

417
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,166
Mink.

418
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,333
Fine, I'm leaving now.

419
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,458
Mink, what is it?

420
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,958
What did auntie say?

421
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,083
What did she talk to you about?

422
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,791
What is it?

423
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,583
Mom.

424
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,458
Tell me.

425
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,791
Mom, I don't want to be a shaman.

426
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,041
I won't let you be one.
I won't let it happen.

427
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,416
-Don't be afraid.
-You have to help me.

428
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,708
-Don't be afraid.
-Mom, you have to help me.

429
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:42,291
Why do you think Nim came to see Mink?

430
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:45,666
She wants Mink to replace her as a shaman.

431
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,791
She has no child.

432
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,791
But no matter what,
I won't let my child be a shaman.

433
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:58,750
Ms. Kanda Yasantia.
Receive your medicine at counter 2.

434
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,041
I'll get it for you. Wait here.

435
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,750
I've gotten headaches.
It feels like my head's going to explode.

436
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,416
Stomachaches. Backaches.

437
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
And that part also hurts.

438
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,541
When it hurts…

439
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,125
it feels like it's going to rip apart.

440
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,791
The doctor said he doesn't know
what's wrong either.

441
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,541
He doesn't know the cause.

442
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,875
Have you dreamed
of anything strange lately?

443
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,416
I have the same dream almost every night.

444
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,875
In my dreams, I see a huge man.

445
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:39,791
He's wearing a red loincloth
and a red vest

446
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,958
with some kind of talisman all over it.

447
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,500
In my dreams…

448
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,958
he's holding a long sword.

449
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,958
He stomps his foot

450
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,416
and licks the blood from the sword.

451
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:58,916
And…

452
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:04,541
there's a decapitated head
and blood all over the floor.

453
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:13,208
It's like the head is trying
to tell me something.

454
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,375
And what is the head saying?

455
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:24,208
I try to listen to what it's saying. But…

456
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,208
there isn't any sound that comes out.

457
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,583
Mink.

458
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,250
Mink.

459
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:40,666
Mink.

460
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:44,791
Are you okay?

461
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,083
Leave me alone!

462
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,583
Mink, can you get up?

463
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,541
Can you get up?

464
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,458
Come on.

465
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,291
Get out!

466
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,041
I think we should go to the hospital.
Let's go.

467
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,916
Leave me alone. Get out!

468
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,958
Kanda. May I have a word with you?

469
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,416
You can't film anymore.

470
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,208
What the fuck are you saying?

471
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,416
How can you fire me? Asshole!

472
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,291
Screw you!

473
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:10,541
Mink.

474
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:13,666
-Did you take your meds this morning?
-Mink!

475
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,666
-Will you be okay?
-Mink, come change.

476
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,791
I'll be outside.

477
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,666
Done. Wait for us to do your hair.

478
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,458
Mink?

479
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,166
Mink?

480
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,208
Hey!

481
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,125
GOD REMAINS WITH US

482
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,166
Mink.

483
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:39,916
Mink.

484
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,416
Wow, she's so gorgeous.

485
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,083
-Mink.
-Mink.

486
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,750
Mink.

487
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:47,708
Mink.

488
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:51,166
-Mink. We're here.
-Mink.

489
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:52,916
-Mink.
-Mink.

490
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,791
Why doesn't she look at us?

491
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,125
Mink!

492
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:39,625
BORDER CROSSING POINT

493
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,250
Where are you going now?

494
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,500
To work.

495
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,625
RECRUITMENT CENTER

496
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,541
What are you doing here? Get out!

497
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,791
Security!

498
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,500
Get her out of here.

499
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:33,083
The thing is…

500
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:35,791
stuff in our office went missing.

501
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,958
So I took a look at the CCTV

502
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,416
and found this.

503
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,166
As you can see…

504
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,125
Look.

505
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:45,750
Disgusting.

506
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,541
This woman is shameless.

507
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,458
Mink.

508
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:04,625
Mink.

509
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,458
Are you taking a shower?

510
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,208
Mink!

511
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,333
Mink!

512
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,083
-Noi?
-Manit!

513
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:20,666
What is it, Noi? Oh, God!

514
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,083
Shit!

515
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,208
Go get some towels. Noi, call the doctor.

516
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:30,708
Hurry, call an ambulance.
Get me some towels.

517
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,750
-Shit!
-Noi!

518
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,708
Be careful.

519
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:36,625
Hospital, right? Send an ambulance now.

520
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,583
Why?

521
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,625
Why?

522
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:04,166
Nim.

523
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:07,958
Nim.

524
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:09,500
I surrender now.

525
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:12,708
I'll let Mink do the Acceptance Ceremony.

526
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,750
Please hold the Acceptance Ceremony
for Mink.

527
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,125
I don't want to see my child like this.

528
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,833
Mink can't do the Acceptance Ceremony.

529
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,041
Why not?

530
00:48:29,458 --> 00:48:32,208
Because what's taken hold of Mink
isn't Ba Yan.

531
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,208
How come it's not?

532
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,125
Mink's symptoms
are like what you and I had.

533
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:44,333
If Mink agrees to become a shaman,
she will be okay, right?

534
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,166
I can't let Mink do the ceremony.

535
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,541
You have to do it for Mink.

536
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:51,875
Manit, come with me.

537
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:53,958
Nim.

538
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm going to go with Nim then.

539
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,875
Nim, you have to do it for her.

540
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:02,666
She's your niece. Don't you pity her?

541
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:12,875
Open the door.

542
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:16,416
Open what door?

543
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,708
-This door.
-What are you going to do?

544
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,666
Hurry, will you?

545
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,291
Are you sure?

546
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,833
Tell me first, what are you going to do?

547
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,708
Tell me the truth. How did Mac die?

548
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,000
Everyone knows
that his motorcycle flipped over.

549
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,583
Tell me the truth.

550
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:22,375
I know…

551
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,250
Mink and Mac had something going on.

552
00:50:33,208 --> 00:50:34,583
Do you know

553
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:37,333
what the soul of someone
who commits suicide becomes?

554
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:38,875
Do you?

555
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,458
Tell me where Mac killed himself.

556
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:05,000
THE TEAM IS CERTAIN MINK'S SYMPTOMS
AREN'T RELATED TO INHERITANCE,

557
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,875
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
POSSESSING MINK.

558
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:13,791
Sit down slowly.

559
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:16,750
Now that Nim won't do
the Acceptance Ceremony for Mink,

560
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,625
do you know what you're going to do next?

561
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,666
If she won't help me,

562
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,833
I'll find my own way.

563
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:29,916
Even if…

564
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
it may go against my religion.

565
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,833
I must do it.

566
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:12,500
Mac.

567
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,000
Tell me.

568
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,750
All of this is your doing, right?

569
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,958
I know that you love her,
but you can't take her.

570
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,916
Do you hear me?

571
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,125
Are you really doing this, Noi?

572
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,500
Yeah, just drive.

573
00:53:16,916 --> 00:53:18,458
Get the stuff and come upstairs.

574
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:19,458
All right.

575
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:09,916
Stop right now!

576
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,458
Stop! I said stop!

577
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,583
-Stop!
-Nim.

578
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,041
-Stop it!
-Why are you doing this?

579
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:18,416
How could you do
a random ceremony like this?

580
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,375
What if she receives some evil spirit?

581
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,458
What do you expect me to do?
She is about to die.

582
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:23,708
-You won't help me.
-You don't understand.

583
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,083
Why wouldn't I help you?

584
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,041
-I have my own way.
-When are you going to help me?

585
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:29,458
-Why did you do it with him?
-Do you want my child to die?

586
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,083
Do you know who he is?

587
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,083
-Mink.
-When are you going to help?

588
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,208
-Are you going to let her die?
-Mink.

589
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,875
Mink. Mink! Stop it, Mink!

590
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,125
Mink!

591
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,666
Mink, stop!

592
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:43,750
Stop!

593
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:44,666
Mink!

594
00:54:58,708 --> 00:54:59,541
Mink.

595
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:00,958
Mink.

596
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,333
Mink.

597
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,208
Mink!

598
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,875
Mink!

599
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,000
Mink!

600
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:12,250
Mink!

601
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,250
-Mink.
-Mink.

602
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,375
Mink.

603
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,875
Mink.

604
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:44,833
Mink.

605
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,291
-Mink.
-Mink.

606
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,291
Mink.

607
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,916
Mink.

608
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:51,958
-Mink.
-Mink.

609
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:53,458
Mink.

610
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:55,791
Mink.

611
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:57,458
Mink.

612
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:30,750
Nim.

613
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,125
What about Mink?

614
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:33,916
Mink.

615
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,625
-Where's Mink, Nim?
-Lie down. Lie down, first.

616
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:39,875
What about Mink?

617
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,833
Did you find Mink? Did you find her?

618
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,166
Oh, Mink.

619
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,875
Why is she like this, Nim?

620
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,416
You have to help Mink.

621
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,750
You have to help her, Nim.

622
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,500
The only way to find her
is to hold a ceremony.

623
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,916
But first things first,
Noi must open her heart

624
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,416
to accept Ba Yan,

625
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,875
and beg for Her forgiveness,

626
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:17,000
even if she once shunned Ba Yan away,

627
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:19,666
which is a serious matter.

628
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,125
But I believe she will have mercy on Noi.

629
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,125
Lift it above your head.

630
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,125
If Noi really opens her heart to Her,

631
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,541
Ba Yan will definitely forgive her.

632
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:36,166
Give the offerings to Her.

633
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:52,125
What's that smell?

634
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,000
Go through it all.

635
00:57:55,958 --> 00:58:00,083
We have to gather all the foul things
Mink's collected from various places

636
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,416
and do a ceremony.

637
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,000
What is this? Take a look.

638
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,750
Because in these things,

639
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:11,958
there are traces of the spirits
Mink came in contact with.

640
00:58:12,708 --> 00:58:13,833
Nim. Look here.

641
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,166
She even kept this under the bed.

642
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:25,958
She has baby shoes.

643
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,833
Nim.

644
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:32,833
What?

645
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,958
Take everything out of here.

646
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,333
Take it all away.

647
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:45,125
And we must do the ceremony where
Mac killed himself.

648
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,666
I'll have to pray to Mac not to harm Mink.

649
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,833
I have to let Mac know,

650
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,708
even if he loved Mink,

651
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,916
or was mad and seeking revenge
on this family,

652
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:04,833
I won't let him do anything to her.

653
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:36,708
Actually, I don't even know
how much longer I have to pray.

654
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,416
No matter how long it takes,
I'll keep doing it.

655
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,333
Until I know where Mac took Mink.

656
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:52,833
A taxi saw the announcement.

657
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,000
So he gave the clip
from his dashcam to the police.

658
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:59,583
The driver said that
he picked Mink up around 3 a.m.

659
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:00,833
ON DUTY INQUIRY OFFICER

660
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,208
When she got in,

661
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,625
he asked her questions,
but she didn't answer.

662
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:07,791
After that,
you can see what happened in the clip.

663
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:11,958
Hey.

664
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:14,083
Where are you going?

665
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:16,708
Hey!

666
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:18,708
Hey!

667
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:20,458
What the hell?

668
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,500
Fine, I'm going to leave now.

669
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,083
Shit!

670
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,375
Damn it.

671
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:42,000
Maybe this clip is edited?

672
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,875
I had someone take a look at the scene.

673
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,916
There haven't been
any other leads on Mink.

674
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,750
If there is any more news,
I'll let you know.

675
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm worried for my daughter.

676
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:17,583
I don't know where she is now,
alive or dead.

677
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,291
All I can do is pray…

678
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,625
to the Lord

679
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,958
and any other gods out there.

680
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:28,291
Please bring my daughter back to me.

681
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,375
I already went everywhere.

682
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,916
Everyone's house,
all her friends' houses, all her ex's.

683
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,083
I went everywhere, but no one's seen her.

684
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:58,333
I've prayed and done everything I could.

685
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:01,125
If it had worked, she'd be back by now.

686
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:05,541
HEAVENLY MEAT

687
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:09,291
SEAMSTRESS
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

688
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:14,458
Ever since Mink disappeared,
everyone in the family is miserable,

689
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:16,375
especially Noi.

690
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:20,000
She can't eat or sleep at all.

691
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:23,541
It's been months.
We haven't received any news.

692
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,625
Are you wasting taxpayers' money?

693
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,333
-It's not like that.
-The police are all the same!

694
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:28,916
-It's not like that.
-No matter where.

695
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's been months.
All I see is you sitting around.

696
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:32,666
You guys just sit around.

697
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,208
-I don't see you doing anything.
-We are working, sir.

698
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:38,666
I just see you doing nothing.
Is this what you call working?

699
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,458
There wasn't any more news.

700
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,416
Nothing.

701
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,708
No news, no leads from anywhere at all.

702
01:03:08,916 --> 01:03:10,791
I've been completely tricked so far.

703
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,541
It's done by the ones that have
nothing to do with Mac.

704
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,625
Then, who are they?

705
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,666
YASANTIA THREAD FACTORY

706
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,500
Mink.

707
01:05:57,666 --> 01:05:58,500
Mink.

708
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,916
Mink.

709
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:04,458
Mink.

710
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:09,250
Mink.

711
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,125
Mink.

712
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,416
Mink, wake up.

713
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:18,000
Right now, the patient is safe,

714
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:20,541
but she might be malnourished.

715
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:23,875
She has bruises and scratches,
but not so bad.

716
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:27,958
Will my daughter go back to normal again?

717
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,750
When she regains consciousness,
we'll reevaluate her symptoms.

718
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:37,625
Right now, things are becoming clearer.

719
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,541
It's a good thing that
it didn't kill Mink.

720
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,291
I'm going to go up the mountain again.

721
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,416
I have to pray and beg Ba Yan once more.

722
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,166
Who did this to you, Ba Yan?

723
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:55,625
Where did you go?
What did you do? Tell me.

724
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,333
Try to take at least one bite.

725
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,750
It didn't even go in her mouth.

726
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:20,125
MINK IS COMPLETELY POSSESSED NOW.

727
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,750
Who are you?

728
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,500
I asked, who are you?

729
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,791
I'm Ba Yan.

730
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:54,125
I asked, who are you?

731
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:58,625
Why don't you guess who I am?

732
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,041
Try guessing.

733
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,583
Hey! What's with you?

734
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,041
Mink!

735
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,291
Have you lost it?

736
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,333
You're crazy!

737
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,625
Why is she like this?

738
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:21,208
Mink!

739
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:26,125
Don't you like young girls' pussies?
Don't you like it?

740
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,625
Why are you doing this? Mink!

741
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:30,208
Mink, why are you doing this?

742
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,833
-Get her off.
-Let go of me!

743
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:32,791
Get her off.

744
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,375
-Mink.
-Let me go!

745
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:36,375
-Hold her down.
-Let go!

746
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,375
Mink.

747
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,541
-Why are you like this?
-Let go!

748
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:40,833
Hold her down. Quick.

749
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,208
Put her index finger in the glass!

750
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:44,875
Mink.

751
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,625
You know…

752
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,458
the reason you're like this

753
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:05,625
is because of your beloved sister.

754
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,875
She planned to get you
to wear her clothes every day.

755
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,916
She put talismans in your shoes.

756
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,833
She did everything

757
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,916
to get you to be the shaman
instead of her.

758
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:21,208
Did you know?

759
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:47,333
Go find something to tie her up with.
Hurry!

760
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:48,458
Tie her up tightly.

761
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,541
Hurry up.

762
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,083
Hurry! When you're done, get out.

763
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:56,625
Get out first.

764
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,208
Stop filming already.

765
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,500
Get out! Out!

766
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,333
Everyone, get out.

767
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:21,041
I need to find someone to help me.

768
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:24,000
Nim.

769
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,750
About what Mink just said…

770
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:30,333
I'm sorry.

771
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:34,000
It's fine. I'm going to help her anyway.

772
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:26,541
Santi.

773
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,666
Are you still involved with these clowns?

774
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,375
I have to make a living, you know.

775
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,125
Mink.

776
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,291
Hey, wait.

777
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,375
You guys…

778
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:50,041
took her to do
some random Acceptance Ceremony, right?

779
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,291
Mink's condition right now…

780
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:03,250
is like a car that has the key left in it.

781
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,083
Anyone can drive it anywhere.

782
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,666
And who is this spirit?

783
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:10,416
It's not just one.

784
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,916
I don't know who they are.

785
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:17,916
If you want me to count how many,
it's also impossible.

786
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:20,458
All I know is that…

787
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,541
they're all in it together
because they're vindictive.

788
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,375
And it's this vengeance…

789
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:43,250
that attracted all the wandering ghosts
and the lost spirits of beasts…

790
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:54,166
such as snakes, dogs, centipedes, spiders…

791
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:57,458
and those of plants and grasses.

792
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:05,041
They've gathered together
and become a very powerful, evil demon.

793
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:13,250
Right here.

794
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,833
This is where I found Mink.

795
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,375
We'll conduct the ceremony right here,

796
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,208
where all the evil spirits
originated from.

797
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:29,500
If we can get rid of them,
their slivers in Mink will also disappear.

798
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,250
And why does it have to be Mink?

799
01:15:33,625 --> 01:15:38,125
Do you know about the ancestors
of your husband's family?

800
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,416
Wiroj's ancestors
beheaded thousands of people.

801
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:51,875
The last wishes of those dying people
were to curse the family,

802
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:56,916
and their offspring
never stopped making bad karma.

803
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:00,208
And Wiroj…

804
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:02,458
married you.

805
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,708
The one who rejected Ba Yan.

806
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:15,791
From then on…

807
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:20,041
everything was destined to be that

808
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:25,000
the one who has to pay redemption is Mink.

809
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,791
Do you think it's reasonable?

810
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,000
About what Santi said,
that everything was destined.

811
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:50,583
Don't worry.
We'll get the auspicious date soon.

812
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:52,208
Destined by who?

813
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,000
By God?

814
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:57,375
By Buddha?

815
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,250
Or by other deities?

816
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:05,041
If it's the ancestors
that created bad karma,

817
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:09,166
why does Mink have to pay for it?
Why not me?

818
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:18,333
Go sit over there first.

819
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,791
You don't have to think too much.

820
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,708
Once the ceremony is done,
Mink will get better.

821
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,916
Ba Yan will help us.

822
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,083
Back then, when I was sick,

823
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,666
everyone said
Ba Yan was going to possess me.

824
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:40,666
But I didn't feel anything.

825
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:42,958
I was just sick.

826
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,583
Let me ask you something.

827
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,708
Have you ever seen Ba Yan?

828
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,458
Is there really a Ba Yan?

829
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,208
Of course, there is.

830
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,875
Have you ever seen Her?

831
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:05,166
No.

832
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,166
Then how do you know?

833
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:11,791
I can feel it.

834
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,500
I can feel Her.

835
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:27,000
You have to believe in Ba Yan,

836
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,375
and She will help us.

837
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:49,750
To perform this ceremony,

838
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:52,291
the more evil and dangerous
the spirits are,

839
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:53,833
the more I have to be prepared.

840
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:58,541
I have to make lots of talismans
and consecrate them all,

841
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,750
including a sacred wand.

842
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:07,416
I consecrate them over and over
with all the power I have.

843
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:14,041
And I also have to prepare holy water,
candles, and incense.

844
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,583
It's really an extravagant affair.

845
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:19,583
Most importantly,
I have to do the ceremony with Nim.

846
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:22,458
Nim and I have to be united as one.

847
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:25,583
It's really tough, but it's challenging.

848
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,250
Although, I've been doing this
for a long time.

849
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:29,791
Let's see how tough they are.

850
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,166
She won't eat anything.

851
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,291
When I talk with her, she's not receptive.

852
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,916
I'm really stressed out.

853
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:52,041
Nim hasn't come either. She's been busy

854
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:54,708
with the ceremony preparations.

855
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,666
One other thing…

856
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:01,250
every morning when I come down,
the house is a total mess.

857
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:06,666
It must be Mink. She does it every night.

858
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,166
I don't know what she does.

859
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,833
THE TEAM DECIDES TO INSTALL CAMERAS
INSIDE THE HOUSE

860
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:17,625
TO OBSERVE MINK'S BEHAVIOR AT NIGHT.

861
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:28,416
6 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

862
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,583
Lucky. Where are you?

863
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,375
Lucky.

864
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:15,708
Lucky.

865
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,666
What's wrong, Lucky?

866
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,375
5 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

867
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:57,125
4 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

868
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:27,708
3 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

869
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:30,791
If you set up cameras everywhere
like this, no more filming.

870
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,208
-Manit…
-Pack your stuff and go! I won't allow it!

871
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:35,083
I'm asking you,
please watch till the very end.

872
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,083
-Please.
-What?

873
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,208
Why is she like this?

874
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:00,875
If she's become crazy like this,
how can we live together?

875
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,541
You can go live wherever you want.

876
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:09,291
I'm staying here with my child.

877
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:13,375
I admit that…

878
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:15,833
it looks scary.

879
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:19,833
But she's still my child.

880
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,333
It won't be long until she gets better.

881
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,083
Nim will help her.

882
01:24:28,791 --> 01:24:31,958
Nim is an expert.
She's helped lots of people.

883
01:24:32,041 --> 01:24:33,416
She can definitely help Mink.

884
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:35,041
Don't you think?

885
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,458
AFTER SEEING MINK'S BEHAVIOR,

886
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:48,875
THE FAMILY MEMBERS ALLOWED THE TEAM
TO INSTALL MORE CAMERAS.

887
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,041
What's wrong?

888
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:10,833
My stomach hurts.

889
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:29,583
2 DAYS BEFORE THE CEREMONY

890
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:34,583
Done.

891
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:36,666
She can't get out anymore.

892
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:40,250
She can only dream of getting out.

893
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:42,333
All done. Let's go.

894
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:18,541
Mink!

895
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:22,666
Mink!

896
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,541
Guys, wake up!

897
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,375
You need to get up!

898
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,625
Holy shit.

899
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:40,541
Pong!

900
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,416
Pong! Mink!

901
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,333
Mink!

902
01:28:47,291 --> 01:28:48,208
Mink!

903
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:55,375
Pang!

904
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:57,041
Pang!

905
01:28:58,666 --> 01:28:59,541
Pong!

906
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,875
-Pong!
-What is it, Manit?

907
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:02,958
Where is Pong?

908
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:05,083
-What is it?
-Mink took Pong!

909
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:07,208
-What?
-Mink took my son!

910
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,625
Where did she take him?

911
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:09,708
Let's go look.

912
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:12,625
-She took my son.
-Where did she take Pong?

913
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:13,541
Mink.

914
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:16,000
Let's go find him.

915
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,208
Pong!

916
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,916
Where did she take him?

917
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,416
Come on. Let's go search.

918
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,083
Mink!

919
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,208
Why did you take my kid?

920
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,750
Have you lost it?

921
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:29,708
Mink.

922
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:31,500
Mink.

923
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:33,583
Mink!

924
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:36,791
Mink!

925
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:37,958
Have you seen Mink?

926
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:39,375
No.

927
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,333
Mink!

928
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:43,916
Mink!

929
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,375
Mink!

930
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:51,208
Damn it! Why are you doing this?

931
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:54,333
Mink! Where are you?

932
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:55,375
Mink!

933
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:01,916
Pong.

934
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:06,166
Pong!

935
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:08,166
Pong!

936
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:12,208
Pong!

937
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,916
My boy.

938
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,750
Pong!

939
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:24,750
Pong!

940
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:36,416
It's all right now, baby.

941
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:40,000
Mink?

942
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:42,416
Mink!

943
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,208
Mink!

944
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:46,666
Mink!

945
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:48,625
Mink!

946
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:53,875
Mink!

947
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:32,958
Mink.

948
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,541
Mink!

949
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:44,583
What the hell?

950
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:48,750
Mink!

951
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:50,291
Mink.

952
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,375
Let go of him.

953
01:32:01,791 --> 01:32:06,541
1 DAY BEFORE THE CEREMONY

954
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:14,583
Nim.

955
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,583
Is something wrong?

956
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:23,875
I've been calling her since last night,
but she hasn't answered.

957
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:27,291
I can hear her phone ringing.
Why won't she answer it?

958
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:30,125
I'll go get help.

959
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:31,291
Okay.

960
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:36,375
Nim.

961
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:38,208
Nim.

962
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:40,875
Nim!

963
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:42,291
Where are you?

964
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:44,291
Nim.

965
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:56,916
Why are there so many maggots?

966
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,833
Nim.

967
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:01,291
Nim.

968
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,583
Nim!

969
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,041
Nim!

970
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:08,125
Nim! Wake up.

971
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:09,708
Why are you sleeping like this?

972
01:33:10,416 --> 01:33:11,291
Nim!

973
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:13,541
Nim!

974
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,500
Hurry, come help me!

975
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,541
I don't know what's with her! Nim!

976
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,333
NIM DIED WHILE ASLEEP.

977
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:26,666
ISAN PEOPLE CALL IT "LAI TAI."

978
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:32,583
DOCTORS COULD NOT CONCLUDE
THE CAUSE OF DEATH.

979
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:41,541
Nim died because of me.

980
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,583
Mink is like this because of me.

981
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:49,875
I have no one left in my life.

982
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:53,708
From now on,

983
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:57,416
I'm going to do everything
to protect my daughter from harm.

984
01:33:58,416 --> 01:33:59,791
I'm even willing to die.

985
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,833
Why did Nim die?
The spirits did it, right?

986
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,166
There's no way to know.

987
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,416
What's that supposed to mean?

988
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:15,541
Why are you saying such things?

989
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:18,375
Master, what are we supposed to do now?

990
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:20,291
Don't worry.

991
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:24,250
Tomorrow, we will conduct
the ceremony as planned.

992
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:37,791
DAY OF CEREMONY

993
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,875
-Right here?
-Yeah. Put it right here.

994
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:02,583
Master Santi,
please tell us about today's ceremony.

995
01:35:03,666 --> 01:35:05,333
The ceremony will be on the 5th floor.

996
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:08,041
The first thing I have to do is

997
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:10,750
summon the evil spirits to gather

998
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,416
into Mink's body.

999
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:34,875
Then,

1000
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:36,791
I'll expel the spirits

1001
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,791
into the cursed pot.

1002
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:44,375
And I'll take the pot to the ground floor,

1003
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:47,666
bury it,
and perform a spellbinding ritual.

1004
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:50,791
Based on what happened to Nim,

1005
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:53,791
will it be too risky to let Mink
still be a part of the ceremony?

1006
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:55,958
Well, yeah.

1007
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,791
But…

1008
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,250
have you noticed the back of Manit's car?

1009
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,916
It has a sticker that says…

1010
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:06,208
"This car is red."

1011
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:08,875
THIS CAR IS RED

1012
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:12,875
What does that have to do
with the ceremony?

1013
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,250
Don't let anyone

1014
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:41,166
leave the area

1015
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,041
until the ceremony is over.

1016
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:15,333
Come and eat!

1017
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:08,958
Come on! Come and get it!

1018
01:39:09,041 --> 01:39:09,916
Come!

1019
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,250
Why did she scream?

1020
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:30,916
I don't know.

1021
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,458
Noi!

1022
01:40:15,541 --> 01:40:16,708
Noi!

1023
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:17,791
Noi!

1024
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:19,541
-Noi.
-How is she?

1025
01:40:19,625 --> 01:40:21,916
-She's just blacked out.
-Take her to rest up.

1026
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,333
Noi!

1027
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:26,166
Noi!

1028
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:28,583
How are you, Noi?

1029
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,416
Can you hear me?

1030
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,166
Is there anyone out there?

1031
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:46,833
Why am I being locked up?

1032
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,666
Mom? Are you outside?

1033
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,750
Please open the door.

1034
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,250
Did the spirit leave already?

1035
01:40:55,583 --> 01:40:56,791
I don't know.

1036
01:40:57,416 --> 01:40:58,791
Pang?

1037
01:40:58,875 --> 01:40:59,958
Mink.

1038
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,875
Pang, open the door for me.

1039
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:02,958
Mink!

1040
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,708
You're better now, right?

1041
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:06,958
Open the door.

1042
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:08,250
She's well now, right?

1043
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,041
Pang, I'm in here.

1044
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:11,250
Open the door, please.

1045
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:12,208
I don't know.

1046
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:14,875
The Master told us not to open the door
if the ceremony isn't over.

1047
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,375
-Please open the door.
-Mink.

1048
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:21,416
Open the door for me, please.
I'm locked up in here.

1049
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,000
Hold on.

1050
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:25,333
-Pang, please open the door.
-Mink.

1051
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:27,375
No one has called to let us know yet.

1052
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:31,333
Pang. Where are all of you? Pang?

1053
01:41:31,416 --> 01:41:32,291
Mink.

1054
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:34,166
Pang, open the door.

1055
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:49,916
Mink, are you okay?

1056
01:41:52,583 --> 01:41:53,500
Mink.

1057
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,458
Pong.

1058
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,458
Open the door. My son is in there.

1059
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:29,458
-We can't.
-Open it!

1060
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:31,500
Open it! My son is in there!

1061
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:33,500
We can't.
No matter what, we can't open it.

1062
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:35,750
He's in there! Can't you hear him, huh?

1063
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:36,708
How can that be?

1064
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:39,041
I just saw your son in the crib.

1065
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:41,625
He's in there! Are you deaf?

1066
01:42:51,666 --> 01:42:53,083
My son's in there. Pong!

1067
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:55,208
Master Santi ordered us not to open it.

1068
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:59,125
-Mink! Please don't do anything to Pong!
-Take a look in the crib for me.

1069
01:42:59,708 --> 01:43:00,625
Open the door.

1070
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,208
-I can't.
-Open it right now!

1071
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:03,541
Go look in the crib for me.

1072
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:04,666
Open it!

1073
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:05,833
Open it, damn it!

1074
01:43:05,916 --> 01:43:07,416
-Go look in the crib!
-Okay!

1075
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,833
-Open it!
-No!

1076
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:10,333
-What?
-Open it!

1077
01:43:10,416 --> 01:43:11,500
Pang!

1078
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,875
Pang!

1079
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:16,541
You can't go in!

1080
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:20,666
Pang!

1081
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:21,625
Pong!

1082
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:22,625
-Pang!
-Pong!

1083
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:05,666
Master, why do you stop here?

1084
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:14,000
Master?

1085
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:21,958
Master?

1086
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:24,041
What the hell?

1087
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:24,958
Master?

1088
01:44:26,041 --> 01:44:26,875
Master?

1089
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:29,750
Master?

1090
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:34,958
What?

1091
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:40,750
Master?

1092
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:44,708
Master?

1093
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:47,458
Master!

1094
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:53,583
Master, what's wrong?

1095
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:07,250
No! Master!

1096
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:11,958
Pong!

1097
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:16,375
Pong!

1098
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,375
Mink. Where is Pong?

1099
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:28,458
Mink.

1100
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:44,166
Mink.

1101
01:45:47,875 --> 01:45:48,750
Mink.

1102
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:51,916
Mink.

1103
01:45:58,125 --> 01:45:58,958
Shit!

1104
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,166
Shit!

1105
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:17,083
Open up.

1106
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:19,000
Open the door!

1107
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:19,916
Help!

1108
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:21,791
Help me!

1109
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,083
Help!

1110
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:25,333
Help!

1111
01:46:30,416 --> 01:46:31,458
I can't open it.

1112
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:34,083
Don't.

1113
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,125
No!

1114
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,000
Shit!

1115
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:19,083
Why did the lights go out?

1116
01:47:21,416 --> 01:47:23,583
Turn on the camera's light.

1117
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:24,500
Okay.

1118
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:29,916
Shit.

1119
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,250
Where did everyone go?

1120
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:38,166
Hey.

1121
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,208
What happened?

1122
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:40,416
Where is everybody?

1123
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:53,458
Hey.

1124
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:55,958
Let's get out of here.

1125
01:48:17,916 --> 01:48:19,250
Fuck this!

1126
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:24,375
Shit, so damn dark…

1127
01:48:52,791 --> 01:48:53,791
Holy shit.

1128
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:33,666
Oh, hell.

1129
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,458
Manit!

1130
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:06,791
Manit!

1131
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:10,541
Noi.

1132
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:16,458
Noi.

1133
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:19,166
Manit.

1134
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:21,625
Are you all right?

1135
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,208
Are you okay?

1136
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:26,666
I can feel it now.

1137
01:50:28,458 --> 01:50:30,416
Ba Yan is with me now.

1138
01:50:34,666 --> 01:50:36,666
Ba Yan is with me now.

1139
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,125
Ba Yan is here to help me.

1140
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:03,333
The ceremony must be continued.

1141
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:06,958
Go get the potsherd.

1142
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:12,333
We'll perform the spellbinding ritual
once again.

1143
01:51:14,833 --> 01:51:15,916
Go! Hurry!

1144
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:26,250
Give me the incense.

1145
01:53:56,166 --> 01:53:58,583
Can I film you instead?

1146
01:54:24,666 --> 01:54:26,583
Why did she put them in that way?

1147
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:46,333
No!

1148
01:55:39,333 --> 01:55:41,750
Manit, don't!

1149
01:55:41,833 --> 01:55:42,833
No!

1150
01:56:28,958 --> 01:56:29,958
You, evil spirit,

1151
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:32,458
leave my child's body now.

1152
01:56:32,541 --> 01:56:34,416
You're going to surrender now

1153
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,708
to the mighty power of Ba Yan!

1154
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:49,875
Mom.

1155
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:52,833
Mom.

1156
01:56:58,625 --> 01:56:59,458
Mom.

1157
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,083
Mink.

1158
01:57:03,916 --> 01:57:04,750
Mink.

1159
01:57:06,875 --> 01:57:08,083
Mink, it's you, right?

1160
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:09,583
Mink.

1161
01:57:11,625 --> 01:57:12,791
It's you, right?

1162
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:14,375
Mink.

1163
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:18,208
Please return my child.

1164
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:21,375
Give me back my child.

1165
01:58:23,166 --> 01:58:24,166
Return her…

1166
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:02,916
Mink.

1167
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,458
Can you hear me?

1168
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:07,041
Mink, are you still in there?

1169
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:08,000
Mink.

1170
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,583
Don't…

1171
01:59:10,666 --> 01:59:11,958
Don't do it.

1172
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:13,625
Don't do this to me.

1173
01:59:14,875 --> 01:59:16,083
Mink.

1174
01:59:16,166 --> 01:59:17,625
Can you hear me?

1175
01:59:18,125 --> 01:59:20,375
Mink! I'm sorry.

1176
01:59:22,416 --> 01:59:24,083
I'm sorry.

1177
01:59:25,125 --> 01:59:27,125
Come back to me, Mink.

1178
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:28,500
Mink.

1179
01:59:30,875 --> 01:59:34,166
God, please help Mink.

1180
01:59:37,041 --> 01:59:38,541
Please help her.

1181
01:59:56,958 --> 02:00:00,000
Mink, don't give up hope.

1182
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:04,583
Don't do this.

1183
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:08,125
Don't do this to me.

1184
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:15,666
YASANTIA

1185
02:00:42,291 --> 02:00:47,916
NIM'S LAST INTERVIEW

1186
02:00:57,416 --> 02:00:59,708
What just happened in front of the altar?

1187
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,541
I was just thinking of…

1188
02:01:08,208 --> 02:01:10,916
the day of the ceremony,
I don't know what will happen.

1189
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:13,583
Why?

1190
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:16,375
Any problems with the preparations?

1191
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:21,708
It might mean nothing at all.

1192
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:25,458
What do you mean?

1193
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:46,333
Honestly…

1194
02:01:52,291 --> 02:01:53,875
I've never really known…

1195
02:01:55,833 --> 02:01:57,583
I was never really sure…

1196
02:02:00,333 --> 02:02:02,833
if Ba Yan actually possessed me or not.

1197
02:02:04,625 --> 02:02:05,916
What do you mean?

1198
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,458
I don't know anymore.

1199
02:10:40,916 --> 02:10:45,916
