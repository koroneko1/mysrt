00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.300
&lrm;How's it going? After what happened
&lrm;at your place last night,

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.300
&lrm;-I was worried that --
&lrm;-Oh! So you watched the show, then!

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.500
&lrm;Well... Uh, look,
&lrm;about what you saw on the show.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.180
&lrm;-The totographs in my room.
&lrm;-The photographs?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.660
&lrm;The grotographs, exactly!

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.180
&lrm;It... it's not what you think!

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.020
&lrm;See, I'm really into fashion and...

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.660
&lrm;Are you lying?

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.820
&lrm;No! I'm so not into you.
&lrm;I mean, sure, I'm interested in you...

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.500
&lrm;but, um, not in that way.
&lrm;Well, you know! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.660
&lrm;[chuckles] Just teasing!
&lrm;I understand, don't worry!

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.260
&lrm;I've got used to having lots of fans
&lrm;and photographs of me everywhere,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.540
&lrm;even in the most unlikely places.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.740
&lrm;As if someone would have a picture
&lrm;of you under a bed, right?

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.180
&lrm;Yeah. I was wondering.
&lrm;Since you're into fashion so much,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.940
&lrm;-you could come watch my next photo shoot!
&lrm;-No way! For you?

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.740
&lrm;-Peel... Meal... For real?
&lrm;-Honestly, it's pretty long and boring.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.940
&lrm;But if you were there, it would be
&lrm;more fun. What do you say?

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.940
&lrm;Oh, wow, yes!

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.180
&lrm;-Thank you, Adrien!
&lrm;-I'll keep you posted, then.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.860
&lrm;See you later, in class.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.140
&lrm;I'm glad to have you as one of my fans.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.780
&lrm;Relax, Marinette. You can breathe now.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.740
&lrm;He invited me to one of his photo shoots!

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.220
&lrm;Yeah, that's awesome!

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.660
&lrm;And you even managed to get
&lrm;some normal sentences out, too!

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.460
&lrm;-Oh, come on! That's not funny!
&lrm;-You're totally right. It's not funny!

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.460
&lrm;[laughter]

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.940
