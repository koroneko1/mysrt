There's a chest in this house

that holds... Nual's spirit.

Leave the fish at my house.

Do you know when the school will reopen?

We'll have to wait
until the war in Bangkok ends.

But it's great not having to go to school!

It's no joke.

I don't know.

You have to take precautions.

How?

104
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:16,916
Close all doors and windows at night.

105
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,708
Don't hang your laundry outside.

106
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,916
The Krasue like to wipe their mouths
on them.

107
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:29,291
If I really were a Krasue,
you'd be dead by now.

Who told you that?

124
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,916
Aunt Kamlai. I treated her son today.

125
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,583
She said Dang's hens
were eaten by a Krasue.

But no one has seen it in a long time.

You stay with Grandma.

We've come from Salaya,
where the Krasue have wreaked havoc.

In the beginning...

199
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:43,375
they ate all the chickens and ducks
until there were none left.

Then, the cows and buffaloes.

But the villagers were too slow
to take extreme measures.

202
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,208
So...

203
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,541
it began to spread.

204
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,333
That was when pandemonium struck.

206
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,500
Once the Mother Krasue
spits in some water...

If it's a man,

210

he'll be in terrible pain from the poison.

211
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,125
When he can no longer endure it and dies,

212

the Krasue will devour his guts.

213
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,000
The folks were scared
and already abandoned the village.

Krasue don't hurt people.

These demons have lived alongside us
for a long time.

402
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,250
They were once humans
who practiced black magic.

403
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:21,791
Their spells backfired
and turned them into hellish ghouls.

The female is called Krasue.

The male is called Krahang.

406

Usually people will hurry to find a hunter
when they see a Krasue.

I have a vision of the forest.

Sai!

678
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,916
Just admit you're a Krasue.

679
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:25,750
Jerd and I saw it with our own eyes.

[menacing music continues]

681
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,208

Get out of my village.

685
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:53,958
Love her while you still can.

The show's over.

690
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:10,750
I'll go after the Krasue myself.

We're finished. There's no herb left.

719

Let's run away to Bangkok.

720

What about my dad?

721

Just worry about yourself!
You're in danger!

That bloodthirsty Tad
is still snooping around.

In Bangkok there must be someone
who can help us.

Meet me in the forest tomorrow
after sunset.

I've known all along...

that you're a Krasue.

730

It's late, let me walk you home.

731

No.

[wistful piano music]

734

I joined the hunters
so I could misdirect them.

735
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:34,666
There'll be a full-scale hunt tonight.
Secure your doors and windows.

736
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:47,625
[sobbing]
It hurt every time...

737
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:54,708
that I saw you with Noi.

Yes, Dad.

How are you?

751
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,416
Still hurt?

752
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:06,166
Dad...

753
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,750
Hmm.

754
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,875
One day, if I'm no longer here...

755
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:16,833
will you be all right?

756
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:20,916
Why are you saying that?

757
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,750
I won't let anyone hurt you.

758
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:33,375
I promise.

[sad piano and violin music]

01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:04,500
I'm here to say goodbye.

762
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:09,416
I also have something to ask you.

763
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:15,416
About Krasue and Krahang,
there's more to the story, isn't there?

764
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:19,500
Have you seen it?

765
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:26,666
Well...

766
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,500
it began...

767
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:33,541
when the Krasue,
who was the wife of the first Krahang,

768
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,833
fell in love with a human.

769
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,166
She got pregnant...

770
01:35:39,916 --> 01:35:42,250
and they ran away together.

771
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:46,416
But Krahang found them.

772
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,708
He killed the man.

773
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,583
Then he killed his wife
and ripped her heart out

774
01:35:56,666 --> 01:35:58,916
to avenge his own heartbreak.

775
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:03,166
His wrath was passed down
through generations.

776
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:09,500
Since then, a Krahang has to destroy
every Krasue's heart.

777

[Pan]

Good evening, Chief.

Love is poison.

It turns you into a fool,

Leave me alone!

Do you think Sai's going
to keep her promise?

She's running away with Noi to Bangkok!

She's going to leave you.

She's leaving you behind!

You're such a fool. A fool! A fool!

Sai, let's go!

845
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:12,458
[in inhuman voice]
Noi, why are you protecting her?

846
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,916
She's a whore, nothing but a whore!

847
01:45:20,416 --> 01:45:22,625
You think she's going to love you forever?

848
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:24,458
-You really think so?
-Shut up!

849
01:45:26,375 --> 01:45:27,250
[snarls]

[heavy splat]

854
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,416
Take that as my apology, Nual...

855
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:34,750
Someone saw it last night.

856
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,666
Reng's internal organs were gone.

857
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:41,583
Who do you think it was?

858
01:46:51,333 --> 01:46:52,291
Nual...

859
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:07,708

[sobbing]

863
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:43,916
Release me.

864
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,000
No, please!

865
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:02,875
[Nual continues sobbing]

866
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:12,625
Noi.

867
01:48:13,208 --> 01:48:17,250
Go through the forest
and you'll find a river.

868
01:48:18,041 --> 01:48:19,916
On the other side is Bangkok.

869
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:21,875
Hurry!

870
01:48:33,083 --> 01:48:34,916

[menacing music fades]

875
01:49:32,291 --> 01:49:33,250
[Noi groans]

876
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:48,166
Sai!

877
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:50,541
Sai!

878
01:49:52,291 --> 01:49:53,791
[ghostly hissing]

879
01:50:02,666 --> 01:50:03,916
We're almost there.

880
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:12,375
Just across the river and we'll be safe.

881
01:50:13,333 --> 01:50:14,625
Hang in there.

882
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:17,958
[voice trembling]
I'll find a way to treat you.

883
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:21,708
You'll be all right. I'll cure you.

884
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:24,458
Hang in there, just a little more.

885
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:26,875
Just a little more.

886
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:33,666
Just a little more.

887
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:36,458
Hang in there, just a little more.

888
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:39,958
You'll be all right.

889
01:50:41,708 --> 01:50:42,875
You'll be all right.

890
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:45,583
You'll be all right.

891
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:54,791
You'll be all right,
I'll treat you myself.

[haunting, sad choral music]

893
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:05,041
I'll treat you myself.

894
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:13,166
Everything's going to be all right.

895
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,500
You'll be fine. I'll treat you myself.

896
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:32,000
[sad piano music]

897
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:16,625

[haunting, sad choral music]

899
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:21,583
[sobbing]
I'm sorry.

900
01:53:23,791 --> 01:53:26,750
I'm sorry I can't keep my promise...

[sad violin music]

908
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:09,208
When the war's over,
let's go to Bangkok together.

909
01:57:09,416 --> 01:57:10,791
I'll show you around.

910
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:14,166
Great, I want to go.

911
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:18,250
Promise?

912
01:57:21,541 --> 01:57:22,625
Promise.
