<i><c.color80ffff>The legend of the ten rings</c>

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:50.091
<i><c.color80ffff>has been told for thousands of years.</c>

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.431
<i><c.color80ffff>Every generation,
the story grows.</c>

00:00:56.599 --> 00:01:01.394
<i><c.color80ffff>But at its centre
there is always one man.</c>

00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:16.952
<i><c.color80ffff>Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.</c>

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.540
<i><c.color80ffff>They gave him the strength of a god,</c>

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:26.211
<i><c.color80ffff>and the gift of eternal life.</c>

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.388
<i><c.color80ffff>He could have used them for good.</c>

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.978
<i><c.color80ffff>But all he wanted...</c>

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.854
<i><c.color80ffff>was power.</c>

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.483
<i><c.color80ffff>He called his army The Ten Rings.</c>

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:37.824
<i><c.color80ffff>Over the centuries, they spread
into every corner of the world.</c>

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.959
<i><c.color80ffff>They moved in the shadows...</c>

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:52.380
<i><c.color80ffff>Toppled governments...</c>

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.968
<i><c.color80ffff>And changed the course of history.</c>

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:17.489
<i><c.color80ffff>He chased money and power
for a thousand years.</c>

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:21.451
<i><c.color80ffff>But he still wanted more.</c>

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:28.541
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.839
<i><c.color80ffff>A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.</c>

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:39.969
Where people practise
a martial arts style from the gods.

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:42.013
<i><c.color80ffff>I want to find it.</c>

00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:45.642
Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.436
<i><c.color80ffff>and come back
with more information.</c>

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.565
I want to go now.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:17.340
The forest...

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.928
...is moving.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.837
<i><c.color80ffff>He had nothing left
on Earth to conquer.</c>

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:04.471
<i><c.color80ffff>That's when he came
for my home.</c>

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:15.815
Where's the entrance
to Ta Lo?

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:19.861
You're not welcome
in our village.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.573
You don't know who
you're talking to.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:25.825
I don't care who you are.

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:30.371
Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.340
Is that all?

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.315
<i><c.color80ffff>That was the first time
I met your father.</c>

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.822
<i><c.color80ffff>He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.</c>

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:14.577
<i><c.color80ffff>But love had other plans.</c>

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.541
Shang-Chi,

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:23.503
there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:27.465
but you'll learn about that
when you're older.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:33.346
If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?

00:08:35.057 --> 00:08:41.854
Where I'm from, we are empowered
by the magic of the Great Protector.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:49.195
When you have the heart
of our dragon,

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.407
you can do some amazing things.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.868
Can you still do those things?

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:01.958
I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,

00:09:02.126 --> 00:09:05.586
but what I got in return
is so much better.

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:11.843
I want you to have this.

00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:15.847
Whenever you feel lost,

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:19.016
this will help you
find your way home.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.269
Can you remember that?

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.457
Okay.

00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:45.603
Hello, sir,

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.064
welcome to the Fairmont...

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:49.565
I'm driving.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.192
No, you're not... Katy.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.236
Hey, hey, get back here.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.362
Give me the key.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.199
Please open the door.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.827
Oh, my God.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.954
- Get out.
- You get in!

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.080
Look, if happens
to this thing,

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.164
we're gonna be jobless

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:06.499
and in debt
for the rest of our lives.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.751
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.336
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:11.671
I don't know who that is.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.631
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.299
Please get out of the car.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.759
Shaun,

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.970
we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.180
<i><c.color80ffff>You know I'm not an idiot.</c>

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.392
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.688
Katy, watch the...

00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:36.404
<i><c.color80ffff>I knew Katy was trouble</i></c>

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:37.822
<i><c.color80ffff>the first day we met
in high school.</i></c>

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.073
I was getting picked on a lot,

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.075
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:42.952
<i><c.color80ffff>Plus, I had just moved
to the US,</c>

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.495
<i><c.color80ffff>so I was struggling
with my English,</c>

00:11:44.663 --> 00:11:45.746
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:47.665
when this guy
who was like twice my size

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:48.749
yells at me
from down the hall,

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.126
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:52.753
So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot. "

00:11:52.838 --> 00:11:53.838
And I turn the corner,

00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:55.548
and I see this guy
drop his backpack,

00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:56.966
<i><c.color80ffff>he's getting
all up in his face...</c>

00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:58.926
And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.928
Katy comes out of nowhere,

00:12:01.096 --> 00:12:04.348
steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:05.850
<i><c.color80ffff>to Hotel California.</i></c>

00:12:06.018 --> 00:12:07.018
What?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.228
It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.

00:12:09.438 --> 00:12:10.479
<i><c.color80ffff>And that's how we met.</c>

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.064
Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.357
At which point she revealed

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:15.735
that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:17.987
<i><c.color80ffff>Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.</c>

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.530
And your wife
was in the car, too.

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:21.324
- That's true. You were.
- What?

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.825
I was just in the back seat.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.910
That's a part of the car.

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:25.077
That's still
a part of the car.

00:12:25.162 --> 00:12:26.787
How have you
never told me this story?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.122
You know,
before she was a lawyer,

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:29.457
your girl was pretty wild.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.292
Oh! What happened?

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.295
I grew up.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.088
What's that supposed to mean?

00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:37.173
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.925
That maybe there's a point

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.968
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.554
<i><c.color80ffff>and start thinking about
living up to your potential.</c>

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.222
Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.390
<i><c.color80ffff>Look,</c>

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.642
we're now living in a world

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:48.726
where at any moment

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.561
half the population
can just disappear.

00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:53.564
<i><c.color80ffff>Life's too short
and too fragile.</c>

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.316
Katy, you're a valet driver

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.859
with an honours degree
from Berkeley,

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:59.278
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.364
You've always been the most
talented people I know.

00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:03.616
I just don't get why
you're scared

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.576
to actually use it
for something serious.

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.286
<i><c.color80ffff>Wow.</i></c>

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.873
You sound like my mom.
You also...

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.375
dress like her
a little bit, too.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.502
<i><c.color80ffff>Where's this from, Talbots?</c>

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.504
We're not running
from adulthood.

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.965
How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.633
Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:23.094
Did you think
valet parking is easy?

00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.179
It's like the most
challenging job ever.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.515
You need people skills,
driving skills...

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.225
Soo can't even
parallel park.

00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:35.564
Well, it's almost midnight.
We got the early shift.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.734
Should probably be
responsible, go to sleep.

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.611
Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.238
Or...

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:46.117
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Over,

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.659
Morning, Mrs Chen.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:29.952
She's not ready yet.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.787
Come have some joe
while you wait.

00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:35.416
Katy, Shaun's here.

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.334
Yeah, Mom,
be there in a minute.

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.419
Ruihua,

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:41.005
you're supposed to be helping
your dad stock the shop.

00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:44.341
Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.885
Maybe Shaun can help him

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.179
instead ofjust showing up
every day to eat our food.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:49.555
I'm happy to help.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.433
No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:54.143
Waipo.

00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:56.937
That seat's for Waigong.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:59.106
Oh, sorry.

00:14:59.191 --> 00:15:04.612
He's getting all his favourite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.363
Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:07.448
Funyuns and cigarettes

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:08.741
back to the afterlife?

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.576
He can take anything.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:14.747
Last year I put a bottle of whisky
on his grave...

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.832
And it was gone the next morning.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:21.420
I know you kids think it's silly.

00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.297
We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:25.966
We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.134
and enjoy your life.

00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:29.428
"Moving on"
is an American idea.

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.764
You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.349
Shaun,

00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:36.685
did my daughter apply
to any newjobs this week?

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.604
She really likes her job.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.855
We both do.

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:42.817
Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.527
so you could park cars
for a living.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.571
Well, on that note,

00:15:47.656 --> 00:15:49.115
I think we're gonna
miss our bus.

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.076
I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.

00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:53.536
And for staying out late
last night,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.162
trying to enjoy my life.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.498
But one day, I'll make you
proud, I promise.

00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.041
I'm proud of you, sis.

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.669
Parking cars is super hard.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:02.878
Thanks, bro.

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:04.213
Maybe one day you'll pass
your driver's test,

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.297
live the dream like me.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.465
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:11.887
When are you two going
to get married?

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.264
Waipo, we're just friends.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.976
All right. Go, go, go.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.944
Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.029
She's writing a research paper
on a bus.

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:30.531
So?

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.032
That is exactly the daughter

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.868
my mom wishes
came out of her vagina.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.580
I'm sorry about her.

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.166
How's it goin'?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.505
Give me the pendant,

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.799
and no one gets hurt.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.968
<i><c.color80ffff>Do you know this guy?</c>

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.096
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.808
Hey! Get off of me!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.019
What is wrong with you,
asshole?

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.229
I don't want any trouble.

00:17:02.314 --> 00:17:04.148
Then give us the pendant!

00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:05.983
<i><c.color80ffff>You have the wrong guy!</c>

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.401
Does he look like
he can fight?

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:09.111
Come on, bro!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.371
You okay?

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.931
Yo, what up, y'all?
It's your boy Klev,

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.766
<i><c.color80ffff>comin' at you live on the bus.</c>

00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:40.226
<i><c.color80ffff>I actually did take</c>

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.144
<i><c.color80ffff>a little bit of martial arts
as a youth,</c>

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:45.105
so I'm gonna try and grade
this fight as we're goin'.

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:00.496
Holy shit.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.123
Who are you?

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.014
You got this, bro!

00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:23.978
My bad.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:50.629
No, no, no!

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.215
Sorry.

00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:56.093
What the hell's going on?

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.303
You really wanna talk
about this now?

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.020
Bus driver is down.

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:07.354
I'm not gonna handle this.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.773
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:31.045
Go, you freak!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.681
Open the door, please!

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.104
The back is about to go.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.314
On my signal,
make a hard right.

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.482
What signal?

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:04.388
Everybody to the front now!

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.099
Go! Go, go, go.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.893
What's up, y'all? What's up,
y'all? What's up, y'all?

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:23.615
You and your sister
deserve what's coming.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.058
Hold on, everybody!

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.310
Oh, God.

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:01.445
Oh, my God!

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:15.959
Sorry. Heh.

00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:18.086
We make a good team.

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:49.868
Shaun. Hey.

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:52.621
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.373
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.208
- Macau.
- Macau?

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.584
Those guys are going
after my sister next,

00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:58.669
and I have to
get to her first.

00:22:59.504 --> 00:23:00.879
You have a sister?

00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:02.047
Look, I know
this is confusing.

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:03.382
I'll explain it
when I get back, I promise.

00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:04.466
No, no.

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:05.634
Hell no, dude.

00:23:05.802 --> 00:23:06.969
This is bullshit!

00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:09.471
I have been by your side
for half your life.

00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:11.640
I get there are things you
never wanted to talk about,

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:13.183
and I never wanted to push.

00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:16.353
But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm

00:23:16.521 --> 00:23:18.438
just chopped
our bus in half, Shaun!

00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:20.232
Who the hell are you?

00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.993
My sister sent me this
a few months ago.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.328
I think it's the address
of where she's staying.

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:39.084
Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:40.252
What?

00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:42.629
If they hurt her...

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.428
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:55.058
Fine.

00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:56.643
You can explain on the plane.

00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.145
What?
No, Katy, you can't just...

00:23:58.313 --> 00:24:00.022
You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!

00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:25.130
<i><c.color80ffff>After my mom died...</i></c>

00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:28.091
<i><c.color80ffff>my dad started my training.</i></c>

00:24:45.693 --> 00:24:47.027
<i><c.color80ffff>From sunup to sundown,</i></c>

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.613
<i><c.color80ffff>I was taught every possible
way to kill a man.</i></c>

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:40.747
<i><c.color80ffff>By the time I was 14,</i></c>

00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:41.832
<i><c.color80ffff>I could barely remember</i></c>

00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:43.375
<i><c.color80ffff>what life was like
before she died.</i></c>

00:25:45.962 --> 00:25:47.003
<i><c.color80ffff>That's how old I was</i></c>

00:25:47.088 --> 00:25:48.964
<i><c.color80ffff>when he sent me
on my first assignment.</i></c>

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:53.802
<i><c.color80ffff>I was willing to do
anything he wanted.</i></c>

00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:55.846
<i><c.color80ffff>If he asked me
to burn the world down,</i></c>

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.930
<i><c.color80ffff>I would've asked him...</i></c>

00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.098
<i><c.color80ffff>Beef or vegetarian?</i></c>

00:26:00.643 --> 00:26:01.643
We're all out of the chicken,

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:03.979
so I can only offer you
beef or vegetarian?

00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:08.150
- Vegetarian would be great.
- Yeah, same.

00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:09.317
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:11.528
<i><c.color80ffff>So...</c>

00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:14.072
Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:15.866
<i><c.color80ffff>Now we only have beef.</c>

00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:18.952
Beef. 'Cause that's all
you have, right?

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.328
- Okay, you'll have the beef.
- Yes.

00:26:20.413 --> 00:26:21.413
- And...
- Beef.

00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:23.457
- And the beef.
- Two beefs.

00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:30.922
Did you go through with it?

00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:40.974
I knew that I couldn't
go back to him, so I just...

00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:44.060
ran.

00:26:48.816 --> 00:26:51.359
I know this is a lot
to dump on you.

00:26:55.782 --> 00:26:57.949
I'm sorry about your mom.

00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:05.832
I should also probably mention

00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:08.794
that my name's
not technically Shaun.

00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:11.171
What?

00:27:12.215 --> 00:27:13.215
What is it?

00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:16.092
It's Shang-Chi.

00:27:16.677 --> 00:27:17.803
Shaun-Chi.

00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:19.346
No. Shang-Chi.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.889
Shaun-Chi.

00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:22.516
Shang.

00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:23.683
- Shaun.
- Shang.

00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:25.227
Shan.

00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:27.395
S- H-A-N-G. Shang.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.356
Shang?

00:27:29.524 --> 00:27:30.524
Yeah.

00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:33.902
You changed your name
from Shang to Shaun?

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.946
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:37.614
I wonder how
your father found you.

00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:39.199
Okay, I was 15 years old.
All right?

00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.243
What is your
name change logic?

00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:42.452
You're going into hiding.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.954
- Okay.
- And your name is Michael,

00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:45.872
you go on
and change it to Mishael.

00:27:46.123 --> 00:27:48.083
That's not what happened.

00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:49.417
It's like,
"Hi, my name's Gina.

00:27:49.502 --> 00:27:51.461
"I'm gonna go into hiding.
My new name's Gina. "

00:27:51.629 --> 00:27:52.629
<i><c.color80ffff>Can't hear you. I'm sorry.</c>

00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:54.297
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, you can hear me.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.925
Sign here to get in.

00:28:42.847 --> 00:28:45.307
I'm looking for my sister,
Xu Xialing.

00:28:45.558 --> 00:28:47.642
Have you heard of her?

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.605
This is the address she gave me.

00:28:55.902 --> 00:28:57.193
Okay.

00:28:58.446 --> 00:29:00.363
Seems like a nice fella.

00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:02.365
And this elevator
is definitely up to code.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.700
There's absolutely no chance
of it just falling off

00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:04.784
the side of the building...

00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:09.623
Bus Boy!

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:15.045
Two million views
in three days, bro!

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:16.212
Damn, dude.

00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:17.631
Oh, no.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.717
And you're the driver!

00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:24.346
Oh, my Chinese sucks.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680
Oh, all good.

00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:27.390
- I speak A-B-C.
- Oh, great.

00:29:27.558 --> 00:29:28.934
- I'm Jon Jon.
- Jon Jon.

00:29:29.143 --> 00:29:32.103
Welcome
to the Golden Daggers Club.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.773
Okay,
let's get you ready to fight.

00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:36.024
Wait. What?

00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:38.693
We're a multi-platform
global operation.

00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:40.987
Every fight livestreamed
on the dark web.

00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:43.657
Thousands of viewers
placing bets as we speak.

00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:46.034
This is gonna take your brand
to a whole new level.

00:29:46.202 --> 00:29:47.744
Think there's been
some sort of confusion.

00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:49.079
I like your spike face.

00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:50.163
Thanks!

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:51.915
Usually, you gotta
fight your way to centre ring,

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:53.041
but a viral star like you?

00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:54.209
Front of line, baby.

00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:55.794
I'm not here
to fight anybody. Okay?

00:29:56.003 --> 00:29:57.420
I'm looking
for my sister, Xu Xialing.

00:29:58.965 --> 00:29:59.965
Never heard of her.

00:30:00.091 --> 00:30:01.925
We just lost a fighter
at the last minute,

00:30:02.093 --> 00:30:03.969
so you get the next slot.

00:30:10.685 --> 00:30:12.102
Nice one, Helen.

00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:14.729
Is he gonna be
fighting in one of these?

00:30:14.814 --> 00:30:17.899
Oh, no, no, no. These are
like low-level fights.

00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:22.320
You're gonna be
fighting up there.

00:30:34.709 --> 00:30:37.627
That hurt, Emil.

00:30:37.712 --> 00:30:39.754
You want me to show you
how it feels?

00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:51.641
Wong! Wong! Wong!

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:54.477
Wong! Wong! Wong!

00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:56.146
Go, Wong!

00:30:56.313 --> 00:30:57.772
I always bet on Asian.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.399
Oh, my God.

00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:01.359
Yeah, look, I'm not
going up there, okay?

00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:02.777
<i><c.color80ffff>I'm just trying to...</c>

00:31:02.862 --> 00:31:03.903
It's too late to back out now.

00:31:03.988 --> 00:31:05.655
- You already committed, bro.
- What?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.782
<i><c.color80ffff>You signed
the contract, remember?</c>

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.284
<i><c.color80ffff>Your name's on the roster.</c>

00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:11.202
The bets are piling in.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.413
- Really? What's our cut?
- Oh, it's huge.

00:31:13.581 --> 00:31:14.581
It doesn't matter.

00:31:14.749 --> 00:31:15.832
It matters.

00:31:16.459 --> 00:31:18.710
Dude, I saw you
fight five assassins

00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:20.754
and a giant Romanian
with a razor for an arm

00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:22.213
<i><c.color80ffff>on a moving bus.</c>

00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:23.590
This is just one guy.

00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:26.217
Just do it.
Then we all get paid,

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.304
<i><c.color80ffff>and then I'll help you find
whoever you're looking for.</c>

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:30.972
Come on. You got this.

00:31:31.057 --> 00:31:32.432
- You got this.
- Don't be nervous.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.600
Thank you.

00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:34.768
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:44.027
How's the jaw?

00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:48.156
Maybe you'll start
controlling those punches

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.574
like we practised?

00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:56.414
Love that guy.

00:31:57.958 --> 00:31:59.375
Now take your shirt off.

00:31:59.919 --> 00:32:01.836
<i><c.color80ffff>Ladies and gentlemen,</i></c>

00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:04.255
<i><c.color80ffff>the fight we've all
been waiting for.</i></c>

00:32:04.715 --> 00:32:07.133
<i><c.color80ffff>The incredible

<i><c.color80ffff>all the way

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.682
<i><c.color80ffff>it's Bus Boy!</i></c>

00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:20.480
What happened to your shirt?

00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:27.570
<i><c.color80ffff>And his opponent
for tonight,</i></c>

00:32:28.114 --> 00:32:31.157
<i><c.color80ffff>it's Macau's
own fearsome killer...</i></c>

00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:37.455
<i><c.color80ffff>Xu Xialing!</i></c>

00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:43.503
Sister.

00:32:45.422 --> 00:32:46.589
Wait, wait!

00:32:48.759 --> 00:32:49.801
What are you doing?

00:32:56.934 --> 00:32:58.560
I know you're upset.

00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.228
But can you hear me out?

00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:05.984
We don't have time for this.

00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:16.578
<i><c.color80ffff>Ooh, that's gotta hurt.</i></c>

00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:25.587
Can you please stop hitting me?

00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:38.933
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.728
Dad's coming for you.

00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:47.650
I'm not fighting you.

00:33:48.569 --> 00:33:50.904
You shouldn't have come back.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:00.330
<i><c.color80ffff>Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...</c>

00:34:01.624 --> 00:34:03.625
I close my eyes,

00:34:03.792 --> 00:34:07.795
and it's like I can feel her.

00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:10.882
<i><c.color80ffff>Do you ever feel like that?</c>

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.719
No.

00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:20.892
I know
what you're going there to do.

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:23.853
<i><c.color80ffff>I don't know what
he's telling you, but Mom...</c>

00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:25.647
Mom's dead.

00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:40.536
Please don't leave me here.

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:50.630
I'll be back in three days.

00:35:14.196 --> 00:35:15.863
<i><c.color80ffff>Xu Xialing, you're amazing!</i></c>

00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:17.699
<i><c.color80ffff>We love you, Xu Xialing!</i></c>

00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.467
You run this place?

00:35:37.094 --> 00:35:39.012
I own it.

00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:43.766
Where'd you
get all that money?

00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:46.436
Did you bet against me?

00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:48.187
No.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.107
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:52.525
You're, like, such a badass.

00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:53.860
Everything that you do is,
like, so cool.

00:35:54.028 --> 00:35:55.194
That was really cool.

00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:56.821
I like your pants.

00:35:56.989 --> 00:35:58.823
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

00:36:00.534 --> 00:36:01.743
What do you want?

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.162
The Ten Rings ambushed us
in San Francisco.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.496
<i><c.color80ffff>I saw the video.</c>

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:07.040
They took my pendant.

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:09.751
<i><c.color80ffff>They're gonna come
for yours next.</c>

00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:13.880
I don't know
what he wants with them,

00:36:14.048 --> 00:36:15.506
but we both know
it can't be good.

00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:21.804
You know what he said to me
when he left?

00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:25.266
<i><c.color80ffff>"I'll be back in three days. "</c>

00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:27.769
And after three days,

00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:30.021
I went to our mom's shrine
and waited.

00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:34.400
Three days
turned into a week,

00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:36.611
<i><c.color80ffff>a week turned to a month,</c>

00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:38.946
<i><c.color80ffff>and a month
turned to six years.</c>

00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:45.870
That's how long
it took me to realise

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:47.663
I didn't need him any more.

00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:52.710
<i><c.color80ffff>I built this place on my own.</c>

00:36:53.003 --> 00:36:56.839
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.

00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:00.551
Then why would you
send me the postcard?

00:37:01.011 --> 00:37:02.387
<i><c.color80ffff>What postcard?</c>

00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:12.063
I didn't send you this.

00:37:19.363 --> 00:37:20.780
<i><c.color80ffff>Is there a back exit?</c>

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.365
Shaun.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.993
Hey. Hey!
Hey, open up!

00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:31.874
She's gone, dude.

00:37:48.642 --> 00:37:49.642
What do we do?

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.227
What do we do?

00:37:58.735 --> 00:38:00.111
Come on!

00:38:05.075 --> 00:38:07.201
Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.

00:38:07.369 --> 00:38:08.369
If we make it to the elevator,

00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:09.662
we can hop in
on the next floor.

00:38:11.165 --> 00:38:12.999
Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.

00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:18.212
One, two, three.

00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:25.261
Just head
straight for that elevator.

00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:27.555
You got this.

00:38:39.443 --> 00:38:41.027
I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.

00:39:31.245 --> 00:39:33.454
<i><font color=Lime>♪ On a dark desert highway ♪</i></c>

00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:46.259
Shaun!

00:39:49.096 --> 00:39:51.514
Shaun! Shaun!

00:39:54.977 --> 00:39:56.727
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.775
I'm coming!

00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:09.282
Shaun!

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.617
Hang on.

00:40:14.371 --> 00:40:16.122
Gotcha.

00:40:16.623 --> 00:40:17.623
Shaun!

00:40:19.376 --> 00:40:20.668
Katy!

00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:46.569
You left us for dead!

00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:50.615
Now you know how it feels.

00:41:09.885 --> 00:41:11.010
What does
he want with the pendant...

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.726
Did America make you soft?

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.117
He has the pendant!

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.202
I told my men

00:43:00.287 --> 00:43:03.622
they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.

00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:06.333
Glad I was right.

00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:14.675
I've missed you, my son.

00:43:18.889 --> 00:43:20.347
Let's go home.

00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:20.533
My son is home.

00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:26.580
Take the girls to their room.

00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:39.885
I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,

00:44:40.053 --> 00:44:43.055
<i><c.color80ffff>but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.</c>

00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:46.475
Is he gonna kill us?

00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:51.397
Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.816
<i><c.color80ffff>That's how I survived.</c>

00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.819
He always treat you like that?

00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:00.906
Only after my mom died.

00:45:02.868 --> 00:45:07.288
He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.

00:45:08.874 --> 00:45:11.083
I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.

00:45:12.377 --> 00:45:14.128
But I watched
everything they did

00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:16.255
and taught myself
to do it better.

00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:19.967
When did you leave?

00:45:20.135 --> 00:45:22.386
I ran away when I was 16.

00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:25.431
As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.

00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:29.351
You started an underground
fight ring in Macau

00:45:29.978 --> 00:45:31.729
when you were 16 years old?

00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:36.150
If my dad won't let me
into his empire,

00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:37.693
I'm gonna build my own.

00:45:38.987 --> 00:45:40.321
Hell yeah.

00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:07.681
Shang-Chi.

00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:12.102
That's enough.

00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:20.861
Have you been
practicing your English?

00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:24.156
Yes.

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:29.828
You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.

00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:39.755
If you want them
to be yours one day,

00:46:39.923 --> 00:46:43.842
you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.

00:47:01.444 --> 00:47:02.945
How did you find me?

00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.990
I always know
where my children are.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.784
I gave you 10 years
to live your life,

00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:10.160
and where did it get you?

00:47:13.415 --> 00:47:17.251
Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.

00:47:18.253 --> 00:47:20.587
That's not gonna happen.

00:47:24.092 --> 00:47:25.718
American girl.

00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:27.011
Her name is Katy.

00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:29.972
What is your Chinese name?

00:47:33.977 --> 00:47:35.269
Ruiwen.

00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:38.480
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

00:47:38.648 --> 00:47:40.649
They connect us
not only to ourselves,

00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:42.526
but to everyone
who came before.

00:47:43.987 --> 00:47:45.654
<i><c.color80ffff>A funny story.</c>

00:47:45.822 --> 00:47:48.282
Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:49.783
needed a boogeyman

00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:52.578
to bring your country
to its knees.

00:47:52.746 --> 00:47:55.414
So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.

00:47:55.498 --> 00:47:56.498
My Ten Rings.

00:47:56.583 --> 00:47:59.084
But because
he didn't know my actual name,

00:47:59.169 --> 00:48:00.544
he invented a new one.

00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:03.130
<i><c.color80ffff>Do you know the name he chose?</c>

00:48:04.966 --> 00:48:06.508
The Mandarin.

00:48:06.676 --> 00:48:09.636
He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.

00:48:10.055 --> 00:48:11.472
<i><c.color80ffff>And it worked.</c>

00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.432
America was terrified.

00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:15.893
Of an orange.

00:48:17.687 --> 00:48:18.979
<i><c.color80ffff>The truth is,</c>

00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:22.024
I've had many names
throughout my life.

00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:25.152
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:27.362
the most dangerous man
on Earth.

00:48:27.697 --> 00:48:31.742
For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.

00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:37.456
But when I met their mother,

00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:40.000
everything changed.

00:48:54.224 --> 00:48:57.851
<i><c.color80ffff>She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.</i></c>

00:49:00.605 --> 00:49:03.482
<i><c.color80ffff>It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.</i></c>

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.204
<i><c.color80ffff>She gave up everything
so we could be together.</i></c>

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:22.126
<i><c.color80ffff>And so did I.</i></c>

00:49:37.183 --> 00:49:38.851
You know who's in there?

00:49:39.018 --> 00:49:40.853
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:48.777
<i><c.color80ffff>After all those years,</i></c>

00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:50.445
<i><c.color80ffff>I finally found something</i></c>

00:49:50.613 --> 00:49:52.781
<i><c.color80ffff>worth growing old for.</i></c>

00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:00.622
My real name is Wenwu.

00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:04.042
<i><c.color80ffff>She was the only one
who called me that.</c>

00:50:05.712 --> 00:50:07.504
And when she died...

00:50:10.717 --> 00:50:13.051
<i><c.color80ffff>I was lost for many years.</c>

00:50:15.763 --> 00:50:17.764
<i><c.color80ffff>But I'm not lost any more.</c>

00:50:22.145 --> 00:50:23.604
<i><c.color80ffff>When you children ran away,</c>

00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:26.315
<i><c.color80ffff>I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,</c>

00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:29.693
<i><c.color80ffff>I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.</c>

00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:32.070
<i><c.color80ffff>The legendary Ta Lo.</c>

00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:34.448
<i><c.color80ffff>I wasn't able</c>

00:50:34.532 --> 00:50:36.783
<i><c.color80ffff>to find the secret path
to the village entrance,</c>

00:50:36.951 --> 00:50:40.495
but I did find
what they are hiding.

00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:43.582
<i><c.color80ffff>There's a gate
deep in their mountains.</c>

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.919
<i><c.color80ffff>Your mother
is waiting for us there.</c>

00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:51.506
I know this is a lot.

00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:55.552
I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.

00:50:56.387 --> 00:50:58.013
What are you talking about?

00:50:58.514 --> 00:51:00.599
I was sitting right here
in this seat,

00:51:01.017 --> 00:51:03.060
deep in my research...

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.146
and she spoke to me.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.691
<i><c.color80ffff>It was like
she was standing in this room.</c>

00:51:09.859 --> 00:51:12.694
I could feel her breath
on my cheek

00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:14.738
and her hand on my back.

00:51:16.282 --> 00:51:18.533
<i><c.color80ffff>She told me she needs my help.</c>

00:51:20.286 --> 00:51:21.495
To do what?

00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:24.665
To save her from her people.

00:51:27.835 --> 00:51:29.670
After we fell in love,

00:51:29.754 --> 00:51:32.464
your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.

00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:34.633
She asked permission
from the elders,

00:51:34.717 --> 00:51:35.884
and they refused.

00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:38.262
They said I wasn't worthy.

00:51:40.056 --> 00:51:41.390
She would still be with us.

00:51:41.474 --> 00:51:44.101
We would all be
living there together.

00:51:44.894 --> 00:51:46.603
Ta Lo did this to us.

00:51:48.398 --> 00:51:51.024
They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.

00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.697
Don't you see?

00:51:57.657 --> 00:51:59.741
She's leaving clues for us.

00:51:59.909 --> 00:52:01.368
She wants us to find her

00:52:01.536 --> 00:52:04.288
and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.

00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:07.833
Dad, Mom's gone.

00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:11.128
She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,

00:52:11.212 --> 00:52:13.505
and she's not leaving
any clues for us.

00:52:18.845 --> 00:52:20.846
Then what are these?

00:53:07.352 --> 00:53:11.021
<i><c.color80ffff>The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.</c>

00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:15.192
But there's a direct path
through the forest

00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:17.361
that only opens once a year

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:19.446
<i><c.color80ffff>on qlngming Jie.</c>

00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:22.949
<i><c.color80ffff>To get through,
you need to know the route</c>

00:53:23.034 --> 00:53:25.410
<i><c.color80ffff>and the exact time it opens.</c>

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:31.458
Now I know both.

00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:45.263
Three days from now,

00:53:45.431 --> 00:53:47.808
we will rescue
my wife from her prison

00:53:47.892 --> 00:53:49.101
and bring her home.

00:53:55.775 --> 00:53:57.442
This is why you're here.

00:53:58.361 --> 00:53:59.945
To help me
bring her back to us.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.823
And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.869
We'll burn the village
to the ground.

00:54:09.914 --> 00:54:10.914
What?

00:54:13.626 --> 00:54:15.919
You can't just march
into our mom's village

00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:17.421
with this bullshit.

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.297
I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...

00:54:24.637 --> 00:54:25.637
Hey!

00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:31.059
<i><c.color80ffff>Where are you taking me?</c>

00:54:32.437 --> 00:54:34.729
When will you stop pretending?

00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:38.608
Lock them up.

00:54:58.254 --> 00:55:01.423
<i><c.color80ffff>It's okay, my dear.</c>

00:55:08.347 --> 00:55:12.517
<i><c.color80ffff>We're all going to be
together soon.</c>

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:25.906
So,
pretty confused right now,

00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:29.618
because, initially
I thought your dad should

00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:31.745
definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,

00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:35.540
but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,

00:55:36.292 --> 00:55:38.668
<i><c.color80ffff>and now I have no idea
what's real.</c>

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:43.423
Is what he said
about your mom's village true?

00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:48.553
She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo

00:55:48.638 --> 00:55:49.638
when we were kids.

00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:54.893
A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.

00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:56.978
I thought
it was just a fairy tale.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.774
What if Dad's right?

00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:03.902
About Mom being locked
behind a gate

00:56:03.986 --> 00:56:05.946
by her own people?

00:56:06.113 --> 00:56:08.365
Crazier things
have turned out to be true.

00:56:09.575 --> 00:56:11.743
Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:14.329
but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,

00:56:14.497 --> 00:56:16.915
he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.087
This family was destroyed
a long time ago.

00:56:26.384 --> 00:56:28.051
The hell was that?

00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:30.303
Oh.

00:56:30.388 --> 00:56:32.639
You're going
toward that noise?

00:56:52.159 --> 00:56:55.453
<i><c.color80ffff>"Wake Duncan
with thy knocking.</c>

00:56:55.621 --> 00:56:58.582
<i><c.color80ffff>"Oh, I would'st

00:56:58.749 --> 00:57:00.292
<i><c.color80ffff>"My deed 'twere best not... "</c>

00:57:03.296 --> 00:57:05.255
Oh, hello, loves.

00:57:06.382 --> 00:57:07.841
What year is it?

00:57:09.343 --> 00:57:10.719
Who are you?

00:57:10.886 --> 00:57:13.013
Trevor? Slattery?

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.599
The actor from Liverpool?

00:57:16.517 --> 00:57:17.517
<i><c.color80ffff>Wait.</c>

00:57:17.685 --> 00:57:19.227
Are you the governor's kids?

00:57:19.895 --> 00:57:21.521
<i><c.color80ffff>I've been preparing
a monologue</c>

00:57:21.606 --> 00:57:23.273
<i><c.color80ffff>for your homecoming dinner.</c>

00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.317
<i><c.color80ffff>Oh. Where's she going?</c>

00:57:25.484 --> 00:57:26.651
Why are you down here?

00:57:26.819 --> 00:57:28.778
Well, some time ago,

00:57:28.863 --> 00:57:30.405
I was offered
the role of a terrorist.

00:57:30.615 --> 00:57:32.866
I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.

00:57:33.034 --> 00:57:34.951
But times were lean,
you know what I mean?

00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:37.871
<i><c.color80ffff>Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.</c>

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:39.497
But, ironic twist,

00:57:39.582 --> 00:57:42.167
it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

00:57:42.335 --> 00:57:43.835
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.295
but what I now recognise to be

00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:47.339
a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.

00:57:47.757 --> 00:57:49.507
<i><c.color80ffff>We all got our just deserts.</c>

00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:51.551
The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,

00:57:51.636 --> 00:57:53.303
and I served time
in federal prison,

00:57:53.471 --> 00:57:56.306
which turned out
to be the best thing for me.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.808
I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.

00:57:58.976 --> 00:58:01.561
- Then my dad broke you out?
- Exactly.

00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:03.813
- To kill you.
- Exactly.

00:58:04.565 --> 00:58:06.900
But just as his men

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.611
were tying me up
for my execution,

00:58:09.779 --> 00:58:11.655
I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.

00:58:11.739 --> 00:58:13.365
"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan

00:58:13.449 --> 00:58:14.949
"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st... "

00:58:15.034 --> 00:58:16.201
They couldn't
get enough of it.

00:58:16.369 --> 00:58:18.787
<i><c.color80ffff>I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.</c>

00:58:18.954 --> 00:58:20.830
So you're like his jester?

00:58:20.998 --> 00:58:22.666
I can give you a quick preview
if you like.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.000
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle... "

00:58:24.168 --> 00:58:26.461
Thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.

00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:28.505
Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...

00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:30.006
<i><c.color80ffff>What the hell?</c>

00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:31.216
What the... Oh!

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.342
What is that?

00:58:34.053 --> 00:58:35.053
What's what?

00:58:35.221 --> 00:58:37.013
- That! What is that?
- That! That! That!

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:40.684
You can see Morris?

00:58:40.851 --> 00:58:41.851
<i><c.color80ffff>Morris?</c>

00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:44.604
Oh, Morris!

00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:47.107
They can see you! You're real!

00:58:47.274 --> 00:58:50.318
<i><c.color80ffff>All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.</c>

00:58:50.486 --> 00:58:51.986
Oh, this is such fab news.

00:58:53.072 --> 00:58:54.072
Where's his face?

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.367
He's a bit sensitive
about that.

00:58:58.494 --> 00:59:00.203
Oh. Really?

00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.456
Morris says he knows
who you are.

00:59:04.166 --> 00:59:05.500
It talks... It talks to you?

00:59:05.584 --> 00:59:07.127
<i><c.color80ffff>If he didn't talk to me,</c>

00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:09.045
<i><c.color80ffff>I'd have gone mad yonks ago.</c>

00:59:10.423 --> 00:59:11.798
<i><c.color80ffff>How would he know me?</c>

00:59:11.966 --> 00:59:14.801
He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.

00:59:15.678 --> 00:59:18.763
<i><c.color80ffff>Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest</c>

00:59:18.931 --> 00:59:21.641
<i><c.color80ffff>on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.</c>

00:59:25.312 --> 00:59:26.896
He wants you to take him home.

00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.526
Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.

00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:33.236
<i><c.color80ffff>According to my dad,</c>

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.071
<i><c.color80ffff>the path there
only opens once a year.</c>

00:59:38.576 --> 00:59:40.744
Oh.

00:59:41.954 --> 00:59:44.539
Morris says he can guide you
there right now.

00:59:44.707 --> 00:59:45.915
<i><c.color80ffff>You can get through the maze</c>

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.584
<i><c.color80ffff>without waiting
for the path to open.</c>

00:59:47.752 --> 00:59:49.753
But, and it's a big "but,"

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.963
<i><c.color80ffff>it's very dangerous.</c>

00:59:52.131 --> 00:59:53.131
How dangerous?

00:59:53.299 --> 00:59:55.216
No one's ever
made it out alive.

00:59:55.384 --> 00:59:58.178
But Morris is 90% confident

00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.096
<i><c.color80ffff>he can guide us
through safely.</c>

01:00:00.181 --> 01:00:01.723
Oh.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.308
19%.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.313
Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.190
But even if
that chicken-pig is right...

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.358
<i><c.color80ffff>...we're still locked
in your...</c>

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:23.953
How did you...

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.539
Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.458
That's how
I escaped last time.

01:00:28.626 --> 01:00:29.626
Oh.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:31.753
This will take us
straight to the garage.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.308
<i><c.color80ffff>Oh, my God.</c>

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:46.976
I kinda like this guy.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:48.978
Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.271
Should be a straight shot.

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:52.065
Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...

01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:53.233
Do you mind?

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.360
I get sick in the back.
Carsick.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:00:59.739
That's my car!

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:06.329
God damn it.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:07.622
<i><c.color80ffff>Hold on.</c>

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.166
Is there another exit?

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:11.501
The other end of the garage.

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:13.169
<i><c.color80ffff>But we need a fingerprint
to open it.</c>

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:21.302
Incoming!

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.805
Shit!

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.161
<i><c.color80ffff>What's happening
back there?</c>

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:49.581
Doing my best.

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:51.499
<i><c.color80ffff>Scan hand print
for gate access.</i></c>

01:01:51.584 --> 01:01:53.877
- Hurry up!
<i><c.color80ffff>- I'm trying!</c>

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.297
<i><c.color80ffff>Scan hand print
for gate access.</i></c>

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.381
Shaun!

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.134
<i><c.color80ffff>Access approved.</i></c>

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:22.280
They will come back
once I bring her home.

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:25.867
Prepare the men for war.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:27.911
Yes, sir.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.419
<i><c.color80ffff>The first time
I witnessed pure artistry.</c>

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:40.548
1968. Planet of the Apes.</i></c>

01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:42.717
I was sitting in the cinema
next to my mum,

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.260
watching mastery

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:46.304
unfold before my very eyes.

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:48.598
After the film, I asked her,

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.184
"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:54.145
And she patted me on the head
and she said,

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:57.190
"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting. "

01:02:57.358 --> 01:02:59.067
That's when I knew.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:01.569
If they can teach
those monkeys

01:03:01.654 --> 01:03:03.571
to act that brilliantly,

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:07.492
just imagine what I could
bring to the world.

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:09.202
So you became an actor

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.287
because you thought
the monkeys were actually...

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:14.123
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.875
When, in fact,

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.045
they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.422
I still can't get my head
round it, to be honest.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.258
Good for you, dude.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:28.262
You found your passion
and went for it,

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.514
and eventually used it

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.641
to cripple the US government,
but whatever.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.768
<i><c.color80ffff>Yeah.
No, yeah, thanks.</c>

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.853
This is really cool
and all,

01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:37.397
but how long
do we have to sit here?

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:39.023
Morris is very clear.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.484
The way through
is all about timing.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:43.695
Okay, but how long
are we talking?

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.571
<i><c.color80ffff>Like, hours? Days?</c>

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.366
Friends,
I am but a transitory vessel

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.867
for the infinite wisdom
of a creature

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.286
far more advanced than
we'll ever truly understand.

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.539
What he sees, what he feels

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:56.332
of this vast, unknown universe

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.418
is beyond anything
our simple brains can...

01:03:58.502 --> 01:03:59.919
Oh. You can go.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.379
What?

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.256
Go. You can go. He says "go. "

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:27.947
You should speed up.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:29.615
What? Why?

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:32.994
Katy, go, go, go!

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:38.082
Morris says,

01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:40.043
- "Hard right on three. "
- What?

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.210
Two...

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.295
Hard right where?

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.755
Now.

01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:52.305
And left.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.311
It's all about staying
in the pocket.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:00.146
- What pocket?
- We're in it now.

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.981
What happens if
we don't stay in the pocket?

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.149
The forest eats us.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:04.776
Eats us? What does that mean?

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:06.486
He says it eats us.
Go left.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.746
- Watch your back!
- Stay in the pocket.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.498
- How close is it?
- Five metres.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.416
- Stay in the pocket.
- What is that in feet?

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:21.584
Really fricking close.

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:22.752
Stay in the pocket.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.462
Will you just stop saying,
"Stay in the pocket"?

01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:33.179
One last right,
then straight on to the end.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.563
You might wanna hurry up.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.565
What do you think I'm doing?

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.235
We're not gonna make it.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:51.989
I'm coming home, Mummy.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:07.255
Morris says,
"Great job, everyone. "

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:11.551
Now, all we have to do
is go through that waterfall,

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.511
and we're pretty much there.

01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:04.896
<i><c.color80ffff>Bloody hell.</c>

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.814
<i><c.color80ffff>I think those birds
are on fire.</c>

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:09.275
Really? Oh.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.777
Morris says it's normal.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.280
They're old mates of his.

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.191
That's a weird horse.

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.361
<i><c.color80ffff>What's it looking at me for?</c>

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.010
Hi there!

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:01.178
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:04.598
<i><c.color80ffff>This is my sister, Xu Xialing.</c>

01:09:04.766 --> 01:09:07.310
<i><c.color80ffff>We're Ying Li's children.</c>

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.690
This is my friend, Katy.

01:09:12.858 --> 01:09:16.485
Get in your car and go home!

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:19.155
Please. You don't understand.

01:09:25.579 --> 01:09:26.996
<i><c.color80ffff>Guang Bo!</c>

01:09:28.373 --> 01:09:30.541
What are you doing?

01:09:31.168 --> 01:09:33.336
<i><c.color80ffff>Put down your weapons!</c>

01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:37.965
Shang-Chi.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:39.550
Xialing.

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:42.970
I'm your aunty Nan.

01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:47.433
I've waited so long to meet you.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.736
You look like your mother.

01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:07.703
Hi, I'm Katy.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.288
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.956
Oh, thank you.

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:19.256
<i><c.color80ffff>Look who has found
his way home!</c>

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:21.175
I'm not a threat.

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:23.469
Just an entertainer.

01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.221
Morris can vouch for me.

01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:28.557
We don't have much time.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:30.351
Our father is coming.

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:41.404
Our people have been
here for over 4,000 years,

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.365
preparing for something
we hope will never happen.

01:10:44.533 --> 01:10:47.076
<i><c.color80ffff>We are the keepers
of the Dark Gate,</c>

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:49.620
sworn to protect this realm
and yours

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:52.289
from the evil
that's locked behind it.

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:55.334
Our dad is coming
here to open that gate.

01:10:55.877 --> 01:10:57.878
He thinks
you're holding our mom there.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.673
Why would he think that?

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:02.049
<i><c.color80ffff>She told him.</c>

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:04.260
He says he can hear her
asking for help.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.681
Is he wearing the rings?

01:11:08.849 --> 01:11:10.975
<i><c.color80ffff>He hasn't taken them off
since she died.</c>

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:14.520
What do they have to do
with all this?

01:11:18.442 --> 01:11:20.526
The realm of Ta Lo
stretches far beyond

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.486
the shores
of our small village.

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:26.323
We have cities that surpass
any in your universe,

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.201
<i><c.color80ffff>rich with culture and history.</c>

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.370
<i><c.color80ffff>Thousands of years ago,</c>

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:34.790
<i><c.color80ffff>all of our people
lived in peace and prosperity,</c>

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:39.003
<i><c.color80ffff>until the attack
of the Dweller-in-Darkness.</c>

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.046
<i><c.color80ffff>He came with his army,</c>

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:44.175
<i><c.color80ffff>devouring every soul
in their path,</c>

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:48.012
<i><c.color80ffff>and with each kill,
they grew stronger.</c>

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.223
After decimating
our largest cities,

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:54.810
they were headed to
your universe to do the same.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:58.355
<i><c.color80ffff>The leaders of Ta Lo sent
their strongest warriors here</c>

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:01.734
<i><c.color80ffff>to stop them from reaching
the portal to your world.</c>

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:05.446
<i><c.color80ffff>But our ancestors
were no match for them.</c>

01:12:06.573 --> 01:12:09.575
Until The Great Protector

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:13.245
<i><c.color80ffff>joined their fight
and turned the tide.</c>

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.957
<i><c.color80ffff>Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army</c>

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:18.250
<i><c.color80ffff>into the Dark Gate</c>

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:20.878
<i><c.color80ffff>and locked it behind them.</c>

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:26.258
Our people have guarded
that gate ever since,

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:29.887
empowered by the magic
of The Great Protector

01:12:30.055 --> 01:12:32.348
and the gift that she gave us.

01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:44.985
Dragon scales.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:46.820
Makes very good armour.

01:12:48.949 --> 01:12:50.991
Your father isn't the first
to come here

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.326
to open the Dark Gate.

01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:55.162
<i><c.color80ffff>Many have tried and failed
over the centuries,</c>

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:57.665
<i><c.color80ffff>and they all had one thing
in common.</c>

01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:58.832
They were lured here

01:12:58.917 --> 01:13:01.043
by the voice of something
on the other side.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.713
<i><c.color80ffff>A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.</c>

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:11.345
So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:15.474
They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.

01:13:19.813 --> 01:13:20.813
Oh.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.025
Here you go.

01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:26.277
Oh.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.279
To the range.

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.490
What? Okay.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:34.910
Looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.537
Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:37.913
Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.081
Thank you.

01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:42.835
Let's go see your mother.

01:13:57.517 --> 01:14:00.102
I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,

01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:03.105
and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:04.857
I wish I was more like that.

01:14:05.025 --> 01:14:07.109
It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:09.528
I just quit
and start something new.

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:11.614
But I just know my own limits,

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.408
and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.327
that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:17.453
That's not me.

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:18.996
Guang Bo.

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:21.582
Let her shoot.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.631
If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:53.739
<i><c.color80ffff>You were everything to her.</c>

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.868
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

01:14:58.036 --> 01:15:00.788
and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:25.270
After losing someone like her,

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.981
it's easy to feel alone
in this world.

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:30.317
But you're not.

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:32.736
You are children
of this family,

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.656
and I welcome you home.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.144
You're not
in your father's house any more.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:11.024
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:16.655
You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.259
Guang Bo, you saw that?

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:39.344
<i><c.color80ffff>That was tight!</c>

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:54.651
My mother was the only one
who could beat him.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:58.030
Show me how she did it.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.789
No, sorry.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.540
Sorry. Offside, offside.

01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:11.478
Your mother knew
who she was.

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:13.397
Do you?

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:22.466
You are a product
of all who came before you.

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:27.262
The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,

01:19:28.056 --> 01:19:30.390
it is all a part
of who you are.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.855
Stop hiding, nephew.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.733
It only prolongs the pain.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:14.726
<i><c.color80ffff>We'll be together soon.</c>

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.150
Sir.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:26.321
The men are ready.

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:29.157
The passage will open at dawn.

01:20:30.118 --> 01:20:31.743
I'll prepare the vehicles.

01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:57.853
<i><c.color80ffff>Lead with your breath.</c>

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:01.273
<i><c.color80ffff>Look into your heart,</c>

01:21:01.441 --> 01:21:04.776
<i><c.color80ffff>the light and the dark.</c>

01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:09.031
<i><c.color80ffff>To know yourself,</c>

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:13.118
<i><c.color80ffff>you must face them both.</c>

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.135
<i><c.color80ffff>Your husband tried to destroy us.</c>

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.388
The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:35.932
My husband is not the man
he used to be.

01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:38.101
<i><c.color80ffff>It doesn't matter.</c>

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:42.606
Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:47.402
They can go,

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:51.364
but someone has to pay.

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:57.871
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

01:21:58.039 --> 01:21:59.039
Go inside.

01:21:59.165 --> 01:22:01.958
I'm going to talk to our guests.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:10.801
But you don't have your powers.

01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:15.555
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.014
<i><c.color80ffff>Mama.</c>

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:42.809
<i><c.color80ffff>Mama.</c>

01:24:01.329 --> 01:24:02.537
Papa.

01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:14.883
She told me I could change.

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:19.638
That I could leave my past behind.

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:24.559
But she was wrong.

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:30.398
If I hadn't taken them off,

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:35.278
those men wouldn't have
dared to do this.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.492
And now they will pay for it.

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:35.964
Where's your boss?

01:25:36.424 --> 01:25:37.424
I don't know!

01:25:37.842 --> 01:25:39.426
I swear I don't!

01:25:41.012 --> 01:25:42.595
Okay.

01:25:55.943 --> 01:26:00.697
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:03.325
Will you help me?

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:34.481
We found the man

01:26:34.565 --> 01:26:36.649
responsible for killing
your mother.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:40.945
It is your right
to finish this for both of us.

01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:43.698
And when you return,

01:26:43.866 --> 01:26:47.369
we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:10.517
Been looking
everywhere for ya.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:19.651
You okay?

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:27.409
I'm not who you think I am.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.411
You already apologised
for that. We're good...

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.538
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:35.041
Okay.

01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:38.420
What... What is it?

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:48.847
When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...

01:27:51.559 --> 01:27:53.768
I told you
I couldn't go through with it.

01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:00.316
I lied.

01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:06.865
I thought that
I could change my name,

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:09.951
start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.

01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:11.327
But...

01:28:18.252 --> 01:28:20.503
She would hate
the person I've become.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:29.429
Your dad trained you
to be an assassin

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:31.431
when you were seven.

01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:35.768
<i><c.color80ffff>He sent you on a hit at 14.</c>

01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:40.106
<i><c.color80ffff>You realise how messed up
that is, right?</c>

01:28:43.736 --> 01:28:46.237
My mom is dead because of him.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.951
And now he's coming
to destroy her home.

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:04.589
A blood debt
has to be paid by blood.

01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:09.260
What are you saying?

01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:15.016
I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:22.565
I'm gonna kill him.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.030
He's here.

01:30:23.377 --> 01:30:24.377
No!

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:25.712
You're not ready.

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:27.922
She stays here.

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:23.227
Are you here
to help the people

01:31:23.312 --> 01:31:25.772
holding your own mother
captive?

01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:27.774
<i><c.color80ffff>She isn't back there.</c>

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.150
You're being lied to

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:31.402
by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.

01:31:32.863 --> 01:31:34.947
Is that what they told you?

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:38.159
<i><c.color80ffff>I know my wife's voice.</c>

01:31:38.369 --> 01:31:40.912
I miss my sister
as much as you do,

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.665
but this is not the way
to honour her memory.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.625
Did you honour her
when you turned her away

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:46.709
from your gate?

01:31:46.835 --> 01:31:49.337
You fool. We turned you away.

01:31:49.505 --> 01:31:52.048
The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.

01:31:52.383 --> 01:31:56.678
Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.

01:31:57.096 --> 01:32:00.890
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:04.060
Let me pass.

01:32:04.395 --> 01:32:06.437
We cannot do that.

01:32:25.416 --> 01:32:26.582
Burn it down.

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:31.647
Stop him!

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:10.269
Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?

01:34:14.608 --> 01:34:16.025
I'm not afraid of you.

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:24.534
Yes, you are.

01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:33.584
You've spent
your entire life afraid.

01:34:33.752 --> 01:34:35.795
Always running,

01:34:35.963 --> 01:34:37.255
always hiding.

01:34:52.479 --> 01:34:54.647
You were there
when they came for her,

01:34:54.815 --> 01:34:56.983
and you did nothing.

01:34:57.568 --> 01:35:00.444
You stood at a window
and watched her die!

01:35:35.272 --> 01:35:36.981
She was gone
and we needed you.

01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:41.402
But you chose those damn rings
over us.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:46.991
You trained your son
to be a killer.

01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:49.327
Is this what you wanted?

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.387
Even if you could
bring her back,

01:36:10.182 --> 01:36:12.808
what makes you think she'd
want anything to do with you?

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:40.127
<i><c.color80ffff>Save me.</c>

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.464
<i><c.color80ffff>Save me, my dear.</c>

01:37:03.276 --> 01:37:05.152
<i><c.color80ffff>Save me.</c>

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:08.030
I'm coming, my love.

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:50.823
He breached the gate!

01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:56.495
Those things
are gonna kill us all

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.164
if we don't work together.

01:37:58.331 --> 01:38:00.374
You think
I'm going to fall for that?

01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:02.710
Your weapons are useless
against them.

01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:04.795
We don't need your help.

01:38:05.338 --> 01:38:07.590
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

01:38:07.674 --> 01:38:09.091
and any...

01:38:33.784 --> 01:38:36.368
We... We should work together.

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:38.579
<i><c.color80ffff>Release them.</c>

01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:40.498
Release them!

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:47.546
<i><c.color80ffff>What are they doing?</c>

01:38:47.714 --> 01:38:50.174
<i><c.color80ffff>Stealing souls to
feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.</c>

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.675
If it grows strong enough,

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.177
it will break
right through the gate.

01:38:53.345 --> 01:38:55.304
That was just the beginning.

01:38:58.225 --> 01:38:59.517
It's too dangerous.

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:00.935
I have to help my friends.

01:39:05.232 --> 01:39:07.233
Don't die.

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:11.070
Everyone to the water now!

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:12.363
To the lake! Let's go!

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:13.656
Let's go!

01:39:15.784 --> 01:39:17.827
Hey, where's your brother?

01:39:17.994 --> 01:39:19.703
I was hoping you knew.

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:28.587
<i><c.color80ffff>Save me.</c>

01:39:53.155 --> 01:39:56.073
Aim at the sky,
to win or die!

01:40:09.838 --> 01:40:11.589
Deep breath.

01:40:27.272 --> 01:40:29.732
<i><c.color80ffff>Shang-Chi,
you have nothing to fear.</c>

01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:33.068
<i><c.color80ffff>You have the heart

01:40:33.862 --> 01:40:37.198

And your dad will too.

01:40:37.824 --> 01:40:41.952
<i><c.color80ffff>Take everything we've given you

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:08.229
Our family needs you.

01:41:09.648 --> 01:41:10.648
<i><c.color80ffff>Go.</c>

01:42:04.786 --> 01:42:06.537
Draw.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.834
Fire!

01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:41.155
You have to stop your father!

01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:14.396
She's not back there, Dad.

01:43:15.857 --> 01:43:19.693
Get out of my way, boy.

01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:21.945
No.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.010
Calm down, mate.

01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:28.637
I'm not dead,
it's just a performance.

01:44:28.805 --> 01:44:30.431
Now get down here
and play along.

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:15.554
I have to save her.

01:47:17.265 --> 01:47:19.141
She's calling to me.

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:24.229
I wish that were true.

01:47:27.358 --> 01:47:28.734
Dad, please.

01:47:31.279 --> 01:47:32.988
Your family needs you.

01:47:42.123 --> 01:47:43.874
<i><c.color80ffff>Let me out!</c>

01:48:14.489 --> 01:48:15.572
Shit.

01:49:58.176 --> 01:49:59.468
It's headed for the village!

01:51:49.412 --> 01:51:51.872
<i><c.color80ffff>If it gets our dragon's soul,</c>

01:51:51.956 --> 01:51:53.748
<i><c.color80ffff>it will be unstoppable!</c>

01:51:56.794 --> 01:51:58.295
Aim for the throat!

01:52:46.636 --> 01:52:48.428
You have to let me go.

01:52:55.686 --> 01:52:57.228
Let go!

01:52:59.148 --> 01:53:00.899
I'm not leaving you again.

01:53:19.168 --> 01:53:20.460
Holy shit.

01:53:52.618 --> 01:53:54.494
Go.

01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:03.749
<i><c.color80ffff>Tonight,</i></c>

01:56:03.749 --> 01:56:05.500
<i><c.color80ffff>we honour those

01:56:05.584 --> 01:56:08.921
so we might see another day.

01:56:08.921 --> 01:56:10.588
They were more than warriors.

01:56:11.715 --> 01:56:15.135
<i><c.color80ffff>They were our mothers
and fathers,</c>

01:56:15.302 --> 01:56:18.012
<i><c.color80ffff>our sisters and brothers.</c>

01:56:19.181 --> 01:56:22.517
<i><c.color80ffff>And though we will always
hold on to their memories,</c>

01:56:24.145 --> 01:56:28.690
<i><c.color80ffff>tonight we release them
to rest with our ancestors.</c>

01:56:35.531 --> 01:56:37.323
<i><c.color80ffff>Farewell, Dad.</c>

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.826
<i><c.color80ffff>Mum, we'll be okay.</c>

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:43.997
<i><c.color80ffff>A thousand years ago,</c>

01:56:44.456 --> 01:56:46.791
<i><c.color80ffff>and a thousand years from now,</c>

01:56:47.543 --> 01:56:50.378
<i><c.color80ffff>we will always be together.</c>

01:57:32.755 --> 01:57:34.422
<i><c.color80ffff>I seriously thought
we were going to die.</i></c>

01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:35.965
And I'd only learned
how to shoot a bow,

01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:37.300
like, a day earlier,

01:57:37.468 --> 01:57:38.593
now I'm on a battlefield,

01:57:38.677 --> 01:57:40.970
killing all these Soul Suckers
with Shaun's aunty,

01:57:41.138 --> 01:57:43.348
who's this awesome,
magical kung fu goddess.

01:57:43.515 --> 01:57:44.933
And I'm hanging on
to The Great Protector

01:57:45.017 --> 01:57:46.017
with my sister at this point,

01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:48.102
trying not to get eaten
by the Mega Soul Sucker.

01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:50.563
Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker
was such a nasty bitch.

01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:52.232
Yeah. It was trying
to eat our dragon's soul.

01:57:52.316 --> 01:57:53.316
Which would have
allowed it

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.442
to destroy
the entire universe.

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:55.526
Yeah.

01:57:55.611 --> 01:57:56.778
I only had
one arrow left,

01:57:56.862 --> 01:57:58.738
and all I could hear
in the back of my mind

01:57:58.906 --> 01:58:00.365
was my mom's voice saying,

01:58:00.532 --> 01:58:02.742
"Just take the shot,
you little mooch!"

01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:05.411
And so, I aimed
right for the Sucker's throat

01:58:05.496 --> 01:58:07.413
- and I let her fly.
- She hit it dead on.

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:09.082
And then Shaun used
the Ten Rings

01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:11.834
to do this crazy
Kamehameha fireball

01:58:11.919 --> 01:58:13.461
that exploded the thing...

01:58:13.545 --> 01:58:15.463
...and he saved the world.

01:58:16.799 --> 01:58:19.634
Yeah, we, lost
some good people that day...

01:58:21.804 --> 01:58:23.137
but we made it.

01:58:23.639 --> 01:58:25.014
We made it.

01:58:26.725 --> 01:58:28.184
Are you done mocking me?

01:58:28.394 --> 01:58:30.228
Oh, no. We're not mocking you.

01:58:30.396 --> 01:58:31.771
So where is this sister
of yours?

01:58:31.939 --> 01:58:33.856
She's back
at my dad's compound,

01:58:33.941 --> 01:58:35.108
shutting down his operations.

01:58:35.276 --> 01:58:36.859
Yeah, his dad was the head
of The Ten Rings

01:58:36.944 --> 01:58:38.444
for the past thousand years.

01:58:39.989 --> 01:58:42.031
Two weeks ago, you were
parking cars for tips,

01:58:42.199 --> 01:58:44.492
and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.452
from soul-sucking monsters?

01:58:47.121 --> 01:58:48.371
I know, you're trying
to get me back

01:58:48.455 --> 01:58:50.123
for what I said last time,
but I'm not gonna apologise...

01:58:51.292 --> 01:58:52.625
...for speaking the truth
as a friend.

01:58:52.793 --> 01:58:55.420
I really meant what I said,
and, in fact, I actually think

01:58:55.587 --> 01:58:57.922
this whole bit you're doing
just further proves my point.

01:58:58.090 --> 01:58:59.215
You guys are obviously...

01:59:00.509 --> 01:59:02.135
- What?
<i><c.color80ffff>- Shang-Chi.</c>

01:59:04.888 --> 01:59:06.180

01:59:08.976 --> 01:59:09.976
Present.

01:59:13.689 --> 01:59:14.814
My name is Wong.

01:59:16.066 --> 01:59:18.234
Yeah, I know, sir.
I'm a huge fan...

01:59:18.402 --> 01:59:19.861
Do you have the rings?

01:59:21.363 --> 01:59:22.822
Yeah, yes.

01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:25.950
Good. Let's go,
we have a lot to talk about.

01:59:26.452 --> 01:59:27.535
You too.

01:59:30.331 --> 01:59:31.331
Me too?

01:59:34.543 --> 01:59:36.502
- I think we should...
- Yeah.

01:59:36.587 --> 01:59:38.880
- We gotta go.
- Yeah.

01:59:40.174 --> 01:59:43.593
I know this is, like, crazy,
but I'm gonna text you,

01:59:43.761 --> 01:59:46.637
and we'll do this again.
Nice to see you, John.

01:59:46.805 --> 01:59:48.681

They don't match any artefacts
from our codex.

02:02:07.154 --> 02:02:08.571
What do you think?

02:02:08.655 --> 02:02:10.531
I'm not sure.

02:02:12.826 --> 02:02:15.953
They're not vibranium.
Chitauri?

02:02:17.372 --> 02:02:19.790
Not like any alien tech
I've seen.

02:02:20.792 --> 02:02:21.918
How long did your dad
have them

02:02:22.002 --> 02:02:23.503
before he gave them to you?

02:02:26.089 --> 02:02:27.673
About a thousand years.

02:02:27.966 --> 02:02:29.675
Their thermoluminescence
indicates

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:31.093
they're older than that.

02:02:31.303 --> 02:02:32.887
By a lot.

02:02:33.138 --> 02:02:35.389
The first time
you used the rings,

02:02:35.766 --> 02:02:38.184
we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

02:02:46.902 --> 02:02:48.361
What is it?

02:02:53.742 --> 02:02:55.785
A message to where?

02:02:58.330 --> 02:03:00.331
I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

02:03:00.541 --> 02:03:01.624
You can get my number
from Bruce.

02:03:01.708 --> 02:03:03.125
It was so nice to meet you.

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.338
Yeah, I...
I don't have her number.

Guys, stay safe.

02:03:13.845 --> 02:03:16.097
Welcome to the circus.

02:03:22.771 --> 02:03:25.314
I know this is a lot
to take in,

02:03:25.482 --> 02:03:27.942
<i><c.color80ffff>but you're gonna have
to start getting used to that.</c>

02:03:28.443 --> 02:03:31.487
From now on,
the trajectory of your lives

02:03:31.655 --> 02:03:34.740
will be like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

<i><c.color80ffff>You both have a long journey
ahead of you.</c>

02:03:42.457 --> 02:03:45.084
Go home, get some rest.

02:03:47.129 --> 02:03:48.504
Yeah. That's a good idea.

02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:51.632
Yeah. Yeah,
we probably should do that.

02:03:53.135 --> 02:03:54.510
