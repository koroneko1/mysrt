00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,075
Hello, Ae.

2
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,352
Can I talk to you?

3
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,548
What do you want from me?

4
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,354
I want to tell your story through a song.

5
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:07,838
I just want you think about it.

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,543
I'm sorry that I disappoint you.

7
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:14,682
But I never said that
I'd be against in your relationship.

8
00:00:14,762 --> 00:00:18,609
But I'm okay now
because my sister won't kill me.

9
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,908
It's time for your brother to meet him.

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,205
My name is Tul.

11
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:24,432
I'm his brother.

12
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:27,317
I'm glad that I'm finally get to meet
my brother's important person.

13
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:28,398
You're such a douche-bag.

14
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:31,450
Don't mess with him.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,428
Dust is everywhere.

16
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:55,852
I'm angry.

17
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:58,746
What's wrong?

18
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,399
That asshole.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,175
Why are you making that face?

20
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,456
I don't know why I'm angry.

21
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,802
It's because of your brother.

22
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:11,823
I thought your brother came
looking for a fight,

23
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,652
but turns out he played nice instead.

24
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:16,622
I was going to deal with him,
but you told me to get inside first.

25
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:26,717
If you didn't stop me,

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,316
I'd curse him so bad he wouldn't be able
to find a way back home.

27
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,295
Wait. This is his house...

28
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,354
But I'm so angry!

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,550
He's pretending to be a good person.
Does he think he can deceive me?

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,817
If you tell me he's bad,
of course I'd believe you.

31
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,196
What are you thinking about?

32
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:04,278
Promise me one thing.

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,141
Don't involve yourself
with my brother again.

34
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:09,935
Are you scared?

35
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:15,100
I am.

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm scared that he'll take it out on you.

37
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,299
I won't let anyone hurt you.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,284
I won't let anyone hurt you too.

39
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,095
Come on.

40
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,368
Stop ruining the moment.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,414
Of course.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,585
I'll recreate the atmosphere for you.

43
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:08,752
Can!

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,276
Stop it.

45
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,748
I know you want to do it.

46
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,888
Because I've already fallen for you.

47
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,999
Good answer. I'll make you feel good.

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,881
Tin!

=A Chance To Love=

75
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,707
Oh, nice guess.

76
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:29,591
Even if mom taught me to behave myself
when I go to someone else's house.

77
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:31,869
I'm frigging' hungry.

78
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:34,881
Where did everyone go?

79
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:36,762
There were so many people here
in the morning,

80
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:38,318
now it's so quiet.

81
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,453
The worker's rooms are at the back.

82
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,933
Everyone's probably asleep now.

83
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,500
You don't have to be that wary of me.

84
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:52,773
Where's my brother?

85
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,173
Already asleep!

86
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,781
Then why are you down here?

87
00:07:58,861 --> 00:07:59,989
Do you need anything?

88
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,566
I don't need anything
from someone like you!

89
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,373
Stupid stomach...

90
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,095
The hell are you laughing at?

91
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:13,369
Come with me me,
I'll cook you something to eat.

92
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:15,050
Who says I'm hungry?

93
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,226
I'm not!

94
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,692
Spaghetti with chili and bacon.

95
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:40,339
Looks simple,
but I'm sure it'll taste good.

96
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,359
Give it a try.

97
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,300
You can't believe I can cook?

98
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:57,095
Just because Tin doesn't like cooking...

99
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,186
doesn't mean that I'd also hate it.

100
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,540
I'm not gonna eat it.

101
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,877
You're a funny kid.

102
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,488
Just eat it, so it won't go to waste.

103
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,211
This is because
I don't want to waste any food...

104
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,756
It's good, right?

105
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,585
This is Phu's favourite menu.

106
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:52,382
But he can't have spicy food,
so I'd only put in bacon for him.

107
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,914
Phu said he met Tin's friend
who says that I'm a bad guy.

108
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,072
That's you right, Can?
What did Tin tell you?

109
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:06,366
All the bad things you've done, obviously.

110
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,399
And you believed him?

111
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:12,540
Yeah. Whatever Tin says,
I'll always believe him.

112
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:19,258
I also don't understand why
Tin loves to make up stories...

113
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:21,709
about how I like to hurt him
and other people.

114
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,696
Even if I might not seem like it,
I do love my brother.

115
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:28,771
I really don't understand
what Tin is thinking.

116
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:30,658
Don't you dare insult Tin.

117
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,182
I won't believe anyone other than Tin.

118
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,214
Remember that.

119
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:51,002
What a waste.

120
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,725
He acts just like Phu.

121
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:17,734
Frigging' Champ, why don't you
just say that I already lost...

122
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:18,901
Techno!

123
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,533
Speaking of the devil
and the devil appears...

124
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:23,207
I won't be here anymore.

125
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,600
-Are you okay?
-Stop!

126
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:31,918
Don't say anything.

127
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,362
But...

128
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,735
I said shut up!

129
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,435
If you say one more word,

130
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,027
I won't talk to you anymore.

131
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,155
I'm embarrassed.

132
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,503
Don't touch me.

133
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,516
You're still cute even when you're angry.

134
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:11,731
Come on Tin,
I'm just here to buy something with Ae.

135
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,778
I'm just here to buy something with Ae.

136
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,965
And since exams are finished,
I just want to go shopping and relax.

137
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,990
I'm not angry about that.

138
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:30,558
Then you're angry that I'm here with Ae?

139
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,190
Tin... It's just Ae.

140
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,025
My spoiled prince,

141
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,614
you know fully well who Ae likes.

142
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,510
But I guess I can't really say much,

143
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,615
since you also like me.

144
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,662
Sorry that I'm very charming.

145
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,104
I'm not surprised
if you get jealous over me.

146
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:56,972
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

147
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,503
I gotta go, see you later.

148
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,106
I have an hour left...

149
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,364
What should I do?

150
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:13,409
Let's find something to eat.

151
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,339
I'm not scared of you.

152
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,443
What a coincidence.

153
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,381
What a coincidence my ass!

154
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:23,112
Your house is in the opposite direction!

155
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,356
Why are you here?

156
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,945
Fine, fine.

157
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,643
I'm here to see you, Can.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,114
Why?

159
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,617
If you wanna know, let's talk for a bit.

160
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,253
What are you looking at?

161
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,211
You act just like a child.

162
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:10,884
I didn't think
Tin would like someone like you.

163
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,064
What's wrong with being like this?

164
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,428
Nothing.

165
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,532
I didn't mean anything bad.

166
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:23,486
I'm just surprised
Tin is dating someone so innocent.

167
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,116
Because in the past,
he didn't date people like this.

168
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,781
Are you...

169
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:33,410
trying to make me suspicious of Tin?

170
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:34,974
Keep dreaming.

171
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:36,879
The past doesn't mean anything.

172
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,763
I'm the present.

173
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,288
I'm not here to do that.

174
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:43,682
I'm just here
to correct a misunderstanding.

175
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,034
To correct...

176
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,696
a misunderstanding?

177
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:53,029
Tin said
I accused him of taking drugs, right?

178
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,152
It's not accusing
if he's telling the truth.

179
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,298
What...

180
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,603
is this?

181
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,986
Tin didn't tell you
that he did drugs before?

182
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,134
Ae.

183
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,137
I can't meet up with you today anymore.

184
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,317
Sorry.

185
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:44,230
About what you said.

186
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,057
What did you mean?

187
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,369
Here's your order.

188
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,703
Thank you.

189
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,407
So? Why did Can call?

190
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:02,878
Don't be so nosy.

191
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,276
Fine.

192
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:09,603
Insult me as much as you want.

193
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:12,708
It's all you do anyway.

194
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,406
If you're not nosy,
why would you follow me then?

195
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,197
Sorry for the interruption.

196
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,485
Let's talk.

197
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:30,683
This is Ae
from the Faculty of Engineering.

198
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,617
The one that I told you about before.

199
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:33,889
And this is my friend.

200
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:34,984
Tum.

201
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,802
The one who wants an inspiration
for writing a song.

202
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:41,620
That's why we're interested in your story.

203
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,244
It's just you who's interested.

204
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,402
Try talking to him first.

205
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,782
Maybe you'll get some inspiration
for multiple songs.

206
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,252
Not just one.

207
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,529
Keen said your story is interesting.

208
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,508
Actually...

209
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,974
If you're not interested in my friend,
you don't need to talk to him.

210
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,885
It seems that you don't want to be here.

211
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:09,494
Stop it.

212
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,557
I'm just stating the truth.

213
00:17:17,668 --> 00:17:19,174
Then let me ask you something.

214
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:22,091
How interesting
do you think your story is?

215
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,247
I don't know.

216
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,361
I just...

217
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:33,158
know that I'm willing to do anything
to tell him that I love him.

218
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,473
And I'll always be waiting.

219
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:43,435
And what did he say?

220
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,947
Have you ever loved someone so much?

221
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,027
But there's something that
makes you unable to be together?

222
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,769
Of course.

223
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:06,336
See?

224
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,150
I told you that Ae's story is interesting.

225
00:18:10,893 --> 00:18:11,974
Yeah.

226
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,734
I think it's already worth it
that we skipped practice to come here.

227
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,219
-Hey, Ae.
-Shut up.

228
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,448
I don't want to hear it.

229
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,887
Fuck you.

230
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,162
Why are you so rude?

231
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,572
If you stop prying
into other people's businesses,

232
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,496
maybe your life would be better.

233
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,672
It's not like I can help it!

234
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,132
Like that couple back there.

235
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,846
Something smells fishy.

236
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,239
Trust me.

237
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,938
I can feel it.

238
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,521
Keen likes Tum,

239
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,824
but Tum likes someone else.

240
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:53,387
For sure!

241
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,762
Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,599
Should I just ask Type about this?

243
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,468
Maybe I'll get some extra information.

244
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,769
Stop right there.

245
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,807
It's their business, not yours.

246
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:10,415
Are you going to hit my head
until my brain explodes out of my skull?

247
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:13,688
Fine.

248
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,088
I'll stop thinking about them.

249
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:20,656
Instead, I'll wait to hear
how your song will turn out.

250
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,299
It's not my song.

251
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,205
Then let's refer to it as the song...

252
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:30,413
that will be born
from the story of you and...

253
00:19:32,056 --> 00:19:33,982
Shit. I shouldn't have said anything.

254
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:35,355
What should I do?

255
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,606
Oh, yeah! Where is Can?

256
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,583
He texted me
saying something came up suddenly.

257
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:44,489
But I think he must be lying.
I bet he got up late this morning.

258
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:48,955
Why are you sighing at me?

259
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,752
Hey, Ae! Wait for me!

260
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,485
If you ditch me,
no one's gonna help me carry my stuff!

261
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:58,578
Ae!

262
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,304
What is this?

263
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,623
I saw you updated your
status on Facebook yesterday...

264
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:36,870
that you got wet in the rain.

265
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,503
And?

266
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,333
You should start looking after yourself.

267
00:20:43,684 --> 00:20:45,482
Here. Eat this.

268
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:46,648
I bought it for you.

269
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:50,835
If you got soaked in the rain,

270
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:53,161
you should take a lot of vitamins
so you won't get sick.

271
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,820
Why didn't you tell me
as soon as you got here?

272
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:06,365
I would've hurried to come.

273
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:14,299
What are you looking at?

274
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,514
Aren't your eyes already small enough?

275
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,416
Stop squinting.

276
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,166
Tin.

277
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:23,905
Let me ask you something.

278
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,114
What?

279
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,114
Have you taken drugs before?

280
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:45,913
Why are you asking me something like that?

281
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,400
Take a look at this.

282
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,149
Where did you get this picture from?

283
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,883
Well..

284
00:22:04,982 --> 00:22:06,428
Your brother sent it to me.

285
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:08,876
You talked to my brother?

286
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:11,944
Yeah...

287
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:14,298
I did.

288
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:16,866
Okay.

289
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:18,422
Then we're done here.

290
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:22,938
In the end, you chose to believe him.

291
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:25,967
Tin!

292
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,055
Wait!

293
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:29,053
Tin!

294
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,657
Tin...

295
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,767
Tin. Listen to me.

296
00:22:39,115 --> 00:22:40,398
You believed him, right?

297
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,390
You hate me now, don't you?

298
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,154
Can you stop for a second
and just listen to me first?

299
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,782
How can you think that
I would believe him more than you?

300
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:53,222
If I believed him,
why would I even bother to ask you?

301
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:55,379
Seriously.

302
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,447
Do you really think that
I would choose your brother over you?

303
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,191
How many times...

304
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:02,581
do I have to tell you that
you're the only one I'll listen to?

305
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,825
Even if I'm stupid
and you end up deceiving me,

306
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,640
I will still only believe you.

307
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,641
So stop being a fool
and imagining things all on your own.

308
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,965
Tin!

309
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:15,410
Just tell me!

310
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:19,089
Just tell me what's wrong.
I'm your boyfriend.

311
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,046
You told me before that I'm stupid, right?

312
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:26,780
Then start telling me things
so I know what's going on.

313
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,347
Just tell me already.

314
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:39,524
Why are you quiet?

315
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,116
Come on, answer me.

316
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,272
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,039
I'm just scared.

318
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,473
I thought you believed my brother.

319
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,711
And you've already hated me
like everyone else.

320
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,354
I'm sorry, Can.

321
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,894

Tin.

330
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,175
I will seriously hit you on the head.

331
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,309
What are you saying?

332
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,537
Everyone who's talked
to my brother before,

333
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:34,388
all believed him.

334
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:37,660
In the end, they all left me.

335
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,856
Did I ever say I believed him?

336
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,305
I just wanted to know what that clip is.

337
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:50,283
I didn't intend to show you that clip
and start crying.

338
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:51,959
I just wanted an explanation.

339
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,742
After that event,

340
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,994
I acted like a fool.

341
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,229
But I didn't do drugs.

342
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:10,399
Yes.

343
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:12,849
I could sleep with anyone,

344
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,800
but I am not like
what my brother told you.

345
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,247
That's all I needed to hear.

346
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,315
See?

347
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,934
As soon as you explained it to me,
I understood immediately.

348
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:31,382
I'm really sorry.

349
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,850
Why are you saying sorry?

350
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,469
The one who should apologize
is your brother, not you.

351
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:42,322
How can he do that to you?

352
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm so furious.

353
00:26:57,939 --> 00:26:59,375
Why are you staring at me?

354
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:06,792
I love you.

355
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,414
Please don't leave me.

356
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,640
Can.

357
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,277
Tin!

358
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,035
Why are you pulling my hand away?

359
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:25,575
Can't you see I'm embarrassed?

360
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,832
Of course, I'm not gonna go anywhere.

361
00:27:31,772 --> 00:27:33,026
I'll stay with you like this.

362
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:37,946
I'm so embarrassed I feel like dying.

363
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,639
Can.

364
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,018
Tin.

365
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:57,642
We're in the middle of the campus!

366
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,890
Stop it!

367
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,212
I really feel like dying.

368
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,332
That's enough.

369
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:19,005
You've thought about it carefully, right?

370
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:20,329
Yes.

371
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,768
I've made my decision.

372
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:25,759
Even if in the end,

373
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:28,541
you'll have no one left?

374
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:33,671
Yes.

375
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,499
Even if I'll have no one left...

376
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,230
If it's your final decision, then fine.

377
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:45,603
Thank you.

378
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:53,595
Tul.

379
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:01,518
Never mind, nothing.

380
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:02,639
You can go.

381
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,134
Gonhin.

382
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:16,744
I'm sorry...

383
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:21,344
for not being able to help anyone.

384
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:03,420
Why are you at Bangna anyway?

385
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,885
Family gathering.

386
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,554
I can't go.

387
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,599
Everybody already thinks
my family only has my brother.

388
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:12,587
I see.

389
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,541
Then go on.

390
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:17,326
I'll keep sleeping while missing you.

391
00:31:23,062 --> 00:31:24,280
If I just tell him I miss him,

392
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,801
he'll hurry to come see me tonight.

393
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,443
I should just get more sleep.

394
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,772
Tin...

395
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:40,429
What?

396
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,946
Calm down...

397
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,479
Can... Calm down...

398
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,052
Fuck it! I'm not staying calm anymore!

399
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,510
Where are you going, Can?

400
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,043
I'm gonna murder someone at Tin's house.

401
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,382
I'm not coming home tonight.

402
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,583
And if I go to jail,
don't forget to come bail me out.

403
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:27,511
What is wrong with him?

404
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,414
Did you bite my son?

405
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,619
Why is he acting so crazy?

406
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,233
Coming, coming!

407
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:53,119
-Oh, Tin!
-Hello.

408
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,467
Hello.

409
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:55,955
Did Can know you were coming?

410
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:57,034
Oh, no.

411
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:59,761
I was just around
so I came to give you some snacks.

412
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:03,579
Thank you, Tin, you're always so nice!

413
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,445
But next time,
you don't need to bring us anything.

414
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,657
Okay.

415
00:33:08,323 --> 00:33:10,708
And is Can home?

416
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,955
Oh, right! Since you mentioned it...

417
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,605
He went out around an hour ago.

418
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:18,264
Saying he was going to your house.

419
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,193
You didn't see him?

420
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:20,607
Maybe you passed each other
on the way here.

421
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:22,982
What did he say again...

422
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,990
He said he was going to murder someone
at your house!

423
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:30,253
My son seems to become more silly
with each passing day, don't you think?

424
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,294
He has someone as cute as you as his
friend, why would he want to kill you?

425
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:36,995
Please excuse me.

426
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,566
Oh, Tin.

427
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:40,148
You're already going back?

428
00:33:43,276 --> 00:33:45,265
What's wrong with everyone today?

429
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:03,929
Here's your jacket.

430
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,119
I'm coming home a bit late tonight.

431
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,739
Auntie, you can sleep first.
I'll lock up the house when I come home.

432
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,587
It's okay, I can wait for you.

433
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:17,624
Tul!

434
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,087
Can. Tin's not here today.

435
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:24,987
-Tul!
-Fuck you! Why would you do this?

436
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:26,998
You are such a fucker, do you know that?

437
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,648
Let go of me!

438
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:30,776
You think I'll believe you?

439
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:32,588
-What did I do?
-Everything!

440
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,270
Leave Tin alone, you fucker!

441
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,789
-Please stop, Can.
-Let go of me!

442
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,663
I beg you.

443
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,984
What's going on here?

444
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:44,359
Who can tell me what's going on?

445
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:13,311
Where's Can?

446
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:14,966
Can punched Tul's face.

447
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:16,883
Do you think it'll end here?

448
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:18,311
Doesn't matter how it's gonna end.

449
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,073
I won't let you lay a finger on Can.

450
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:22,241
Look after him carefully.

451
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:27,838
The best kind of revenge is to be happy.

452
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:30,968
Tin!

453
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,184
You've thought this through
carefully, right?

454
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:37,652
