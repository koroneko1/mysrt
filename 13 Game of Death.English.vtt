WEBVTT

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.280
Just a minute.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.400
FRIENDS FOREVER REST IN PEACE

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.680
Hey, Chit.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120
Hi, Chang.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.200
How are you?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.320
How are you?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.200
Hi, Chit.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.160
That's the wrong note. Higher.
Breathe using your diaphragm.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.360
This is as far as I can help you.
The rest is up to you.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.240
Professor, this is my friend, Chit.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.720
Chit, this is Professor Winai.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.120
Afternoon, sir.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.520
He wants to talk
about the brass instruments.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.560
Oh, yes, come on in.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.680
Thank you.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.280
-Let's take a look.
-Here it is.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.880
Well…

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.080
I heard a student playing on the trumpet

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.520
and the sound quality wasn't that clear.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.320
I would like to recommend this one.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.360
You're from Yamaha?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.280
Yes, sir.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.200
Chang?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.360
I talked to Prame yesterday.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.480
Oh, really?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I thought you were
from a different company.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.800
I can't help you.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.080
I'm about to place an order with Prame.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.160
Hi, Mom.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.040
<i>Hi, Chit. Have you eaten yet?</i>

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.480
Yes, Mom.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.320
<i>Good. So what are you doing?</i>

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.400
I’m on my way home. I’m almost there.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360
<i>When you get there, try to rest, okay?</i>

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.000
Yes, Mom. There's no need to worry.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.120
<i>Are you coming home</i>
<i>for the Songkran holidays?</i>

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.680
<i>Everyone is asking about you.</i>

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.720
I don’t know
if I can clear my work in time.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.600
I might need to do overtime.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.760
Everyone is very busy this time of year.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.160
Promotions are coming up.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120
I might have the chance
to become a supervisor.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.400
Isn't that good?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.640
<i>Oh? That would be great.</i>

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.440
But I’m sure I can come home
for a couple of days.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.160
<i>That’s good, son.</i>

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.520
<i>If work is getting tough</i>
<i>then come home and relax.</i>

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.160
<i>It worries me seeing you work so hard.</i>

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.120
<i>If Bangkok is too hectic then come home.</i>

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.040
Yes, Mom.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.520
<i>We may not be wealthy,</i>

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.760
<i>but we'll be close.</i>
<i>We can take care of each other.</i>

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280
Yes, Mom. But don’t worry.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.960
Everything is coming along fine.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.240
<i>That's wonderful, son.</i>

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.080
<i>And Maew, how is she doing?</i>

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.040
<i>If you’re coming home, bring her along.</i>

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.280
<i>She’s a famous singer now.</i>
<i>Has she’s forgotten me?</i>

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.080
<i>Please tell her that we all miss her.</i>

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.480
I will, Mom.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.640
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
"FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS" - PHUCHIT

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720
IN LOVE TO THE DREAMS…

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.240
Sign here, please.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.040
What's this?

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.680
You’ve missed
over three months of payments.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.320
Didn't you read the notices we sent?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.560
Sign here, too.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.680
Thank you.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.640
I'll need your keys too.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.480
-Hey, come stand here.
-Oh Tong! Hello!

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.280
Don't get stuck in the middle.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.040
Why are you taking the bus?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.080
Need a change in scenery?

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.040
Um, no.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.160
Hey, I brought your CD.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.320
But why?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.200
Don't you like the songs?
Don't you want the CD?

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.320
No, it's not like that.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.760
You won't have to make
another copy to give to a studio.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.760
It'll save you some cash.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.080
I gave up that idea a long time ago.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.600
Go ahead, keep it.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.280
What record company would want these?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.560
I think your music is much better
than a lot of stuff nowadays.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.120
You’re just saying that.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320
Seriously.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.280
Why don’t you give yourself a chance?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.440
Honestly, this internship is killing me.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.200
They use me like a full employee.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.560
So? Quit. Get the hell out.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.600
Are you crazy? My dad would kill me.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.960
You don't graduate in computers
to become a musician.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.480
Oh, so you want it like this then?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.960
When is Somboon taking us
for our bonus dinner?

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.320
I have no idea.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.600
Is Somboon choosing the restaurant?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.280
Why doesn't he let Prame do it?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.680
The person with the best sales record
should choose.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.440
Exactly, if it wasn’t for Prame's sales,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.720
we wouldn’t even be getting a bonus.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.640
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.360
-Prem, do you know how much the bonus is?
-Phuchit, is something bothering you?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.760
Oh, oh, nothing.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.440
Okay then, I’d better get to work.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.560
Okay.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.440
Hey, Prame?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.400
Oh, Chit. What's up?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.640
Did you make a sale over at St. Nicholas?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.640
Yes. Is something wrong?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.160
That school was one of my clients
and you knew it.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.440
Who is your contact?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.680
A friend. He's a teacher there.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.560
We've been talking about it for ages.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.280
-Why did you--
-Chit.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.240
You were too slow.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.360
Chit, Somboon wants to see you right away.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.600
It's okay, Am.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.800
Have a seat.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.200
Your documents…

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.080
I don’t understand

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.080
why your sales have been
dropping for the past three months,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.760
whereas everyone else
seems to be doing better.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.280
I’m trying, sir.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.360
Trying? Is this what you call trying?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.720
I think you misunderstand
the meaning of "trying".

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.400
Take Prame, for example.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.320
That’s called trying.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.040
Excuse me, Mr. Somboon.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.320
The system is setup now. I need
to try to and access it from outside.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.360
Do you know what’s happening next month?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.480
We’re using our computer network?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.200
That’s right. We’re going online.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.440
There are many benefits to this system.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.440
It will let us work
more efficiently and effectively.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.080
Most importantly,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.560
it will lower our overheads,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.200
particularly those
that don’t generate profit.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.760
I really don’t want to do this to you.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.640
This resignation letter
will give you the opportunity

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.360
to apply elsewhere
without getting a bad reference from us.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.760
DUNNING LETTER

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.960
Thank you, Tong.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.640
Sorry.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400
Hello, Mom.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.720
<i>Chit.</i>

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.760
What is it, Mom?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.560
<i>Do you have 8000 Baht I could borrow?</i>

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.720
<i>Fai needs it for her school registration.</i>

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.440
But I just sent you some money, Mom.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.120
<i>She used it to buy a new phone.</i>

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.200
<i>If she fails to register today,</i>
<i>she will not be able to study this year.</i>

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.720
Okay, Mom, I’ll transfer the money.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.200
<i>Thank you, son.</i>

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.360
<i>I wont ask for anymore.</i>

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.720
<i>I’m so sorry.</i>

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.560
<i>As soon as your dad returns,</i>
<i>I'll pay you back.</i>

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.600
It’s alright, Mom.
I still have some savings.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.960
I'll transfer it to you.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.560
If there isn’t anything else,
I’d better get back to work. Bye, Mom.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.560
Hello?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.960
Hello?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.240

Who are you?

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720
Nik?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.480
Is that you, Ceen?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.160
<i>All your problems can be resolved</i>

If you don’t tell me
who the hell you are, I’ll hang up.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.280
<i>We are here to help you</i>

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.360
Are you sure
you didn’t dial the wrong number?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.040
<i>Phuchit Puengnathong. Age 32.</i>

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.520
<i>Your financial situation at present</i>

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.080
-<i>is a debt of 50,000 Baht to Easy Buy.</i>
-That's me.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.400
<i>And you owe 30,000 Baht</i>
<i>on your credit card.</i>

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.000
Who are you? How do you know this?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.400
<i>Before you get to know me,</i>

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.320
<i>tell me, aren't you annoyed</i>
<i>by that fly buzzing around you?</i>

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.400
Yes.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.720
<i>Now, look behind you.</i>

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.160
<i>Look.</i>

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.720
<i>You will see a newspaper.</i>

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.000
<i>If you can kill the fly</i>
<i>with the newspaper,</i>

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.120
<i>you will receive a cash prize</i>
<i>of 10,000 Baht instantly.</i>

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.480

<i>our game show</i>

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.120
<i>Go for it. We wish you luck.</i>

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.320
Hello.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.320
<i>How was the first challenge?</i>

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.080
<i>How do you feel?</i>

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.440
I feel like I need to know who you are.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.040
<i>Before that,</i>

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.040
<i>let’s play another game.</i>

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.760
<i>If you succeed,</i>

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.200
<i>you'll have 50,000 Baht.</i>

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.480
Let's do it.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.480
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>isn’t any harder than the first.</i>

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.000
<i>Right now you are holding the fly</i>
<i>in your left hand, right?</i>

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.960
Yes.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040
<i>Well, here’s the challenge.</i>

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.320
<i>We would like you</i>
<i>to swallow that dead fly.</i>

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.280
<i>If you do this, 50,000 Baht in cash</i>
<i>will be yours instantly.</i>

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.960
<i>Do your best.</i>

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.160
Bastard.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.800
AVAILABLE BALANCE 319.50 BAHT

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.400
Hey Tong, what's up?

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.680
Um, can I have my cigarettes back?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.040
What did you just put in your mouth?

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.480
Licorice.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.080
Licorice?

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.040
Hey, Chit.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.320
Celebrating your unemployment?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080
Hello?

<i>100 million Baht is within your grasp.</i>

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.280
100 million?

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.160
<i>That confused the hell out of your office.</i>

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.760
<i>100 million Baht can be yours</i>

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.320
<i>if you pass all 13 challenges.</i>

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.240
<i>You've already passed two,</i>

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.000

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.040
<i>Please listen carefully to our guidelines.</i>

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.680

<i>the game will end</i>

<i>and all the money will be withdrawn</i>
<i>from your account.</i>

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.560
All of it?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.080
<i>Yes, but there are three more ways</i>
<i>to stop the game.</i>

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.200
<i>One. If you tell us to stop the game,</i>

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280
<i>we will.</i>

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.760
<i>Two. If someone finds out</i>
<i>that you are playing this game,</i>

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.080
<i>it will automatically end.</i>

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.160
<i>This game is confidential</i>
<i>between you and us.</i>

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.120
<i>Three. If you try to contact us</i>
<i>or find out the origin of this game,</i>

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.760
<i>it will automatically end,</i>

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.120
<i>Everything will be revealed to you</i>
<i>at the appropriate time.</i>

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.120
<i>If you understand these rules,</i>

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.440
<i>then please make your decision.</i>

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.280
<i>Please press 1 to register your entry,</i>

<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.560
<i>Hello, welcome to the game.</i>

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.040
<i>A cash prize of 100 million Baht</i>
<i>is within your reach,</i>

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.680
<i>but only if you complete</i>
<i>the 11 challenges that await you.</i>

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720
<i>We will give you</i>
<i>all the moral support you’ll need.</i>

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.560
<i>You’ll need to leave this place</i>
<i>for the next challenge.</i>

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.520
<i>If you have any parting words</i>
<i>for your colleagues, please do it now.</i>

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.200
<i>We’ll see you outside in a moment.</i>

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440
IN LOVE TO THE DREAMS…

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.200
Okay. Okay. See you in ten minutes.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.840
Hello?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.160
<i>Listen up.</i>

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.160
<i>You should be able</i>
<i>to see loads of children.</i>

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.440
<i>Our challenge is very simple.</i>

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.040
<i>Just make at least three children cry.</i>

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.360
<i>If you succeed</i>
<i>you'll receive 100,000 Baht.</i>

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.480
<i>Give it a go.</i>

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.080
I'm sorry.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.760
Look at the kids. They're just playing.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.440
Let it go.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.440
What are you doing?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.240
What are you doing?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.240
Stop it!

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.760
ENTRANCE

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.240
-Teacher, hurry!
-That's the guy! Get him!

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.320
Stop him. Don't let him escape…

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.360
-Yes…
-He tortured the kids.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.600
Hurry. Run after him!

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.160
What kind of security guard are you?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.000
Oh, God, help us!

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.400
-What the hell is this?
-Is it going to be okay, Sis?

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.640
Go arrest him.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.040
Look, he hit me.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.560
My parents don't even hit me.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.960
I'll sue him
for assault, attempted murder,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.000
or whatever costs him more money.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.960
You have to arrest him.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.280
Look, we have new regulations.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.160
To make an arrest,
you must know who he is.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.720
-I do.
-We need to know his full name.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.560
He wears glasses and dresses like me.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.200
Just ask these two.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.280
Many people wear glasses. We need a name.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.520
His name is Phuchit. He works with me.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.640
-And his last name?
-Well, just Phuchit.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.440
Last name. What was it?

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040
Miss!

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.360
Miss. Miss!

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.280
I'm reporting a crime, so shut up!

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.080
We're reporting a crime, too.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.600
-Officer, you must arrest him.
-He dresses just like that!

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.640
Officer, he dresses
just like that guy there.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.280
Oh, my God! Yes, just like him.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.000
-Is he going to hurt us?
-Are you crazy?

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.280
You're his brother, aren't you?

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.680
You no good son of a bitch!

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.360
Give me a gun.
If you cops can't settle this

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440
then I will.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.320
-That's slander, bitch!
-Listen to this crap.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.360
-The guy's shirt was like his.
-He…

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.320
Officer, arrest him. Get my money back.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.600
Now what?

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.040
Some guy just started kicking him
and stole his jar of money.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.480
He resisted, so the guy just beat him.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.480
Do you remember what he looked like?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.080
Skinny with glasses.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.360
I AM DEAF, BLIND AND MUTE
PLEASE BE KIND AND DONATE

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.960
He dresses like that guy over there.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.080
Are you insane?

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.160
I knew it! He's a murderer.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.240
Right.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.200
There can't be
many shirts like that around.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.000
You're all crazy.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.360
I'll sue the lot of you!

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.520
Hello?

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.000
<i>It is lunch time.</i>

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.160
<i>We would like to invite you out for lunch</i>

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.400
<i>and a shot at your 5th challenge.</i>

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.720
The menu, please.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.520
<i>Hello. For your 5th challenge</i>

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.080
<i>you must finish</i>
<i>a special meal we've prepared.</i>

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.720
What's this?

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.360
<i>It’s your challenge.</i>

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.200
<i>Take all the time you need to finish it.</i>

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.240
<i>Then the cash prize of 500,000 Baht</i>
<i>will be transferred to your account.</i>

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.760
<i>We understand you may need some time,</i>

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.080
<i>but remember, you still have</i>
<i>eight more challenges ahead of you.</i>

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.200
And if I refuse to eat it?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.200
<i>You know the game will terminate.</i>

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.320
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.080
<i>You know what to do.</i>

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.280
-You half-breed!
-Bastard!

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.680
Your mom is a whore.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.320
Who the hell are you?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.040
Tui? Jom, is that you?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.520
<i>If you ask that kind of question again,</i>
<i>you forfeit the game.</i>

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.120
<i>I advise you not to think about your past,</i>

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.200
<i>because this game is over.</i>

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.280
<i>You can force people</i>
<i>to eat far dirtier things.</i>

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.720
<i>Take a look at that woman over there.</i>

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.200
<i>Have you ever wanted to look at someone</i>
<i>the way she looks at you?</i>

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.480
Mr. Somboon, you're a good person.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.520
Even after all the headache I've caused,
you still bring me to a nice restaurant.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:55.520
Waiter, what did that guy order?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720
Hello.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.960
<i>You did very well on the last challenge.</i>

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.960
<i>You now have 500,000 Baht.</i>

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.000
<i>How do you feel?</i>

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.360
Just tell me what to do next.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.600
<i>Wow, you really don’t want to waste time.</i>

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.080
<i>But you'll need to trade your phone</i>
<i>for a riddle.</i>

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.800
Then how will we keep in touch?

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.800
<i>Listen to our assistant</i>
<i>and we will be able to stay in touch.</i>

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.160
<i>He's quite easy to find.</i>

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.480
<i>He’s at the bus stop.</i>

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.760
There are lots of people
at the bus stop. How can I find him?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.400
<i>It’s not hard. He’ll be alone.</i>

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.440
Hello? Hello?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.080
You dare sit on my throne!

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.760
I'll have you killed!

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.200
I'm still cranky

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.280
after signing the divorce papers.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.320
Hey! How dare you sit on my throne!

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.680
Soldiers, arrest this subject.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.160
I have something to trade with you.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.280
What the hell did you eat? You stink!

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.440
Soldiers! Arrest him!

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.800
Are you deaf?

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.200
Damn, lazy soldiers!

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.160
I'll do it myself.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.200
Please wait, Your Royal Highness.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.560
I have an offering from a distant land.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.480
Oh, my God, this is…

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.560
Where did you find this?

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.960
Ebay.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.720
Aha! The Lord Ebay has sent a gift.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.160
Do you know what this is?

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.560
I do not, your highness.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.240
It's a message from God!

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.720
God will contact us
through this holy messenger.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:49.440
When 13.13 is here,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:55.000
God will descend down to earth.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.480
What are they all looking at?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.960
13.13, God is coming.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.600
What is 13.13?

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.480
13.13 is God.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.360
He is coming on chariot number six

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.640
to bless the world's struggling people,

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:43.400
so they may eat and enter heaven.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.240
But you will miss it,
because you can’t see God's chariot.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.120
Only the righteous

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.280
will see the way to God.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.040
Chit!

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.640
You stupid shit. God is waiting. Go!!

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.400
Hey! Chit!

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.640
Chit, wait up!

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.480
Yo, check this out. Damn!

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.560
He's got a fangirl.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.080
Looks like no one's
getting on this bus anymore.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.040
An original gangster right there.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.360
Last night we were poppin' wheelies.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.480
What's in there, bro?

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.440
Check it out, color screen!

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.600
Answer it.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.680
Hello? Wrong number-- Hey!

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.480
Hey, this prick is looking for trouble.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.520
Hey ! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.360
A tough guy, eh?

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.520
Do you know who we are?

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.080
Step up? Let's see what you're made of!

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160
Get him!

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.000
Hey!

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.080
Hey! Who told you to stop?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.360
Eat this!

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.560
Please, this phone
is very important to me.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.040
I found this freaking phone first.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.120
But it belongs to me, honestly.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.440
I think he really needs it.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.160
If you really want it,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.360
bow to my feet. Then, I'll give it to you.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.560
Go on.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.600
That's all you had to do.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.600
You're a freaking wuss.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.800
Bitch!

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.120
It's on, dickhead!

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.520
Pull! Pull!

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.720
Pull me up! Come one!

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.240
Why the hell are you helping him?

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.720
What should we do now?

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.320
Hey!

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.360
Don't do it.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.760
My God! What do we do?

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.240
Hey! What are you doing?

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.000
Ouch!

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.360
Is he still alive?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.000
That's enough. Stop.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.280
No! Stop it!

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.280
That's enough!

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.480
Leave him!

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.520
That's enough! Please, I'm begging you!

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.200
Don't kill him, please. It's not worth it.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.120
Don't do it.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.400
-Put down the knife, please.
-Spare him your mercy, please.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720
Hello.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.400
<i>Good job. You did it much better</i>
<i>than we expected.</i>

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.400
<i>You broke the record</i>
<i>for having the most viewers.</i>

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.760
People are watching?

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.320
<i>Of course.</i>

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.240
<i>This is a game show.</i>
<i>How could we not have an audience?</i>

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.600
-I thought you said--
-<i>Forget about that.</i>

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.400
<i>Let’s talk about your prize instead.</i>

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.200
<i>Currently, you have</i>
<i>800,000 Baht in your account.</i>

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.600
<i>You can check your balance with this phone</i>

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.520
<i>just as you did with your other phone.</i>

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.560
<i>For the next challenge,</i>
<i>you must walk for three bus stops.</i>

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.680
<i>The video clearly identifies the suspect</i>
<i>as Mr. Phuchit Puengnathong.</i>

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.200
<i>An employee of Sahamongkol Music,</i>

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.120
<i>who earlier injured one of his co-workers,</i>

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.040
<i>as well as a street beggar in the market.</i>

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.760
<i>This was most likely triggered</i>
<i>from high levels of stress</i>

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.160
<i>after being laid off from work.</i>

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.960
<i>In addition to financial debts,</i>

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.320
<i>which, caused him to go on a rampage.</i>

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.000
<i>For this case,</i>
<i>Pol. Col. Surachai Tantiweerakun,</i>

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.800
<i>the head of the investigation division,</i>

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.520
<i>a special division</i>
<i>of our national police force,</i>

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.360
<i>has personally taken over the manhunt</i>

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.440
<i>and is currently with us for an interview.</i>

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.040
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.880
<i>Hello.</i>

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.240
<i>Why have you taken</i>
<i>a special interest in this case?</i>

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.040
<i>In the past we've dealt with people</i>
<i>under similar circumstances.</i>

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.440
<i>Though this sounds like a trivial case,</i>

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.560
<i>in the interest of public safety,</i>

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.440
<i>the situation must be suppressed</i>
<i>before it escalates.</i>

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.200
<i>Do you feel that his condition</i>
<i>was triggered purely by stress,</i>

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.720
<i>or were other factors involved?</i>

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.440
<i>According to evidence</i>
<i>and witness testimony,</i>

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.240
<i>the suspect appears to be coherent.</i>

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.480
<i>So, I am positive</i>
<i>other factors are involved.</i>

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.360
<i>Can you elaborate more?</i>

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.760
<i>Not at this moment,</i>

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.480
<i>because we're still</i>
<i>in the middle of a ongoing investigation.</i>

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.800
Is anyone there?

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.400
<i>This is the condition of the house</i>
<i>before Chew started neglecting it</i>

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.120
<i>after his wife passed away four years ago.</i>

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.760
<i>Chew has refused to move out,</i>

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.520
<i>so his family abandoned him.</i>

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.560
<i>He gave this reason</i>
<i>when asked why he wouldn’t move.</i>

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.480
<i>I don’t want to move.</i>

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.280
<i>I built this house with my own hands.</i>

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:24.520
<i>I built it for them,</i>
<i>but they don't want to live here.</i>

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.520
<i>And on top of that,</i>
<i>they wanted to tear it down.</i>

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:35.080
<i>Chew built this house in 1955.</i>

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.760
<i>He continued to add</i>
<i>extensions to the house,</i>

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.760
<i>but the most unique feature</i>
<i>of the house is its indoor wishing well,</i>

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.680
<i>which he never let anyone cover,</i>

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.640
<i>for it would unbalance</i>
<i>the house’s sense of Feng Shui.</i>

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.160
<i>Just let it be.</i>

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.680
<i>Any house with a filled-in well</i>
<i>is damned. Didn’t you know that?</i>

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.200
<i>Chew struggles with paralysis</i>
<i>and other minor illnesses,</i>

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.960
<i>which are burdens to his everyday life.</i>

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.560
<i>I’d like a wheelchair.</i>

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.320
<i>And I want them to come</i>
<i>and check up on me once in awhile.</i>

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.080
<i>Even though life in the capital city</i>
<i>will continue to improve,</i>

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.440
<i>there will always be cases</i>
<i>of the elderly being neglected.</i>

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.280
<i>We don’t feel that this incident</i>
<i>is unique to Chew,</i>

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.080
<i>but we tell his story hoping that people</i>
<i>will take better care of their elders,</i>

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.400
<i>and not leave them in solitude.</i>

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.520
<i>This is the condition of the house</i>
<i>before Chew started neglecting it…</i>

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.720
What the hell?

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.160
-<i>You saw the TV, didn’t you?</i>
-Yes.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.080
<i>I’m going to give you an opportunity</i>
<i>to do a good deed for a change.</i>

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.600
<i>A chance to help someone.</i>

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.280
<i>That person is Chew.</i>

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.360
<i>He's still inside this house.</i>

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.240
What do I have to do?

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.680
<i>Do you remember the well?</i>

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.080
Yes.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.400
I’m looking for it right now.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.560
<i>Excellent.</i>

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.360
<i>Chew is in the well.</i>

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.600
<i>You have ten minutes to help him out.</i>

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.480
How long has Chew been in there?

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.200
<i>A little over ten days.</i>

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.640
Ten days?

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.600
And you knew he’d fallen in ten days ago?

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.600
Why didn’t you help him?

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.080
<i>It’s not our business.</i>

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.200
<i>It’s the responsibility of his relatives</i>
<i>to care for him, isn’t it?</i>

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.440
I guess.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.400
-But--
-<i>If you hurry he might still be alive.</i>

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.240
<i>You have ten minutes starting</i>
<i>from when you hang up the phone.</i>

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.520
<i>Help Chew from the well</i>

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.360
<i>and get the telephone number</i>
<i>from his shirt pocket.</i>

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.560
<i>Then call his relatives</i>
<i>to come pick him up.</i>

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.960
<i>If you succeed, a cash prize</i>
<i>of 1.2 million Baht will be yours.</i>

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.400
<i>Do you understand?</i>

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.600
Okay.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.600
<i>If you understand, then start.</i>

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.560
Uncle!

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:38.680
Stop creeping me out.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.760
I’m trying to help you.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.160
Then your relatives
can have a proper funeral for you,

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.560
and then you can rest in peace.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.520
Hello. Who do you wish to speak to?

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.000
Hello, are you a relative of Chew’s?

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.200
Nope. I'm just his nephew.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.520
Chew's fallen down the well. He's dead.

00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.760
<i>Come and pick up his body.</i>

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.600
What was that?

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.120
Chew's fallen down the well. He's dead.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.360
Who’s going to a water fall?

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.320
Who was that?

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.240
Muay, answer it!

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.960
I can’t, I doing my nails? You get it!

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.200
I'm playing a game. Can't you see?

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.800
Well, can't you see what I'm doing?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.200
Aren't you a little too young
to be doing that?

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.320
Hurry up and get the phone, will you?

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.160
-You hurry up!
-Forget it!

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.200
What's wrong with you two?
Can't you hear the phone?

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.760
-Well, it's her--
-God, it's annoying.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.040
He won't pick it up.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.080
-Stop arguing, will you?
-Look, my fighter just died.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.160
I don't you what your problems are.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.080
What is so hard
about answering the damn phone?

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.520
You’re useless, both of you!

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.040
Hello, you’ve reached
the Chotisetianpaisarn residence.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.120
Are you a relative of Chew's?

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.280
Not really, I'm just his son.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.640
Your father fell down the well.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.160
What did you say? I can’t hear you.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.760
Your dad drowned in the well.
Please come and get his body.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.400
Who? What? Who died?

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.160
Your god damn father
drowned in the freaking well!

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.640
No, your father died, asshole!

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.560
Dad… the well… Dead!

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.680
Dad!

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.400
Oh, my God!

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.360
Dad!

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.200
Mommy!

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.120
Dad!

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.520
Mom!

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.080
How the hell did you get in here?

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.680
I heard about it on TV, so I stopped by.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.320
Are you a burglar?

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.400
How dare you say that?

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.440
I’m here to help.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.520
What kind of a family are you?
Didn't give a damn about your dad.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.480
You left him to drown.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.120
You've got some nerve!

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.240
The coroner’s almost here

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.680
and the police are on their way.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.120
Hey, where the hell
do you think you’re going?

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.520
Stay and talk to the cops first,
Mr. Nice Guy.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.560
Mr. Nice Guy?

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.000
Do you have any cigarettes?

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.040
Tong, you’re working over time?

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.240
Don’t work so hard.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.080
Maew. Maew. Maew.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.040
What!?

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.360
Oh, Chit.

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.760
Why are you walking away?

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.520
I’m sorry. I didn’t know it was you.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.080
How are you?

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:57.680
I’m sorry, but I need to get going.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.440
Maew, my mom says she misses you.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.520
She wants both of us
to visit her during the holidays.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.360
Phuchit, we’ve been through this.
We're finished.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.520
We can start over.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.640
Maew. I’ve changed.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.600
I can buy a house now.
I can even buy you a car.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:24.560
I can give you everything
you've ever wanted.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.720
Chit, stop it.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.240
I’ve heard this all before.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.440
I’ve wasted enough time on you.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.280
You should go home if you're drunk.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.680
I'm not drunk. I'm telling the truth.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.280
If you don’t believe me,
then take a look at my bank balance.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.720
Chit,

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.800
even if you had

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.480
all the money in the world,

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:02.000
you still couldn't make me famous.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.600
Maew.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.080
Maew, I’ve been looking
everywhere for you. I'm so sorry.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.520
Leave me alone. That hurts.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.480
This is Phuchit, an acquaintance.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.360
Phuhit, this is Chalerm, my boyfriend.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.360
Maew, I’m sorry.
I won’t do this to you again.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.320
Chalerm!

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.320
Come on?

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.440
That hurts.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.600
I'm sorry. Please come back to me.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.480
-You always say that.
-I'll do anything.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.320
Hello.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.120
<i>100 million Baht is within your reach.</i>

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.560
<i>Now it's time</i>
<i>to engage your brain a little.</i>

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.720
<i>You’ll need a partner</i>
<i>for the next challenge.</i>

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.960
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the number of this challenge?</i>

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.560
-Of course.
-<i>Good.</i>

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.080
<i>Then just look for something in the area</i>

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.160
<i>that has the number eight</i>
<i>associated with it.</i>

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.080
Then what?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.760
<i>Once you have found that number eight</i>
<i>on that particular person,</i>

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.360
<i>you must take the object with number eight</i>
<i>and knock them out with it.</i>

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.120
Why didn’t you just tell me that
in the first place?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.320
I'll be more then glad
to whack him with this chair.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.200
Why didn't you just say that?

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.520
<i>Well, that’s how the script was written.</i>

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.640
Chalerm!

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.320
Stop! Phuchit, what are you doing?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.440
Maew…

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.240
Chalerm! Chalerm!

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.520
That's it.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.480
Maew, let me expla--

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.520
Take this! Here!

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.080
Why the hell
do you keep getting up? I’m tired.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.120
-Maew, let me explain.
-Chalerm! Chalerm!

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.640
Chalerm!

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.760
Honey, don't die.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.800
Please, get up.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.600
Chalerm…

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.080
Please! Somebody please help us!

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.480
Chalerm, please don’t die, okay?

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.040
What are you going to do to him?

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.200
Chalerm… Chalerm…

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.360
VACANT

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.280
Please take this man to the hospital.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.520
I don't think so. He’ll stain my seats.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.680
Forget it.
He'll get blood all over my car.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.480
Get the hell out, then!

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.680
Maew, get him in the car.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.360
-Come out.
-What are you doing? Hey!

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.360
Why are you punching me?

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.240
Why did you punch me? Ouch!

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.400
Help! This asshole is hi-jacking my car.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.080
Anybody! Help! He's taking my car.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.360
The office is closing.

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.280
<i>It's an orange taxi.</i>

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.560
<i>And what about the assailant?</i>

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.360
<i>He's a guy dressed like an office worker.</i>

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.800
<i>His clothes are filthy</i>
<i>and he's wearing glasses.</i>

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.560
<i>Okay, we are coordinating activities</i>
<i>with Pol. Col. Surachai Tantiwiirakul,</i>

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.680
<i>who is overseeing this case.</i>

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.320
<i>It's believed that this case</i>

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.200
<i>is related to an incident</i>
<i>that happened at 11am this morning.</i>

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.160
Chalerm, you’ll be okay.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.400
You asshole, why did you do that?

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.280
What if he dies? What will you do then?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.680
Maew, show me some respect.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.080
Why? Do you think
you’re some kind of saint?

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.960
Look what he did to you!

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.320
Am I supposed to ignore that he beats you?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.680
I'm may be an asshole,
but did I ever beat you like he did?

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.120
Please help him.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.560
Help him, please.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.520
Chalerm, Chalerm.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.080
We're here, Chalerm.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.040
<i>At this time we have new developments</i>

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.200
<i>in a case which is hitting the headlines.</i>

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.120
<i>Police are currently on the look-out</i>
<i>for Mr. Phuchit Puengnathong,</i>

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.280
<i>a member of staff at Sahamongkol Music.</i>

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.600
Why are you doing this?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.360
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You’ve made it to level nine.</i>

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.320
<i>This next level is a cinch.</i>

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.160
<i>You must find our assistant,</i>
<i>who is somewhere in this hospital and--</i>

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.320
Look, this has gotten out of hand.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.240
<i>If you are caught, then the game is over.</i>

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.360
<i>If you are able to find our assistant,</i>

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.520
<i>not only will you have</i>
<i>an important tool for playing level ten,</i>

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.160
<i>but you will also receive 10 million Baht.</i>

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.120
<i>From here on, every three minutes,</i>

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.600
<i>we will send you a clue.</i>

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.760
Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.760
<i>How’s that?</i>
<i>If you’re ready then let’s get started,</i>

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.280
<i>to listen again, please press 1.</i>

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.680
<i>Spread out</i>
<i>and block the exits of the hospital.</i>

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.280
<i>Be careful, the suspect</i>
<i>may try to take patients hostage.</i>

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.760
<i>The first clue word is "eight". Press 1…</i>

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.360
Hey! Quickly! Catch him!

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.280
Hey! Follow him!

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.400
Quick! Get him!

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.560
Hey! Stop!

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.080
Spread out
and search every inch of this place.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.520
Let's go. You, come with me.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.360
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.640
It-- It's a zombie!

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.160
<i>The next clue word is "zero".</i>

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.360
What the hell is going on?

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.280
We can never have
too many officers on this guy.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.600
<i>We won’t have enough police</i>
<i>for other cases, Surachai.</i>

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.080
<i>Aren't you overreacting a bit?</i>

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.760
Sir, I’m positive
that the capture of Mr. Phuchit

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.120
will lead us to solving
a far more significant case.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.720
Do you have evidence to back this up?

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.680
Of course, sir.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.400
Fine. I'll give you some leeway.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.000
-Hello?
-<i>Your last clue word</i>

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.520
-<i>is "five". To listen again, press 1.</i>
-Five?

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.440
Five. That’s it?

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.840
805. 805.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.680
What happened?

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.720
Hey!

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.960
Don't be afraid. Just tell me everything.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.040
Tell everyone to be ready.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.760
The suspect has got to be nearby.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.280
Sir.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.720
Telephone, sir.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.720
Yes, sir.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.000
Hey, there. Where are you off to?

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.640
My nephew has come to pick me up.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.560
Be careful,

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.280
there is a criminal on the loose.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.320
Take good care of her, buddy?

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.080
Call off the search.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.640
Yes, sir.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.280
Tum, let me borrow your car.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.280
Where are you going?

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.160
To look for a friend. I’ll be right back.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.640
Okay, but be quick.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.280
And watch out,
because your stupid dog got out.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.360
Why didn't you go after him?

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.680
No. Mom says he's an animal.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.720
He’s just looking for a mate.
He’ll be back when he’s done.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
What are you looking at?
The car keys are over there.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.120
<i>It's not difficult.</i>

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.480
<i>Just do what the old woman wants.</i>
<i>That’s it.</i>

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.160
No one else is going to get hurt, right?

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.080
<i>Not at all. The old woman</i>
<i>is not the violent type.</i>

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.120
Then it's dark, then it's blurry,
then it's bright.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.120
Then it's bright.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.120
Grandma.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.400
Wow, the stars in the sky…

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.160
So where is this hut
you keep talking about?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.760
…are so pretty.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.080
Granny.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.360
Why did you leave
the clothes out like this?

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.320
They're soaked from the rain.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.680
The least you can do is
put them away before you leave.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.560
I'm going to bash
your head in when I see you.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.280
All wet!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.080
Where did you run off to, Keaw?

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.240
Where are you tonight?

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.320
Come back, you little harlot!

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.520
Stop!

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.160
Stop, now!

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.120
Stop!

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.560
Stop, now!

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360
Please! Don't!

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.800
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You passed challenge number ten.</i>

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.120
<i>You've won a bonus prize</i>

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.480
<i>of two return tickets</i>
<i>to any country you choose.</i>

01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.560
<i>And a cash total of--</i>

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.000
Are you even human, you little shit?

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.680
Chit!

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.240
What have you done?

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.800
How could you do this?

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.800
For money? Is that why you did it?

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.680
Chit, please stop. Turn yourself in.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.160
What’s wrong with you? Talk to me?

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.200
We can go to the police
and explain everything.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.240
They'll understand.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.680
I know about this game
you’re playing. I can help you.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:17.480
I can help you.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.360
What's wrong with you?

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.000
How do you use this thing?

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.200
Chit, don’t answer it.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.200
<i>We’re so sorry, Chit.</i>

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.280
<i>The game ends here.</i>
<i>You have broken rule number two.</i>

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.480
<i>However,</i>

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.080
<i>we held a vote and our viewers</i>
<i>would like to see you continue.</i>

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.040
<i>We will give you another chance.</i>

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:16.360
<i>If you pass, you'll be allowed</i>
<i>to continue with challenges 12 and 13.</i>

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.480
Don’t tell me…

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.280
<i>To your right is the obstacle</i>
<i>that may bring your game to an end.</i>

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.480
<i>And in front of you…</i>

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.680
Poi.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.240
Poi.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.360
Come here, boy.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.200
<i>Amongst the corpses,</i>
<i>you will find a Samurai sword.</i>

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.560
<i>It’s yours now.</i>

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.360
<i>Solving the 11th challenge</i>
<i>is worth 40 million Baht.</i>

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.440
<i>Now you have a choice to make.</i>

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.800
-<i>Kill the woman…</i>
-What are you doing? Don't do it!

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.960
<i>to keep her</i>
<i>from interfering with your game.</i>

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.520
<i>Or two.</i>

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.640
<i>Kill her dog</i>

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.680
<i>as a warning,</i>
<i>so she'll keep her nose out of the game.</i>

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.360
<i>Choose wisely.</i>

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.640
<i>You'll be allowed to continue</i>
<i>regardless of your choice.</i>

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.680
<i>However, if you do not choose one,</i>

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.280
<i>the game will end here.</i>

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.400
<i>Do you know what that will make you?</i>

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.000
<i>A murderer!</i>

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.760
-Poi, come here boy.
-<i>Think it over.</i>

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.120
-<i>Make the right decision and you'll be…</i>
-Poi…

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.320
<i>…free and wealthy.</i>

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.800
<i>You are just three challenges away.</i>

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
<i>All right, when you’re ready,</i>
<i>then pick up the sword.</i>

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.480
Poi, come here, boy.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.040
Poi!

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.400
Poi, get over here!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.760
Poi, get your ass over here!

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.000
Poi!

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.560
Bitch, get the hell out of here
and stop bothering me.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.680
See. Your dog is dead
and it's because you got nosey.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.680
You asshole! I will stop you.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.760
I’ll make sure
you’re locked up for good, prick!

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.000
Hello?

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.800
<i>That wasn’t a wise choice.</i>
<i>Why didn't you get rid of the problem?</i>

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.160
Because I’m still human.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.600
<i>Are you sure?</i>

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.360
<i>You now have 40 million Baht.</i>

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.400
<i>And you’re about to add</i>
<i>another 50 million in level 12.</i>

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.320
So, you're sure that

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.240
Mr. Chit was involved
in the clothesline incident?

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.000
Yes.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.400
And what were you doing at the scene?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.640
I went to where the website told me to go.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240
How can I put this?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280
The website was just a blank page.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.440
WE CANNOT FIND URL DATA…

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.400
I typed in the address just as you did.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.200
Then I googled Chit's name and everything,

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.240
but there's no such thing.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
They must have moved the site.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.720
Yes, sir.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.240
The injured man at the scene has died.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:52.520
That leaves you as the only witness
to testify that Phuchit was there.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.680
There was an old woman. She--

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.440
The report doesn’t mention anyone else.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.040
Is there anything else?

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.600
In that case, I’ll be on my way.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.560
He's always accusing me.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.280
He has something against me.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.040
Tell the truth, now, old man!

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.200
When did you do it? Did anyone see it?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.520
Tell the truth, Daeng!

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.080
How do you know it was me?

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.040
Because the damn thing
didn’t come from my village.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.640
This filth is from your village.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.240
I know you don't like me,

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.440
but you’ve got no right saying that.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.560
Dom has had the damn thing since the WWII,

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.560
but who would do such a thing?

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.640
What's going on?

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.440
The folks from Daeng’s village.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.280
They took a samurai sword
and slaughtered my cow.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.080
If that weren’t enough,
they cut out her guts.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.160
Damn psychos!

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.080
Yes, that's what they are.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.280
And where is your home?

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.680
Sorry if the boys
were a little rough with you.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.560
Please don’t be angry at me.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.520
Tong.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.200
You were the one who learned of us first,

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.720
so we naturally had to learn about you.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.640
And before I go any further,
we must thank you

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.160
for revealing a weak point.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.480
What’s all that?

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.560
As far as you know, it’s an online game.
A paid online reality game.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.160
You must pay like everyone else
if you wish to join.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.000
Don't just hack in!

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.560
You created this all on your own?

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.680
That’s right.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.520
But this is only one of many games.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.440
What do you mean?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
If you want to know, just keep watching.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.280
Who's that?

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.560
This has gone too far.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.320
Do you know how many people
this game has hurt?

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.080
Of course.

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.080
Then why do you do it?

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:05.600
Don’t lose your cool.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:09.280
It's just a game to all those who can win.

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.240
How can you screw with people’s lives?

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.400
It's not me.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.160
Those who play this game
make their own choices.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.680
That is against the law.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.760
The law?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.120
Don’t worry. We own the law.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.080
Stop this right now!

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.240
I told you already. I can't.

01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.320
Now, I'm just
a single component of the game.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.760

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.240
WE'RE DOWN TO THE LAST CHALLENGE

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.560
What are you doing?

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:48.040
I had to put him to sleep. He had rabies.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.720
What are you doing to him?

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.000
Why do we bother to keep him around?

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.160
Why did you want to
hurt your dad like that?

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.360
He beats you, Mom. He beats me.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.720
I want to kill him.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.040
Don’t think like that.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.280
Why not? He’s never given you anything.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.280
Why are you protecting him?

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.680
He's given me plenty, son.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.080
Like what?

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.720
He gave me you.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.160
It would destroy me if you turned bad.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.000
Don't disappoint me, please.

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.520
To see you grow into a responsible adult,

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:30.400
would be the greatest thing in my life.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:53.840
I can’t do it. I give up.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.440
He didn’t lose. It’s you who lost.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.360
Don’t think too much of it.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:06.360
The world of reality
is behind me. Take a look.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.320
People today hide behind morality.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.080
It's just a big mask.

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.560
That's far scarier
than anything you've witnessed here.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:36.040
Because we never know
when they'll drop their masks.

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.200
Maybe if it were you,

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.560
you might had done a better job than Chit.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:45.720
You bastard!

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.440
Mr. Kie.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.760
Let go of me!

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.160
You asshole!

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:55.520
You little shit!

01:43:58.440 --> 01:43:59.640
You bastard!

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.400
Murderer!

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.000
I didn’t kill him.

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.400
We did it together.

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.320
Let me go!
