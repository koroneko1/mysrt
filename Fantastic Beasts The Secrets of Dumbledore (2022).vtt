00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210
<c.yellow>- Thank you.
- Would you like something else?</c>

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.260
<c.yellow>No. No, no, not just yet. I'm waiting.
.</c>

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.640
<c.yellow>I'm expecting someone.
.</c>

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.350
<c.yellow>Would this be one of your regular haunts?
.</c>

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020
<c.yellow>I don't have any regular haunts.
.</c>

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.870
<c.yellow>Let me see it.
.</c>

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.840
<c.yellow>Sometimes I imagine
I still feel it around my neck.
.</c>

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.550
<c.yellow>I carried it for so many years.
.</c>

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.050
<c.yellow>How does it feel around yours?
.</c>

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.060
<c.yellow>We can free each other of it.
.</c>

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.730
<c.yellow>Love to chatter, don't they,
our Muggle friends.
.</c>

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.230
<c.yellow>Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.
.</c>

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.150
<c.yellow>What you're doing is madness.
.</c>

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.570
<c.yellow>It's what we said we'd do.
.</c>

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.870
<c.yellow>- I was young. I was...
.
- Committed.
.</c>

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.330
<c.yellow>To me.
.</c>

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.940
<c.yellow>To us.
.</c>

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.040
<c.yellow>No, I went along because...
.</c>

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080
<c.yellow>Because?
.</c>

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.120
<c.yellow>Because I was in love with you.
.</c>

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.030
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.430
<c.yellow>But that's not why you went along.
.</c>

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.940
<c.yellow>It was you who said
we could reshape the world.
.</c>

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770
<c.yellow>That it was our birthright.
.</c>

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.840
<c.yellow>Can you smell it? The stench.
.</c>

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.050
<c.yellow>Do you really intend
to turn your back on your own kind?
.</c>

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.010
<c.yellow>For these animals?
.</c>

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.100
<c.yellow>With or without you,
I'll burn down their world, Albus.
.</c>

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.020
<c.yellow>There's nothing you can do to stop me.
.</c>

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.030
<c.yellow>Enjoy your cup of tea.
.</c>

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.350
<c.yellow>She's ready.
.</c>

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.870
<c.yellow>Beautiful.
.</c>

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.620
<c.yellow>All right, you two.
.</c>

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.630
<c.yellow>Now, the tricky bit.
.</c>

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.410
<c.yellow><i>Accio.</i>
.</c>

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.350
<c.yellow>I'm so sorry.
.</c>

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.210
<c.yellow>Twins.
.</c>

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.270
<c.yellow>You had twins.
.</c>

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.710
<c.yellow>Leave us.
.</c>

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.590
<c.yellow>Show me.
.</c>

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.100
<c.yellow>The others, they said it was special.
.</c>

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.640
<c.yellow>It's beyond special.
.</c>

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880
<c.yellow>See?
.</c>

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.270
<c.yellow>See its eyes?
.</c>

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
<c.yellow>Those eyes see everything.
.</c>

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.520
<c.yellow>When a Qilin is born, a righteous leader
will rise to change our world forever.
.</c>

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.040
<c.yellow>Her birth brings change,
Credence, to everything.
.</c>

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.460
<c.yellow>You did well.
.</c>

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.260
<c.yellow>Go.
.</c>

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.610
<c.yellow>Rest.
.</c>

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.570
<c.yellow>There.
.</c>

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.500
<c.yellow>There.
.</c>

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.560
<c.yellow>I don't suppose you'd like to tell me
what this is about, would you?
.</c>

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.730
<c.yellow>He just asked that we meet,
and that I be sure to bring you.
.</c>

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.100
<c.yellow>Right.
.</c>

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.410
<c.yellow>Here to meet my brother, I expect.
.</c>

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.460
<c.yellow>No, sir.
.
We're here to see Albus Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.260
<c.yellow>That would be my brother.
.</c>

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.760
<c.yellow>Sorry. Brilliant.
.</c>

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.720
<c.yellow>I'm Newt Scamander,
and this is Theseus...
.</c>

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.260
<c.yellow>Up the stairs. First on the left.
.</c>

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.260
<c.yellow><i>Has Newt told you why you're here?</i>
.</c>

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.700
<c.yellow>Was he meant to?
.</c>

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.700
<c.yellow>No. As a matter of fact.
.</c>

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.120
<c.yellow>There's something that we... That
Dumbledore wishes to speak to you about.
.</c>

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.130
<c.yellow>It's a proposal.
.</c>

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.090
<c.yellow>All right.
.</c>

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.950
<c.yellow>You know what this is, of course.
.</c>

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.260
<c.yellow>Newt had it in Paris.
.</c>

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.930
<c.yellow>I can't say I have much
experience with such things...
.</c>

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.890
<c.yellow>but it looks to me to be a blood troth.
.</c>

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.600
<c.yellow>That would be correct.
.</c>

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.310
<c.yellow>And whose blood is contained within?
.</c>

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.370
<c.yellow>Mine.
.</c>

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.570
<c.yellow>And Grindelwald's.
.</c>

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.690
<c.yellow>I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?
.</c>

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.790
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.830
<c.yellow>Nor he against me.
.</c>

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.420
<c.yellow>Can I ask, what would possess you
to make such a thing?
.</c>

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.900
<c.yellow>Love.
.</c>

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.300
<c.yellow>Arrogance. Naivete. Pick your poison.
.</c>

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.180
<c.yellow>We were young,
we were going to transform the world.
.</c>

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.020
<c.yellow>This ensured that we would,
even if one of us had a change of heart.
.</c>

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.770
<c.yellow>And what would happen
if you were to fight him?
.</c>

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.820
<c.yellow>It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.
.</c>

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.910
<c.yellow>Were I to even think about defying it...
.</c>

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.550
<c.yellow>It knows, you see.
.</c>

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.730
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.020
<c.yellow>It senses the betrayal in my heart.
.</c>

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.440
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.130
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.420
<c.yellow>That would be the least of it.
.</c>

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.840
<c.yellow>Young man's magic,
but as you can see...
.</c>

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.550
<c.yellow>powerful magic.
.</c>

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.980
<c.yellow>It can't be undone.
.</c>

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.440
<c.yellow>So this proposal, I take it
the Qilin has something to do with it?
.</c>

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.200
<c.yellow>He promises he won't tell a soul.
.</c>

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.410
<c.yellow>If we're to defeat him...
.</c>

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.740
<c.yellow>the Qilin's only part of it.
.</c>

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.920
<c.yellow>The world as we know it is coming undone.
.</c>

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.840
<c.yellow>Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.
.</c>

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800
<c.yellow>Things that seem unimaginable today
will seem inevitable tomorrow...
.</c>

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.970
<c.yellow>if we don't stop him.
.</c>

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.270
<c.yellow>Should you agree to do what I ask...
.</c>

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.060
<c.yellow>you'll have to trust me.
.</c>

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.570
<c.yellow>Even when every instinct tells you not to.
.</c>

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.830
<c.yellow>Let's hear it.
.</c>

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.570
<c.yellow>Does he send you to spy on me?
.</c>

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.940
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.280
<c.yellow>But he asks.
.</c>

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.620
<c.yellow>What ya thinkin', what ya feeling.
.</c>

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.950
<c.yellow>And the others?
.</c>

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.040
<c.yellow>Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?
.</c>

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.660
<c.yellow>Yes, but it's mostly you.
.</c>

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.040
<c.yellow>And do you tell him?
.</c>

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:06.710
<c.yellow>You do.
.</c>

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.300
<c.yellow>Who's reading whose mind now?
.</c>

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.390
<c.yellow>Tell me what you see.
.</c>

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.940
<c.yellow>You're a Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.780
<c.yellow>It's an important family.
.</c>

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.610
<c.yellow>You know this because he's told you.
.</c>

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.740
<c.yellow>He's also told you they abandoned you.
.</c>

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.040
<c.yellow>That you were a dirty secret.
.</c>

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.250
<c.yellow>He says Dumbledore abandoned him too,
and he knows how you feel.
.</c>

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.380
<c.yellow>And for that reason...
.</c>

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.130
<c.yellow>he's asked you to kill him.
.</c>

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.850
<c.yellow>I want you to go now, Queenie.
.</c>

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.440
<c.yellow>I don't tell him.
.</c>

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.110
<c.yellow>Not always.
.</c>

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.990
<c.yellow>Not everything.
.</c>

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.970
<c.yellow>Hey, we're...
.</c>

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.480
<c.yellow>Queenie.
.</c>

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.060
<c.yellow>Hi, sweetie.
.</c>

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.950
<c.yellow>Honey...
.</c>

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.490
<c.yellow>look at your bakery.
.</c>

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.620
<c.yellow>It's like a ghost town.
.</c>

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.500
<c.yellow>Yeah, well, I missed you.
.</c>

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.290
<c.yellow>Oh, baby.
.</c>

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.080
<c.yellow>Why don't you come here?
.</c>

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.460
<c.yellow>Come here.
.</c>

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.000
<c.yellow>Hey.
.</c>

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.390
<c.yellow>Everything's gonna be all right.
.</c>

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.730
<c.yellow>Everything's gonna be just fine.
.</c>

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.840
<c.yellow>Hey, sweetheart, what brings you downtown?
.</c>

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.520
<c.yellow>I really hope you didn't spend all day
coming up with that.
.</c>

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.400
<c.yellow>You want scary, is that what you want?
.</c>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.780
<c.yellow>You know what it is,
you just aren't menacing enough.
.</c>

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.240
<c.yellow>I think I'm plenty menacing.
.</c>

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.120
<c.yellow>Am I not menacing?
.</c>

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.120
<c.yellow>Maybe if you waved your arms around,
you know, like a crazy man...
.</c>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.750
<c.yellow>then you'd appear more menacing.
.</c>

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.630
<c.yellow>That's good. A little more.
.</c>

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.260
<c.yellow>A little more.
.</c>

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.140
<c.yellow>Keep going. Perfect.
.</c>

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.770
<c.yellow>Three, two, one.
.</c>

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.030
<c.yellow>Hey!
.</c>

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.730
<c.yellow>That's enough. Get outta here.
.</c>

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.650
<c.yellow>What's on your mind, baker boy?
.</c>

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.900
<c.yellow>Jeez.
.</c>

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.650
<c.yellow>You should be ashamed of yourselves.
.</c>

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:40.940
<c.yellow>Well, we're not.
.</c>

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.410
<c.yellow>It's a lady.
.</c>

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.820
<c.yellow>I tell you what...
.</c>

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.640
<c.yellow>I'll give you the first shot.
.
Go ahead.
.</c>

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.700
<c.yellow>You sure?
.</c>

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.040
<c.yellow>Oh, boy.
.</c>

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.340
<c.yellow>Last time I ever help that woman out again.
.</c>

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.620
<c.yellow>Lally!
.</c>

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.340
<c.yellow>Whoopsie, Frank.
Sometimes I forget my own strength.
.</c>

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.760
<c.yellow>I'll take it from here.
Thank you!</c>

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060
<c.yellow>Welcome.
.</c>

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.100
<c.yellow>- Catch you later, Lally.
- Bye, Stanley.
.</c>

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.270
<c.yellow>I'll be over for a game
of Befudler Dudley soon.
.</c>

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.310
<c.yellow>All right.
.</c>

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.400
<c.yellow>That's my cousin Stanley. He's a wizard.
.</c>

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.650
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.070
<c.yellow>Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.
.</c>

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.710
<c.yellow>I said I wanted out, and I want out.
.</c>

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.740
<c.yellow>Come now, Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.240
<c.yellow>Can't believe my therapist said
you wizards don't exist.
.</c>

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.580
<c.yellow>What a waste of money!
.</c>

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.040
<c.yellow>You do know I'm a witch, right?
.</c>

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.820
<c.yellow>Yeah.
.</c>

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.120
<c.yellow>Look, you seem
like a really nice witch.
.</c>

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.310
<c.yellow>You don't know what
I've been through with you people.
.</c>

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.710
<c.yellow>So, could you please get out of my life?
.</c>

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.840
<c.yellow>- A little over a year ago...
.
- Oh, my...
.</c>

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.740
<c.yellow>in the hopes of securing
a small business loan...
.</c>

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.740
<c.yellow>you walked through the doors
of the Steen National Bank...
.</c>

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.060
<c.yellow>located about six blocks from here.
.</c>

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.950
<c.yellow>You then made the acquaintance
of Newt Scamander...
.</c>

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.480
<c.yellow>the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.
.</c>

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.530
<c.yellow>You then learned of a world
you had previously been wholly unaware of.
.</c>

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.300
<c.yellow>You met and fell in love
with a witch named Queenie Goldstein...
.</c>

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.780
<c.yellow>had your brain wiped by means
of Obliviation, only it didn't take.
.</c>

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.450
<c.yellow>And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who...
.</c>

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.160
<c.yellow>after your refusal to marry her...
.</c>

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.910
<c.yellow>decided to join Gellert Grindelwald
and his dark army of followers...
.</c>

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.170
<c.yellow>who pose the single greatest threat to
both your world and ours in four centuries.
.</c>

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.880
<c.yellow>How did I do?
.</c>

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.460
<c.yellow>That was good.
.</c>

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.720
<c.yellow>Except for the part about Queenie
going over to the dark side.
.</c>

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.430
<c.yellow>I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo.
.</c>

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.080
<c.yellow>But she's got a heart
bigger than this whole crazy island...
.</c>

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.060
<c.yellow>and she's so smart, you know?
.</c>

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.080
<c.yellow>She can legitimately
read your brain, you know...
.</c>

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.140
<c.yellow>she's a whatchamacallit...
.</c>

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.150
<c.yellow>- A Legilimens.
.
- Yeah.
.</c>

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.110
<c.yellow>Look...
.</c>

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.740
<c.yellow>You see this?
.</c>

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.290
<c.yellow>You see the pan?
.
That's me, I'm the pan.
.</c>

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.620
<c.yellow>I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
.
I'm just a schmo.
.</c>

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.560
<c.yellow>I don't know what kind of crazy ideas
you have in your head there, lady...
.</c>

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.750
<c.yellow>but I'm sure as hell
you could do a lot better than me.
.</c>

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.130
<c.yellow>Goodbye.
.</c>

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.550
<c.yellow>I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.350
<c.yellow>You could have ducked under the counter,
but you didn't.
.</c>

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.640
<c.yellow>You could have looked the other way,
but you didn't.
.</c>

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.770
<c.yellow>In fact, you were willing to put yourself
in danger to save a perfect stranger.
.</c>

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.030
<c.yellow>Seems to me you're just the kind
of average Joe the world needs right now.
.</c>

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.360
<c.yellow>You just don't know it yet.
.</c>

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.780
<c.yellow>That's why I had to show you.
.</c>

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.410
<c.yellow>We need you, Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.630
<c.yellow>All right.
.</c>

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.670
<c.yellow>Call me Jacob.
.</c>

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.050
<c.yellow>- Call me Lally.
.
- Lally.
.</c>

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.380
<c.yellow>I gotta lock up.
.</c>

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.140
<c.yellow>Thanks.
.</c>

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.640
<c.yellow>Much better, Jacob.
.</c>

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.190
<c.yellow>I believe you know how this works, Jacob.
.</c>

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.340
<c.yellow>What did they say at the Ministry?
.</c>

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.840
<c.yellow>Liu or Santos?
.</c>

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.630
<c.yellow>Officially, the Ministry takes no position.
.</c>

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.140
<c.yellow>Unofficially, smart money's on Santos.
.</c>

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.430
<c.yellow>Although anyone would be better than Vogel.
.</c>

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.810
<c.yellow>Anyone?
.</c>

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.650
<c.yellow>I don't believe he's on the ballot, Kama.
.</c>

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.900
<c.yellow>He also happens to be a fugitive.
.</c>

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.490
<c.yellow>Is there a difference?
.</c>

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.320
<c.yellow>Spinning! Always with the spinning.
.</c>

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.620
<c.yellow>Jacob.
.</c>

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.080
<c.yellow>Welcome. You brilliant man.
.</c>

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.450
<c.yellow>Sorry.
.</c>

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.250
<c.yellow>I was absolutely sure
that Professor Hicks would convince you.
.</c>

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.790
<c.yellow>Yeah.
.</c>

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.210
<c.yellow>You know me, pal.
.
I can't pass up a good Portkey.
.</c>

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.260
<c.yellow>Mr. Scamander.
.</c>

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.970
<c.yellow>Professor Hicks.
.</c>

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.210
<c.yellow>- At long last.
.
- At long last.
.</c>

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.470
<c.yellow>So, Professor Hicks and I,
we've corresponded for many years...
.</c>

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.880
<c.yellow>but we've never actually met.
.</c>

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.270
<c.yellow>So, her book on advanced charm casting
is a must-read.
.</c>

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.730
<c.yellow>Newt is far too kind.
.</c>

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.850
<c.yellow><i>Fantastic Beasts</i> is required reading
for all my fifth years.
.</c>

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.320
<c.yellow>Now, let me make some introductions.
.</c>

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.400
<c.yellow>So, this is Bunty Broadacre...
.</c>

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.110
<c.yellow>my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.
.</c>

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.530
<c.yellow>Eight. Years.
.</c>

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.990
<c.yellow>And 164 days.
.</c>

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.660
<c.yellow>As you can see, indispensable.
.</c>

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:01.000
<c.yellow>And this is...
.</c>

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.040
<c.yellow>Yusuf Kama.
.</c>

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.420
<c.yellow>Pleasure.
.</c>

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.090
<c.yellow>And you, obviously,
already made Jacob's acquaintance.
.</c>

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760
<c.yellow>Newt.
.</c>

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.430
<c.yellow>So, this is my brother, Theseus...
.</c>

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.720
<c.yellow>and he works for the Ministry.
.</c>

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.180
<c.yellow>Actually, head of the British Auror Office.
.</c>

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.810
<c.yellow>Well, I'll have to ensure
my wand registration's up-to-date.
.</c>

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.790
<c.yellow>Although, strictly speaking,
that doesn't fall within my purview.
.</c>

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.380
<c.yellow>All right then.
.</c>

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.880
<c.yellow>Well, I imagine that you're all
wondering why you find yourselves here.
.</c>

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.220
<c.yellow>And in anticipation of that,
Dumbledore asked that I convey a message.
.</c>

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.560
<c.yellow>So, Grindelwald has the ability
to see snatches of the future.
.</c>

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:08.810
<c.yellow>So, we have to assume that he'll be able
to anticipate what we do before we do it.
.</c>

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.030
<c.yellow>So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world...
.</c>

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.820
<c.yellow>to save your world, Jacob...
.</c>

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.620
<c.yellow>then our best hope
is to confuse him.
.</c>

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580
<c.yellow>'Scuse me.
.</c>

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.960
<c.yellow>I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?
.</c>

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.790
<c.yellow>Countersight.
.</c>

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.500
<c.yellow>Exactly.
.</c>

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.300
<c.yellow>The best plan being no plan.
.</c>

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.090
<c.yellow>Or, many overlapping plans.
.</c>

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.630
<c.yellow>Thus, confusion.
.</c>

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.090
<c.yellow>It's working on me right now.
.</c>

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.760
<c.yellow>In fact, Dumbledore asked that
I give you something, Jacob.
.</c>

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.070
<c.yellow>It's snake wood.
.</c>

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.820
<c.yellow>It's somewhat rare.
.</c>

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.900
<c.yellow>Are you kiddin' me right now?
.</c>

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200
<c.yellow>Is this thing real?
.</c>

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.640
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.740
<c.yellow>Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.
.</c>

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.700
<c.yellow>It's sorta real?
.</c>

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.710
<c.yellow>More importantly,
where we're going, you'll need it.
.</c>

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.550
<c.yellow>Now, there's something for you too,
I think, Theseus.
.</c>

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.800
<c.yellow>Teddy, please let go now.
.</c>

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.180
<c.yellow>Teddy, please let go.
.</c>

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.600
<c.yellow>No. Teddy, will you behave?
.</c>

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.350
<c.yellow>This is Theseus's...
.</c>

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.610
<c.yellow>That's...
.</c>

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.230
<c.yellow>Well, of course.
.</c>

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.360
<c.yellow>Now everything makes sense.
.</c>

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.110
<c.yellow>Lally, I believe you were given
some reading material?
.</c>

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.370
<c.yellow>You know what they say.
.</c>

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.500
<c.yellow>A book can take you around
the world and back...
.</c>

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.030
<c.yellow>all you have to do is open it.
.</c>

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.290
<c.yellow>She ain't kiddin'.
.</c>

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.250
<c.yellow>Yes, Bunty...
.</c>

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.920
<c.yellow>that's for you.
.</c>

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.040
<c.yellow>I was told it was for your eyes only.
.</c>

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.970
<c.yellow>And, Kama.
.</c>

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.060
<c.yellow>I have what I need.
.</c>

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.860
<c.yellow>What about Tina? Is Tina coming?
.</c>

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.650
<c.yellow>Tina's not available.
.</c>

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.360
<c.yellow>Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...
.</c>

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.450
<c.yellow>well, from what I understand.
.</c>

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.240
<c.yellow>Tina's been made head
of the American Auror Office.
.</c>

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.620
<c.yellow>We know each other well.
.
She's quite a remarkable woman.
.</c>

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.330
<c.yellow>She is.
.</c>

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.350
<c.yellow>So, this is the team
that's gonna take down...
.</c>

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.880
<c.yellow>the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.
.</c>

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.130
<c.yellow>A magizoologist, his indispensable
assistant, a schoolteacher...
.</c>

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.350
<c.yellow>a wizard descended from
a very old French family, and...
.</c>

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:50.100
<c.yellow>a Muggle baker with his fake wand.
.</c>

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.980
<c.yellow>Hey, we got you too, pal...
.</c>

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.650
<c.yellow>and his wand works.
.
I</c>

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.480
<c.yellow>Who wouldn't like our chances?
.</c>

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.180
<c.yellow>You're all right, little one.
.</c>

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.230
<c.yellow>Berlin.
.</c>

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.860
<c.yellow>Wonderful.
.</c>

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.240
<c.yellow>Kama...
.</c>

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:48.490
<c.yellow>stay safe.
.</c>

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.960
<c.yellow>I must be going too now, Newt.
.</c>

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.970
<c.yellow>No one can know everything...
.</c>

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.970
<c.yellow>not even you.
.</c>

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760
<c.yellow>Right.
.</c>

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.630
<c.yellow>Well, here it is.
.</c>

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.370
<c.yellow>German Ministry of Magic?
.</c>

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.570
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.580
<c.yellow>I take it we're here for a reason.
.</c>

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.090
<c.yellow>Yes, we have a tea ceremony to attend...
.</c>

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.470
<c.yellow>and if we don't hurry up, we'll be late.
.</c>

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.640
<c.yellow>Jacob, stay with the group.
.</c>

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.570
<c.yellow>Santos! Santos! Santos!
.</c>

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.900
<c.yellow>Santos! Santos! Santos!
.</c>

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.290
<c.yellow>Evening...
.</c>

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.830
<c.yellow>Helmut.
.</c>

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.170
<c.yellow>Theseus.
.</c>

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.840
<c.yellow>Hey, hey.
.</c>

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.590
<c.yellow>They're with me.
.</c>

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.980
<c.yellow>Santos! Santos! Santos!
.</c>

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.070
<c.yellow><i>Incendio.</i>
.</c>

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.470
<c.yellow>I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.
.</c>

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.730
<c.yellow>No, I have a message to deliver.
.</c>

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.230
<c.yellow>A message?
.</c>

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.520
<c.yellow>To who?
.</c>

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860
<c.yellow>Mr. Vogel, it's a pleasure to be here.
.</c>

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.360
<c.yellow>It's an honor to meet you.
.</c>

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.160
<c.yellow>You are joking.
.</c>

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.510
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.950
<c.yellow>What am I even doing here?
.
Let's go outside.
.</c>

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.790
<c.yellow>I'm not very good in these situations.
.</c>

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080
<c.yellow>These situations?
.</c>

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.500
<c.yellow>With all the people, the fancy people.
.</c>

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.130
<c.yellow>Hello.
.</c>

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.720
<c.yellow>I saw you enter the room...
.</c>

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.430
<c.yellow>and I thought to myself...
.</c>

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.890
<c.yellow>Edith, that's an interesting-looking man.
.</c>

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:39.890
<c.yellow>Jacob Kowalski.
.</c>

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.100
<c.yellow>How are you?
.
Very nice to meet you.
.</c>

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:45.140
<c.yellow>And where is it you
hail from, Mr. Kowalski?
.</c>

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560
<c.yellow>Queens.
.</c>

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.950
<c.yellow>Sorry, <i>Herr</i> Vogel.
.
Sorry, I wonder if I could have a word?
.</c>

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.370
<c.yellow>Merlin's beard, it's
Mr. Scamander, isn't it?
.</c>

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.200
<c.yellow><i>Herr</i> Vogel...
.</c>

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:09.210
<c.yellow>I have a message from a friend,
and it cannot wait.
.</c>

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.090
<c.yellow>Do what is right...
.</c>

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.470
<c.yellow>not what is easy.
.</c>

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.180
<c.yellow>He said it was important
that I reach you tonight...
.</c>

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.520
<c.yellow>that you hear them tonight, the words.
.</c>

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.560
<c.yellow>It's time, sir.
.</c>

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.530
<c.yellow>Is he here?
.</c>

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.450
<c.yellow>In Berlin?
.</c>

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.240
<c.yellow>No, of course not.
.</c>

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.830
<c.yellow>Why leave Hogwarts
when the world outside is burning?
.</c>

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:53.000
<c.yellow>I thank you, Mr. Scamander.
.</c>

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.710
<c.yellow>Thank you.
.</c>

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.130
<c.yellow>Thank you.
.</c>

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.260
<c.yellow>I see many familiar faces here tonight.
.</c>

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.090
<c.yellow>Colleagues, friends...
.</c>

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.440
<c.yellow>foes.
.</c>

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.850
<c.yellow>Within the next 48 hours...
.</c>

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.560
<c.yellow>you, along with the rest of
the Wizarding World...
.</c>

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.070
<c.yellow>will choose our next great leader.
.</c>

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.150
<c.yellow>A choice that will shape our lives
for generations to come.
.</c>

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.530
<c.yellow>I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph...
.</c>

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.030
<c.yellow>the Confederation will be in able hands.
.</c>

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:09.710
<c.yellow>Liu Tao.
.</c>

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.670
<c.yellow>Vicencia Santos.
.</c>

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.470
<c.yellow>Thank you, thank you.
.</c>

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.140
<c.yellow>It's in moments such as these
we are reminded...
.</c>

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:34.610
<c.yellow>that it is this peaceful transfer of power
which marks our humanity...
.</c>

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.690
<c.yellow>and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences...
.</c>

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.990
<c.yellow>all voices deserve to be heard...
.</c>

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.040
<c.yellow>even voices which many
may find disagreeable.
.</c>

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.870
<c.yellow>Newt.
.</c>

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.250
<c.yellow>Any of those lot look familiar to you?
.</c>

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.050
<c.yellow>Paris. The night that Leta...
.</c>

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.380
<c.yellow>They were with Grindelwald.
.</c>

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:20.480
<c.yellow>And so, after an extensive investigation...
.</c>

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.700
<c.yellow>the Confederation has concluded
that insufficient evidence exists...
.</c>

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.580
<c.yellow>to prosecute Gellert Grindelwald...
.</c>

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.170
<c.yellow>for the crimes against the Muggle community
of which he was accused.
.</c>

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:43.050
<c.yellow>He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.
.</c>

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.180
<c.yellow>Are you kidding me?
.</c>

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.140
<c.yellow>They're letting the guy off?
.</c>

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.970
<c.yellow>I was there, he was killing people.
.</c>

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.270
<c.yellow>You're under arrest.
.</c>

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.810
<c.yellow>All of you.
.</c>

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.360
<c.yellow>Wands down!
.</c>

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.870
<c.yellow>Theseus.
.</c>

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.450
<c.yellow>Theseus!
.</c>

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.790
<c.yellow>Newt, Newt. Not here.
.</c>

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.460
<c.yellow>Newt, we don't stand a chance.
.</c>

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.880
<c.yellow>Let's go. Newt...
.</c>

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.880
<c.yellow>they have the German Ministry.
.
We've got to go.
.</c>

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.090
<c.yellow>It ain't right. That's not justice.
.</c>

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.010
<c.yellow>"Extended investigation." I was there.
.</c>

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.890
<c.yellow>Were you there? Were you there?
.
I was there.
.</c>

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.640
<c.yellow>- You just let a killer off!
- Jacob.
.</c>

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.850
<c.yellow>We have to go. We have to go.
.</c>

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.890
<c.yellow>Jacob, let's go.
.</c>

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.930
<c.yellow>That's very good.
.</c>

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.720
<c.yellow>Her favorite.
.</c>

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.810
<c.yellow>Remember how she begged Mother to make it?
.</c>

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.360
<c.yellow>Ariana.
.</c>

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.810
<c.yellow>Mother claimed it calmed her,
but I think that was wishful thinking.
.</c>

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.160
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.040
<c.yellow>I was there.
.</c>

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.040
<c.yellow>I grew up in the same house.
.</c>

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.540
<c.yellow>Everything you saw, I saw.
.</c>

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.210
<c.yellow>Everything.
.</c>

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.980
<c.yellow>Read the sign, you stupid sod.
.</c>

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.950
<c.yellow>I'm sorry to disturb you, Albus.
.</c>

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.570
<c.yellow>Tell me, what is it?
.</c>

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.200
<c.yellow>It's Berlin.
.</c>

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.450
<c.yellow>What happened?
.</c>

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.660
<c.yellow>Vogel has absolved
Gellert of all his crimes.
.</c>

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.580
<c.yellow>He's free. He says there's no proof.
.</c>

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.970
<c.yellow>He tried to arrest aurors who were there
the night Leta Lestrange was murdered.
.</c>

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.520
<c.yellow>Rather disappointing.
.</c>

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:46.350
<c.yellow>I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.
.</c>

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.900
<c.yellow>Can I impose on you?
.</c>

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.650
<c.yellow>Of course.
.
And, Albus, please be...
.</c>

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:52.700
<c.yellow>I'll do my best.
.</c>

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.740
<c.yellow>Evening, Aberforth.
.</c>

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.200
<c.yellow>Evening, Minerva.
.</c>

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.540
<c.yellow>Apologies for calling you a stupid sod.
.</c>

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.370
<c.yellow>Apology accepted.
.</c>

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.800
<c.yellow>I'm afraid I'll have to
cut our evening short.
.</c>

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.800
<c.yellow>Off to save the world, are we?
.</c>

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.090
<c.yellow>That will take a better man than me.
.</c>

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.520
<c.yellow>Don't ask.
.</c>

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.270
<c.yellow>There are thousands in the streets
chanting your name.
.</c>

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.270
<c.yellow>You're a free man.
.</c>

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.900
<c.yellow>Tell the others to prepare to leave.
.</c>

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.490
<c.yellow>- Tonight?
.
- Tomorrow.
.</c>

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.410
<c.yellow>We'll have a visitor in the morning.
.</c>

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.500
<c.yellow>Why does it stay with him?
.</c>

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.830
<c.yellow>It must sense what he's about to do.
.</c>

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.170
<c.yellow>And you're sure...
.</c>

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.880
<c.yellow>that he can kill Dumbledore?
.</c>

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.680
<c.yellow>His pain is his power.
.</c>

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.810
<c.yellow>The man that I am inquiring about
is the head of the British Auror Office.
.</c>

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.020
<c.yellow>How can you have misplaced
the head of the British Auror Office?
.</c>

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.610
<c.yellow>As our contention said,
since he was never in our custody...
.</c>

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.990
<c.yellow>we never misplaced him.
.</c>

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.280
<c.yellow>Sir, there were dozens of people there,
any one of them could corroborate...
.</c>

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.120
<c.yellow>- And your name is?
.
- Let's get out of here.
.</c>

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.910
<c.yellow>Wait a minute, that's the guy.
.</c>

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.000
<c.yellow>Come here. Come here.
.</c>

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.290
<c.yellow>Excuse me!
.</c>

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.900
<c.yellow>That's the guy.
.
He knows where Theseus is.
.</c>

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.010
<c.yellow>Hello!
.</c>

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.840
<c.yellow>Where's Theseus?
.</c>

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.850
<c.yellow>That's him.
.
He knows about Theseus.
.</c>

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.490
<c.yellow>Newt.
.</c>

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.930
<c.yellow>Theseus has been taken to the Erkstag.
.</c>

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.440
<c.yellow>Wait, no,
but the Erkstag shut down years ago.
.</c>

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:15.270
<c.yellow>Yes, well, it's the Ministry's
secret little bed and breakfast now.
.</c>

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:17.990
<c.yellow>You'll need this to see him.
.</c>

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.490
<c.yellow>And one of these.
.</c>

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.450
<c.yellow>And this.
.</c>

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:29.790
<c.yellow>Wait, wait, wait.
.</c>

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.460
<c.yellow>I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?
.</c>

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.630
<c.yellow>Me? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.090
<c.yellow>It's a real pip.
.</c>

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.550
<c.yellow>I advise you to keep it close.
.</c>

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.300
<c.yellow>- Professor Hicks.
.
- Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.760
<c.yellow>Assuming you're not otherwise engaged,
and frankly even if you are...
.</c>

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.520
<c.yellow>I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.
.</c>

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.230
<c.yellow>Take Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.680
<c.yellow>I'm quite certain
there'll be an assassination attempt.
.</c>

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.730
<c.yellow>Anything you can do to scotch that
will be greatly appreciated.
.</c>

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:56.900
<c.yellow>It's my pleasure.
.</c>

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.350
<c.yellow>I shall welcome the challenge.
.</c>

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.900
<c.yellow>Besides, I'll have Jacob with me.
.</c>

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.740
<c.yellow>Not to worry.
.</c>

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.070
<c.yellow>Professor Hicks's
defensive magic is superb.
.</c>

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:08.160
<c.yellow>Until next time.
.</c>

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:09.870
<c.yellow>Such a flatterer.
.</c>

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.710
<c.yellow>Well, not really. It is superb.
.</c>

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.570
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.710
<c.yellow>I was just wondering...
.</c>

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.340
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.220
<c.yellow>- The case.
.
- Yes.
.</c>

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.220
<c.yellow>Rest assured, it's in safe hands.
.</c>

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.150
<c.yellow>Can I help you?
.</c>

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.370
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.320
<c.yellow>I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.
.</c>

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.950
<c.yellow>Certainly.
.</c>

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:52.710
<c.yellow>No, you mustn't open it.
.</c>

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.830
<c.yellow>I mean, it's not necessary.
.</c>

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:59.550
<c.yellow>The interior isn't important.
.</c>

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.970
<c.yellow>I see no reason I can't make you one.
.</c>

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.310
<c.yellow>If you leave it here.
.</c>

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.950
<c.yellow>No...
.</c>

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.360
<c.yellow>I couldn't leave it.
.</c>

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.900
<c.yellow>And I'll be needing more than one.
.</c>

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.410
<c.yellow>You see...
.</c>

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.910
<c.yellow>my husband, he's a bit absentminded.
.</c>

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.910
<c.yellow>He's always forgetting things.
.</c>

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.250
<c.yellow>Just the other day,
he forgot he was married to me.
.</c>

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:40.840
<c.yellow>Can you imagine?
.</c>

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.800
<c.yellow>But I love him.
.</c>

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.390
<c.yellow>Exactly how many were you thinking?
.</c>

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.350
<c.yellow>Half a dozen...
.</c>

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.140
<c.yellow>and I'll need them in two days' time.
.</c>

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.410
<c.yellow>Show your hands.
.</c>

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:13.990
<c.yellow>Who are you?
.</c>

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:16.660
<c.yellow>My name is Yusuf Kama.
.</c>

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.750
<c.yellow>Who's our visitor?
.</c>

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.250
<c.yellow>I'm an admirer.
.</c>

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.050
<c.yellow>You murdered his sister.
.</c>

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.840
<c.yellow>Her name was Leta.
.</c>

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.220
<c.yellow>Leta Lestrange.
.</c>

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.210
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.600
<c.yellow>You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.
.</c>

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.140
<c.yellow>Shared.
.</c>

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.140
<c.yellow>That's the only thing we shared.
.</c>

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.690
<c.yellow>Dumbledore sent you, am I right?
.</c>

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.780
<c.yellow>He fears you're in
possession of a creature.
.</c>

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.740
<c.yellow>He fears the use you may put it to.
.</c>

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.950
<c.yellow>He sent me here to spy on you.
.</c>

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.040
<c.yellow>What would you like me to tell him?
.</c>

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.000
<c.yellow>Queenie.
.</c>

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.460
<c.yellow>Is he telling the truth?
.</c>

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.520
<c.yellow>What else?
.</c>

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:19.440
<c.yellow>Even though he believes in you...
.</c>

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.350
<c.yellow>he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.
.</c>

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:26.320
<c.yellow>He carries her absence with him every day.
.</c>

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.320
<c.yellow>Every breath he takes
is a reminder that she breathes no more.
.</c>

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.620
<c.yellow>Then I presume you won't mind
if I relieve you of your sister's memory.
.</c>

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:43.250
<c.yellow>Right?
.</c>

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.590
<c.yellow>Right.
.</c>

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:08.610
<c.yellow>There.
.</c>

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.780
<c.yellow>Better?
.</c>

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:14.490
<c.yellow>I thought so.
.</c>

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.990
<c.yellow>When we allow ourselves to be consumed
by anger, the only victim is our self.
.</c>

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.170
<c.yellow>Now, we were just about to depart.
.</c>

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.170
<c.yellow>Perhaps you'd like to join us?
.</c>

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.170
<c.yellow>Come, we can talk some more
about our mutual friend, Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:41.310
<c.yellow>After you.
.</c>

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:10.770
<c.yellow>Hello, Credence.
.</c>

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.870
<c.yellow>Do you know what it's like to have no one?
.</c>

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.200
<c.yellow>To always be alone?
.</c>

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.790
<c.yellow>It's you.
.</c>

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:32.710
<c.yellow>You're the one sending messages
in the mirror.
.</c>

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:35.630
<c.yellow>I'm a Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.260
<c.yellow>You abandoned me.
.</c>

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:43.760
<c.yellow>The same blood that
runs my veins runs yours.
.</c>

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.400
<c.yellow>He's not here for you.
.</c>

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.280
<c.yellow>He's here for me.
.</c>

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:46.830
<c.yellow>Things are not quite
what they appear, Credence...
.</c>

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.960
<c.yellow>no matter what you've been told.
.</c>

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.670
<c.yellow>My name is Aurelius.
.</c>

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.210
<c.yellow>He's lied to you.
.</c>

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:57.000
<c.yellow>Kindled your hate.
.</c>

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.280
<c.yellow>What he's told you isn't true...
.</c>

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.650
<c.yellow>but we do share the same blood.
.</c>

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.620
<c.yellow>You are a Dumbledore.
.</c>

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.010
<c.yellow>I'm sorry for your pain.
.</c>

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.300
<c.yellow>We didn't know, I promise.
.</c>

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.430
<c.yellow>I've come to see my brother.
.</c>

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.560
<c.yellow>His name is Theseus Scamander.
.</c>

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.780
<c.yellow>Sorry, that's...
.</c>

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:39.280
<c.yellow>Wand.
.</c>

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.590
<c.yellow>That's...
.</c>

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.920
<c.yellow>I'm a magizoologist.
.</c>

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.090
<c.yellow>He's perfectly harmless.
.</c>

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.640
<c.yellow>He's just a pet, really.
.</c>

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.310
<c.yellow>Sorry.
.</c>

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:10.390
<c.yellow>That's Teddy.
.</c>

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.270
<c.yellow>He's a total nightmare, truth be told.
.</c>

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.900
<c.yellow>They stay here.
.</c>

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.840
<c.yellow>So, how will I know where to find him?
.</c>

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.880
<c.yellow>He's your brother?
.</c>

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.030
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.890
<c.yellow>He will be the one
who looks like your brother.
.</c>

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:50.930
<c.yellow>I will be back, Pick.
.</c>

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.640
<c.yellow>On my word.
.</c>

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.740
<c.yellow>"I'll be back, Pick."</c>

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:02.320
<c.yellow>"On my word."</c>

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.240
<c.yellow>And I'll be Minister of Magic one day.
.</c>

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.280
<c.yellow>Take us 'round the back.
.</c>

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.490
<c.yellow>It's not safe here.
.</c>

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.450
<c.yellow>Roll it down.
.</c>

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:53.910
<c.yellow>What?
.</c>

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.080
<c.yellow>The window.
.</c>

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:57.630
<c.yellow>Roll it down.
.</c>

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.890
<c.yellow>Grindelwald! Grindelwald!
.</c>

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.730
<c.yellow>No. No!
.</c>

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.740
<c.yellow><i>Those people...</i>
.</c>

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.200
<c.yellow>aren't suggesting we listen to them.
.</c>

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:32.370
<c.yellow>They aren't asking us to listen.
.</c>

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.370
<c.yellow>They're demanding it.
.</c>

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.880
<c.yellow>You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?
.</c>

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.210
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:42.500
<c.yellow>Yes, let him stand.
.</c>

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.510
<c.yellow>Gellert Grindelwald
wants a Muggle-wizard war...
.</c>

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.640
<c.yellow>and if he gets his wish,
he won't just destroy their world...
.</c>

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.100
<c.yellow>he'll destroy ours as well.
.</c>

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:55.140
<c.yellow>Which is why he cannot win.
.</c>

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:58.310
<c.yellow>Let him stand as a candidate.
.</c>

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.100
<c.yellow>Let the people vote.
.</c>

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.440
<c.yellow>When he loses, the people will have spoken.
.</c>

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.780
<c.yellow>But deny them their voices...
.</c>

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.570
<c.yellow>and those streets will run with blood.
.</c>

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:32.850
<c.yellow>Theseus.
.</c>

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.140
<c.yellow>Theseus.
.</c>

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:16.710
<c.yellow>Lally...
.</c>

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.920
<c.yellow>the guy with the hair...
.</c>

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.720
<c.yellow>sitting next to Edith.
.</c>

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:24.310
<c.yellow>He looks like he can kill somebody.
.</c>

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:27.930
<c.yellow>He also looks like my Uncle Dominic.
.</c>

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.690
<c.yellow>Is your Uncle Dominic
the Norwegian Minister of Magic?
.</c>

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.610
<c.yellow>Didn't think so.
.</c>

01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.050
<c.yellow>Queenie.
.</c>

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.390
<c.yellow>Queenie.
.</c>

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:20.450
<c.yellow>Madam Santos, a pleasure.
.</c>

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.610
<c.yellow>Your supporters are in fine voice.
.</c>

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.200
<c.yellow>As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.
.</c>

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.350
<c.yellow>Rescuing me, are you?
.</c>

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.020
<c.yellow>That's the general idea.
.</c>

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.940
<c.yellow>And I presume this...
.</c>

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:55.980
<c.yellow>whatever it is that you are doing,
is strategic.
.</c>

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.150
<c.yellow>Yes, a technique called limbic mimicry.
.</c>

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.690
<c.yellow>It discourages violent engagement,
theoretically.
.</c>

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.410
<c.yellow>I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.
.</c>

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:06.280
<c.yellow>And the results?
.</c>

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.200
<c.yellow>Inconclusive.
.</c>

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:11.220
<c.yellow>Course that was a laboratory setting...
.</c>

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.540
<c.yellow>and the conditions were
strictly controlled, and the...
.</c>

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.600
<c.yellow>Well, the current conditions
are more volatile...
.</c>

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:17.690
<c.yellow>so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.
.</c>

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:19.880
<c.yellow>The ultimate outcome presumably...
.</c>

01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:25.050
<c.yellow>being our survival.
.</c>

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.530
<c.yellow>Well done, come on.
.</c>

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.630
<c.yellow>And the plan is?
.</c>

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.960
<c.yellow>Hold this.
.</c>

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.770
<c.yellow>What the bloody hell was that for?
.</c>

01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.150
<c.yellow>We're gonna need some help.
.</c>

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.280
<c.yellow>Follow me.
.</c>

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:07.330
<c.yellow>Come on.
.</c>

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:18.680
<c.yellow>You're no swiveling properly.
.</c>

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300
<c.yellow>Swivel...
.</c>

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.430
<c.yellow>swivel, but delicately.
.</c>

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.100
<c.yellow>I'm swiveling like you're swiveling, Newt.
.</c>

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:27.310
<c.yellow>I don't believe you are.
.</c>

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:47.750
<c.yellow>Swivel.
.</c>

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.220
<c.yellow>Go to him.
.</c>

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:11.770
<c.yellow>Queenie.
.</c>

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.740
<c.yellow>Tell him it's all right.
.</c>

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.110
<c.yellow>I can see he's failed.
.</c>

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.610
<c.yellow>He'll have another chance.
.</c>

01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:26.740
<c.yellow>It's his loyalty I most value.
.</c>

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.570
<c.yellow>Stay here.
.</c>

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.300
<c.yellow>Apologies.
.</c>

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.150
<c.yellow>Oh, boy.
.</c>

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.210
<c.yellow>Let her go.
.</c>

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880
<c.yellow>Excuse me?
.</c>

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:06.550
<c.yellow>Assassin!
.</c>

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:18.890
<c.yellow>No, wait.
.</c>

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900
<c.yellow>Newt!
.</c>

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620
<c.yellow><i>Accio!</i>
.</c>

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.740
<c.yellow>Grab the tie.
.</c>

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.150
<c.yellow>That was a Portkey.
.</c>

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.990
<c.yellow>Yeah.
.</c>

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.840
<c.yellow>Well done, you two.
.</c>

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.790
<c.yellow>Not that either of you asked, but I
would highly recommend learning Charms.
.</c>

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080
<c.yellow>Lally.
.</c>

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.330
<c.yellow>What kept you two.
.</c>

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.380
<c.yellow>We encountered some complications. You?
.</c>

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.420
<c.yellow>We encountered some complications.
.</c>

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.340
<c.yellow>Jacob tried to murder Grindelwald?
.</c>

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.300
<c.yellow>It's a long story.
.</c>

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.140
<c.yellow>Is it really snake wood?
.</c>

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:27.020
<c.yellow>Yes, it's really snake wood.
.</c>

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:28.850
<c.yellow>Can I...
.</c>

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.810
<c.yellow>Very dangerous.
.</c>

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:33.610
<c.yellow>It's very powerful.
.</c>

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:36.440
<c.yellow>It's rare. If it got in the wrong
hands, you know...
.</c>

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:37.690
<c.yellow>mess you up.
.</c>

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.190
<c.yellow>Where did you get it?
.</c>

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:41.990
<c.yellow>I got it for Christmas.
.</c>

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:43.200
<c.yellow>Jacob...
.</c>

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:44.620
<c.yellow>look who I found.
.</c>

01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:45.870
<c.yellow>Hey.
.</c>

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.250
<c.yellow>It's my wizard friends, Newt and Theseus.
.</c>

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.620
<c.yellow>We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.
.</c>

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.170
<c.yellow>I gotta go.
.
All right, have fun.
.</c>

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.420
<c.yellow>Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
.</c>

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.380
<c.yellow>Can you believe this place?
.</c>

01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:59.940
<c.yellow>They got pint-sized little witches
and wizards running around here.
.</c>

01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:01.130
<c.yellow>You don't say.
.</c>

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:03.180
<c.yellow>I was the assassin.
.</c>

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:05.680
<c.yellow>Newt and Theseus both went to Hogwarts.
.</c>

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.850
<c.yellow>I knew that.
.
Well, they're being very nice to me.
.</c>

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.950
<c.yellow>The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.
.</c>

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.730
<c.yellow>They're delicious. Who wants one?
.</c>

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.560
<c.yellow>I never cared for cockroach clusters
much myself...
.</c>

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:17.270
<c.yellow>although Honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.
.</c>

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.200
<c.yellow>Off you go.
.</c>

01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.990
<c.yellow>McGonagall.
.</c>

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:27.740
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:28.950
<c.yellow>Well done.
.</c>

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.580
<c.yellow>All of you, well done.
.</c>

01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:31.580
<c.yellow>Congratulations.
.</c>

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:33.250
<c.yellow>- Congratulations?
.
- Indeed.
.</c>

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.670
<c.yellow>Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.
.</c>

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.920
<c.yellow>And you are alive and you are well.
.</c>

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:44.130
<c.yellow>The fact that everything didn't go
precisely to plan was precisely the plan.
.</c>

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:45.720
<c.yellow>Countersight 101.
.</c>

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:48.260
<c.yellow>Albus, forgive me,
but aren't we back where we started?
.</c>

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.060
<c.yellow>Actually, I would argue
that things are...
.</c>

01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:53.390
<c.yellow>a great deal worse.
.</c>

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.930
<c.yellow>You haven't told them, have you?
.</c>

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.190
<c.yellow>Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.
.</c>

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.530
<c.yellow>- What?
.
- But how?
.</c>

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.740
<c.yellow>Because Vogel chose easy over right.
.</c>

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:33.770
<c.yellow>It's all right.
.</c>

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.140
<c.yellow>Bhutan.
.</c>

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:37.270
<c.yellow>Correct. Three points to Hufflepuff.
.</c>

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.650
<c.yellow>The kingdom of Bhutan
sits high in the Eastern Himalayas.
.</c>

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:45.530
<c.yellow>It's a place of indescribable beauty.
.</c>

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:49.120
<c.yellow>Some of our most important magic
has its origins there.
.</c>

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:54.250
<c.yellow>They say if you listen carefully enough,
the past whispers to you.
.</c>

01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:58.040
<c.yellow>It also happens to be
where the election will be held.
.</c>

01:21:58.290 --> 01:21:59.460
<c.yellow>He can't win, can he?
.</c>

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:01.880
<c.yellow>Only a few days ago
he was a fugitive from justice.
.</c>

01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:07.510
<c.yellow>Now he is an official candidate in the
International Confederation of Wizards.
.</c>

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:12.350
<c.yellow>Dangerous times favor dangerous men.
.</c>

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.060
<c.yellow>By the way, we'll be dining
with my brother in the village.
.</c>

01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.020
<c.yellow>Should you need anything before then,
Minerva is here.
.</c>

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.860
<c.yellow>Dumbledore has a brother?
.</c>

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.290
<c.yellow>Here we are.
.</c>

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.380
<c.yellow>Bunty, you're here.
.</c>

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:53.390
<c.yellow>How is she?
.</c>

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600
<c.yellow>She's fine.
.</c>

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:58.390
<c.yellow>What's Alfie done now?
.</c>

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.870
<c.yellow>Wait, you've not been biting
Timothy's bottom again, have you?
.</c>

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.270
<c.yellow>Miss Broadacre, I trust my
brother has been a gracious host?
.</c>

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:08.030
<c.yellow>Yes, ever so gracious.
.</c>

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:09.780
<c.yellow>I'm delighted to hear.
.</c>

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.200
<c.yellow>So, rooms have been arranged for you
in the village...
.</c>

01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:16.830
<c.yellow>and Aberforth here
will prepare you a delicious dinner...
.</c>

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.540
<c.yellow>his own recipe.
.</c>

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.210
<c.yellow>There's more of that if you want it.
.</c>

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.890
<c.yellow>Thank you.
.</c>

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760
<c.yellow>Thanks.
.</c>

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.350
<c.yellow>Astonishing.
.</c>

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.730
<c.yellow>Never has something that looks so repellent
tasted so delicious.
.</c>

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:44.940
<c.yellow>Who is this little one?
.</c>

01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:46.110
<c.yellow>Do you mind?
.</c>

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.610
<c.yellow>She's a Qilin, Jacob.
.</c>

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.570
<c.yellow>She's incredibly rare.
.</c>

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:53.110
<c.yellow>One of the most beloved creatures
in the Wizarding World.
.</c>

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:54.700
<c.yellow>Why?
.</c>

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.290
<c.yellow>'Cause she can see into your soul.
.</c>

01:24:00.710 --> 01:24:02.210
<c.yellow>You're kidding me.
.</c>

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:08.210
<c.yellow>No. So, if you are good and worthy,
then she'll see that.
.</c>

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:11.970
<c.yellow>But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful...
.</c>

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.010
<c.yellow>then she'll know that too.
.</c>

01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:16.220
<c.yellow>Oh, yeah?
.</c>

01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:18.970
<c.yellow>Does she just tell you that or...
.</c>

01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.180
<c.yellow>Not exactly tells.
.</c>

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.060
<c.yellow>Well, she bows, but only in the presence
of someone truly pure of heart.
.</c>

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.000
<c.yellow>I mean, almost none of us are, of course...
.</c>

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.400
<c.yellow>no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.
.</c>

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.530
<c.yellow>There was actually a time,
many, many years ago...
.</c>

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:39.120
<c.yellow>when the Qilin chose who'd lead us.
.</c>

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.330
<c.yellow>No...
.</c>

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:49.380
<c.yellow>Okay. All right, already.
.</c>

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.420
<c.yellow>Here you go.
.</c>

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500
<c.yellow>Thriving.
.</c>

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.050
<c.yellow>He's just hungry. Look at him.
.</c>

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.140
<c.yellow>- She really likes you, Jacob.
.
- Oh, all right.
.</c>

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.520
<c.yellow>It's okay.
.</c>

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:14.320
<c.yellow>Come with me.
.</c>

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.450
<c.yellow>I'll help you.
.</c>

01:25:19.410 --> 01:25:21.330
<c.yellow>He's your son, Aberforth.
.</c>

01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:25.750
<c.yellow>He needs you.
.</c>

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.140
<c.yellow>Newt.
.</c>

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.940
<c.yellow>Come in.
.</c>

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:58.320
<c.yellow>Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.
.</c>

01:25:58.570 --> 01:25:59.570
<c.yellow>Close the door.
.</c>

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.290
<c.yellow>It's from Credence, Newt.
.</c>

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.340
<c.yellow>The summer Gellert and I fell in love...
.</c>

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.010
<c.yellow>my brother fell in love as well...
.</c>

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.390
<c.yellow>with a girl from the Hollow.
.</c>

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.180
<c.yellow>She was sent away.
.</c>

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.310
<c.yellow>There were rumors about a child.
.</c>

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.350
<c.yellow>Credence...
.</c>

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.690
<c.yellow>He's a Dumbledore.
.</c>

01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:37.110
<c.yellow>If I'd been a better friend...
.</c>

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.280
<c.yellow>to Aberforth,
if I'd been a better brother...
.</c>

01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:43.830
<c.yellow>he might have confided in me.
.</c>

01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:48.750
<c.yellow>Perhaps things would have been different,
and this boy...
.</c>

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:52.290
<c.yellow>could have been part of our lives,
part of our family.
.</c>

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.300
<c.yellow>Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.
.</c>

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.970
<c.yellow>But he may yet be able to save us.
.</c>

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.730
<c.yellow>Phoenix ash.
.</c>

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:18.150
<c.yellow>The bird comes to him
because he's dying, Newt.
.</c>

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.860
<c.yellow>I know the signs.
.</c>

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.120
<c.yellow>You see...
.</c>

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:28.250
<c.yellow>my sister was an Obscurial.
.</c>

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:32.250
<c.yellow>And like Credence,
she never learned to express her magic.
.</c>

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.590
<c.yellow>Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.
.</c>

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.510
<c.yellow>Worst of all, none of us
were capable of easing her pain.
.</c>

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.390
<c.yellow>Can you tell me how it is that...
.</c>

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.020
<c.yellow>or how it came to an end for her?
.</c>

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.690
<c.yellow>Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.
.</c>

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.400
<c.yellow>My brother didn't approve.
.</c>

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.780
<c.yellow>One night, he confronted us.
.</c>

01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:06.660
<c.yellow>Voices were raised, threats made.
.</c>

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:10.330
<c.yellow>Aberforth drew his wand, which was foolish.
.</c>

01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:16.340
<c.yellow>I drew my wand, which
was even more foolish.
.</c>

01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:20.800
<c.yellow>Gellert just laughed.
.</c>

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:24.590
<c.yellow>No one heard Ariana coming down the stairs.
.</c>

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:30.060
<c.yellow>Can't say for certain it was my...
.</c>

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:32.730
<c.yellow>spell.
.</c>

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.530
<c.yellow>Doesn't really matter.
.</c>

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:44.160
<c.yellow>One minute she was there,
and the next she was gone.
.</c>

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.990
<c.yellow>I'm so sorry, Albus.
.</c>

01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:52.710
<c.yellow>But if it's of any comfort,
perhaps she was saved some pain...
.</c>

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.330
<c.yellow>Don't.
.</c>

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:56.460
<c.yellow>Don't disappoint me, Newt.
.</c>

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.340
<c.yellow>You of all people.
.</c>

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.050
<c.yellow>Your honesty is a gift...
.</c>

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:07.720
<c.yellow>even if at times a painful one.
.</c>

01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:15.940
<c.yellow>Our friends downstairs will be tired
and wanting to go home.
.</c>

01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:18.230
<c.yellow>You should go.
.</c>

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.540
<c.yellow>Albus, Lally said something earlier...
.</c>

01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:38.630
<c.yellow>about most of us being
ultimately imperfect.
.</c>

01:29:40.210 --> 01:29:44.050
<c.yellow>But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...
.</c>

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:48.180
<c.yellow>we can try to make things right.
.</c>

01:29:50.890 --> 01:29:52.390
<c.yellow>And that's what matters...
.</c>

01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:57.600
<c.yellow>trying.
.</c>

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:14.790
<c.yellow>We're with you.
.</c>

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:16.580
<c.yellow>Thank you.
.</c>

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.880
<c.yellow>Our time is close, my brothers and sisters.
.</c>

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:30.800
<c.yellow>Days of hiding are over.
.</c>

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.770
<c.yellow>The world will hear our voice.
.</c>

01:30:39.190 --> 01:30:40.560
<c.yellow>And it will be deafening.
.</c>

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:51.660
<c.yellow>You didn't come here
to betray Dumbledore...
.</c>

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:55.540
<c.yellow>You know in your pure-blood heart...
.</c>

01:30:57.330 --> 01:30:59.170
<c.yellow>your place is here.
.</c>

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:04.130
<c.yellow>To believe in me is to believe in yourself.
.</c>

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.850
<c.yellow>Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.
.</c>

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.500
<c.yellow><i>Vulnera Sanentur.</i>
.</c>

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:48.380
<c.yellow><i>Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.</i>
.</c>

01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:08.110
<c.yellow>There.
.</c>

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:10.940
<c.yellow>There, there.
.</c>

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.240
<c.yellow>There.
.</c>

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:17.620
<c.yellow>Come, look.
.</c>

01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:25.790
<c.yellow>This is why we are special.
.</c>

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.680
<c.yellow>To conceal our powers
is not merely an affront to ourselves...
.</c>

01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:35.640
<c.yellow>it's sinful.
.</c>

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.860
<c.yellow>Was there another?
.</c>

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.320
<c.yellow>Another?
.</c>

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:58.620
<c.yellow>That night, was there another Qilin?
.</c>

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.460
<c.yellow>I don't think so...
.</c>

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.830
<c.yellow>That's twice you failed me.
.</c>

01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:10.800
<c.yellow>Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?
.</c>

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.340
<c.yellow>One last chance.
.</c>

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.180
<c.yellow>Understood?
.</c>

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.560
<c.yellow>Find it.
.</c>

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:18.570
<c.yellow>Hey, Newt.
.</c>

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.030
<c.yellow>What is this place?
.</c>

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.040
<c.yellow>The room we require.
.</c>

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:32.000
<c.yellow>I trust you all have the tickets
that Bunty gave you?
.</c>

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.510
<c.yellow>You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.
.</c>

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:35.800
<c.yellow>What do you think, Newt?
.</c>

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.340
<c.yellow>Can you tell which one is yours?
.</c>

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.800
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:41.180
<c.yellow>Good. I'd be worried if you could.
.</c>

01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:43.470
<c.yellow>I assume the Qilin's in one of these cases.
.</c>

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.750
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:46.730
<c.yellow>- Well, which one is it?
.
- Which one indeed.
.</c>

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:49.270
<c.yellow>It's like a three-card Monte thing.
.</c>

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.190
<c.yellow>Like a shell game thing.
.</c>

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480
<c.yellow>Like a short con.
.</c>

01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:56.400
<c.yellow>Never mind, it's a Muggle thing.
.</c>

01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:58.950
<c.yellow>Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers...
.</c>

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.280
<c.yellow>to get his hands on our rare friend.
.</c>

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.660
<c.yellow>Therefore, it's essential that we keep...
.</c>

01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:06.910
<c.yellow>whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing...
.</c>

01:35:07.710 --> 01:35:10.080
<c.yellow>so the Qilin gets to the ceremony safely.
.</c>

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:15.960
<c.yellow>If, by teatime, the Qilin,
not to mention all of us...
.</c>

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:18.670
<c.yellow>are still alive...
.</c>

01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:21.640
<c.yellow>we should consider our efforts a success.
.</c>

01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:25.140
<c.yellow>For the record, nobody ever died
playing three-card Monte.
.</c>

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.560
<c.yellow>An important distinction.
.</c>

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:32.440
<c.yellow>All right, everybody choose a case
and we'll be on our way.
.</c>

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:36.280
<c.yellow>Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.
.</c>

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.280
<c.yellow>Me?
.</c>

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.870
<c.yellow>Okay.
.</c>

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:11.000
<c.yellow>I'm looking forward
to you educating me a little further...
.</c>

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.600
<c.yellow>on the finer points
of three-card Monte.
.</c>

01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:20.570
<c.yellow>My pleasure.
.</c>

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.950
<c.yellow>Well, good luck, everybody.
.</c>

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:31.910
<c.yellow>Good luck.
.</c>

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.670
<c.yellow>And you too, Bunty girl.
.</c>

01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:39.920
<c.yellow>See you, Bunty.
.</c>

01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:00.280
<c.yellow>It is not lost on those of us in leadership
that we are currently a world divided.
.</c>

01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:03.990
<c.yellow>Each day brings talk of another conspiracy.
.</c>

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.780
<c.yellow><i>Each hour another dark whisper.</i>
.</c>

01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:10.740
<c.yellow><i>These whispers have
only increased in recent days...</i></c>

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:13.660
<c.yellow><i>with the-addition of a third candidate.</i>
.</c>

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.880
<c.yellow>There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt...
.</c>

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:25.180
<c.yellow>that a worthy candidate exists amongst
the three you have been presented.
.</c>

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:47.530
<c.yellow>As every schoolboy and girl knows...
.</c>

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:54.370
<c.yellow>the Qilin is the purest of creatures
in our wonderful magical world.
.</c>

01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.960
<c.yellow>It cannot be deceived.
.</c>

01:37:58.670 --> 01:38:01.130
<c.yellow>Let the Qilin unite us.
.</c>

01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:23.320
<c.yellow>Santos! Santos! Santos!
.</c>

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:50.590
<c.yellow>Come.
.</c>

01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:55.930
<c.yellow>Where to, next?
.</c>

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.230
<c.yellow>This is where I leave you.
.</c>

01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:01.020
<c.yellow>I'm sorry, you're what?
.</c>

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:02.520
<c.yellow>Leaving me?
.</c>

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.320
<c.yellow>I have to meet someone else, Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:07.190
<c.yellow>Not to worry...
.</c>

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.610
<c.yellow>you'll be perfectly safe.
.</c>

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.080
<c.yellow>You don't have the Qilin.
.</c>

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.040
<c.yellow>Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.
.</c>

01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:22.790
<c.yellow>One other thing, if you
don't mind me saying.
.</c>

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.380
<c.yellow>You should stop doubting yourself.
.</c>

01:39:25.670 --> 01:39:28.340
<c.yellow>You have something most men
go their entire lives without.
.</c>

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:29.880
<c.yellow>Do you know what that is?
.</c>

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.720
<c.yellow>A heart that is full.
.</c>

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.520
<c.yellow>Only a truly brave man...
.</c>

01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:41.690
<c.yellow>could open himself up
so honestly and completely, as you do.
.</c>

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.970
<c.yellow>Santos! Santos! Santos!
.</c>

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:27.710
<c.yellow>Cases, please.
.</c>

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:47.980
<c.yellow>Hey, fellas.
.</c>

01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:57.950
<c.yellow>He's angry.
.</c>

01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.050
<c.yellow>Wait.
.</c>

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:16.970
<c.yellow>Open them, make sure it's in there.
.</c>

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.260
<c.yellow>Idiots.
.</c>

01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:05.330
<c.yellow>How long does he have?
.</c>

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.660
<c.yellow>Here. Hey. Hi.
.</c>

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:50.070
<c.yellow>You're in danger, all right?
.</c>

01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:51.700
<c.yellow>- You need to leave.
.
- Well...
.</c>

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.290
<c.yellow>I can't go, okay?
.</c>

01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.880
<c.yellow>I can't come home.
.</c>

01:44:57.130 --> 01:44:58.410
<c.yellow>It's too late for me, all right?
.</c>

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.760
<c.yellow>Some mistakes, they're just too big.
.</c>

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.720
<c.yellow>Can you listen to me?
.</c>

01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:05.090
<c.yellow>There's no time. I was followed.
.</c>

01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:08.760
<c.yellow>I gave 'em the slip, but it won't
be long before they find me.
.</c>

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.620
<c.yellow>- They're gonna find us.
.
- I don't care.
.</c>

01:45:11.730 --> 01:45:13.100
<c.yellow>All I got is us.
.</c>

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:14.640
<c.yellow>I make no sense without us.
.</c>

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.480
<c.yellow>Jacob, what? Come on...
.</c>

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.660
<c.yellow>I don't love you anymore.
.
Just get outta here.
.</c>

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.110
<c.yellow>You're the worst liar in the world,
Queenie Goldstein.
.</c>

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:24.860
<c.yellow>You hear that?
.</c>

01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:26.360
<c.yellow>What? No.
.</c>

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.990
<c.yellow>That's a sign.
.</c>

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.240
<c.yellow>Oh, man.
.</c>

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.330
<c.yellow>- Come on.
.
- Come here, come here.
.</c>

01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:33.080
<c.yellow>Close your eyes.
.</c>

01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:35.870
<c.yellow>Please close your eyes.
.</c>

01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:39.420
<c.yellow>You know what Dumbledore said to me?
.</c>

01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:41.170
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.010
<c.yellow>He said that I got a full heart.
.</c>

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:49.470
<c.yellow>He's wrong.
.</c>

01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:52.810
<c.yellow>I'm always gonna have
room in there for you.
.</c>

01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:55.310
<c.yellow>- Yeah?
.
- Yeah.
.</c>

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:56.730
<c.yellow>You know it.
.</c>

01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.150
<c.yellow>Look at me.
.</c>

01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:03.650
<c.yellow>Queenie Goldstein.
.</c>

01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.110
<c.yellow>Mr. Scamander.
.</c>

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.030
<c.yellow>We've never been properly introduced.
.</c>

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.030
<c.yellow>Henrietta Fischer...
.</c>

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.740
<c.yellow><i>Herr</i> Vogel's attache.
.</c>

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.870
<c.yellow>Yes...
.</c>

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:20.910
<c.yellow>hello.
.</c>

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.040
<c.yellow>I can take you up.
.</c>

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.830
<c.yellow>There's a private entrance
for members of the High Council.
.</c>

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.630
<c.yellow>If you just follow me.
.</c>

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.420
<c.yellow>I'm sorry, why would you do that?
.</c>

01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:33.340
<c.yellow>Take me up?
.</c>

01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:36.300
<c.yellow>Isn't it obvious?
.</c>

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:39.010
<c.yellow>No, frankly, it's not.
.</c>

01:47:43.730 --> 01:47:45.480
<c.yellow>Dumbledore sent me.
.</c>

01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:51.320
<c.yellow>I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.
.</c>

01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:14.670
<c.yellow>He should be here any minute.
.</c>

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:19.950
<c.yellow>What kept you?
.</c>

01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:37.050
<c.yellow>I thank the candidates for their words.
.</c>

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:43.640
<c.yellow>Each represents a distinct vision
of how we will not shape only our world...
.</c>

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.060
<c.yellow>but the non-magical world as well.
.</c>

01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.560
<c.yellow>Which brings us to the most important
part of our ceremony...
.</c>

01:49:52.810 --> 01:49:54.900
<c.yellow>the walk of the Qilin.
.</c>

01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:26.700
<c.yellow>The Qilin has seen.
.</c>

01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:29.120
<c.yellow>Seen goodness...
.</c>

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:31.580
<c.yellow>strength...
.</c>

01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:36.420
<c.yellow>qualities essential to
lead and to guide us.
.</c>

01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:40.250
<c.yellow>Who do you see?
.</c>

01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.820
<c.yellow>Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader
of the magical world...
.</c>

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.650
<c.yellow>by acclamation.
.</c>

01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:44.820
<c.yellow>This is the man who tried to take my life.
.</c>

01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:50.120
<c.yellow>This man, who has no magic...
.</c>

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:54.080
<c.yellow>who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood...
.</c>

01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:57.460
<c.yellow>create a forbidden union
that would make us less...
.</c>

01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:00.290
<c.yellow>make us weak, like his kind.
.</c>

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.090
<c.yellow>He's not alone, my friends.
.</c>

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.630
<c.yellow>There are thousands
who seek to do the same.
.</c>

01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:13.760
<c.yellow>There can only be one response
to such vermin.
.</c>

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.440
<c.yellow>No.
.</c>

01:53:28.150 --> 01:53:29.150
<c.yellow><i>Crucio.</i>
.</c>

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:30.740
<c.yellow>No!
.</c>

01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:34.910
<c.yellow>Make him stop!
.</c>

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:40.540
<c.yellow>Our war with the Muggles begins today.
.</c>

01:53:58.770 --> 01:53:59.770
<c.yellow>Jacob.
.</c>

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.770
<c.yellow>He's lying to you.
.</c>

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.650
<c.yellow>That creature is dead.
.</c>

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:56.200
<c.yellow>Not now. Wait.
.</c>

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080
<c.yellow>He did it to trick you.
.</c>

01:55:02.710 --> 01:55:05.290
<c.yellow>He killed it and bewitched it...
.</c>

01:55:05.590 --> 01:55:08.170
<c.yellow>so that you might think him worthy to lead.
.</c>

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:12.720
<c.yellow>But he doesn't want to lead you.
.</c>

01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:17.300
<c.yellow>He just wants you to follow.
.</c>

01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.260
<c.yellow>Words.
.</c>

01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:23.020
<c.yellow>Words designed to deceive.
.</c>

01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:26.080
<c.yellow>To make you doubt what you've seen
with your own two eyes.
.</c>

01:55:26.110 --> 01:55:27.630
<c.yellow>There were two Qilins born that night.
.</c>

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.900
<c.yellow>A twin.
.
And I know that...
.</c>

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.400
<c.yellow>I know that...
.</c>

01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:33.650
<c.yellow>Because?
.</c>

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.240
<c.yellow>Because you have no proof.
.</c>

01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:43.210
<c.yellow>Because there was no second Qilin.
.</c>

01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:45.920
<c.yellow>Am I not right?
.</c>

01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:47.310
<c.yellow>Its mother had been killed, it...
.</c>

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.790
<c.yellow>Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander?
.</c>

01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.740
<c.yellow>No one can know everything, Newt.
.</c>

01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:19.120
<c.yellow>Remember?
.</c>

01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:50.860
<c.yellow>I don't get it.
.</c>

01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:05.450
<c.yellow>She can't hear you, little one.
.</c>

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.330
<c.yellow>Not here...
.</c>

01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:12.540
<c.yellow>but perhaps somewhere she's listening.
.</c>

01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.430
<c.yellow>This is the true Qilin.
.</c>

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.930
<c.yellow>Look at it...
.</c>

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.510
<c.yellow>you can see it with your own eyes.
.</c>

01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:25.600
<c.yellow>This is the true...
.</c>

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.770
<c.yellow>This can't be allowed to stand.
.</c>

01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:34.520
<c.yellow>The vote must be taken again.
.</c>

01:57:35.530 --> 01:57:38.110
<c.yellow>Come on, Anton. Do something.
.</c>

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.720
<c.yellow>You...
.</c>

01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:10.020
<c.yellow>No, no, no, please.
.</c>

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.210
<c.yellow>I'm honored.
.</c>

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:41.430
<c.yellow>But just as two of you
were born that night...
.</c>

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:44.890
<c.yellow>there's another here, equally worthy.
.</c>

01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:48.180
<c.yellow>I'm certain of it.
.</c>

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:05.030
<c.yellow>Thank you.
.</c>

02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:59.620
<c.yellow>Who will love you now, Dumbledore?
.</c>

02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:04.130
<c.yellow>You're all alone.
.</c>

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.600
<c.yellow>I was never your enemy.
.</c>

02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:06.650
<c.yellow>Then, or now.
.</c>

02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:49.570
<c.yellow>Did you ever think of me?
.</c>

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:53.490
<c.yellow>Always.
.</c>

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.290
<c.yellow>Come home.
.</c>

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:52.090
<c.yellow>Here she is.
.</c>

02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:55.840
<c.yellow>Well done, Bunty.
.</c>

02:04:59.930 --> 02:05:01.050
<c.yellow>Come on, little one.
.</c>

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.970
<c.yellow>I'm sorry.
.
I must have given you an awful fright.
.</c>

02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:06.350
<c.yellow>No, I think...
.</c>

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:10.520
<c.yellow>sometimes it takes losing something
to realize quite how much it means.
.</c>

02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:15.610
<c.yellow>And sometimes you just...
.</c>

02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:21.120
<c.yellow>Sometimes you just know.
.</c>

02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:33.420
<c.yellow>Right, in you pop.
.</c>

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.720
<c.yellow>Mr. Kowalski.
.</c>

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:41.050
<c.yellow>I owe you an apology.
.</c>

02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:45.680
<c.yellow>It was never my intent
for you to suffer the <i>Cruciatus</i> curse.
.</c>

02:05:46.810 --> 02:05:47.980
<c.yellow>Yeah...
.</c>

02:05:48.190 --> 02:05:50.390
<c.yellow>well, you know, we got Queenie back,
so we're square.
.</c>

02:05:50.650 --> 02:05:52.520
<c.yellow>Hey, can I ask you a question?
.</c>

02:05:53.610 --> 02:05:54.940
<c.yellow>Can I keep this?
.</c>

02:05:55.230 --> 02:05:56.780
<c.yellow>For, like, old times' sake?
.</c>

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:02.950
<c.yellow>I can't think of anyone more deserving.
.</c>

02:06:05.410 --> 02:06:06.950
<c.yellow>Thanks, Professor.
.</c>

02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:28.810
<c.yellow>Remarkable.
.</c>

02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:29.730
<c.yellow>But how?
.</c>

02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:31.460
<c.yellow>I thought you couldn't
move against one another.
.</c>

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:32.560
<c.yellow>We didn't.
.</c>

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:36.020
<c.yellow>He sought to kill, I sought to protect.
.</c>

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:38.030
<c.yellow>Our spells met.
.</c>

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:41.450
<c.yellow>Let's call it fate.
.</c>

02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:46.200
<c.yellow>After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?
.</c>

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.330
<c.yellow>Albus.
.</c>

02:06:51.250 --> 02:06:52.750
<c.yellow>Promise me.
.</c>

02:06:55.130 --> 02:06:57.050
<c.yellow>You'll find him and you'll stop him.
.</c>

02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:27.660
<c.yellow>Albert, don't forget the pierogis.
.</c>

02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:29.120
<c.yellow>Yes, Mr. K.
.</c>

02:07:29.370 --> 02:07:30.830
<c.yellow>Albert.
.</c>

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:33.080
<c.yellow>No more than eight
minutes on the kolaczkis.
.</c>

02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:34.870
<c.yellow>Yes, Mr. K.
.</c>

02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.380
<c.yellow>He's a sweet kid.
.</c>

02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:39.110
<c.yellow>He doesn't know the difference
between paszteciki and golabki.
.</c>

02:07:39.130 --> 02:07:40.170
<c.yellow>- Hey, sweetheart.
.
- What?
.</c>

02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:41.980
<c.yellow>Newt doesn't know
what you're talking about.
.</c>

02:07:42.010 --> 02:07:43.530
<c.yellow>I don't know what you're talking about.
.</c>

02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:46.390
<c.yellow>And you are not working today, remember?
.</c>

02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:49.720
<c.yellow>Are you all right, honey?
.</c>

02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:51.910
<c.yellow>You're nervous about the speech.
.
Don't be nervous.
.</c>

02:07:51.930 --> 02:07:52.930
<c.yellow>Tell him, honey.
.</c>

02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:54.200
<c.yellow>Don't be nervous about the speech.
.</c>

02:07:54.230 --> 02:07:55.230
<c.yellow>I'm not nervous.
.</c>

02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:58.310
<c.yellow>What is the smell?
.
Why is there burning? Albert?
.</c>

02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.820
<c.yellow>Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?
.</c>

02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:06.740
<c.yellow>I can't imagine what you're talking about.
.</c>

02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:23.170
<c.yellow>So, the day that I first met Jacob...
.</c>

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:28.090
<c.yellow>The day that I first met Jacob, we were
both sitting in the Steen National Bank.
.</c>

02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:31.140
<c.yellow>Never would I...
.</c>

02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:47.660
<c.yellow>The maid of honor, I presume?
.</c>

02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:51.990
<c.yellow>The best man, I gather?
.</c>

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.210
<c.yellow>- You've done something to your hair.
.
- No.
.</c>

02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:01.500
<c.yellow>Well, yes, actually, just...
.</c>

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:02.920
<c.yellow>Just for tonight.
.</c>

02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:04.650
<c.yellow>- Well, it suits you.
.
- Thank you, Newt.
.</c>

02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:11.510
<c.yellow>- Hello.
.
- Hi.
.</c>

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:12.810
<c.yellow>Look who's...
.</c>

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.400
<c.yellow>Hi.
.</c>

02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:17.140
<c.yellow>So good to see you.
.</c>

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:18.690
<c.yellow>- Hi.
.
- How are you?
.</c>

02:09:18.980 --> 02:09:20.020
<c.yellow>You look wonderful, Lally.
.</c>

02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:22.230
<c.yellow>Well, thank you, Newt. I appreciate it.
.</c>

02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:23.570
<c.yellow>Good luck.
.</c>

02:09:23.690 --> 02:09:24.690
<c.yellow>Tina, come on.
.</c>

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:26.940
<c.yellow>- You must tell me how MACUSA's been.
.
- See you inside.
.</c>

02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:34.080
<c.yellow>What about me? How do I look?
.</c>

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:36.410
<c.yellow>- You all right?
.
- You look fine.
.</c>

02:09:36.710 --> 02:09:37.710
<c.yellow>You okay?
.</c>

02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:38.750
<c.yellow>Yeah, I'm all right.
.</c>

02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:40.040
<c.yellow>You're not nervous, are you?
.</c>

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:44.130
<c.yellow>Can't be nervous about
a speech after saving the world.
.</c>

02:10:01.690 --> 02:10:03.060
<c.yellow>It's a historic day.
.</c>

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:08.990
<c.yellow>Where once was before,
there will now be after.
.</c>

02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:15.790
<c.yellow>Funny how historic days seem so ordinary
when you're living them.
.</c>

02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:19.590
<c.yellow>Well, perhaps that's what happens
when the world gets things right.
.</c>

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.630
<c.yellow>It's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.
.</c>

02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:28.550
<c.yellow>I didn't know if I'd see you here.
.</c>

02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:30.970
<c.yellow>I wasn't sure you would, either.
.</c>

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:32.260
<c.yellow>Hey, Newt.
.</c>

02:10:32.590 --> 02:10:33.590
<c.yellow>Yes.
.</c>

02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:35.470
<c.yellow>Jacob seems to think he's lost the ring.
.</c>

02:10:35.770 --> 02:10:36.910
<c.yellow>Please tell me you've got it.
.</c>

02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:38.720
<c.yellow>No, it's all good. Yep.
.</c>

02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:41.730
<c.yellow>That scared me. Jacob!
.</c>

02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:45.690
<c.yellow>Good man, Pick.
.</c>

02:10:51.070 --> 02:10:52.410
<c.yellow>I should probably...
.</c>

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:55.320
<c.yellow>Thank you, Newt.
.</c>

02:10:57.040 --> 02:10:58.040
<c.yellow>What for?
.</c>

02:10:58.290 --> 02:10:59.660
<c.yellow>Pick your poison.
.</c>

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:04.460
<c.yellow>I really couldn't have done it without you.
.</c>

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.760
<c.yellow>I'd do it again, by the way.
.</c>

02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:17.100
<c.yellow>Should you ask.
.</c>

02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:33.470
<c.yellow>Okay.
.</c>

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:36.800
<c.yellow>Hey.
.</c>

02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:48.750
<c.yellow>- Hey!
- Hello!</c>

02:11:49.130 --> 02:11:50.500
<c.yellow>Bunty!
.</c>

02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:52.840
<c.yellow>Bunty!
.</c>

02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:15.650
<c.yellow>Wow, you're so beautiful.
.</c>

02:12:23.410 --> 02:12:25.330
<c.yellow>I can't believe it.
.</c>

02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:47.560
<c.yellow>This is Albert.
.</c>

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.420
<c.yellow>I don't know if you've met Albert, yet?
.</c>

02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.730
<c.yellow>Have you met Lally?
.</c>
