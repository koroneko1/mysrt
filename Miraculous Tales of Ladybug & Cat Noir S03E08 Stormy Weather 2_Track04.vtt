‎See you tomorrow!
‎So, Nino, homework at my place tonight?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.220
‎Uh... you sure we said tonight?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.020
‎Well, see... Uh...
‎I kind of promised Adrien

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.700
‎I'd drop off the school work
‎he missed today

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.140
‎'cause of his shoot!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.780
‎No worries, guys!
‎You go and do your homework together,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580
‎and I'll drop off the lessons
‎at Adrien's later on.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.260
‎You sure? Thanks, Marinette!

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.700
‎That's terrible! You hear that, Chloé?

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.340
‎Aurore's GPA dropped a whole point
‎on her last report card!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.020
‎You can't be Little Miss Weather Girl

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.900
‎and Little Miss Good Grades
‎at the same time!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.660
‎Better not to make her cry
‎or she might turn into Stormy Weather

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.260
‎and start raining on us!
‎What a ridiculous power!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.060
‎ ‎Utterly ridiculous!

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020
‎Aurore won't be transforming.
‎Her grades will be up again next term!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.020
‎-Just ask if you need any help.
‎-Thanks, Marinette!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.900
‎Yeah, right!
‎Once a villain, always a villain!

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.300
‎Unlike you, Chloé,
‎people do change for the better!

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.220
‎Well, you will never change,
‎Marinette Dupain-Cheng!

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.220
‎You'll always be... "Adri-dumb,"

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.100
‎I mean, "Adri-bumd, A-blayblay"... Lame!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.060
‎And you, Alya Césaire,
‎you still haven't found out

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.300
‎who Ladybug is, right?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380
‎Well, you two are made for each other.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.380
‎You're both just as clueless as the other.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.300
‎Back to you now.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.700
‎Huh!
‎She's gone now, because of you two!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.460
‎And I wasn't even halfway done
‎trashing her.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.900
‎Come on, Sabrina!

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.580
‎Chloé might not be completely
‎wrong, you know, Tikki.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.340
‎I haven't changed.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140
‎I always fail when I try to have
‎a basic conversation with Adrien!

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.580
<i>‎When I'm in front of him</i>
<i>‎my heart beats like crazy</i>

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.260
<i>‎and my words make no sense whatsoever!</i>

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.660
<i>‎It seems like I'm paralyzed.</i>

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.460
‎ Hey!

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.580
‎-Hey!
‎-I... I wanted to, um...

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380
‎gift you a make.
‎I mean, gift you a give I made.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.660
‎-I mean...
‎-Out of the way.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.740
<i>‎"Ah, beneath that strong disguise,</i>

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.900
‎"every day we see each other
‎and I hope that you'll be mine.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.580
‎"Together our love could be so true.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.300
‎"Please will you be my Valentine?"

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
‎It's so beautiful!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.300
‎But I'll never know what he thinks of me

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.100
‎or who this poem he wrote was meant for.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.460
‎Oh, I am so, so lame!

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.500
‎You are not!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.100
‎You've changed a lot
‎since the beginning of the year

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.460
‎and since you first met Adrien.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.620
‎ <i>‎You're right, I have changed!</i>

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.140
<i>‎I got more and more clumsy</i>
<i>‎since I met him!</i>

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.700
<i>‎No! Think of all the things you've done</i>

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.460
<i>‎since the first day back at school.</i>

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.140
<i>‎You went to the movies with Adrien!</i>

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.900
‎ <i>‎Yeah, how could I forget that?</i>

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.180
<i>‎In my PJs, wearing a towel.</i>

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.060
‎ <i>‎True.</i>
<i>‎Maybe that wasn't the best example.</i>

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.380
<i>‎What about the time</i>
<i>‎you played video games</i>

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.900
<i>‎with him right here in your bedroom?</i>

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.660
‎-Sorry.
‎-No, you go.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.620
‎ ‎I'll use the other one.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.620
‎ <i>‎And when you fenced with him?</i>

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.780
<i>‎Attaque. Touche. Fort.</i>

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.300
‎-Continue.
‎-Thanks.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.820
‎All I did was lunge.
‎You've got good reflexes.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.260
‎ <i>‎Adrien has become a true friend!</i>

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
‎You never got a chance to open
‎it with all that was going on.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.820
‎I always carry the lucky charm
‎you gave me wherever I go,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.100
‎and I think it works pretty well.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.620
‎You're so wonderful. Uh... it's wonderful.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.660
‎What a charm! The charm.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.700
‎I mean, I'll wear the charm. With luck.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.100
‎Uh, but, basically, um... thank you.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.620
‎Adrien's become a friend
‎who I can talk to about anything,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.140
‎except about feelings for him!

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.100
‎-It's better than nothing.
‎-Can you be in love with someone

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.380
‎even after they've become your friend?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.460
‎Do you think I'll ever be able to tell him

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.580
‎that he means more to me
‎than just a friend?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.340
‎ ‎To the attention of Ms Tsurugi.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.140
‎Things may not be going exactly

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.260
‎the way we had planned,
‎but change can be a good thing.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.140
‎I'm confident
‎it'll strengthen our agreement.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.100
‎ <i>‎It's true.</i>

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.740
<i>‎Things aren't going as planned.</i>
<i>‎For me, either.</i>

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.860
‎There's no point
‎in waiting for your father.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.100
<i>‎I should never have taken this job.</i>

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.420
<i>‎It's too much sometimes.</i>

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860
‎Practice your piano before you go to bed.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220
<i>‎As I watched Adrien growing up,</i>

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.820
<i>‎my affection for him has grown too.</i>

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.500
‎I'm sure he'll understand, sir.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.980
‎ My dad's flaking, isn't he?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.660
‎Let me guess. Something came up?

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.700
‎Yes, but he has reserved the best seats
‎in the house for you, Adrien.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.820
‎Front row.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.060
‎As usual. The best money can buy.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.980
‎The fencing hall is booked for 6:05pm

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.020
‎and the Chinese classroom for 6:35pm,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.020
‎just as you wished.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.540
‎And remember that you have to go
‎to the gala tonight.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.500
‎I'll be there, for sure.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.460
<i>‎As I've watched Emilie falling</i>
<i>‎deeper into an endless sleep,</i>

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.180
<i>‎my sadness for her has deepened too.</i>

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.260
<i>‎And, little by little,</i>
<i>‎my admiration for Gabriel.</i>

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.980
<i>‎A man who'd do anything for his family</i>

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.420
<i>‎has turned into something more.</i>

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.340
<i>‎I never thought</i>
<i>‎I would have feelings like this.</i>

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.500
<i>‎I would do anything for Gabriel Agreste.</i>

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.980
<i>‎No matter the cost.</i>

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.260
‎-Are you ready?
‎-They've been keeping you

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.300
‎from achieving your dream for too long.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.540
‎I will go to any length to end

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.900
‎the reign
‎of Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.260
‎Good.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.340
‎-Nathalie, are you all right?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.940
‎Yes. Thank you, sir.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.220
‎I feel a strong negative emotion.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.220
‎We will finish this later.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.300
‎The photoshoot was amazing, Dad.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.020
‎I'm sorry, Father, uh...
‎it was very interesting.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.540
‎You'll tell me all about it later.
‎I am busy at the moment.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.420
‎In that case,
‎can I meet up with my friends?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.100
‎You'll see them at school tomorrow.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.940
‎This negative emotion I'm feeling,
‎it's familiar.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.300
‎Maybe it's your son's emotion.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.660
‎You should spend more time with him.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.900
‎I'm doing all this
‎so he can be happy again.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.780
‎But aren't you in danger of losing him
‎if you continue down this path?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.780
‎ ‎Your father is very busy.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.260
‎ <i>‎Your Miraculous was not intended</i>
<i>‎to be used in this way.</i>

‎I forbid you to talk to me like that,
‎Nooroo!

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.500
‎Nooroo, dark wings rise!

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.380
‎What if Nooroo is right?
‎Am I taking too many risks?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.380

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.620
‎-Always.
‎-Quick!

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.620
‎-Yeah!
‎-No!

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.860
‎I know longer have a choice.
‎I must succeed, at any price!

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.340
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and evilise her.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.180
<i>‎You can't be "Miss Weather Girl"</i>

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.420
<i>‎and "Miss Good Grades" at the same time!</i>

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.060
<i>‎Or she might turn into Stormy Weather</i>

‎ Stormy Weather,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.780
‎people have told you
‎that you'll never change.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.780
‎Well, they're right!

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.220
‎People don't change, they grow.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.780
‎This time,
‎your powers will be even stronger,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.580
‎as you know them well.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.180
‎Show them how you're able to control
‎all the forces of Nature!

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.740
‎All right, Hawk Moth!

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.260
‎-My father will never change.
‎-I like people who never change.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.820
‎That way,

‎Does this mean my life will never change?

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.540
‎Course not. Don't worry!

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.660

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.020
<i>‎You're finally going to school.</i>

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.940
<i>‎You know I find it weird for a boy</i>

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.340
<i>‎your age to love going to school so much</i>
<i>‎when you could stay home.</i>

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.820
<i>‎I was tired of being cooped up at home,</i>

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.020
<i>‎never seeing anyone</i>
<i>‎because of my father.</i>

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.060
<i>‎I met a lot of friends at school.</i>

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.780
‎See? You've already started to change!

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.140
‎But Father still hasn't.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.340
‎You sure about that?

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.460
<i>‎He didn't punish you after you went</i>
<i>‎to the movies with that girl.</i>

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.940
‎ <i>‎True.</i>

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.060
<i>‎We even watched mother's movie together</i>
<i>‎instead.</i>

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.580
‎ <i>‎And you played a duet</i>
<i>‎on the piano with him.</i>

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.660
‎ <i>‎And he allowed me</i>
<i>‎to meet my friends afterwards.</i>

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.780
<i>‎And, for once,</i>
<i>‎his birthday gift was amazing.</i>

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.940
‎Hey, dude.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.300
‎Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chains.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.060
‎Yeah, can you believe my dad
‎got this for me?

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.700
‎It's so awesome.
‎He's given me the same lame pen

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.180
‎for three years in a row.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
‎Wow. I guess anyone can change.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.140
‎Adults can be cool
‎when you least expect it.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.820
‎Your father's like a wheel of cheese
‎with a very thick rind.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.980
‎Once you manage to sink
‎your teeth into it,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.700
‎you realize it's all soft inside.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.180
‎Or slightly rotten.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.540
‎You're really gross, but you're right.
‎Thank you.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.780
‎It's not me, I swear!
‎I didn't use my Cataclysm!

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.380
‎Oh! What is that?

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.660
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.580
‎I'm going to use this volcano

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.620
‎to move the Earth away from the sun.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.860
‎Soon, the world will plunge
‎into a perpetual winter

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.460
‎and earthlings will be nothing
‎but frozen food!

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.740
‎Then you'll realize
‎just how powerful I really am!

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.580
‎-Can she really do that?
‎-Probably.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.300
‎But don't worry, Kitty.
‎We won't let her rain on Paris' parade!

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.940
‎Hey! Was that a pun I heard, Milady?

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.860
‎Yup! A little change is good,
‎don't ya think?

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.020
‎I love that girl!

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.140
<i>‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.900
<i>‎Astronauts confirmed</i>
<i>‎that our planet has shifted off its axis</i>

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.260
<i>‎and is moving away from the sun.</i>

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.980
‎She seems way stronger

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.740
‎-than the first time around.
‎-And it's that brat Chloé's fault again!

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.500
‎If only things could go back
‎to the way they were

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.900
‎before Hawk Moth.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.620
‎You mean, before we met?

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.300
‎No, of course not.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.380
‎I didn't mean it that way.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.180
‎It's weird to think of it,

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.220
‎but if it weren't for Hawk Moth,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.180
‎you and I might not be here right now.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.340
‎ <i>‎Actually,</i>
<i>‎it's thanks to Ladybug we're together.</i>

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.780
<i>‎True, and for becoming superheroes too.</i>

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.820
<i>‎Both of us.</i>

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.940
‎Rena Rouge and Carapace,
‎I need you both.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.900
‎You're Rena Rouge?

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.420
‎Of course I am. Trixx, let's pounce!

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.220
‎So awesome!

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.700
‎Wayzz, shell on!

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.180
‎ <i>‎I suspected you were Carapace</i>
<i>‎from the very beginning.</i>

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.500
‎So there's nothing I can hide from you?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.980
‎You've always been a terrible liar!

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.740
‎Alya! Nino! That villain that makes

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.860
‎the weather bad, she's too scary!

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.500
‎-Protect us!
‎- Come on, flyweights!

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.460
‎No need to worry. I'll protect you!

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.300
‎One thing's for sure,
‎we aren't going anywhere!

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.660
‎What is she doing? She needs to come

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.700
‎and give me my Miraculous right now!

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.700
‎Aren't I the best superhero of them all?

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.140
‎Yes, of course you are!

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.380
‎-Nobody's nicer than me!
‎- So true, Chloé!

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.340
‎Since no one is owning up,
‎the whole school will be punished!

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.660
‎What? I'm not so sure my father will react

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.540
‎kindly to me being punished without proof.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.300
‎Oh, no!
‎Please don't disturb the busy mayor.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.900
‎The whole school is punished,
‎except for Miss Bourgeois.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.140
‎Sabrina who? I don't know any Sabrina.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.420
‎But of course you do, Chloé.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.820
‎It's me!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.580
‎Your BFF.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.900
‎You should talk to her. She's right here.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.780
‎Hmm? I don't see anyone.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.500
‎I just don't understand
‎why she's not coming!

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.700
‎Especially since she could've never
‎defeated Despair Bear without you!

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.980
‎-Chloé, would you be so kind?
‎-OK, Ladybug.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.060
‎-Ladybug, what are you doing?
‎-Oh, nothing.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.540
‎Just saving your skin
‎with the help of our new little sidekick.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.140
‎ <i>‎Then there were the times</i>
<i>‎when you were Queen Bee!</i>

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.460
‎I've always dreamed
‎of doing this with you!

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.020
‎We must work together as a team,
‎all right, Queen Bee?

00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.660
‎Venom!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.380
‎Your turn, Ladybug!

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.100
‎ Pound it.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.460
‎You really are the best of the best!

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.140
‎And Ladybug's such a lamey
‎for being a no-show.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.820
‎Hey, stop it!
‎Don't talk about Ladybug like that!

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.420
‎Ah! Finally! Oh!

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.420
‎So, Chloé Bourgeois, you still think
‎my power is "utterly ridiculous"?

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.020
‎Ugh! This is just proof that I was right.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.780
‎Once a villain, always a villain!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.700
‎You'll never defeat me! I'm a hurricane!

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.220
‎ <i>‎Ouch! It's true.</i>
<i>‎She really is a lot stronger than before!</i>

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.740
<i>‎But we're also stronger than before.</i>

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.300
<i>‎Cat Noir and I know one another better,</i>

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.660
<i>‎and we've learned how to fight together!</i>

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.580
‎ We still don't know
‎where his akuma is hidden.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.380
‎This might be a good time
‎to use your Lucky Charm.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.420
‎I needed all of us to make it work.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.100
‎I can't do anything with it now.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.540
‎Over to you, Cat Noir.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.940
‎-We are Ladybug...
‎-And Cat Noir.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.140
<i>‎We've learned to trust each other.</i>

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.540
‎Spots off.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.140
‎Claws in.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.180
<i>‎And now we have new superpowers!</i>

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.300
‎Aqua Tikki, spots on!
‎Yeah!

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.860
‎Plagg Glacier, claws out!

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.980
‎We've been through a lot together.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.260
‎We won't let Stormy Weather defeat us.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.060
‎As usual, I completely agree with you,
‎Bugaboo!

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.020
<i>‎The further the Earth moves away</i>

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.940
<i>‎from the sun, the colder it will get.</i>

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.420
<i>‎You're outside. How's it going?</i>

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.180
<i>‎We're down to minus 40, Nadja.</i>
<i>‎It's getting very difficult.</i>

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.700
<i>‎But Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
<i>‎have donned ice suits,</i>

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.180
<i>‎so they can battle Stormy Weather.</i>

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.900
<i>‎Everything OK, Clara?</i>
<i>‎The picture's gone down!</i>

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.060
<i>‎The temperature cracked the camera.</i>

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.500
<i>‎But I can view the battle.</i>
<i>‎Everything's fine.</i>

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.180
<i>‎Icebug just called up her Lucky Charm.</i>

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.940
‎She's got... a small object.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.620
‎It looks like a pencil.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.700
‎What is she going to do with that?

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.700
‎ Will Ladybug do some coloring?

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.460
<i>‎Cat Noir is holding up a copy machine.</i>

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.820
‎I can't see much, but it looks like
‎Ladybug is making a photocopy.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.860
‎Whoa! That was a huge flash.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.060
<i>‎Wait!</i>
<i>‎Stormy Weather has been defeated!</i>

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.300
‎ Yeah!

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.620
‎ Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.260
‎Queen Bee would have done it
‎a thousand times better and faster!

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.780
‎One of these days,
‎I'll send you both into orbit,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.860
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir!

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.820
‎ You can do it, Marinette!

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.780
<i>‎-</i><i>‎ </i><i>‎Yes?</i>
<i>‎-Uh... Hello. I'm Marinette!</i>

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.180
<i>‎I'm in Adrien's class.</i>

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.100
<i>‎I'm bringing him the work he missed today</i>

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.100
<i>‎and the homework that's due tomorrow.</i>

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.100
<i>‎Tell him it's from Marinette,</i>
<i>‎his friend from school</i>

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.220
<i>‎and that I did it as a friend,</i>
<i>‎to help him, OK?</i>

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.900
‎ <i>‎I will.</i>

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.980
‎"See you tomorrow at school.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.220
‎Love, your friend Marinette."

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.460
‎Good job!
‎We've got a new-and-improved Marinette!

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.980
‎She's really so amazing and classy.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.900
<i>‎She has always been that way.</i>

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.780
<i>‎She never changes,</i>
<i>‎she's just so... Ladybug.</i>

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.100
<i>‎You mean like the time she stood you up</i>

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.220
<i>‎after you invited her on a romantic date</i>
<i>‎on a Paris rooftop?</i>

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.740
<i>‎Or when she told you</i>
<i>‎that she was in love with someone else?</i>

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.460
‎I don't want to play around
‎with your feelings.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.900
‎It would be lying to you.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.660
‎-I don't want to do that.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.260
‎You're more than a partner, Cat Noir,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.460
‎you're my friend
‎and I'd never want to lie to a friend.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.420
‎But why do you think it would be lying?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.700
‎Because there's this boy I...

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.460
‎There's a boy? Who is... ?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.740
‎ It's...

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.380
‎I can't tell you who it is.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.140
‎We can't know anything about each other.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.900
‎Our identities must remain a secret.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.900
‎We're both superheroes, Cat Noir.
‎We don't have a choice.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.300
‎I get it, Ladybug.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.620
‎Your friendship means everything to me.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.420
‎You can keep the rose.
‎It goes with your costume.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.100
‎Why don't you look
‎for another girl to love?

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.020
‎One who's actually... available?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.300
‎The heart wants what the heart wants.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.900
‎You can't change your feelings.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.500
‎-Yes?

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.180
‎Marinette brought you the lessons
‎you missed today.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.460
‎She copied them out by hand.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.820
‎She wanted me to tell you she did it
‎as a friend, to help you.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.660
‎Thank you, Nathalie.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.740
‎"See you tomorrow at school.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.620
‎Love, your friend Marinette."

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.300
‎I'd never noticed Marinette's writing.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.900
‎Remember this unsigned
‎card I got on Valentine's Day?

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.140
‎Whoa! Hold up!
‎Someone answered my poem?

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.420
‎But I threw it away!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.860
‎"Your hair shines like the sun.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.340
‎Your eyes are gorgeous green.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.740
‎I look at you and wonder
‎your innermost thoughts and dreams.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.500
‎Yes, your Valentine I will be,
‎our love will be so true.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.860
‎Together for eternity,
‎my heart belongs to you."

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.100
‎Well, anyone who writes as sickeningly

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.860
‎sweet as you must be your soulmate.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.020
<i>‎See you tomorrow. Your friend, Marinette.</i>

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.220
‎It couldn't have been from Ladybug,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.740
‎but from someone at school. But Marinette?

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.620
‎Phew! Hopefully, he didn't see me.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.420
‎-Hey, Marinette.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.420
‎How's it going?

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.020
‎After what happened at your place
‎last night, I was worried--

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.900
‎Oh, so you watched the show?

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.980
‎Well, uh... Look,
‎about what you saw on the show,

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.820
‎-the totographs in my room.
‎-You mean the photographs?

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.700
‎The grotographs, exactly!
‎It... it's not what you think.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.540
‎See, I'm really into fashion and, um...

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.180
‎Are you lying?

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.460
‎No! I'm so not into you.
‎I mean, sure, I'm interested in you,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.580
‎but, um, not in that way.
‎Well, you know.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.180
‎Just teasing. I understand. Don't worry.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.420
‎No, she couldn't possibly
‎be in love with me.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.540
‎She's just a friend who loves fashion.
‎Besides, there's Luka.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.460
‎It's just someone who has similar writing.
