&lrm;[Tikki] Invite him to a movie, then.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.060
&lrm;[Marinette] Right, Tikki.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.380
&lrm;Imagine that.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.340
&lrm;Hey, Adrien. Would you like to...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.740
&lrm;[spluttering]

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.300
&lrm;Exactly. I can't help it.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.660
&lrm;Every time I see him,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.300
&lrm;I get all clammy and I feel like fainting.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.220
&lrm;So you have to be blindfolded
&lrm;to have a normal conversation with him?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.380
&lrm;Pretty much.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.140
&lrm;There is a simple solution.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.780
&lrm;It's called a phone.
&lrm;You just need his number.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.940
&lrm;I know who'll have it.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.540
&lrm;I'm sure you've outdone yourself, Theo.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
&lrm;It was my honor.
&lrm;I can't wait to meet Ladybug.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.500
&lrm;I hope she signs my photo.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.700
&lrm;I used it as the inspiration
&lrm;for the statue.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.940
&lrm;It's nearly time.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.060
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;should already be here by now.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.140
&lrm;We know improv's not your bag,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.940
&lrm;so stick to this script.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.540
&lrm;The teachers say
&lrm;I don't sound natural when I read

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820
&lrm;Then memorize it. It's pretty simple.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.220
&lrm;You can do it.
&lrm;Just don't improvise, got it?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.020
&lrm;Forget it. It's never gonna work.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.220
&lrm;Too late.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.340
&lrm;It's dialing.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.460
&lrm;It's gone to voicemail.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.100
&lrm;Leave a message. Don't improv'.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.460
&lrm;Hello, Adrien's voicemail...

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.180
&lrm;This is Marinette... who...
&lrm;has a message...

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.580
&lrm;for you, of course,
&lrm;because it's your phone, so...

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.180
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;Call me, see you later, bye.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.580
&lrm;What did you expect?
&lrm;"Hey, hot stuff. It's Marinette.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.220
&lrm;"I'd ask you out

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.460

&lrm;that the only way to talk to you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.340
&lrm;"is over this stupid phone."

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.060

&lrm;[she sobs]

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.460
&lrm;It's not as bad as you think.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.420
&lrm;Ok, it's bad,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.500
&lrm;but you had to tell him one day,
&lrm;some way or another.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780
&lrm;Think of it this way, no more secrets.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.860
&lrm;The voicemail recorded
&lrm;my whole conversation.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.380
&lrm;-Big deal.
&lrm;-I called him hot stuff.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.820
&lrm;He can't hear that message, Alya.
&lrm;If he does, I'll die of shame.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.420
&lrm;OK, I've an idea.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.780
&lrm;If his phone went to voicemail,
&lrm;it means he's busy.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.740
&lrm;That means you can get to it
&lrm;before he does.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.860
&lrm;I wonder where he'd be?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.900
&lrm;Of course. He's got fencing after school.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.940
&lrm;That's why he didn't pick up.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.860
&lrm;It ends in 22.5 minutes.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.020
&lrm;You're insane.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.380
&lrm;You know that, right?

<i>&lrm;You have one new message.</i>

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.620

&lrm;[he burps]
&lrm;You have one new message.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.460
&lrm;Move please,
&lrm;so I can check my voicemail.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.900
&lrm;I don't recognize this number.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.580
&lrm;Oh no, we're late!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.300

&lrm;Hey, everybody.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.620
&lrm;They're unveiling Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir sculptures today.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.820
&lrm;I totally spaced.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940
&lrm;Me too.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.580
&lrm;You never mentioned
&lrm;going to the unveiling.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.180
&lrm;I'm not, I mean I am...
&lrm;I mean, I forgot?

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.540
&lrm;Listen, about Adrien's cell phone...
&lrm;What if we go after?

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.900
&lrm;After the ceremony,
&lrm;his fencing training will be over,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.660
&lrm;and he'll have his phone back by then.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.700
&lrm;Shoot. I gotta cover this event
&lrm;for the Ladyblog.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.540
&lrm;I'm sorry, Marinette.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.620
&lrm;Don't sweat it. I can manage...

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.900
&lrm;I think.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.860
&lrm;-You sure?
&lrm;-Yes, yes, I'm sure.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.060
&lrm;Cool, good luck.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.580
&lrm;Stay out of trouble.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.500
&lrm;And don't improv'.

&lrm;[car horn]

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.740
&lrm;Isn't Ladybug supposed to be
&lrm;at the unveiling?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.380
&lrm;Yes, but Marinette needs to be
&lrm;at the school first.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.500
&lrm;But it is a ceremony in your honor.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.740
&lrm;And it's my honor that's at stake.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.060
&lrm;I'll be in and out in 5 minutes.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.660
&lrm;We can be at the ceremony in no time.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.260
&lrm;Excuse me Cat Noir,
&lrm;but Ladybug's not here.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.340
&lrm;Don't worry. She'll be here soon.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.820
&lrm;I can handle it for now.
&lrm;I'm the one in charge anyway.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.580
&lrm;I wanted to ask her to sign this photo.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.780
&lrm;She's amazing.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.900
&lrm;She's so brave...

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.900
&lrm;And smart...

&lrm;The way she saves everyone.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.660
&lrm;Perhaps we should commence.
&lrm;It might bring her here faster.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.460
&lrm;Just a minute more, Mayor Bourgeois.
&lrm;She is going to come. I can feel it.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.700
&lrm;In there.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.140
&lrm;[Tikki] Oh boy.

&lrm;Which one's his?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.900
&lrm;Call him. His phone will ring.

&lrm;Can I get some photos?

&lrm;I'm actually taller than her.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.220
&lrm;Ladybug didn't show. I just wanted to...

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.460
&lrm;express my adoration for her.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.100
&lrm;Let her know that everything I had
&lrm;went into her statue..

&lrm;If she took time to get to know me,

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.420
&lrm;and I'll never get to go
&lrm;to the movies with Adrien.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.380
&lrm;You need to get your priorities in order.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.660
&lrm;I know.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.820
&lrm;Some days it feels impossible
&lrm;to balance being Marinette

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.540
&lrm;and being Ladybug.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.620

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.340
&lrm;It must still be at the gym.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.700
&lrm;Don't mind me.
&lrm;Just stealing this painting.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.180
&lrm;Go about your business.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.380
&lrm;[alarm rings]
&lrm;Hey!

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.820
&lrm;[groaning]

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.100
&lrm;I gotta get this on camera.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.380
<i>&lrm;And in some astonishing news,</i>
<i>&lrm;there's been a theft at the Louvre.</i>

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.860
<i>&lrm;Amateur videos show</i>

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.300
<i>&lrm;that the thief is none other</i>
<i>&lrm;than the famous hero, Cat Noir.</i>

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.140
<i>&lrm;This painting is the cat's meow.</i>

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.980
&lrm;The "cat's meow"?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.260
&lrm;Not only is he a fake,
&lrm;he's a terrible fake.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.820
<i>&lrm;Thanks JD. Now for your weather.</i>

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.860
&lrm;Of course Adrien owns
&lrm;a super-expensive hi-tech smartphone.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.340
&lrm;I can't even figure out how it works.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.700
&lrm;It would help
&lrm;if you took off those silly mittens.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.220
&lrm;And risk leaving finger prints? No way.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.980
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.300
<i>&lrm;Problem fixed?</i>

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.020
&lrm;Almost. I haven't erased the message
&lrm;yet but I'm working on it now.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.300
<i>&lrm;No way. You palmed his phone?</i>

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.940
&lrm;Yes... No...

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.420
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;I was planning to give it back.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.700
&lrm;Where are you? I could use some help.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.740
<i>&lrm;No can do.</i>

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.780
&lrm;I'm waiting for details
&lrm;on the Cat Noir robbery.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.460
&lrm;What? Somebody robbed Cat Noir?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.100
&lrm;No, girl. Didn't you hear?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.580
&lrm;Cat Noir came in and stole the Mona Lisa,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.980
<i>&lrm;in broad daylight.</i>

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.820
<i>&lrm;Ladybug's gonna turn up,</i>
<i>&lrm;and I don't wanna miss it.</i>

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.140
<i>&lrm;Chill. I'll be over later.</i>

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.580
&lrm;OK.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.660
&lrm;Cat Noir is a lot of things,
&lrm;but he's no thief.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.580
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.780
&lrm;Tikki, Spots on!

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.420
&lrm;Easy, tigers, you've got the wrong cat.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.660
&lrm;That thief's an impostor.
&lrm;I'm the real Cat Noir.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.540
&lrm;Let me check it out.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.020
&lrm;I have a knack for finding clues,
&lrm;you know, animal instincts.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.700
&lrm;Of course. Come with me.
&lrm;Thanks for your help.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.900
&lrm;Hey. I'm the real Cat Noir.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.060
&lrm;I'm way slicker than that guy.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.060
&lrm;Kitty's in the slammer,
&lrm;I repeat, kitty's in the slammer.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.420
&lrm;Mr. Mayor, this is ridiculous.
&lrm;I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.100
&lrm;Kitty's in the slammer, Ladybug.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.380
&lrm;Don't think you're gonna...

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.580
&lrm;Now, now, leave it to the experts.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.900
&lrm;We've got it under control.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.020
&lrm;Thanks for the hospitality
&lrm;but I gotta split.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.260
&lrm;So, I'll say this one more time.
&lrm;You've got the wrong cat!

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.980
<i>&lrm;Cat Noir's getting away.</i>

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.300
&lrm;If he's so innocent,
&lrm;why is he running away?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.100
&lrm;If you were wrongly imprisoned,
&lrm;wouldn't you?

<i>&lrm;You know I'm innocent, don't you, Bugaboo?</i>

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.300
&lrm;Stop calling me Bugaboo. This is serious.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.500
&lrm;I'm gonna find the culprit
&lrm;and save my tail.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.860
&lrm;I'll get back to...

&lrm;Aren't you gonna go after him?

&lrm;I'll leave it to the experts.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.340

&lrm;How did I not see that jealousy coming?

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.420
&lrm;Yours or his?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.500
&lrm;[sarcastic laugh] So funny.

&lrm;She won't be duped. She knows me too well.

&lrm;You're right. She loves me.

&lrm;That's why she'll be able
&lrm;to reveal your true identity.

&lrm;Simply amazing, isn't it?

&lrm;If you don't believe I'm Cat Noir,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.740
&lrm;ask him about our love for each other.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.820
&lrm;Have I ever lied to you, Bugagoo?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.260
&lrm;I hope you didn't tell him about us.

&lrm;What?

&lrm;That we're... you know...

&lrm;We made a secret promise.

&lrm;Yes... Of course.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.500
&lrm;We never made a promise,

&lrm;Photo in his pocket. Let's make it snappy.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.460

&lrm;Don't rub it in.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.500
&lrm;I told you I was better than him.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.860
&lrm;But I'm better than both of you.

&lrm;-Hey, it's me.
&lrm;-He's lying. I'm the real one.

&lrm;Now you're both annoying me.

&lrm;Gotcha.

&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

&lrm;I'm glad you could tell
&lrm;the real Cat from the fake.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.220
&lrm;Once I figured out
&lrm;which cat really loved me,

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.860
&lrm;it was a no-brainer.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.180
&lrm;Better help him out.
&lrm;His crush just got crushed.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.580
&lrm;That makes two of us.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.820
&lrm;What am I doing here?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.180
&lrm;Ladybug?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.660
&lrm;Sorry I couldn't make it
&lrm;this morning, Theo.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.620
&lrm;Can you sign it for me?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.180
&lrm;Of course I can.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.020
&lrm;You've got some real artistry here.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.380
&lrm;You really captured my essence.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.940
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.860
&lrm;And don't worry,
&lrm;I know about you and Cat Noir, it's OK.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.180
&lrm;Didn't find it.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.260
<i>&lrm;To hear your message, press 1.</i>

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.180
<i>&lrm;To erase your message, press 2.</i>

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.460
<i>&lrm;Your message has been erased.</i>

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.700
&lrm;I'm gonna tell him I found his phone.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.260
&lrm;That'd be a good way to start
&lrm;a conversation, wouldn't it?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.460
&lrm;Then I'll ask him out.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.140
&lrm;That's my girl.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.820
&lrm;[Nino] Maybe you dropped it.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.460
&lrm;Then whoever has it
&lrm;found it in the locker room.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.620
&lrm;[Alya whispers] Do it now.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.060
&lrm;I had it during fencing practice.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.900
&lrm;What in the...?

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.540
&lrm;I already looked in here.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.060
&lrm;You need some time off.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.100
&lrm;I know, let's go to the movies.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.900
&lrm;Hey, dudes,
&lrm;mind if a few friends tag along?

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.260
&lrm;Sure thing!

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.020
&lrm;Yay!
