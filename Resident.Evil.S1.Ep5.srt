[young Jade] Why?

[Simon] Some old guy crashed the party,

one o'clock in the morning.

And my mother, she's super pissed.

00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,102
She nearly murdered me
for walking in so late.

What do you know
about the first Raccoon City?

Um, it, it… it blew up.
It was some sort of gas leak.

Yeah, well, the blog guy,

[Simon] Nothing about
the original Raccoon City in his docs.

It's mostly just research articles.

A lot of stuff by some guy
named William Birkin.

I mean, web-wise, he's got MSNBC
and Science Daily bookmarked.

is just old people shit,

In an embryo,
there are ways you can… help.

658
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,786
Select for certain traits,
edit strands of DNA to give the child…

659
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:56,788
advantages.

660
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,833
Remember when we lived by St. Patrick's?
[breathes heavily]

661
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,836
I found you outside one day talking
to the nuns in fluent Spanish.

662
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,129
You were four.

663
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,924
You've always been exceptional.

664
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,092
And your body,
how you fought off the virus,

665
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,761
I've never seen anything like it.

666
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,056
So what?
[sighs]

667
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,059
We're like your science experiments?

668
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,812
You're my daughters. I'm your father.

669
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,233
Then why are you taking our blood?

670
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,568
[pensive music]

671
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:35,494
Umbrella… made you possible.
They, they want me to monitor you.

672
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,373
So we're their experiments.

673
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,750
[sighs]

674
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,836
[inhales]
Do you know a man named Angel Rubio?

675
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,755
[dramatic music]

676
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,552
Right now, Umbrella
has him tied up, beaten.

677
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,222
That's where I was. He said he knew you.

678
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,224
[Albert] Did you see him? Talk to him?

679
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,895
Well, you don't know
what Umbrella will do if--

680
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,314
Fucking stop blaming them!

681
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:09,069
This is you! You did this!

682
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:11,446
[scoffs]

683
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,493
You're right, but I still need to know.

684
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,956
[tense music]

685
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:28,255
We didn't tell him anything,
but he knows I got bit.

686
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,341
[tense music continues]

687
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,220
Well, you need to let me go.
Look, this is my fault.

688
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,806
But if the company finds out
you were infected?

689
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,100
[Albert] They won't stop
until they have you.

690
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,977
That girl in the video,
you saw what they did to her.

691
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,312
What you did to her.

692
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,606
[sighs]

693
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:48,358
I'm the reason you're still alive.

694
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:51,153
[Albert] The bag,
it's all to keep you safe.

695
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,405
Angel hasn't told them
anything yet, but he will.

696
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,949
-[Albert] I need to get to him.
-And do what?

697
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,328
Keep protecting you.

698
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,207
[gloomy music]

699
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,086
[scoffs]

700
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:14,593
-This is bullshit.
-[Albert] I know you hate me.

701
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:16,928
And right now…

702
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,016
I'm the only one who can save you.

703
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,980
So let me save you.

704
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,909
[emotional music]

705
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,627
You're not going to hurt him, right?

706
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,297
Stay safe.

707
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:57,719
[somber music continues]

708
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:04,309
[sighs]

709
00:44:04,393 --> 00:44:06,436
[dramatic music]

710
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,440
No!
[grunting]

711
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:12,943
[grunting continues]

712
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,531
[music intensifies]

713
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,157
[hisses]

714
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,169
[gasps in disbelief]

715
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:34,965
Hi, sis.

716
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,052
No.

717
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:45,809
[somber music]
