00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:17,805
No, show me right now.

00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,075
You jerk.

6
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,776
You got your preview.

7
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,185
So should the tutoring continue?

8
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,426
Forget it.

11
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,026
Here. Take it.

12
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:51,506
Don't you ever show me this color chart again.

13
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:59,646
Choi Yeon Woo, you're pretty when you're angry too!

14
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,086
Remember that the beneficiary of my life insurance policy is you.

15
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:42,616
Are you off to your death or something?

16
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,955
I'll be at an island for a month to cover a story.

17
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,925
- A month? - Yes.

18
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,166
There's enough money in your account for expenses.

19
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,765
- I'll get going. - Aunt Yi Rang, wait.

20
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,136
What is it?

21
00:01:58,806 --> 00:01:59,935
Be safe out there.

22
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,216
- I'll come back in one piece. - Got it.

23
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,616
Take care.

24
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:29,095
Darn it!

25
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,776
Forget about the class leader and call me the class servant.

26
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,746
Shouldn't they at least provide some snacks...

27
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:42,945
when they give me such a task?

28
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,826
Grandpa said you'd be craving snacks today.

29
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,255
Thanks.

30
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:58,796
Yeon Woo, have one too.

31
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:00,665
Right. Thanks.

32
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:03,905
It'd be rude of me only to accept this,

33
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,065
so milk will be on me.

34
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,206
Where's mine?

35
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,475
"Twisted doughnuts become round doughnuts,"

36
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,375
"and round doughnuts become twisted doughnuts."

37
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:17,445
"Macbeth."

38
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,116
Don't change the subject.

39
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,255
Is Joo Haeng your only friend? Give me one too.

40
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,586
Are you kissing up to him because he's the class leader?

41
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,625
Shouldn't you be at practice?

42
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,855
I'm back from it.

43
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,296
That's for Min Jae!

44
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,866
You've known me since elementary school...

45
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,165
and have been friends with Min Jae since last year,

46
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,806
but all you care about is Yeon Woo right now.

47
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,875
Yeon Woo is special...

48
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:44,806
unlike the two of you.

49
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,776
I guess I'd rather quit being friends with you...

50
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,345
than wait for you to care for me.

51
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,415
Yeon Woo, join me at the science lab later.

52
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,216
Me? Why?

53
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:55,716
You'll know once we're there.

54
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,595
(Safety first)

55
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:12,436
(Safety first)

56
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:24,285
Seriously. Talk about a stupid joke?

57
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,386
Wait, do you have a fear of blood?

58
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,425
- Yes. - Since when?

59
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,566
I'm just nervous when I'm with you.

60
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:45,035
- Because I'm a probe? - No.

61
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:47,776
Because you'll talk rubbish.

62
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:51,076
That's something I never do. I'm nothing but serious.

63
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,485
Trust me and follow my lead.

64
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,905
It's nice and cozy here...

65
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,436
like a hideout.

66
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:26,206
Hideouts are only as good as the experiments done in secret.

67
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:27,675
What are you about to do?

68
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:33,586
First, take a seat right here.

69
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:39,055
Look at me.

70
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:40,756
Wait, are you...

71
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,055
Are you awake now?

72
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,725
I wanted to show you a rainbow,

73
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,956
but it wouldn't rain.

74
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,035
Made by a prism.

75
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:44,355
Can I touch it?

76
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,456
Me?

77
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:50,925
Sure.

78
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,636
It's all yours.

79
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,405
I know what it was...

80
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:03,175
since I had seen a gray-colored rainbow before.

81
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,716
But looking at one with all its natural colors...

82
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,285
was a first for me.

83
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:22,495
Red,

84
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,126
orange, yellow, green,

85
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:31,006
blue, navy, and purple.

86
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,336
Changing the angle of the light...

87
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:40,045
will have one end of the rainbow seem longer.

88
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,165
It's so pretty.

89
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,376
What are you doing?

90
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:24,086
Let me see it again.

91
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:25,926
Go Yoo Han!

92
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:30,595
I will only wait until this week.

93
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,196
Was this another 10-minute preview?

94
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,036
Why do you want me to agree to this deal?

95
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,796
You already see enough of my face!

96
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:38,605
The colors of this world...

97
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:40,936
are yours to enjoy...

98
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,936
only when I let you see them.

99
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,156
Go Yoo Han.

100
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:02,125
Then you should know that I'm more than that to you.

101
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,595
A mono and his probe.

102
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,696
That's what I am, aren't I?

103
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:10,666
I want to see the colors.

104
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,206
You got your preview.

105
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,875
So should the tutoring continue?

106
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,206
They're yours to enjoy.

107
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,755
It's so pretty.

108
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,466
When a mono meets a probe, it leads to an obsession.

109
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,895
Would it be any different for me?

110
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,916
(Aunt Yi Rang)

111
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,615
Hello?

112
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,225
Yeon Woo,

113
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,796
the family on the news today committed plain suicide.

114
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:09,456
It has nothing to do with one being a mono.

115
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:12,725
The husband is one, but his wife isn't a probe.

116
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,495
The initial media report got it wrong.

117
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:15,836
On the news?

118
00:10:15,836 --> 00:10:18,206
Yes, so don't be bothered by it.

Where's Myeong Hun?

122
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,056
I'd like to know myself.

123
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:36,885
The reporter got it wrong.

124
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,656
It'll take some time to correct the error,

125
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:39,985
so don't let it get to you in the meantime.

126
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:43,725
Aunt Yi Rang, when did I ever let things like this get to me?

127
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:45,895
Just turn the TV off.

128

(Speaker)

129
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,836
Don't look up the case online.

130
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,336
The murder didn't happen because he was mono,

131
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,836
so don't be bothered by it.

132
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:57,906
It's nothing that you need to worry about anyway...

133
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,345
since you don't have a probe yet.

136
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,456
Aunt Yi Rang,

137
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,426
I met my probe.

138
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:20,625
His name is Go Yoo Han and is nothing but unpredictable.

139
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:22,735
Yeon Woo.

140
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:26,765
Yeon Woo?

141
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,436
Yes?

142
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,605
The wife stepping out on the husband...

143
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:33,005
is only a speculation, so don't believe it.

144
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,515
So what about you? Is your story coming along?

145
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:40,086
Yes, it's great here. The food is especially delicious.

146
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:43,515
I had mulhoe yesterday and black pork today.

147
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,456
She can send me all these photos,

148
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:51,725
but I still know that she went there to find clues about Mom.

149
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:55,735
Enough with the photos of food. It's like you're teasing me.

150
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:59,166
Right. Well, I'll buy some omegi rice cake on my way home.

151
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,265
Bye.

152
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:03,135
If Mom's disappearance is related to other mono cases,

153
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,845
investigating the case will be just as dangerous.

154
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,475
Still, her priority always seems to be my well-being.

155
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:16,786
I am a mono and I doubt I'm different from other monos.

156
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,536
Why won't you run away from me though?

157
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,605
A probe should run away after meeting a mono, you idiot.

158
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,196
This darkness, this boredom...

159
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,865
Maybe just living this way...

162
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:05,706
What.

163
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,566
- Where are you? - Home.

164
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,076
I didn't save his number for I never wanted to get close to him.

165
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:21,186
But it turns out that I already know it by heart.

166
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:22,786
Yoo Han's calling me.

167
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:28,056
I shouldn't answer. I should decline.

168
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,036
Yeon Woo, I'm outside your house.

169
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,765
