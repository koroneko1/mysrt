Alright, I will call for his house

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.730
Lam, don't call for Dung's family

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.870
He said to me that he was on the way to my house

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.570
Oh... oh... oh... ah... ah...

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.230

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.200
Wanna pick a bad?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.550
What's wrong? Just sit down.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.690
I've sat already.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.540
You are Thao's younger brother, right?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.230

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.040
How to describe it?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.640
How am I?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.080
You're the one who don't know how to enjoy your luckiness.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.040
Luckiness?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.560
Your sister is too pretty... But why don't you thank for the God?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.100
Why do I have to thank?

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.560

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.150
No, no.... Give me her phone number!

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.120
Oops! Why am I hungry suddenly like this?

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.550
Hungry? Too easy

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.550

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.410
Seem like, I had owed your previous life, right?

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.080
Why do you keep following me?

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.510
Because I like...

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.840

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.420

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.770
You have woken up?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.040
I see you sleep very deeply, so I've asked for allowing you to be late 2 first classes

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.980
I said that you went to do some works for me

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.370
Khoi! Don't leave me, Khoi!

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.070
But why are you so hurry?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.630

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.680
Thought what?

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.020
Thought about who? or you're thinking about...

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.180
Hey, nothing

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.000
You're the one who change everything. You always talk about Dang

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.200
Do you intend to make the rancor become to love?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.360
Don't be crazy anymore! What is 1 Dang and 2 Dang?

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.940
I do not like him at all

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.140
But you must be the one who are so strange

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.210
Huh? | These days

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.900
You and Mr Tam seem so weird...

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.220
Don't tell me that you intend to be a "rainy brother"!

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.470
Follow to the sadness... | Stop being crazy, Lam!

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.850
But me, I see your exculpation

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.510
and shouting emotion, don't I know?

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.620
Who shouts?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.400
Of course, you

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.450
When do I shout?

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.250
I don't talk to you anymore, I return to my home.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.120
Hey... Damn guy! We are talking...

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.010
You need to care about your leg... Always keep hiding, maybe I'm a blindman!

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.420
Keep following boys and leaving me!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:35.330

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.120
Huh?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.000

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.530
Don't worry

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.160
We...

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.090
have practiced in our best. Now we can only keep trying!

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.650
I need to go to the toilet

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.770
Hey guys

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.790

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.520

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.070
Hey, you haven't changed your sneakers.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.120
You only have 5ms left

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.300
What're you doing? It's hurt

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.640
Stop complaining!

Hurt!
