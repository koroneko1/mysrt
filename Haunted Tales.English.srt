1
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:11,291
TAXI

2
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,458
Do you know why we are here?

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,458
And where we go after death?

4
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,833
BANGKOK AND OTHER PROVINCES

5
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,666
KAMRON REANSUWAN

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,875
Your belongings are in the trunk.

7
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,666
To Soi Inthamara 29?

8
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,125
Yes.

9
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,833
Did I already tell you where I'm going?

10
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,875
You did when you stepped in.

11
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,208
I didn't tell you to do all that.

12
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,375
Don't call me again.

13
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,916
Do you need a ride?

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,208
Just a moment.

15
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,250
This song reminds me of my childhood.

16
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,416
When I was a kid,

17
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,291
I did many mischievous things.

18
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,416
I used to swat a fly…

19
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,125
then put its body in an ant's nest

20
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,041
and watch them dismember the body…

21
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,000
piece by piece.

22
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,083
You've never done such a thing, have you?

23
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,750
You seem like a good kid.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,250
Your parents wouldn't let you
do that, like mine.

25
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,708
I burned a pregnant spider

26
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,083
and watched it die with the spiderlings.

27
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,041
Oh, shit!

28
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,708
What's wrong?

29
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,291
7 DEAD IN HOTEL MASSACRE

30
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,166
It looks so deserted.

31
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,541
No cars on the road.

32
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,375
When we're kids,

33
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
we are like a blank canvas.

34
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,500
But when we grow up,

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,958
the canvas becomes tainted.

36
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,791
Why do you have
such an old newspaper here?

37
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,416
Someone must have left it there.

38
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,833
What a coincidence.

39
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,500
There's an article here about me
when I was a kid.

40
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,916
There's no such thing as coincidence.

41
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,125
Pardon?

42
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,125
Don't mind me.

43
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,666
Watch me, I'll be richer than you.

44
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,958
You're going to take over my company.
Of course you'll be rich, smarty-pants.

45
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,000
Smart just like you.

46
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,875
But don't be a troublemaker like your dad.

47
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,041
Yes, Mom.

48
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,291
How am I a troublemaker?

49
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,958
You'll give him the wrong idea about me.

50
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,041
-Don't listen to your mother.
-Yes, Dad.

51
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,583
You fell asleep again.

52
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,083
Aren't we there yet?

53
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,458
Not yet.

54
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
This area doesn't look familiar.

55
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,625
The route is under construction

56
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,833
so I took the detour.

57
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,666
You sound like you've been
to this area before.

58
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,500
I take passengers here often.

59
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,583
Have you heard that
when it gets late like this,

60
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,958
sometimes…

61
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,041
you see a car coming

62
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,708
and then vanish all of a sudden.

63
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,708
There was a story about a man
who was on his way home.

64
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,750
Then a cab stopped by.

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,916
The driver persuaded him to get on,

66
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,500
then took off…

67
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,666
but he didn't take him home.

68
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,666
He brought him to the next world instead.

69
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,916
Hello, everyone.

70
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,583
Welcome back
to the second part of our show.

71
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,208
Let's get back
to talk to our young realtor,

72
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,000
the one we can call a young millionaire.

73
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,416
Please welcome Pete Peera Tangtongdamrong.

74
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,833
We left off before the break
talking about the approach

75
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,958
that he uses for his real estate business.

76
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,291
Hello, Pete.

77
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,000
Hello.

78
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,375
So, Pete.

79
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,541
Let me ask you this.

80
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,625
Do you have a motto for your work?

81
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,083
Motto?

82
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,625
I do, actually.

83
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,208
We have to keep focused
on our destination,

84
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,000
not on a bump in the road.

85
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,958
How did that interview come up?

86
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,875
It was a long time ago.

87
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,000
Could be frequency interference.

88
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:35,666
Boss.

89
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,875
That realtor is a woman.

90
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
So what?

91
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,041
Do whatever you need, think of something.

92
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,375
Just get her away from me.

93
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,625
So much interference in this area.

94
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,875
What do you want?

95
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,333
What do I want?

96
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,625
How did you get that audio clip?

97
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,625
It's frequency interference.

98
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,125
Bullshit!

99
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,833
What do you want from me?

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
Where are you taking me?

101
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,208
I'm asking you a question. Answer me!

102
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,708
Where are you taking me?
Are you kidnapping me?

103
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,916
You shouldn't have killed her.

104
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,833
Who hired you?

105
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,000
Who hired you?

106
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,333
Pull over now!

107
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,458
I can't.

108
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,458
Bullshit! Do you want to die?

109
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,125
Want to take a bullet? Pull over now!

110
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,708
I can only pull over when we arrive.

111
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,166
What's that?

112
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,750
I pity you.

113
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,791
You have done so many bad things

114
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,291
it's become normal to you.

115
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,250
It's not normal at all,

116
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,333
and you have a choice.

117
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,083
Shit, what the hell!

118
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,500
What the hell!

119
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,583
Listen to me.

120
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,166
It seems so easy for you to shoot me.

121
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,916
Having a woman killed
must be easy for you, right?

122
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,000
Settle this with her then.

123
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,958
Settle what? With whom?

124
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,125
The realtor you gave the order to kill.

125
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,666
I already picked her up.

126
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,666
Shit!

127
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,041
Shit!

128
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,375
-Help me.
-Why did you kill me?

129
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,375
Help me.

130
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,125
Help me.

131
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,791
Help me. Help me.

132
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,083
We'll arrive after we go through
this tunnel.

133
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,958
First… he shot me in the face.

134
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,750
Second shot…

135
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,375
went through my lung.

136
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,208
I couldn't breathe.

137
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,750
I tried to crawl away.

138
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,375
He stepped on my hand until it was broken.

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,333
Help me. Help me.

140
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,291
Help, help.

141
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,916
Third bullet…

142
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
he shot me from behind.

143
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,041
The bullet went through my child.

144
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,583
My unborn child was killed.

145
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,458
It didn't get to see the world.

146
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,583
You!

147
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,875
You're going to get what you deserve!

148
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,208
Alpha Airline flight AG56,
Bangkok - Chiang Mai

149
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,458
has crashed before landing
at Don Mueang Airport,

150
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,791
killing more than 300 passengers.

151
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,458
The officials provided
emergency assistance…

152
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,625
Enough.

153
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,375
You can't kill him twice.

154
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,250
Do you need a ride?

155
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,708
You must get out here as well.

156
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,958
It's time for your judgment.

157
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,375
What is this?

158
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,833
Am I dead?

159
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,333
I can't tell you that.

160
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,250
You have to realize it yourself.

161
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,458
It's not true, I can't die.

162
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,541
I have worked so much.

163
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,041
I haven't spent my money yet.

164
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:00,916
Hey…

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,833
I have a family.
If I died, what about my wife and kid?

166
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,416
Please let me get back.

167
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,666
Let me go, I beg you.

168
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,916
Please let me go back. Let me go back.

169
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
That's just what your parents said.

170
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,458
You met my parents?

171
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,041
They are waiting there.

172
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Dad.

173
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:14,875
Mom.

174
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,833
I did bad things.

175
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,291
I was really bad.

176
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,208
Most of us would do anything for success.

177
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:54,375
We don't consider
the good or bad things we do.

178
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,583
At the end, what we can take

179
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,375
are only virtue and depravity,

180
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,375
not the money
you have spent a lifetime earning.

181
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:48,291
STUCK

182
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,583
Come on, what is it howling for?

183
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,125
Can't believe dogs still howl
when they see ghosts these days.

184
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,416
Motherfucker!

185
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,750
No, you can't fuck your mother.
That's disgusting.

186
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,916
Come on, Cheep!

187
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,875
Stop messing around. You know I'm scared.

188
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,250
Why are you so scared?

189
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,291
I've been here for many years,
never seen anything.

190
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,166
Haven't you heard

191
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:31,250
the rumor about Mr. Wanchai,
the hotel owner?

192
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,041
Someone cast a love spell on him.

193
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,708
Really?

194
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,125
Who did that?

195
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,583
His wife?

196
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,666
Yes.

197
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,458
Come on, Mai.

198
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,791
You are so gullible--

199
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,000
Watch out!

200
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,458
Sorry, ma'am.

201
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,041
I would like to stay in room 644

202
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,916
Seems like room 644…

203
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,958
Nobody takes that room.

204
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,375
You can try to call.

205
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,958
Yes, one moment please.

206
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,708
That's odd. I remember it being taken.

207
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,791
My name is Tiwa.

208
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,458
For one night, please.

209
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you have business around here
in the morning?

210
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,958
I see that you have no luggage.

211
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,375
Aunty Mon, what are you looking for?

212
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,708
There was a mouse…

213
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,833
Aunty.

214
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,000
-What?
-You can't say "mouse".

215
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,833
Are you okay, ma'am?

216
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,250
This way, please.

217
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,833
Ma'am.

218
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,541
Ma'am, this way, please.

219
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,333
This is our best room.

220
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,458
It adjoins to another room,
so you can bring the whole family.

221
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,833
And it has just been cleaned.

222
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,958
Don't blame us if it's too clean.

223
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,208
Let us know if you need more blankets.

224
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,625
Enjoy your stay, ma'am.

225
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,083
Get yourself together.

226
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,875
I'm here to help.

227
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,041
It's gonna be all right.

228
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,458
Don't go in there!

229
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,500
What's up, Som?

230
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,875
Did you check the time?

231
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,250
When did you hear the noise?

232
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,875
A little past midnight?

233
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:14,708
Hurry up, Samarn. We don't have much time.

234
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,875
Ning, don't you know
that I love you so much?

235
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:22,000
Stop talking, we don't have much time.
Hurry up.

236
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:53,250
Wa, are you in that room now?

237
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,708
Will you tell me

238
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,666
what people say on the internet?

239
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,375
A woman…

240
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,916
had an affair with the hotel manager.

241
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,166
They met in room 646.

242
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,416
The one you are standing in right now.

243
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,208
Suddenly, there was a man…

244
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,291
who barged in and shot them both.

245
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:26,875
No! No!

246
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:29,083
The bell boy came to help

247
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:31,666
and tried to take the gun,

248
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,083
but the gun went off

249
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,333
and accidentally shot
the receptionist that came to help.

250
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,416
Don't hurt me.

251
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,125
Before the murderer ran away.

252
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,708
You know…

253
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:04,833
the last one he killed was the maid.

254
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,791
After that…

255
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,500
every night at midnight,

256
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,458
people in that area can hear the wailing

257
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,500
and the sound of gunshots
every single night.

258
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,208
It was unbearable. People moved away.

259
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,333
Can you help them?

260
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,833
It's actually like
what they say on the internet.

261
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:09,708
But the whole thing
is right in front of me.

262
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,458
Of course I'm scared.

263
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,708
Why did you take the job
if you are scared?

264
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,041
When I first agreed to take this case,

265
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:20,916
I thought it was just a simple talk.

266
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,625
That I could just tell them
to move on like other times.

267
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:27,208
Can you help me figure out
what I should do?

268
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,416
Is it true that you can see ghosts?

269
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,208
It is.

270
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,541
When was the first time
you experienced it?

271
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,208
After a near death experience
as an eight-year-old.

272
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,791
But I started to see them more regularly

273
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,458
when I was at the orphanage.

274
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,250
Paew.

275
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,666
Yes, Grandpa.

276
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,791
I'll try to gather as much
information as I can.

277
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,916
You just keep trying, all right?

278
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,041
Why wouldn't I?

279
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,416
You know, at first…

280
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,250
I just told them bluntly.

281
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,541
You are already dead.

282
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,916
Already dead.

283
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,708
You are stuck in this hotel.

284
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,666
Well…

285
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:29,166
Miss, can you really see ghosts?

286
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,875
Of course.

287
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:45,791
And… when will your grandpa
relaunch the hotel?

288
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,125
Grandpa has just told me that

289
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:52,250
you posted a video on YouTube,

290
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,750
that you've done exorcisms before,
that's all.

291
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,041
Get out!

292
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,125
Let me ask you something.

293
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,416
Has anyone ever come
to do an exorcism here?

294
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,916
The spirits in that room

295
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,708
keep repeating the same event

296
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,166
at the same time every night.

297
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,041
So that means someone subdued them.

298
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,791
Don't you have something like…

299
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
a magic knife?

300
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,375
Or a fancy spell

301
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,708
like the other people?

302
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:53,333
That's not how I do things.

303
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,375
Do your exorcisms always work?

304
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,500
So…

305
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,291
let me try again tomorrow, okay?

306
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,708
For the last time,

307
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm gonna make it.

308
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,000
Do you know those people
who died in that room, Grandpa?

309
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:16,916
Back in 1989…

310
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,833
Over 30 years,
difficult to dig for information.

311
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,208
Even today,

312
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,458
the police still haven't found
the guy that shot them.

313
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,375
One of the victims was the owner's wife,

314
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,250
there's still no progress in the case.

315
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,291
It must be cold by now.

316
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,083
The woman in that room
was the owner's wife?

317
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,958
Som, can you contact the officer
who took the case?

318
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,250
I'd like more information.

319
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:52,250
Wa, why are you taking
this one so seriously?

320
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,583
I heard that…

321
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,416
you were stuck
with your parents for a week.

322
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,791
What were you thinking?

323
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:08,208
I only wished that I could keep on living

324
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,541
and do my best in life.

325
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,958
Who put the curse on him?

326
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,625
His wife?

327
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,041
You are so gullible.

328
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,166
-You believe their lies.
-Watch out!

329
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,583
For one night, please.

330
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:46,750
We have to apologize, ma'am.

331
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,625
Our elevator is out of order.

332
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,833
Let me help you with the luggage.

333
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,166
Ma'am?

334
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:10,875
What floor is this?

335
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,083
Get out!

336
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:53,958
Still…

337
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,375
Still here?

338
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,833
Who is still here?

339
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,416
Who is still here?

340
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,791
MURDERER

341
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,750
23:58

342
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,250
STILL HERE

343
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,500
Murderer.

344
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,875
Murderer is still here.

345
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,833
Where? Where is he?

346
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,208
Here.

347
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,541
24:00

348
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,625
Samarn, hurry up.

349
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,791
Don't hurt me.

350
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,166
Don't hurt me.

351
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:26,625
Can you expel the ghosts?

352
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,250
Let me talk to your grandpa first.

353
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:46,041
Rumor that Mr. Wanchai, the hotel owner

354
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,875
had a love spell put on him.

355
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,250
The murderer is still here.

356
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:51,333
Where is the murderer?

357
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,291
Why did you do this to us?

358
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,208
Help, please.

359
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,625
You are stuck in this hotel.

360
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,375
I'm here to help.

361
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,583
Miss…

362
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,208
Grandpa said you can leave.

363
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,916
You don't have to do this anymore.

364
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,416
Come here.

365
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,333
Yes, Grandpa.

366
00:41:36,416 --> 00:41:40,000
Som, can you find out about the Yantra?

367
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,041
Driver, please take me back to the hotel.

368
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,750
I don't know.

369
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,375
But looking at the photos,

370
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,583
the Yantra just appeared.

371
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,541
So I think…

372
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,375
the spirits in that room
are trying to tell me something.

373
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,291
Why do you want to go back, Wa?

374
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:34,875
Don't tell me you went back
in that room again.

375
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,333
Come on, Wa.

376
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,083
What if there was
an expulsion Yantra in that room,

377
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,625
and you really died in there?

378
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,916
Your spirit would be stuck
and never move onto the next life.

379
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,375
Are you listening to me?

380
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:49,625
Hello?

381
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,833
Wa?

382
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,208
What is it, Som?

383
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,166
Wa…

384
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,583
I talked to someone
who worked at that hotel.

385
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,916
About the room 646 case.

386
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,166
They said…

387
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,208
after the hotel owner met this woman,

388
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,875
by the name of Ning.
He started acting different.

389
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,166
He was so obsessed with her
and then they got married.

390
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,583
They believed that Ning used black magic.

391
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,375
After they got married,

392
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,833
the hotel staff noticed
that Ning had changed.

393
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,875
She started to get close to Samarn,
the hotel manager.

394
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,458
Wa?

395
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,458
Are you still listening?

396
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,875
Why can't you just be
like everyone else who sees ghosts?

397
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,875
Just pretend you performed the exorcism.

398
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,750
That's all I want.

399
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,000
And then tell everyone…

400
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,083
that you expelled the ghosts

401
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:43,000
so they stop messing with this place.

402
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,666
But no, you tore my Yantra!

403
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,000
Remember,

404
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:57,166
next time…

405
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,125
stay out of other people's business!

406
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,375
Help… help my granddaughter.

407
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:38,166
Just sit here.

408
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,541
Grandpa, what is this all about?

409
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,833
The demon that possesses Paew.

410
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,666
It has possessed my body
for over 30 years.

411
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:01,250
It came in through a love potion

412
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,416
that Ning cast on me.

413
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,083
Now my old body…

414
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,583
is deteriorating.

415
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:28,875
So it took Paew instead of me.

416
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:34,875
Why did it draw the Yantra in that room?

417
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:39,250
It knows that the spirits
in that room are enraged.

418
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:42,625
That's why it subdued them.

419
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,625
So they can't come for it.

420
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:50,500
Everybody stay focused.

421
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,916
Your bodies are burnt to ashes.

422
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,625
How can you feel pain without a body?

423
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,958
Don't you understand?

424
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,541
Listen…

425
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,375
no matter how holy anything is,

426
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,333
nothing can keep you here.

427
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,583
It's against the law of nature.

428
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,958
If your mind can accept

429
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:10,291
that your time in this world is over,

430
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,416
then you can let go.

431
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,916
Nothing can detain you here.

432
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:08,666
Nothing is permanent.

433
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:13,250
Whatever arises must fall.
That's the way of life.

434
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,583
All that is born must die.

435
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:24,333
The peaceful end of those bodies

436
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,416
will bring true happiness.

437
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,750
All those beings,

438
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,791
whether they have died,

439
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:35,000
or are dying,

440
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,958
or are on a path towards death.

441
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,291
Even me, I will travel the same path.

442
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,291
Curiosity about death

443
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,208
won't occur to me.

444
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,666
I think…

445
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,500
this is your time.

446
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:11,333
What happened?

447
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,875
They moved onto the next life.

448
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,041
If we let go of what we're holding onto,

449
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,583
there will be a new life waiting for us.

450
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,750
It's over now.

451
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,583
Help! Help!

452
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,625
Please don't take me.

453
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,833
I didn't mean it.

454
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,208
I can't remember.

455
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:31,625
THE BOOK OF TRUTH

456
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,666
When guests walk in like this,

457
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,750
they don't really want a room.

458
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,750
I couldn't find your number online.

459
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,708
So, I just took my chances.

460
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:50,541
The previous writer disappeared.

461
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:53,208
And he didn't pay his rent.

462
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:55,750
Could he be dead?

463
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,083
Just joking.

464
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:07,625
Treating me like a joke?

465
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,708
We've just met.

466
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,625
Why do writers
like to rent this place for work?

467
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:31,291
I heard that…

468
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:36,041
at night here,
ghosts come to whisper stories to them.

469
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,250
Really?

470
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,375
Just joking!

471
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,666
You spit on my glasses!

472
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,041
Trying to get back at me?

473
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:03,291
What are you looking at?

474
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,375
When it gets dark here,

475
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:10,875
don't go out for a walk.

476
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:12,500
You'll get lost.

477
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,416
Let's get inside.

478
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:23,750
The prayer room is on that mezzanine.

479
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:33,666
Across the hall,
is the room of Khom, the other writer.

480
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,750
He's been here for almost two years.

481
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,708
Don't be too loud,

482
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,500
you'll disturb him.

483
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:14,791
Hello, Tong.

484
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,625
Hello, can you hear me?

485
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,791
I think I can make it in time.

486
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,333
But please…

487
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,166
Let this be my last ghost story.
I'm sick of it.

488
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,125
Just want to try something different.

489
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,083
Come on, if the readers like my work,

490
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:34,625
they'll stay tuned.

491
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:35,708
Right?

492
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,458
Shit!

493
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,666
No, nothing.

494
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:54,583
Coincidentally, I found
this secluded homestay.

495
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:57,750
I thought I'd stay here
while I write the story for you.

496
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,291
There is no such thing as coincidence.

497
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,833
Okay.

498
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,666
I'll send it to you
right after I finish writing.

499
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,000
Yes.

500
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:15,583
Yes.

501
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:21,208
Here. Pay homage to the four directions.

502
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,583
One for each direction.

503
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,083
Why only one?

504
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,708
It is for a ghost.

505
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:33,250
You write about ghosts,
you should know better.

506
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,375
There are three rules here.

507
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:41,916
First, don't call out
when you hear strange noises.

508
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,291
Second, whatever happens…

509
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,666
don't go into the banana trees.

510
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:55,250
Third, pray at the mezzanine every night

511
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,208
before you go to bed.

512
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:02,333
Breakfast at nine.

513
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:07,875
Write what you want for lunch on the paper
and stick it on the door.

514
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,541
Where did you get this?

515
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,166
Last night--

516
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,375
Did you go to pray before bed last night?

517
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,625
Last night I was working really late

518
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,041
and fell asleep right away.

519
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,041
Don't forget again.

520
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,583
If you don't believe me, you better leave.

521
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,958
-So, this house--
-Pay homage to the Buddha now.

522
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:24,458
Please spare this one.

523
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:27,708
Don't take him away.

524
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,583
Just give me a cool title.

525
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:09,666
Must be the wind.

526
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:32,041
YOU WILL DIE

527
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,166
Writer's block…

528
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,541
Come on! Come on!

529
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:28,791
Somebody help me.

530
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,666
Write it down!

531
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:15,250
Traditionally, anything written
on the inscription had to be true.

532
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:19,291
But some mischievous people

533
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,250
still wrote stories on it as a joke

534
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:26,625
until those messages came true.

535
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:41,750
Sooner than I expected.

536
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:47,416
Whoa!

537
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,166
Case 39…

538
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:55,583
This one seems to be more severe
than any other.

539
01:07:56,583 --> 01:08:01,000
It seems to be linked
with all previous cases.

540
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:16,666
You'll never get me.

541
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:21,416
Are you up?

542
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,166
I brought you rice porridge.

543
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:44,750
Coming.

544
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:05,208
Did you go to pray before bed last night?

545
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:07,791
Yes, I did.

546
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,958
Did anything strange happen?

547
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:23,750
No.

548
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,208
No.

549
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,416
Chan.

550
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,500
You, take the left.

551
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,041
I'll take the middle one.

552
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:51,625
I brought you some food.

553
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,083
Just come in.

554
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,333
It's open.

555
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:20,291
Did you go to pray before bed last night?

556
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,750
Yes, I did.

557
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,166
What did you say?

558
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:35,833
I already did.

559
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:40,250
Did you sleep well?

560
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:45,875
Splendid.

561
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,083
Khong!

562
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:54,083
Khong!

563
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,666
It's here. It's here.

564
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:54,916
Come at me! Come on!

565
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,208
This case is progressing more quickly

566
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,208
and with more paranormal activity.

567
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,708
The inscription normally
turns up on day three

568
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:55,916
and it takes five to six days

569
01:15:56,458 --> 01:16:00,458
to dominate a person.

570
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,041
Aunty still doesn't say anything

571
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,583
about what she remembers about this.

572
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:14,625
Seems like she feels special about him.

573
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:24,791
FIND - WRITE - SEE - BLOOD - REVENGE

574
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:28,250
DIE

575
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:54,625
Though the inscription
seems to help with new stories,

576
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,625
it actually doesn't.

577
01:16:57,541 --> 01:16:59,916
It brings back memories

578
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:04,500
that were buried
at the bottom of one's subconscious.

579
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,666
One windy night,

580
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,375
bizarre noises were heard
around that shabby house.

581
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:07,416
An primitive tribesman
suddenly appeared before him.

582
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:10,333
He lifted his blade…

583
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,375
as if to slash at someone.

584
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:25,083
The soul of that ancient man

585
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:28,500
is the writer's vengeful spirit.

586
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,500
He has come to take him from this life.

587
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:23,750
Thinking back
to the beginning of the curse

588
01:19:23,916 --> 01:19:26,333
the young writer can hardly remember

589
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:30,916
anything about the pain he caused
in a previous life.

590
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:34,875
Chan…

591
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,541
You brought us here to die!

592
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,375
The words resounded.

593
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:43,958
Even the sound of war drums
couldn't overpower it.

594
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:47,250
Paen, the man with that furious voice

595
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,458
shouted amid the battle field.

596
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:57,458
A handful of villagers fought against
tens of thousands Burmese soldiers

597
01:19:57,708 --> 01:20:02,666
only because Chan believed that
Ayutthaya would send reinforcements.

598
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,208
He begged the villagers
to stall the Burmese.

599
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:10,333
You brought us here to die!

600
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:11,416
Chan.

601
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:18,583
Then he can't hold back
the tears of guilt.

602
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,458
Now he realizes.

603
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,791
He remembers his previous life.

604
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:33,708
Because he loved his country.

605
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
He only wanted to protect his homeland.

606
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:56,458
What are you doing?

607
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:04,125
Don't ever come in this room again.

608
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,791
There's nothing interesting here.

609
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,083
Is this you when you were younger?

610
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:39,500
You played with the inscriptions,
didn't you?

611
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:43,541
I told you to leave them alone.

612
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:47,750
No…

613
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,500
I haven't.

614
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,041
Too late.

615
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,291
Too late.

616
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,041
It's too late.

617
01:25:43,416 --> 01:25:48,750
HE BROUGHT IT WITH HIM. HE TOOK IT OUT.

618
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,333
What is it, aunty?

619
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:59,791
Khong, I thought you said
we had let it be to their karma.

620
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:01,208
My name is Khom.

621
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:02,833
Don't call me by my dead name.

622
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,750
I remember my previous life.

623
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,166
To me, it's the same life I'm living now.

624
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,208
I'm doing my research here

625
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,416
to speed up my experiment.

626
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:15,166
You said you wouldn't
play with anyone's fate.

627
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,291
Everybody has their own vengeful spirits.

628
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:20,541
But for him, every soul here

629
01:26:21,083 --> 01:26:22,625
is his vengeful spirit.

630
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:39,958
I dripped the blood on the inscription

631
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,958
so that it would reveal

632
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,625
who he was in his past life.

633
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:50,583
He was Chan, my son.

634
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:04,666
LATER ON

635
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,250
Oh, Mother…

636
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:41,875
you shouldn't be bothered
to bring me food.

637
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,250
Come in. Come in.

638
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:48,500
Come, come.

639
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:53,791
Let's eat together.

640
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:57,250
You eat, I already did.

641
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:10,958
Mother.

642
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:15,375
I heard that
the Burmese legions took Tawai.

643
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,375
You just eat up.

644
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:18,958
We'll talk later.

645
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:37,000
His present memories start fading away

646
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:41,750
the memories from
the previous life start coming back.

647
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:57,416
From your research…

648
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,000
when the inscription gets blood on it,

649
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:02,166
how many days until he dies?

650
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,083
Not all of them die.

651
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:05,250
Some just go crazy.

652
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,500
Just stay out of it

653
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,750
or you'll have to
relive this experience again.

654
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:15,916
You were his friend
in the previous life, Khong.

655
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:18,083
Don't you feel sorry for him?

656
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:13,541
Chan!

657
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:31,625
Chan!

658
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:46,958
Help me!

659
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:48,125
Come this way.

660
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:49,583
Help me!

661
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,708
Come this way, son.

662
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,375
Help!

663
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:03,333
Help!

664
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:06,208
Help!

665
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,208
Mother.

666
01:31:15,791 --> 01:31:17,375
I brought everyone to die.

667
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,041
I know you did your best.

668
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:10,583
I remember everything now.

669
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,000
The three of us…

670
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:16,791
loved each other so much.

671
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,375
Paen.

672
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:28,583
Just kill me.

673
01:32:31,416 --> 01:32:37,000
Let this vengeance be over.

674
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:43,791
Why don't we end
all of this with forgiveness, Paen?

675
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Paen…

676
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:52,458
I swear that…

677
01:32:55,333 --> 01:33:01,041
I will hold no grudge against you.

678
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,541
I want just one life…

679
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:08,250
for the three of us…

680
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,875
to be born as best friends again.

681
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:33,708
Thank you, Mom.

682
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:00,750
I don't know whether
Paen forgives me or not.

683
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,583
Aunty told me that after that incident…

684
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:07,416
there were no more tenants.

685
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,791
And nobody has ever seen ghosts again.

686
01:34:16,541 --> 01:34:20,083
We've usually done wrong
to so many people,

687
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:27,041
forgiveness is the only way
to lessen your sin.

688
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,958
Do you need a ride?

689
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,333
For every blessing
that may bloom from this movie,

690
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:52,041
we wish it all
to every soul who is included

691
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,166
and not included in the movie.
