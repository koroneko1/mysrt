&lrm;Oops! Sorry, Mylène! My bad!

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.100
&lrm;-I think this is yours, Rose!
&lrm;-Thanks, Marinette!

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.460
&lrm;Do you realise?
&lrm;It's our very first concert!

&lrm;<i>It's going to be awesome!</i>

&lrm;-No worries, girl!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.580
&lrm;The gig hasn't started yet!

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.020
&lrm;What if he doesn't know the address?
&lrm;Or got the day wrong? Or is lost?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.940
&lrm;Could you check with Nino, please?
&lrm;You know, of course, just... casually.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.100
&lrm;Hey, Nino, did you hear from Adrien,
&lrm;by any chance?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.660
&lrm;He had something to do with his old man.
&lrm;He said he'll come right after.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.700
&lrm;Captain Anarka speakin' to ya! So,
&lrm;how's it comin' along, my young pirates?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.500
&lrm;Ready to celebrate the--

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.620
&lrm;Whatcha up to, there, matey?

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.060
&lrm;Uh, hello, ma'am.
&lrm;I'm cleaning up for tonight!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.700
&lrm;-Your boat will be clean as a whistle!
&lrm;-You're cleaning? Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.900
&lrm;We never pick up in this house!
&lrm;Didn't my daughter tell you?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.460
&lrm;We like the lived-in look!
&lrm;We have no rules on the&lrm;<i> Liberty!</i>

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.660
&lrm;Out of chaos comes creation!
&lrm;Messiness is life!

&lrm;[false note]

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.460
&lrm;I've heard enough.
&lrm;Are you sure you're practising, Adrien?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.180
&lrm;I'm doing the same exercises
&lrm;over and over again.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.460
&lrm;I'd make better progress
&lrm;if I could play with other musicians.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.940
&lrm;After all, music's meant to be
&lrm;shared with other people.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.220
&lrm;We Agrestes are soloists.
&lrm;We're not mere group members.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.060
&lrm;Rehearse your piece some more.
&lrm;You'll play it for me again later today.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.740
&lrm;But you promised
&lrm;that I could attend my friends' concert!

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.700
&lrm;Not after that performance,
&lrm;which is probably due to their influence!

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.700
&lrm;You need to refocus, Adrien.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.940
&lrm;[phone rings]

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.700
&lrm;Wassup, dude?

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.380
&lrm;Wow! What happened?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
&lrm;Whoa! That's real rough.
&lrm;Good luck, dude. See ya tomorrow!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.660
&lrm;Well, it's not exactly the first time

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.820
&lrm;his dad's kept him
&lrm;from hanging out with us.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.740
&lrm;Actually, I'd have been
&lrm;super surprised if he hadn't.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.900
&lrm;Whoa, sailor! Never place a metal object
&lrm;next to a compass, ya hear, lass?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.140
&lrm;Metal attracts the needle,
&lrm;just like a magnet,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.060
&lrm;which is why you can't get them
&lrm;near each other.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.620
&lrm;I know how they feel.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.940
&lrm;Maybe I'm just like this statue
&lrm;and Adrien's my compass.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.900
&lrm;Maybe we're meant to stay away
&lrm;from each other forever.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.700
&lrm;I think it's the other way around.
&lrm;He's the statue and you're the compass

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.260
&lrm;that goes crazy whenever he gets close!

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.300
&lrm;There'll be other chances, Marinette.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.580
&lrm;That's what you said the last time
&lrm;and the time before that.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.260
&lrm;We're ready, Captain!
&lrm;Uh... But Luka's missing.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.020
&lrm;-Marinette, right?
&lrm;-Yes, ma'am... uh, Captain!

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.140
&lrm;Since you're free from cleaning duties,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.860
&lrm;could you go and tell Luka that we're
&lrm;waiting for him to start rehearsals?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.420
&lrm;Of course. Uh, but who's Luka?
&lrm;And where is he?

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.460
&lrm;Luka's my son.
&lrm;You'll find him in his cabin.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.380
&lrm;Uh!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.180
&lrm;Hey! My name's Mama...
&lrm;uh... Mamamarinette!

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.700
&lrm;Your mom sent me down here. The groove...
&lrm;uh... the group's waiting for you.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.420
&lrm;Hello, Mamamarinette.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.820
&lrm;[chuckles]

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.540
&lrm;Sorry.
&lrm;I tend to make more sense with this.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.220
&lrm;That's strange. It seems you have
&lrm;something like this in your heart.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.500
&lrm;How do you do that?

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.060
&lrm;Music is often simpler than words.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.100
&lrm;You like Jagged Stone's music?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.100
&lrm;He's my favourite singer!

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.660
&lrm;Mine too.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.340
&lrm;You can have it if you like.
&lrm;I've got plenty.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.500
&lrm;Oh! Thanks.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.860
&lrm;I think I'd better go
&lrm;and join the... groove, you said?

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.940
&lrm;Did I really say that? Oh, no!

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.140
&lrm;You're a funny girl, Marinette.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.980
&lrm;<i>For this year's National Music Festival,</i>
&lrm;<i>the city hall has organised</i>

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.140
&lrm;<i>numerous free concerts featuring big stars</i>
&lrm;<i>in some pretty prestigious locales!</i>

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.540
&lrm;<i>We're joined by our Mayor.</i>
&lrm;<i>Please tell us about the line-up!</i>

&lrm;<i>XY will be performing</i>
&lrm;<i>at Place de la Concorde,</i>

&lrm;<i>Laura Nightingale at the Louvre,</i>
&lrm;<i>the Philharmonic at City Hall,</i>

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.420
&lrm;<i>and Mr. Jagged Stone at the Eiffel Tower!</i>

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.660
&lrm;<i>And let's not forget the many gigs</i>

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.660
&lrm;<i>given by the people of Paris</i>
&lrm;<i>across the city!</i>

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.380
&lrm;<i>It will be the most incredible festival</i>
&lrm;<i>since the first one was held,</i>

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.300
&lrm;<i>right here, in Paris, in 1982!</i>

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.300
&lrm;<i>I'm Nadia Chamack.</i>
&lrm;<i>Tune in here, to hear more tunes!</i>

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.100
&lrm;Come on, now. Don't be so down
&lrm;in the dumps. Look at the bright side.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.300
&lrm;Now you can enjoy all of the concerts
&lrm;without leaving the comfort of your room!

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.180
&lrm;I just wanted to go
&lrm;to my friends' concert, Plagg!

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.620
&lrm;Then why didn't you say so?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.580
&lrm;As your friend, I'm going to give you
&lrm;a private concert you'll never forget!

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.500

&lrm;<i>♪ Camembert!</i>
&lrm;<i>You make life better than it seems! ♪</i>

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.020
&lrm;Thanks, Plagg. Best concert ever.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.980
&lrm;Aw...

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.980
&lrm;-Are you OK, girl?
&lrm;-Mmm-hmm.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.980
&lrm;I'm thinking Marinette the Compass
&lrm;has found herself a new Statue!

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.060
&lrm;What? Luka? No way!
&lrm;You're being ridiculous! Pff!

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.180
&lrm;Sure, he's cool and nice and everything...

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.260
&lrm;but there's only one statue
&lrm;that drives this compass crazy!

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.860
&lrm;Ho, ho, sailors! Let's give 'em a show!
&lrm;Whenever you're ready, Luka!

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.500
&lrm;You're going to need these, believe me!

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.940

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.540
&lrm;<i>Mrs. Anarka,</i>
&lrm;<i>are you completely out of your mind?</i>

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.540
&lrm;<i>I'm reading 160 decibels!</i>

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.620
&lrm;<i>That's ten times</i>
&lrm;<i>the sound of a jet engine!</i>

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.420
&lrm;<i>You can't do this!</i>
&lrm;<i>You'll have to play something else!</i>

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.700
&lrm;<i>It's the National Music Festival today,</i>
&lrm;<i>Officer Roger!</i>

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.060
&lrm;<i>My crew's allowed to play</i>
&lrm;<i>whatever they want!</i>

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.500
&lrm;<i>It's a music festival,</i>
&lrm;<i>not a noise festival!</i>

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.300
&lrm;<i>If you don't turn the volume down,</i>
&lrm;<i>I'll ban your concert altogether!</i>

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.340
&lrm;Uh, maybe we could just turn
&lrm;the volume down a bit, Captain?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.980
&lrm;-Then there'd be no more problem, right?
&lrm;<i>-No! Out of the question!</i>

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.060
&lrm;<i>I didn't name my galleon</i>&lrm; Liberty
&lrm;<i>for nothing, you know!</i>

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.180
&lrm;<i>It's a matter of principle! Haven't you</i>
&lrm;<i>ever heard of freedom of speech, Roger?</i>

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.340
&lrm;<i>This is my home! I do as I want!</i>

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.860
&lrm;Do you have a document stating
&lrm;you can moor your houseboat here?

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.860
&lrm;-The Seine belongs to everyone!
&lrm;-You can't moor here without a permit!

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.020
&lrm;So you can't play your concert here!
&lrm;Not to mention this incredibly messy deck!

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.300
&lrm;Public visual disturbance.
&lrm;Here's a ticket! And it's too decorated!

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.380
&lrm;-Another ticket!
&lrm;-Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.820
&lrm;You asked for it! One more ticket
&lrm;for making me use too many tickets,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.500
&lrm;one for your attitude,
&lrm;one because I can't sleep,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.500
&lrm;one more because I'm seasick,
&lrm;one more because I say so.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.700
&lrm;Ah, the suppression of a soul
&lrm;demanding liberty and freedom.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.820
&lrm;A perfect target for my akuma!

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.500
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.180
&lrm;I refuse to give in!

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.020
&lrm;Captain HardRock, I am Hawk Moth.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.220
&lrm;Is the Establishment censoring your right
&lrm;to make as much noise as you'd like?

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.420
&lrm;From now on, they won't hear
&lrm;anything but your music!

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.940
&lrm;I'm giving you an indestructible ship,
&lrm;and you will use it to sail around Paris,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.580
&lrm;and blast your music out everywhere
&lrm;you go, as loudly as you please!

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.980
&lrm;In return, you will bring to me
&lrm;the greatest of all treasures,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.580
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.860
&lrm;A treasure in return for freedom?
&lrm;Ho, ho, ho!

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.220
&lrm;Then I shall be your pirate, Hawk Moth!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.540
&lrm;Oh, no!

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.340
&lrm;Raise the mainsail, me deckhands!
&lrm;Let's get swashbucklin' round here!

&lrm;-Arr, arr, arr!
&lrm;-Mom?

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.140
&lrm;-What's going on?
&lrm;-Your mom has weighed anchor, me lad!

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.980
&lrm;I am Captain HardRock!

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.620
&lrm;And today, Paris' timbers
&lrm;are about to be shivered by my cannons!

&lrm;Jagged Stone, at the Eiffel Tower!

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.420
&lrm;Soon, there will be only one concert
&lrm;in Paris, only one music festival!

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.340
&lrm;We will destroy all the others!

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.900
&lrm;Now, get to your instruments, sprogs,
&lrm;and rock those decibels!

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.020
&lrm;Mom, please!
&lrm;You can't ruin the music festival!

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.380
&lrm;You can't force people
&lrm;to listen to your music!

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.540
&lrm;-No way we're playing like this!
&lrm;-Mutiny? On my ship?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.820
&lrm;<i>Liberty,</i>&lrm; seize these scallywags
&lrm;and throw 'em down into the hold!

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.740
&lrm;Ah!

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.740
&lrm;<i>Liberty,</i>&lrm; fire!

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.300
&lrm;Nothing and no one
&lrm;will stop Captain HardRock

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.140
&lrm;from playing her music. Fire!

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.580
&lrm;Ow!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.900
&lrm;<i>Paris is yet again under attack.</i>

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.340
&lrm;<i>A new villain is destroying</i>
&lrm;<i>all the concerts one by one.</i>

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.460
&lrm;<i>Please take shelter as soon as possible.</i>

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.860
&lrm;I may be grounded,
&lrm;but they're playing my song!

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.740
&lrm;Yeah, I know it by heart.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.860
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.380
&lrm;Wow! How did you do that?

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.100
&lrm;Uh... I... uh... with this!

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.980
&lrm;You're amazing!
&lrm;A real magician, Marinette!

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.860
&lrm;You think so? Oh, it was nothing.
&lrm;Amazing, really?

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.740
&lrm;Excuse me, but some of us
&lrm;are still chained up here.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.660
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.500
&lrm;Marinette! She's coming!

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.500
&lrm;We'll come back, I promise!

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.380
&lrm;-Run, Marinette! Quick!
&lrm;-Seize him!

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.460
&lrm;She won't get very far.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.180
&lrm;-Phew! That was close!
&lrm;-Tikki, I have to save my friends!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.540
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.220
&lrm;Yeah!

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.340
&lrm;New target located. Fire at XY!

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.460
&lrm;Ah!

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.620
&lrm;And now...

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.860
&lrm;Huh? What was that?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.700
&lrm;Fire at Cat Noir!

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.980
&lrm;Seize him!

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.140
&lrm;Seize them!

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.180
&lrm;[sirens]

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.660
&lrm;<i>I command you to stop,</i>
&lrm;<i>in the name of the law!</i>

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.060
&lrm;Fire,&lrm;<i> Liberty!</i>

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.260
&lrm;Ah!

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.660
&lrm;-Thank you, Ladybug and Cat Noir!
&lrm;-Stay under cover.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.420
&lrm;-We'll take care of her!
&lrm;-Time for the treasure hunt!

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.540
&lrm;I hope you've got your sea legs, kitty.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.180
&lrm;I'll be purrfect, as long as I stay dry!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.860
&lrm;Seize them!

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.540
&lrm;-Ho, ho, ho!
&lrm;-Any idea where the akuma is?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.020
&lrm;-It's gotta be on the ship somewhere.
&lrm;-A cataclysm will settle this.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.020
&lrm;Wait! There are prisoners in the hold!

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.460
&lrm;-If you sink this boat, they might drown!
&lrm;-Fire at Nightingale!

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.500
&lrm;We've got to stop this ship!

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.060
&lrm;It's time we got this vessel anchored!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.300
&lrm;Let's rip this off!

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.340
&lrm;It's no good!

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.500
&lrm;Argh! It's blocked!

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.820
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha!&lrm;<i> Liberty</i>&lrm; answers only to me!
&lrm;Seize her!

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.500
&lrm;Ladybug!

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.460
&lrm;-Ladybug, is Marinette OK?
&lrm;-She's safe! She alerted me!

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.740
&lrm;That girl's unbelievably brave.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.820
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.380
&lrm;Another chain? Some pliers
&lrm;would've come in more handy!

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.260
&lrm;Don't worry, guys!
&lrm;I'll find a way to get you out!

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.580
&lrm;Seize him!

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.660
&lrm;Well done, Captain HardRock!

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.460
&lrm;My treasure will be your Miraculous,
&lrm;kitty cat!

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.220
&lrm;Don't be an impatient scurvy, Ladybug!
&lrm;You're next in line!

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.940
&lrm;<i>I command you to stop your acts of piracy,</i>
&lrm;<i>in the name of the law!</i>

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.100
&lrm;Him again? Fire!

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.820
&lrm;Ah!

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.220
&lrm;En garde! Huh? Where did you go?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.340
&lrm;If you refuse to give me your Miraculous,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.060
&lrm;my next target will be Mayor Bourgeois
&lrm;and his orchestra!

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.980
&lrm;<i>Liberty,</i>&lrm; next stop, City Hall!

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.900
&lrm;Thanks!
&lrm;Any longer and I'd have been fish food!

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.820
&lrm;We've got a problem.
&lrm;I couldn't free the prisoners!

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.940
&lrm;And I have no idea
&lrm;what I'm supposed to do with this!

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.620
&lrm;It's probably trying to tell you
&lrm;that you're chained to me forever.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.860
&lrm;You're pulling my chain, Cat Noir.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.100
&lrm;-It's time to take the ship. Follow me!
&lrm;-Aye, aye!

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.060
&lrm;There you are again!

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.460
&lrm;The time has come to send you
&lrm;to the bottom once and for all!

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.500
&lrm;-No! Get away from the compass!
&lrm;-Ah!

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.980
&lrm;For the last time, stop your boat,
&lrm;in the name of the law!

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.020
&lrm;Ah!

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.740
&lrm;[Marinette] Do it, Cat Noir!

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.020
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.420
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.340
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.460
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.500
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.740
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-What happened?

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.500
&lrm;Oh, not much.
&lrm;You just had a bout of... seasickness.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.580
&lrm;Time to raise the sails, Milady.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.100
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.860
&lrm;Enjoy your gig! Bug out!

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.780
&lrm;For the sake of Neptune!

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.660
&lrm;Captain HardRock
&lrm;didn't manage to seize your Miraculous.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.900
&lrm;But one of these days,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.660
&lrm;your treasure will be mine!

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.900
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.540
&lrm;Would you like to play this piece with me,
&lrm;as a duet?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.260
&lrm;-I... I don't think...
&lrm;-Please, Father.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.500
&lrm;If I'm not allowed to go to my friends'
&lrm;concert, at least grant me this.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.700
&lrm;La!

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.500
&lrm;You can go to your friends' concert
&lrm;if that's what you want.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.900
&lrm;Thank you, Father!

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.100
&lrm;It's a bit loud by my standards
&lrm;and a few decibels over the legal limit...

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.260
&lrm;But I'll let it slide this once.
&lrm;After all, it's the music festival!

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.820
&lrm;[cheering]

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.900
&lrm;Thanks, Roger.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.260
&lrm;Have a good gig!

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.500
&lrm;Hi, everyone! Hi, ma'am!

&lrm;Ditching, the-the-the...

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.740
&lrm;Adrien! You OK, buddy?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.060
&lrm;No, it's all good, I... Whoa!

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.020
&lrm;An original ZX20.4!
&lrm;I love the sound of this instrument!

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.460
&lrm;Oh, that old thing?
&lrm;No one knows how to play it!

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.980
&lrm;-I know how to play it!
&lrm;-Great!

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.260
&lrm;-Welcome to the band, Adrien!
&lrm;-Thanks... Uh...?

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.460
&lrm;-Luka!
&lrm;-Thanks, Luka.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.780
&lrm;Is the compass going crazy?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.380
&lrm;You know, matey,
&lrm;sometimes disorder can be a good thing.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.020
&lrm;If this hadn't been lying around,
&lrm;we wouldn't have gained a player!
