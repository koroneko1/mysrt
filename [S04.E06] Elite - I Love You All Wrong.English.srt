1
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,000
Patrick.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,199
Patrick, no one could find you.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,679
Where were you when it happened?

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
LAKE CLUB

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,399
Samuel shouldn't prepare at our house.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,200
We should separate our academic
and personal lives.

7
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,320
I offered to work at the Lake Club

8
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,640
and the other venues
whenever they needed an extra hand.

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,560
To be honest, I can use the money.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,960
I have to go change,
so let's pick up tomorrow.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,039
Why are you leaving?

12
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,359
I'm late for work.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Okay, well, don't forget to go over
your arguments for tomorrow.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,079
Got it. Later.

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,359
Well, I guess if Samuel says
we're done here, then we're done.

16
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,560
Good job today, sweetheart.

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Well, thanks.

18
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm very proud of you, Ari.
Wait for me in the car?

19
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,920
García left his keys behind.

20
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,680
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,719
I guess these are yours.

22
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,319
Mm, um, I'll just--
I'll leave this right over here.

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,719
Don't be in such a rush to go away.

24
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,240
-Don't rush to cover yourself up.
-Nothing you haven't already seen.

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,520
I don't remember.

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
-Yeah, no. I imagine you wouldn't.
-Or maybe it wasn't worth remembering?

27
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,120
-No?
-No.

28
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Ciao.

29
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,599
Oh my God.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,479
Why don't you just get a bullhorn
and get it over with?

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Your mother's been calling you all night,
and I didn't say anything.

32
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,719
If you weren't so stubborn,
you could have slept in my bed.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,439
Sure, first we invade your house,
then it's your bed.

34
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,759
No way, dude. Okay?

35
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,439
I can find somewhere to sleep tonight,
so don't worry about it, kay?

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,199
No.
You're going back home. I'll stay here.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,919
The sofa's not so bad for just one person.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,599
Rebe,
I'm not about to leave you all alone.

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,080
End of discussion.

40
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,719
You two. What are you doin'?

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Omar, exams are just around the corner.

42
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't keep skipping school,
'cause Benjamín's gonna--

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,039
Benjamín can go fuck himself.

44
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,719
You know you can't avoid Ander forever.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,240
Maybe not forever.
I'm going one day at a time.

46
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,080
And today, I'm avoiding him.

47
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,960
Well,
it's gonna be a super-exclusive party.

48
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,400
Ambar Lucid might be singing.

49
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,040
You like her? Wanna see her?

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,879
I'd kill to see her.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Phillipe!

52
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,639
Uh, is Ambar Lucid gonna be singing there?

53
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
No idea.

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,199
No way I buy that.

55
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,480
You're buddies.
I've seen you liking each other's posts.

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,199
If you'll excuse me.

57
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,600
-Patrick, don't be annoying.
-Shh.

58
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,920
Your Highness,
if you're able to get us tickets,

59
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,120
this humble servant before you
will do whatever Your Grace desires.

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay, I'll make some calls.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,759
GOOD MORNING, HANDSOME…

62
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,279
MORNING. HOW'S THE PHONE?

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,319
GREAT. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU IN PERSON.
WANT TO MEET TONIGHT?

64
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,360
I really hope
Phillipe manages to get us tickets.

65
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,560
Of course he will.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,319
But just for the record,
I'm the one who got them.

67
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,720
You… just make sure to wear a cute tie
so I can yank on it.

68
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,079
Do you think
this is any way to behave in class?

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,160
I've sent you a document
containing a questionnaire

70
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,800
about your career preferences
for the future.

71
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,439
This is for an internship program
we'll be using in the second semester.

72
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,720
Please fill it out.

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,319
So, not quite as bold
when your old man's around.

74
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,720
Honestly…

75
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,439
"Honestly," what?

76
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,959
Well, you think you have way more power
than you do.

77
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,079
You don't.

78
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,160
What the fuck are you up to?

79
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,680
Just so it's clear to you
that I always get my way,

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
whether in front of a prince or my father.

81
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,759
Samuel.

82
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,279
How's Omar?

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,240
It's your life.

84
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,240
You can do whatever the fuck you want,

85
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,240
but be a little more careful in class.

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
'Cause this
might cost him the school year.

87
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,759
-García?
-Yeah?

88
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,040
The book I told you about.
I'd really love to hear your thoughts…

89
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,199
They get along
'cause of the debate team. That's all.

90
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,959
Come on.

91
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,519
-What are you doing?
-Benjamín, do you have a minute?

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,279
Yes. What's up, Nunier?

93
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,079
Well, I wanted to take you
and your children out for dinner tonight.

94
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,319
Hmm. And, uh,
what would be the reason behind it?

95
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,720
Well, uh, Ari's important to me,
and you're important to Ari,

96
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,560
so I thought
we could get to know each other better.

97
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,120
Problem is, it would be inappropriate

98
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,000
for the principal
to let a student invite him.

99
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,079
-Got it.
-But Guzmán's my boyfriend, Dad.

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,079
Uh-huh.

101
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,720
What I mean is,
we wanted to get the family together

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,439
and make a formal introduction.

103
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, uh, then maybe, in that case,
it's my obligation to accept.

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,000
That's perfect. Then I'll see you all
tonight at the Lake Club.

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
-Mm.
-Bye.

106
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,920
You can't come in.

107
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,959
Phillipe, you can't just come in
when you feel like it.

108
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
Like you with my computer?

109
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,600
What was
that little look earlier all about?

110
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,839
Uh, what little look?

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,319
The one you gave me
after walking across the hallway

112
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,639
to eavesdrop
on our Ambar Lucid conversation.

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
You wanna go too?

114
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,080
Look, I already told you.

115
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,840
Playing hard to get
so I'll go after you, that's played out,

116
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,440
and it doesn't work on me.

117
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,000
Yet here you are.

118
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,399
Don't act all high and mighty.

119
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,080
Accept the fact
that you can't go without asking me.

120
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,159
No,
I actually can't go, thanks.

121
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,559
-Really.
-Yeah. Sure.

122
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:10,720
Just so you don't have to ask me.

123
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,039
Oh, that's right.

124
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm that gold-digging groupie
only interested in getting stuff from you.

125
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,159
Hey, you told me you didn't know
how to separate me from the prince.

126
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,519
Yeah, unlike your friends,
who are clearly doing a great job at it.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,039
Excuse me?

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,879
Well…

129
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,559
If you don't mind,
I have to finish getting changed.

130
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,039
You know?

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,559
YOU AND YOUR SELFISH FRIENDS.

132
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,159
Von Triesenberg.

133
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,240
What were you doing in the janitor's room?

134
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,000
Nothing wrong.

135
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,480
Listen, I saved your hide
by bringing you here.

136
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,960
Yours and your family's.

137
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,440
Do you really think
I'm not watching your every move?

138
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,080
I was just talking to her.

139
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,279
In here, you are my responsibility.

140
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm not risking my neck
for you to revive certain rumors

141
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,840
you're supposed to have buried.

142
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,600
Is that clear?

143
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,360
Excuse me?

144
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,759
Benjamín,
don't use that tone with me, okay?

145
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,360
Is that clear? Yes or no?

146
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,360
-You weren't that sick, huh?
-I can't miss work.

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,720
You can't miss school, either.

148
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,759
Benjamín asked about you.
He's hoping to get rid of you.

149
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,279
Just like his son.

150
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,919
Fine.
You won't have to worry much longer.

151
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,480
HEY, PATRICK

152
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,519
HOW ABOUT DINNER
AND DRINKS AT THE LAKE CLUB?

153
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
PATRICK - ONLINE

154
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm gonna quit school.

155
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,480
What?

156
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah.

157
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm happy behind a bar.

158
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,600
It pays well, and I'm good at it.

159
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,200
You don't wanna quit studying…
just to stop seeing me.

160
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Omar, just 'cause we're not together
doesn't mean I don't love you.

161
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,159
You know that, right?

162
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,799
I love you,
and that's all that really matters.

163
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,159
-I'm not so sure anymore.
-Yeah, well, I am.

164
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,360
I'll be here whenever you need.

165
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
Okay?

166
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,799
Hey. Come here.

167
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,000
-You like portrait mode, huh?
-It's really cool.

168
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,039
Plus, it came out,
like, super masculine, see?

169
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,759
Yeah.

170
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,559
I COULDN'T GET THE TICKETS. SORRY.

171
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,919
-Oh, damn it.
-What's the matter?

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Pfft. A guy from class
was gonna try to get us tickets

173
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,759
to this really exclusive party

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,600
where Ambar Lucid
might possibly be singing,

175
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,039
but I guess he couldn't.

176
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't worry.
We can find a solution.

177
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,159
I guess. Maybe.

178
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,799
What's this guy doin' here?

179
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,399
-Hmm.
-The three of us are meeting for a drink.

180
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,879
-Okay? What would you like?
-He's paying for it.

181
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,360
And for the cell phone, too.
Of course. Snatch.

182
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,039
-Could you try not being against things?
-What'd she offer? A three-way?

183
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
I'd better leave you two here to--

184
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,720
-Yeah, you'd better.
-Armando, no. Stay.

185
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,799
Kid,
why do you keep doing that shit?

186
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,279
-What shit?
-What? Making progress, then backsliding.

187
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,799
But Rebe…

188
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,519
-Can I ask what's going on?
-Wait here a sec. I'll be right back.

189
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,799
-Can you wait a minute and hear me out?
-Actually, fine.

190
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,480
You'll get literally a minute
so you can fucking explain.

191
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,320
Look, I'm just trying to help you, okay?

192
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,720
You really think
I'm that much of a fucking idiot?

193
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,480
I told you I quit because I quit.
I'm not a liar.

194
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,240
So do me a favor
and come back down there and listen to me.

195
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,039
Kay? Please do it for me.

196
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,159
Well, if you don't wanna accept
his offer of the hotel room,

197
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,279
what do you think we should do?

198
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,720
Because you were quick
to run away from home,

199
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,919
but as far as looking for alternatives,
not so much.

200
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,879
Come on, kid.

201
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,759
I left my mom's house for you.
You realize that?

202
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
Just saying, the room's available to you
for as long as you need it.

203
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,679
It's on me, of course.

204
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,799
-Should we wait for Mencía, or…?
-No.

205
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,240
All right.

206
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,600
Thanks.

207
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,559
-Don't call her. What's the point?
-She was invited too.

208
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,799
Fine. It's the host that calls the shots.
Ring her up.

209
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
Disconnected or out of area.

210
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,039
Well, uh, Nunier,
do you want us to keep waiting?

211
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,559
Because, uh, I understand
they serve breakfast here as well.

212
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,200
Sorry, I was just trying to help.

213
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,039
-Didn't mean to interfere.
-Help with what?

214
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,720
It's obvious your relationship
with Mencía isn't the best.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
I mean, fuck, these things
should be discussed openly, right?

216
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,559
No, no, no, no. It's all right.

217
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,279
I'd like to hear
what this dear Nunier of yours has to say.

218
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Mencía's a lot like my sister.

219
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,200
She was intelligent, rebellious,

220
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,679
very passionate,

221
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,360
and very special.

222
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,519
The more my parents butted heads with her,
the more she rebelled.

223
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
Are you giving me parenting advice?

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,360
No.

225
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
No, really.
I mean, this is interesting.

226
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,840
Uh, please, tell me
how I should raise my daughter.

227
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,840
Well, I don't know.

228
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,840
All I'm saying is that
maybe you should cut her some slack

229
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,559
and let her make her own decisions,

230
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,799
even if she'll screw up.

231
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,080
'Cause she has a right to screw up.

232
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,320
Mm. We all have that right. Hmm.

233
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,399
The thing is, you can cut kids some slack
when they actually behave.

234
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,679
But what if they can't? What's the point?

235
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,320
The slack you cut them is the rope
they'll use to hang themselves in the end.

236
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,879
It's like a swimming pool.

237
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,600
Someone's drowning,
and you jump in to save them

238
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,799
on impulse, with your best intentions,
your strength, and knowing how to swim.

239
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,359
But because of your desperation
to save her and her panic,

240
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,640
which keeps her from cooperating,

241
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
you'll end up sinking,

242
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,039
and she'll drown.

243
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,920
But if you had taught that person
how to swim,

244
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,720
to breathe,

245
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,759
to stay in control,

246
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,759
or if you'd just thrown them
a flotation device,

247
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,880
they probably would've saved themselves.

248
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:40,680
So, you gonna let this guy
on the debate team?

249
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,799
Or what?

250
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,240
I'd rather be
the guy waiting outside for Ari.

251
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,000
Guzmán.

252
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,599
Were you thinking
of us all sharing something,

253
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,759
or should we each order our own thing?

254
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,680
I want some as well.

255
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,119
You're gonna drink?

256
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,039
Yes.

257
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,200
Tonight's a night to celebrate.

258
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,319
Well, I swear,
when you first began talking about Mencía,

259
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,359
I wanted to kill you.

260
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
Honestly.

261
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,400
But then, holy shit, you won him over.

262
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
Just like you did me.

263
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,160
That you talking,
or half the bottle of wine in you?

264
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,319
What?

265
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
-Okay, it's the half a bottle.
-Mm.

266
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
Ari, please,
we're in a restaurant. Don't.

267
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,519
Oh, I don't even care.

268
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,079
Oh.

269
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,920
-Oh shit.
-You can't do that in here.

270
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hey, Samuel. Could you get lost?

271
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,480
Ari, please.

272
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,559
We're heading out, man. Sorry about that.

273
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,319
-Hmm?
-I'll go get our coats.

274
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
Samuel, is it this way?

275
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Good morning.

276
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,319
Good morning.

277
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,359
How long have you been awake?

278
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,079
Well, just to give you an idea,

279
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,960
basically the entire night, thereabout.

280
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,759
Why?

281
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,599
I don't know
if it's a good idea for me to stay here.

282
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,400
Can't you enjoy something
for two minutes without freaking out?

283
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,359
A selfless john-slash-sugar daddy?
Doesn't add up.

284
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,440
-Did you order something?
-Why would I?

285
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,680
-Stop showin' off, you.
-No, I didn't order it. I swear.

286
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,839
He got us two tickets
to the Ambar Lucid concert.

287
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,799
No fuckin' way.

288
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,000
I told him I was bummed
we couldn't get tickets, and then…

289
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,799
-Pop!
-Okay, okay, hold on. Calm your tits.

290
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,400
It's just a rumor that she'll be there.
Who knows who'll show up in the end.

291
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,640
You're really pissed off

292
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,920
that you're starting
to like Armando, right?

293
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,119
Stop. I said no.

294
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,480
You know someone.
Like, you're a fucking prince.

295
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,319
You're the son
of one of the most important businessmen

296
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,119
in Europe, and here you are, begging.

297
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,720
Phillipe, come on.

298
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,359
It's a way that we can all hang together.
You don't want that?

299
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,079
I would rather have had dinner
with you last night,

300
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,039
but we can't always get what we want.

301
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,559
Pfft.

302
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
-Oh shit.
-Hello.

303
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey.

304
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,160
-You could let Dad know where you've been.
-I already told Patrick, Ari.

305
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,279
Man, I really missed you douchebags.

306
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,519
-Right on.
-Well, well, look who's returned.

307
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,599
Oh, this is great, man!

308
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,079
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

309
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,240
Thank you.

310
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,960
Oh yeah?

311
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,319
It's okay. We can do it. It's our place.

312
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
I like it that way. Yeah.

313
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,359
When we get there, let's make sure
we have time to do everything we planned--

314
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,559
-Morning, ladies.
-Oh, hi.

315
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,400
-All right, I should probably go to class.
-No, no, no, please. Parrilla, stay.

316
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
I want you to sleep at home.

317
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,440
And if Parrilla has nowhere to go,
if she wants, then,

318
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,039
well, she can come over
and stay in a guest room.

319
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,680
Hmm. I was wondering
where you had the hidden camera,

320
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,920
as if we didn't already have
enough cameras.

321
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,680
-What?
-I mean, it's better than where we are.

322
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,240
I'll have you know we're just fine
sleeping in the same bed.

323
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,400
But thanks a lot, Benjamín.

324
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,000
-We can listen to his offer and consider--
-Let's go.

325
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,000
Anyway, thanks a lot.
It was very thoughtful, Ben… Benjamín.

326
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,559
Sorry I couldn't meet up.

327
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,680
Or reply, from what I saw.

328
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,039
Slipped my mind. I'm sorry.

329
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,200
But you don't forget the tickets.

330
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:50,240
You'll hunt me
to the ends of the earth for those.

331
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,599
But anyway, it…
it doesn't matter.

332
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,880
In fact, I'm the one who has to change

333
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,440
the way he interacts
with people moving forward.

334
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,279
I have to lose the fanfare
and stop treating everyone.

335
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
Why?

336
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,839
I want to see how many friends I have left
if I get rid of the prince.

337
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,240
But what's the problem
with being who you are?

338
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,119
You were born to your station.

339
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,839
This Phillipe is the result of his palace,
his fortune, his education,

340
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,599
his family and his friends.
All his riches.

341
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,319
And his wonderful royal genes
played a part.

342
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,039
-Why would you get rid of all that?
-To see who really wants to be in my life.

343
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,160
What am I?

344
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
Am I a fake friend?

345
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,160
All this is is a friend asking a friend
for a favor

346
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,640
that I know he can pull off
because of who he is.

347
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:47,720
A little bit like,
well, I guess, my father.

348
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,559
Because of who he is, he can help you

349
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,160
and bring you here to keep you
away from the rumors in your country.

350
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,119
Excuse me?

351
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,519
If you haven't noticed,

352
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,759
it's always the same four people
at every event.

353
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,240
But hey, don't worry.
Here, only my dad and I know.

354
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,720
Well, and Ari, because I told her.

355
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,079
And as a person
with the privilege of being your pal,

356
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm asking you kindly
to please help me get tickets

357
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,960
to the Ambar Lucid concert… for Ander.

358
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,920
I just want to make him happy.

359
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,039
Check this out.
Who needs Grindr when you have my gaydar?

360
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,200
Oh, that one.

361
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,559
Definitely.

362
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,720
Mm.

363
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
What about him?

364
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,160
No.

365
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,480
Damn.

366
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,200
Look, there's your boy toy.

367
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,039
-Evening.
-Hey.

368
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,279
Oof! No, no, no.
I totally overdid it yesterday.

369
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,200
For you, then.

370
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,839
Thanks so much for defending me
in front of Benjamín.

371
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,839
Hey, you'd do the same.

372
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,720
Hello there.

373
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,240
Hey.

374
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,799
-How are you, Rebeka?
-I'm fine, thanks.

375
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,240
And thanks for the tickets.
And also for the hotel room. Nice of you.

376
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,559
My pleasure.

377
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,119
Well…

378
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,279
I'd like a sparkling water.

379
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,160
What?

380
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,240
What, are you afraid of losing control…
again?

381
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
You just wanna give me
another dressing down, babe?

382
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Undressing, more like it.

383
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,839
Maybe what you're afraid of
is losing control… with me.

384
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,839
Do you know your problem?

385
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,119
You're not as important as you think.

386
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,880
I'll tell you in public and in private.

387
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,720
-Thanks for bringing us.
-Well, thank you for coming.

388
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,839
-Okay, can I ask you something?
-Sure.

389
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,359
Why isn't Cayetana here?

390
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
Well, we're kind of going
through a rough spot.

391
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,359
She doesn't trust me.

392
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,799
Hmm.

393
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,480
And with good reason.

394
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,000
I'M SORRY. IT'S ONLY NORMAL
THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.

395
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,519
NOT EVEN MY FRIENDS DO.

396
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,599
-Hey, I'm gonna go get a beer. Want one?
-Yeah.

397
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm gonna need a beer
to be able to put up with this asshat.

398
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,680
Can you give me two, please?

399
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,559
I love being here with you.

400
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,519
-Did I misread your signals?
-Misread what signals?

401
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,119
I don't know. You accepted my gifts.
You asked me for more.

402
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,400
A room for you and your girlfriend.
You used to cost me way less.

403
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,759
Mencía, we're not children here.

404
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,839
I don't do favors for free,
and neither do you.

405
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,039
I literally am a child.

406
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,000
-Come on.
-Don't touch me!

407
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,599
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

408
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,279
You okay?

409
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,079
Where'd your buddy run off to?

410
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,519
Uh, I don't know.
He had an emergency and had to go.

411
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,559
Are you feelin' okay?

412
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,839
Yeah.

413
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,440
Are you sure?

414
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,519
Yeah, it's all good.

415
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,720
Let's enjoy it.

416
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,400
Ander.

417
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,559
Patrick. You okay?

418
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,839
I'll see you on the dance floor
in a minute.

419
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
Patrick?

420
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,400
Hey!

421
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,760
-Ari, what happened?
-Nothing.

422
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,760
Hey, you need to chill out.

423
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,079
-Both of you, fuck off!
-Hey.

424
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,119
You want me to kick his ass?

425
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,800
-No, my brother just has these outbursts.
-He split your lip.

426
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
-That's not an outburst.
-I'll get ice.

427
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,119
-You better talk to him.
-Just stay here.

428
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,199
Let me look at it. Come here.

429
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
Just some ice, please.

430
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,719
Oh my God.

431
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,320
So, um, what… what got into Patrick?

432
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,760
That did.

433
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Oh shit.

434
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,400
I have to go. I have a lot of work.

435
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,199
-I think I understand Patrick.
-Excuse you?

436
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,000
Not the violence, the pain.

437
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:05,840
What kind of pain can justify
hurting someone you care about?

438
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,079
It doesn't justify it,
but I get how such terrible pain

439
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,599
could make you lose control.

440
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,960
Like my pain every time you look at Guzmán
like you look at me.

441
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,440
What?

442
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,559
Sorry, that's the truth.
It pisses you off, that's your deal.

443
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,119
Are you sure you're okay?

444
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,760
I've had better days, but yeah.

445
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,920
It's all good.

446
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,840
All right, man.

447
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,519
-See ya.
-Later.

448
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,480
Did you forget the keys?

449
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,159
Forget something?

450
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,719
Where's Guzmán?

451
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,440
At home, I would assume.

452
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,679
Oh.

453
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,239
Did you end up drinking after all?

454
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,519
I wish.

455
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,400
Please, I don't wanna see him.

456
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,239
But why?
What's the matter? Did he do it?

457
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,800
-I just wanna go home now.
-I'm sorry. We can't yet.

458
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,920
We have to be patient.

459
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,880
-I understand, sweetheart.
-Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

460
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,679
I should beat it.
She doesn't wanna see me.

461
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,840
No? And why is that?

462
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,559
What's that?

463
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,519
So then, who'd you hit? Huh?

464
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,800
I have to go.
