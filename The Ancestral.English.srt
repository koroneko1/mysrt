1
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,541
Tell me more about
your family's situation.

2
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,916
Is this your mother?

3
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,416
Yes, she was in good health back then.

4
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,875
And now, she's your burden?

5
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,166
Life is hard here.

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,750
You're always burdened by something.

7
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,416
I'm used to it.

8
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,666
However…

9
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,583
I'm afraid the illness is still there.

10
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,000
It won't go away.

11
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,583
I'm worried for my child.

12
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,291
Why do you think
it will affect your child?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,791
Sleep paralysis makes
your mother a dangerous person?

14
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,458
Come here.

15
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,916
Sleep paralysis affects
millions of people.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There is a state of wakefulness
that has not been explained.

17
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,000
This happens when our mind is awake
but our body is still in deep sleep.

18
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:05,291
In many cases, one may not distinguish
between reality and nightmares.

19
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,666
THE ANCESTRAL

20
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,041
This will be a long trip.

21
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,750
I don't know when we will be back.

22
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,000
Do they have bubble tea there?

23
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,000
Yen, why don't you close the blinds?
It's too bright.

24
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,791
I'm afraid of the dark.

25
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,500
There's nothing to be afraid of.

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you okay?

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,333
She's at it again?

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,916
Probably another nightmare.

29
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,458
Remember what I said?

30
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,958
Take a deep breath in.

31
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,208
Breathe out slowly.

32
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,958
Do it slowly.

33
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,916
Help your sister.

34
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,250
Such a long drive.

35
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,416
I'm tired. You girls would be too.

36
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,791
Wake up! It's our ancestral home.

37
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,708
Here you go.

38
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,416
Hey! Are you abandoning me?

39
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,250
Dad!

40
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,541
Let me take care of it.

41
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,250
That's okay.

42
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,166
Go stand in the shade, Princess. I got it.

43
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,458
Sis!

44
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,416
-Sis?
-What?

45
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,666
When do you think
we'll be out of this place?

46
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,458
No clue.

47
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,750
But we'll have friends at the new school.

48
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:43,875
That sucks.

49
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,125
Let's go see the rooms.

50
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,083
You can pick whichever room you want.

51
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,125
Your choice.

52
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:58,041
But the biggest one is mine. Okay?

53
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,166
Smartass!

54
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,875
Smartass?

55
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,125
Don't they say,

56
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,375
"You gotta be the smartest
to be a princess?"

57
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,541
-Whatever!
-Go to your room and sleep.

58
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Sis! Let's check this one out.

59
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,000
Yen! Join me.

60
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,583
-Okay.
-Go!

61
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,833
Eat your food!

62
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,791
Bubble tea?

63
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,375
Whatever.

64
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,166
It's so dry.

65
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,583
-Sis!
-Be careful!

66
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,291
Let me see.

67
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,708
Is it a doll house?

68
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,625
Yeah. Isn't it pretty?

69
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,375
So ugly!

70
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,291
Don't be annoying! Do you want a spanking?

71
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,000
How can you do it in this darkness?

72
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,583
You ask too many questions.
We'll probably get power tomorrow.

73
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,916
-I'll do the chimney.
-No. Let me show you.

74
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,708
Cut little pieces like this
to make the windows.

75
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,791
Listen.

76
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,541
Tomorrow you can pay me
with a bubble tea, okay?

77
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,083
-Sure, if they have that here.
-Yeah.

78
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,375
Don't forget.

79
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,416
Is this okay?

80
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,333
Yen!

81
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,375
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,041
It's because your house is weak.

83
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,583
Just like this house.

84
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,416
You're so annoying.

85
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,291
Hey, girls!

86
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,750
Guess what I found.

87
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,833
Attack!

88
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,541
Tickle!

89
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,166
I'll get you.

90
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,833
-Your back is hurting, isn't it?
-No. Not at all.

91
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,458
Why are you hiding things from me?

92
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm not.

93
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,500
Let me give you a massage.

94
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,500
What? Do you know how?

95
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,833
You're so skinny.
How are you gonna massage me?

96
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,083
I'm not skinny. These arms are strong.

97
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,500
This is strong?

98
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,375
I'm a pro.

99
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,875
She's lying. How would she know?

100
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,500
I agree with your sister.

101
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,708
Good things come in small packages.

102
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,250
Okay, since you're begging,
I'll give you a chance.

103
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,250
-Show me what you got.
-When did I beg you?

104
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,708
You've been begging.

105
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,041
Okay, do your best.

106
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,041
Wait.

107
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,041
-Come on, Dad.
-Okay.

108
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm ready.

109
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,791
-Here I come!
-Okay.

110
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,916
What is this?
This is torture, not a massage!

111
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,875
Are you kidding me?

112
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,166
Is that you, Yen?

113
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,375
It's the boogeyman.

114
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,625
Go to sleep!

115
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Damn you! So stubborn!

116
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,500
Yen!

117
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,916
Wake up! Wake up!

118
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,000
Wake up! Dad!

119
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,583
Yen!

120
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,958
Yen!

121
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,833
-Are you okay?
-Get off me!

122
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,750
Yen!

123
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,125
-It's me!
-Let me go!

124
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,875
Yen! It's me.

125
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,333
Dad!

126
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,375
Dad!

127
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,541
Yen! It's me.

128
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,916
What happened?

129
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,625
-Is she sleepwalking again?
-Yes.

130
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,125
It's okay. I'm here, it's all right.

131
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,041
Inhale, exhale.

132
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,166
Inhale, exhale.

133
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,500
That's right! Good!

134
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,208
Okay, let's go.

135
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,625
It's okay.

136
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,833
It's okay. I'll take her inside.

137
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,416
She'll be okay.

138
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,208
I'm here, it's all right.

139
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,000
Her heart…

140
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,458
is beating so fast.

141
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,708
That's the reason why we have to

142
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,833
take care of her.

143
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,875
But why does she sleepwalk?

144
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,416
She has nightmares
due to prolonged stress.

145
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,583
She wasn't like this before.

146
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,916
I don't know
how to explain this to you girls.

147
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,875
But I think

148
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,583
if we'd stayed in our old house,

149
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,250
she'd have gotten worse.

150
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,000
I think being there won't do her any good.

151
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,083
I know.

152
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,791
Honestly,

153
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,291
I feel bad dragging you two through this.

154
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,333
You girls should be going to school,

155
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,583
making friends…

156
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,333
Rather than coming here with me.

157
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,625
But that's life.

158
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,833
There's just the three of us now.

159
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,625
We have to take care of each other.

160
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:27,833
You're the big sister,
you have to be strong for her.

161
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,583
I was also thinking

162
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,833
that we shouldn't live there anymore.

163
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,958
I couldn't forget about Mom.

164
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,416
I know.

165
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,166
I know you miss her.

166
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,791
Let's go to bed.

167
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:35,958
Yen!

168
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,416
You were sleepwalking last night.

169
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,833
Did you know where you were standing?

170
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,375
Where?

171
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,375
In the altar room.

172
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,750
Hey.

173
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,958
Last night I dreamt of Mom again.

174
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,833
Of her dying?

175
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,875
It's just a dream. It's not real.
Don't be scared.

176
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,958
But it feels so real to me.

177
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,583
Dreams are like that.
Besides, she died at the hospital.

178
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,916
Sis.

179
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,375
When I dream about her dying,

180
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,625
I think there was
someone else in the room.

181
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,416
Was it dad?

182
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,250
We weren't there
when she died in the hospital.

183
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,458
No, not dad.

184
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,333
Who was it then?

185
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,625
I don't know.

186
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,458
But it looked like…

187
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,125
a ghost.

188
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,000
We got power. Feels good?

189
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,833
You girls stay home and help me tidy up.
There's still lots to do.

190
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,750
I'm going into town.
I'll be back in the afternoon.

191
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,750
Remember to be home for dinner.

192
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,875
Got it.

193
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,375
It's iPad time!

194
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:58,041
Hey! Help your sister. Don't be lazy.

195
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,083
Yes, sir.

196
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,333
It's so dusty, isn't it?

197
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,375
You're asking for trouble.

198
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:30,000
Keep watching zombie stuff,
and I bet you'll dream about them.

199
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,833
Is that you, Yen?

200
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,708
Yen?

201
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:40,833
Yen!

202
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,583
Yen! Stop messing around!

203
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,625
Come and get me.

204
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,791
Damn you!

205
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,208
Peekaboo!

206
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,083
This way!

207
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,375
I'm over here.

208
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,375
-Come and get me!
-Teasing me?

209
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,041
Over here.

210
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:47,958
Yen!

211
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,208
Yen!

212
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,125
Come here!

213
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,416
Yen!

214
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,500
Yen!

215
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,250
-How dare you!
-You're a mess!

216
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,541
-Who were you running from?
-You.

217
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,041
Did you see her too?

218
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,125
Just you.

219
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,833
Quit joking around. I meant the old lady.

220
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:53,625
Yeah. I saw her.

221
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,541
But, who was she?

222
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:57,916
Where did she go?

223
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,083
She ran that way.

224
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,916
Disappeared.

225
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:05,791
-Let's go!
-Where?

226
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,958
What about the clothes?

227
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,083
Hey!

228
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,333
-Hello!
-Hi!

229
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,583
-Please come in.
-Yes.

230
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,500
Hey.

231
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,541
Did you find her?

232
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,541
See…

233
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,666
It's not just my imagination.
You saw her too, right?

234
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,791
I'm pretty, not crazy.

235
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,166
Carry on.

236
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,791
Hi, girls.

237
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,791
Kids. This is Ms. Hanh.

238
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,791
She will be your tutor.

239
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,791
Your dad has told me a lot about you.

240
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,166
Let me guess.

241
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,500
The taller one with the oval face is Yen.

242
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:11,208
And Linh has dimples when she smiles?

243
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,625
No, I'm Linh.

244
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,458
And I'm Yen.

245
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,666
Say hello, girls.

246
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,708
-Hello.
-Okay.

247
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,250
Study with your tutor.
I got somewhere to be.

248
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,125
-Let's do it!
-Okay.

249
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,208
Did you girls sleep well last night?

250
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,125
We're not familiar with the place yet.

251
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,333
I heard Yen has trouble sleeping?

252
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,166
Well…

253
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:05,958
Yen has nightmares.

254
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,458
Hello.

255
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,375
My name is Bubble Tea.

256
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,500
Let's be friends.

257
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
This is for you.

258
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,916
Thank you.

259
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,958
-Her name is Bubble Tea?
-Yeah.

260
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,208
It's so cute.

261
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,541
Is this your daughter's?

262
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,875
I'm not a mom yet.

263
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,041
This was a gift from my mother to me.

264
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,750
Whenever I held her, I slept well.
I rarely got nightmares.

265
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,000
Thank you.

266
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,208
How's everyone doing?

267
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,791
Studying well?

268
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,333
Of course.

269
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:53,291
You know what? You're so blessed
to have such sweet girls.

270
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,458
We were just talking
about Yen's nightmares.

271
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,500
Actually, your dad has told
me about Yen's situation.

272
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,625
But first of all,

273
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
I have a surprise for you both.

274
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,500
By the way,
I studied psychology at a university.

275
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:11,625
So you can talk to me
about anything you want.

276
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,375
Ms. Hanh has helped our family.
Especially with settling here.

277
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:21,250
Okay.

278
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:22,791
After you.

279
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,666
Here?

280
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,125
We are in our first room.

281
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:44,291
Can you guess whose room this is?

282
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,666
It's mine, isn't it?

283
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,833
That's correct.

284
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,083
It's so cute.

285
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:57,041
-Bubble Tea will have a friend now.
-Dad, you did all this yourself?

286
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:00,791
Look at the decorations.

287
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,583
There has to be a woman's touch.

288
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,750
Look.

289
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,958
I can barely iron my own shirt.

290
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:10,833
To be honest,

291
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,291
there is another surprise.

292
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,000
Let's open door number two.

293
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:42,791
Dad!

294
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,916
-When did you do all this for us?
-I wanted the best for you two.

295
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,166
Have you seen my room?

296
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,666
It looks like a pig pen.

297
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:55,416
I also prepared some craft materials.
I hope you like them.

298
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,333
Thank you. Thank you, Dad.

299
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,791
Let's talk more tomorrow.

300
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,666
I'll get going.

301
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:02,958
Goodbye.

302
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,916
This comes with a photo.

303
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,083
Girls, I'll go out for a bit.

304
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,500
I might be home late.

305
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,958
When you're done cleaning up,
take care of her.

306
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,375
Because you're bad.

307
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,291
There's a crazy girl!

308
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,208
Yen!

309
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,291
It's me, Yen!

310
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,333
Yen!

311
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:34,958
Yen!

312
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,625
-Wait.
-Stand back.

313
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,833
Don't wake her.

314
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,875
We have to let her wake up by herself.

315
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:47,500
If we wake her too suddenly,
she might have a panic attack.

316
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,916
It could even be fatal.

317
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:09,541
It's okay. It's okay.

318
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,083
I'm right here. It's okay.

319
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,583
Calm down. I'm here.

320
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,625
Listen to me.

321
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,791
Breathe in deeply and breathe out.

322
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,833
Breathe in deeply, that's right.
Deep breath in. Breathe out.

323
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,791
I'm here. It's okay.

324
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,291
Linh.

325
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,916
I love you girls very much.

326
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,041
I can't always be here for you.

327
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,208
You're the big sister.

328
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,625
You know how hard it is, right?

329
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,958
Being a woman

330
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,041
is not as easy as it seems.

331
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,541
Aside from being a wife

332
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,500
and a mother,

333
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,416
you have to be a good cook,

334
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,583
and a responsible and dutiful person.

335
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,166
But that's not all.

336
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,791
Linh.

337
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,708
When you grow up...

338
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,458
if you love anything...

339
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,458
want anything,

340
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,208
you have to pursue it.

341
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,458
Don't wait.

342
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,625
Life is short.

343
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,500
Let's just keep it up for now.

344
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,541
Yen still remembers those terrible things.

345
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,083
And Yen keeps making up horror stories.

346
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,333
That smells so good.

347
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,833
Thank you.

348
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,666
Enjoy your meal.

349
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,333
Sit down, honey.

350
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,125
This looks so good. You're so talented.

351
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:46,458
Everything you have remembered
about your mother are all just nightmares.

352
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,041
They are not real.

353
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,125
You should forget it all.

354
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:55,166
Your mother's sudden death
has traumatized you into bad memories.

355
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,583
Your present life is what's real.

356
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:10,875
Dad!

357
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,041
What's wrong?

358
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,500
Last night…

359
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,416
I saw something…

360
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,500
I mean...

361
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,750
I felt like there was
someone in our house.

362
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,708
Are you okay?

363
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,750
Why do you look so tense?

364
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:52,666
I saw someone in Yen's room.

365
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:55,708
Are you sure?

366
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,208
You have to believe me. I saw a shadow…

367
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,166
or someone sitting on top of Yen.

368
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:07,458
Listen to me.

369
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,166
What if your sister hears you
talking nonsense like this?

370
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,458
It will scare her.

371
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,208
You are her big sister, right?

372
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,500
Maybe I was tired.

373
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,291
But, Dad,

374
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,375
what is Ms. Hanh doing here?

375
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,750
What do you mean by asking me that?

376
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,625
Because…

377
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,833
she seems to know a lot about Yen.

378
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,583
Like she's a professional.

379
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,708
Of course. She studied psychology.

380
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,083
Okay.

381
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,458
Hey.

382
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,000
You couldn't sleep last night?

383
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,833
Yeah.

384
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,583
I must have been tired and seeing things.

385
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,125
Let me watch something else, please.

386
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,708
I'm so bored.

387
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,708
Sis…

388
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,208
Hello! Check!

389
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:42,916
One. Two. Three. Four. Check.

390
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,541
Wanna sing with me?

391
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,750
Times are tough.
I gotta have a second career.

392
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:51,916
What?

393
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,000
Are you any good to challenge me?

394
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,291
Are you kidding?
I used to be a singer back then.

395
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,500
So?

396
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,833
Come on.

397
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,125
I'm a pretty good singer. Watch me!

398
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,416
SONG: "TIEN DUA" - MALE TONE

399
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,708
Dad!

400
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,291
Dad!

401
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,333
-This song is boring. Pick another one.
-I think it's good.

402
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,875
-I'm good, right?
-Let me pick.

403
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,333
Okay, your choice.

404
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,041
What? This song?

405
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,083
-I can't do this song.
-Yes, you can.

406
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,458
Just look at the lyrics.

407
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:48,625
Sing!

408
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,666
What? Okay.

409
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:58,583
Dance too.

410
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:46,666
Yen…

411
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:48,375
Yen.

412
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,041
What's wrong?

413
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,583
Are you okay?

414
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,000
I couldn't move.

415
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,583
It was just a bad dream.
I'm here. It's okay.

416
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:21,666
I…

417
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,125
saw…

418
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,083
the devil…

419
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,708
And…

420
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,875
It was Miss Hanh.

421
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,375
I think your situation is getting worse.

422
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,000
You're too stressed out
and imagining things.

423
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,166
I'm afraid it can be dangerous.

424
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,000
But don't worry.

425
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,666
I can treat you with a new approach.

426
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,875
We will succeed this time.

427
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,583
This is due to your bad past memories.
It's not real.

428
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,916
Listen to her.

429
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,625
Clearly I…

430
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,000
I saw…

431
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,750
the devil.

432
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,750
Calm down. Look at me.

433
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,291
Listen to me.

434
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,333
There are no such things as ghosts.

435
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,416
If you think of them all day,

436
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,750
you will dream
about them at night, understand?

437
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,708
Why does she keep getting worse?

438
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,333
I think, for now,

439
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:42,916
Yen has to practice replacing bad memories
with good ones from the present.

440
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,833
This will work for sure.

441
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,833
But it hurts me.

442
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,541
It was strong.

443
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,708
Are you hurt anywhere else?

444
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,208
Did you fall down somewhere?

445
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:57,458
I don't know.

446
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,541
There are cases
where people can hurt themselves

447
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,291
in an attempt to wake up.

448
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,250
I'll take her outside.

449
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,250
Wait…

450
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,291
Watch her.

451
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:35,791
Hurry up.

452
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,500
-Sis!
-What?

453
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,583
Do you think Hanh will soon be our mother?

454
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:41,583
What are you talking about?

455
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,916
Don't you think she's suspicious?

456
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,125
Her and dad.

457
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,375
What is suspicious?

458
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,041
She's smart.

459
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:52,791
Very smart.

460
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,125
You're such a gossip!

461
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,208
What did you hear earlier?

462
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,041
-You're annoying.
-Linh!

463
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,291
Yes?

464
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,708
If there's anything I can do,
I'm here for you.

465
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:13,541
I'm here to help you girls.

466
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:16,750
Okay.

467
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:19,666
I know this is a difficult time
for you both.

468
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,083
Don't misunderstand us.

469
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,625
Your dad always wants
what is best for the both of you.

470
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:30,041
Let's all try our best.

471
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:33,125
Yeah!

472
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,458
Yeah!

473
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,708
I understand. We need to go.

474
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:40,666
I gotta go.

475
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,083
It's so beautiful here.

476
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,958
This is far enough.
Can't see our house from here. Get down.

477
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,541
What are we going to do here?

478
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,041
Let's go home.

479
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,916
Are you kidding me?

480
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,875
-Fine, stay if you want.
-Let me get on.

481
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,666
Why aren't we staying?

482
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,458
-You're weird.
-I haven't been out in a long time.

483
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,000
Get down.

484
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,333
Hurry up.

485
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,583
I don't know what they're doing in there.

486
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,208
No clue.

487
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,333
Can you see anything?

488
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,250
Yes.

489
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,583
Not a thing.

490
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,125
Probably just playing house.

491
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,166
No big deal.

492
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:12,375
Why would adults play house?

493
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,458
Then what do adults play?

494
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,333
Get up here.

495
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:20,750
Where?

496
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,375
Be careful.

497
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,000
Hurry up.

498
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:34,000
No, it's scary.

499
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:38,458
-Come on, you have to try.
-No. I'm too weak.

500
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,625
You always call me skinny.

501
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,291
Don't you remember?

502
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,833
Listen to me, Yen.

503
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,541
You have to trust me.
You have to believe you can do it.

504
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,083
I got you.

505
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,875
Come here.

506
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,500
Are you sure?

507
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,916
Protect me.

508
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,541
-Slowly.
-Okay.

509
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,041
Help me!

510
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:20,916
Almost.

511
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,375
Be careful!

512
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,708
I know.

513
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:28,458
Landed safely.

514
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,708
See?

515
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,458
I told you.

516
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,916
There's something going on.

517
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,583
Can he see us?

518
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:47,750
-Cover up.
-Shut up.

519
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,166
Is dad crying?

520
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,250
Yeah, he is crying.

521
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:06,041
Yen! Are you okay?

522
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,458
I'm sorry.

523
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,041
I'm okay.

524
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:20,916
Yen!

525
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,708
Yen! Yen!

526
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,500
What happened?

527
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,291
-Yen fell down.
-What?

528
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:31,791
Yen!

529
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,583
-Yen!
-Yen!

530
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,833
-Yen!
-Yen!

531
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,875
-Yen!
-Yen!

532
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:38,541
Yen!

533
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:40,666
Are you hurt?

534
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:44,375
Why don't you answer me?
What were you girls doing?

535
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,791
What did you do to make her fall?

536
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,416
-Are you okay?
-I trusted you.

537
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,750
You have to protect her.

538
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,041
Why did you let her fall?

539
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,916
Why aren't you answering me?

540
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,458
Did I kill her?

541
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,125
What did you just say?

542
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,666
I killed her.

543
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:00,583
What did you say?

544
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:03,166
-What kind of sister are you?
-Thanh!

545
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,750
You're scaring her.

546
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,375
It's not your fault. Listen to me.

547
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:08,500
Yen will be okay.

548
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:09,833
It's not your fault.

549
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,708
Let's go find someone to help her.

550
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:13,041
Let's go. She'll be okay.

551
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,416
It's not your fault.

552
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,958
Yen! Can you hear me?

553
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:21,791
It's too deep.

554
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:24,833
Come to this side.

555
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,750
It's not your fault.

556
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,208
We will find her.

557
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,125
She'll be okay.

558
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,916
Okay?

559
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,333
Sis!

560
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,041
Sis!

561
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,416
Where am I?

562
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:45,583
It stinks down here!

563
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,166
Who's there?

564
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:24,000
Let me go!

565
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,041
Let go of me!

566
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,791
You'll fall asleep if you close your eyes.

567
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:46,208
I want to stay awake.
I don't want to sleep.

568
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,750
I can't sleep.

569
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,250
They'll get you!

570
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,916
Hey, what are you doing here?

571
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
Your children cannot know about this.

572
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,125
We have to find a way to protect them.

573
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,583
I think you and I have to stay calm.

574
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,625
We will find a way to hide this

575
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,000
without them ever knowing.

576
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,291
Yen!

577
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,125
Yen, come here.

578
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,833
Come here.

579
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:26,250
Come to me.

580
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,375
This is only a nightmare.

581
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,833
You are dreaming.

582
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,000
This is not real.

583
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:34,208
It's only a dream.

584
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:36,000
This is a nightmare.

585
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,583
You're dreaming.

586
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,208
You're dreaming.

587
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,583
You're dreaming.

588
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:50,125
I think she's still conscious.

589
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,041
Yen.

590
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,000
She's okay.

591
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,875
She'll feel better after a nap.

592
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,125
I'm sorry.

593
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,583
Dad, what is this place anyway?

594
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,208
Linh,

595
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,208
I want to show you something.

596
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,500
The truth is this is a facility
specializing in mental illness.

597
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:26,625
And my specialty
is studying sleep paralysis

598
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,750
and its effects on the human psyche.

599
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,291
So this is a nut house?

600
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:31,958
No, it's not.

601
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:33,750
It's a research center.

602
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,708
So our house is not our home?

603
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,833
It's part of a section
in this research center.

604
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,166
Hanh has been helping me all this time.

605
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:44,333
I'm sorry I couldn't spend
more time with you and Yen.

606
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:47,625
I asked her to help you two
overcome the pain of losing your mother.

607
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,458
Your family has a history
of sleep paralysis.

608
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:53,333
You mother had it,
so both of you would have it too.

609
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,000
Your father is a special case.

610
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,416
And I think Yen's is worse
because of your father.

611
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,000
We had to erase Yen's negative memories.

612
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,708
If a person cannot overcome
their traumatic memories,

613
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:05,666
their dreams will become nightmares
and turn into hallucinations.

614
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,916
A sleep paralysis patient

615
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,041
will feel like a demon's
pressing on their chest,

616
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,250
holding them down,

617
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,166
stopping them from moving.

618
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,416
It gets stronger,

619
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,291
heavier, making the person feel paralyzed.

620
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,375
Their whole body will tense up.

621
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,916
It can lead to suffocation and even…

622
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,250
sudden death.

623
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,083
Who are the strangers in our house?

624
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,291
I'm sorry.

625
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:30,833
They are patients here,
who got lost and ended up in the yard.

626
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:34,083
A long time ago, this was a local port.

627
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:37,958
After years of renovating, it became
the research center as you see now.

628
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:42,041
Underground are the remains of this port,

629
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:45,416
creating a tunnel
between the hospital and your house.

630
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,250
Those patients ended up in the house

631
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:50,500
through an opening
in the hospital's warehouse.

632
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,333
But don't worry.

633
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,875
They are harmless. They need our sympathy.

634
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:58,916
-You're awake?
-How do you feel?

635
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,458
How are you?

636
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,166
I saw Ms. Hanh.

637
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,833
When mom died.

638
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,250
Linh! Linh!

639
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,500
Listen to me.

640
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,041
Why did you lie to me?

641
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,250
Your mom was very ill.

642
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,083
You said she died of cancer.

643
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,291
I don't trust you anymore.

644
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,166
Why did you have to treat her?

645
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,291
Listen to me.

646
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:27,708
She was depressed,
and anxiety attacks kept her up at night.

647
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:30,541
It took over her mind,
making her lock herself up all day.

648
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,166
It was a hard time for us.
Don't you understand?

649
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,333
Of course I do.

650
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,125
You didn't think I felt the sadness?

651
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:39,291
That's why

652
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,083
I needed a doctor.

653
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:42,833
She was getting worse.

654
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:46,666
With nightmares and sleep paralysis.
I didn't know what to do.

655
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,166
I was terrified.

656
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,125
She couldn't control herself.
She didn't know who she was.

657
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:53,166
-And then she…
-Committed suicide.

658
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:54,916
Yen saw everything.

659
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,125
Why am I only hearing about it now?

660
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:02,625
Linh. I'm sorry. I couldn't save your mom.

661
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:05,208
But now, I've promised myself

662
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,958
that I'll do whatever it takes
to not let Yen hurt again.

663
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,750
You have to understand that
when she died, you weren't there.

664
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:13,791
I didn't know how to explain.

665
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,458
I needed time.

666
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:19,041
I needed time to face the truth
and to find a good time to let you know.

667
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:20,541
Is that all?

668
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,666
That's why you put us in this nut house?

669
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:25,041
For what?

670
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:26,958
So Hanh can brainwash Yen?

671
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:29,333
It's not like that.
It's the only way to save her.

672
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,750
You have to listen to me.

673
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:33,708
How dare you?

674
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:37,625
And you.

675
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:40,291
You ruined our family.

676
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,083
Linh! Linh!

677
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,000
Thanh.

678
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,583
Give her space.

679
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:05,958
Don't worry! I can take care of it.

680
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,250
I can take care of it.

681
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:18,916
I can't find it.

682
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,125
Babe, you look beautiful in that dress.

683
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,958
We don't take photos together often.

684
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,041
I don't see our stuff.

685
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,291
Hurry up.

686
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,750
Are you not wearing your ring?

687
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,250
Where's your ring?

688
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,166
We will stay here…

689
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,083
This…

690
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:12,708
is our family.

691
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:16,375
We won't go anywhere.

692
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,333
Your mom wants us to be here.

693
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,125
Our family will stay here.

694
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:18,958
Are you okay?

695
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,416
You saw it too, didn't you?

696
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,041
It's okay.

697
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,416
I'm here.

698
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:44,208
I'll always be with you.

699
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,333
I won't leave you.

700
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:51,875
Yen!

701
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,083
I think I saw it…

702
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,000
It's the devil himself.

703
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,041
But it was dad…

704
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,083
Dad!

705
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:22,958
What are you doing here?

706
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,458
We won't stay here anymore.
Let's get out of here.

707
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,666
What's wrong? Tell me.

708
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,541
There are demons in this house.

709
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,083
I'm scared.
Let's go back to where we were.

710
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,250
Go inside.

711
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,833
I really hate this place.
I don't want Yen to stay here.

712
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:45,083
We must go back to the city.

713
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,458
I don't care what you think.

714
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:49,791
Where did you learn to talk like that?
You have no respect for me?

715
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,291
Whatever it is, it takes time.

716
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:57,791
You think moving here was easy?
You have to be patient.

717
01:15:57,875 --> 01:15:58,833
What about you?

718
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:01,833
You are the big sister,
you have to set an example.

719
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,666
Instead you're scaring her
with your nonsense.

720
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,458
Do you think that's right?

721
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,125
Even I get nightmares.

722
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,375
Terrible things have happened
and you don't trust me.

723
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:15,000
And it's all your fault.

724
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,791
After everything I've done,

725
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,333
everything I've sacrificed,

726
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,166
you say it's my fault?

727
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:30,291
Because of me?

728
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:32,250
What did I do wrong?

729
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:34,458
You are always forcing us with Ms. Hanh.

730
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,791
She's replacing mom, isn't she?

731
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,750
Did you forget mom?

732
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:42,833
It's your fault mom died.

733
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,666
Dad! Let her go.

734
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,041
Let her go, please!

735
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,875
Dad!

736
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:57,041
She's my sister. Let go of her!

737
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:59,541
She's my sister.

738
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,666
Dad!

739
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,916
Please.

740
01:17:02,958 --> 01:17:04,416
Let go of her.

741
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,666
She's my sister.

742
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:56,791
Sis! What do you think dad's
been doing up there all day?

743
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:58,875
Yen, come here.

744
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:06,250
Listen.

745
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,375
If anything happens, you have to run.

746
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,500
What about you?

747
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:14,458
I'll be right beside you.

748
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,916
We're really doing this?

749
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:24,708
Something's wrong with dad.

750
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,041
He's not the same anymore.

751
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,583
I'm not staying here.

752
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:30,333
But…

753
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,125
But…

754
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,125
I'm scared.

755
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,458
What are you scared of?

756
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:36,666
I don't know.

757
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,458
Sometimes, dad really scares me.

758
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,291
You look gangster.

759
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:51,750
Yen.

760
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,458
You have to toughen up.

761
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,416
I need you.

762
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:57,333
We're a team.

763
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,833
Okay?

764
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,166
Sis?

765
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,583
Ms. Hanh is probably up there with dad.

766
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:21,416
Let's go back.

767
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,916
-Let's go to our room.
-No one's here.

768
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:28,958
Take this.

769
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,166
Back off.

770
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,500
Wait here.

771
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:14,791
Sis!

772
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:16,458
Sis!

773
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,958
Dad, what are you doing?

774
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,541
I'm so happy today.

775
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,375
Why are you happy?

776
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:52,958
Your mom…

777
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,416
What about her?

778
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,708
I miss your mother.

779
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:57,583
But she died.

780
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:10,750
Don't say that.

781
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,083
I've spoken to her.

782
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,791
Hanh helped me talk to her.

783
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,875
We will be together again.

784
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,208
We will be happy.

785
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:23,041
I want us all to live here.

786
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,500
We will be here with mom.

787
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:26,708
Always beside her.

788
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,625
Wake up, Dad.

789
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:36,291
There.

790
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,541
That's your mother.

791
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:39,625
Can't you see?

792
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,208
-Dad.
-Babe.

793
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:43,833
Answer your daughter.

794
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,583
Dad!

795
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:51,625
Look at me!

796
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:53,041
Dad!

797
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:56,875
Dad, wake up!

798
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,250
Mom is not here.

799
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,791
She died a year ago.

800
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,000
There's only Yen and I.

801
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:06,958
We shouldn't stay here.

802
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:09,000
Let's go back to the city.

803
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,041
Stop it.

804
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,166
Your mom is not dead.

805
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,583
You have to trust me.

806
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:26,458
Babe!

807
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,541
Why don't you tell her?

808
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:31,791
Tell her.

809
01:22:31,875 --> 01:22:33,041
Talk to her.

810
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,666
I miss her.

811
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,250
Dad!

812
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:13,666
Sis!

813
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,791
Dad!

814
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:22,666
Yen!

815
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:26,250
Yen!

816
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,666
Where are you, Yen?

817
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:48,291
-Ms. Hanh!
-Linh!

818
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:49,333
What happened?

819
01:23:49,416 --> 01:23:51,000
Dad and Yen disappeared.

820
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:54,541
It's okay. I'm here.

821
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,500
Tell me. What happened?

822
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:57,916
Dad took Yen away.

823
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,791
I'm so scared. He's different.

824
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,500
What do we do now? I can't find them.

825
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:04,791
Follow me.

826
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:54,291
Where are you?

827
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,125
Thanh.

828
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:03,541
-Thanh!
-No way.

829
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,458
Thanh. It's me. Where is Yen?

830
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:12,625
Thanh!

831
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:15,041
What did you do to her? Tell me.

832
01:25:15,875 --> 01:25:17,583
Did you hurt her?

833
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,458
-Where is Yen? Is she okay?
-Babe.

834
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:22,666
-Tell me. Did you hurt her?
-I'm up here.

835
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,750
-You hurt her, didn't you?
-I heard you.

836
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:25,708
I can hear you.

837
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:27,166
-Thanh!
-I'm coming!

838
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,041
Thanh!

839
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:34,708
Do you see me now?

840
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,791
I can see you well.

841
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,583
-Listen to me.
-I'm here.

842
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:39,833
-I know you're here.
-Thanh!

843
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:40,833
Don't you see me?

844
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,791
Thanh! Don't let it take over you!

845
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:44,125
-Thanh!
-I know you're here.

846
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:47,416
-It's not real. Don't be like that.
-I can feel you.

847
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,083
-Don't let it take over you, Thanh!
-I can feel you.

848
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:51,125
I'm here.

849
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:52,916
I know you're here.

850
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm close to you.

851
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,208
I can feel you.

852
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:56,500
Thanh!

853
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:57,416
Look at me.

854
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,250
Are you looking for your wife?

855
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:00,333
I can feel you.

856
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:02,541
I'm here.

857
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:04,375
I'm right here.

858
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:09,958
Are you looking for me?

859
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,541
I'm here with you, honey.

860
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:19,250
I need you to focus here.

861
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:28,958
I'll count from one to five.

862
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,833
You'll go to sleep.

863
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,250
I'll count from one to five.

864
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:38,958
You'll go to sleep.

865
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,166
One.

866
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,125
Two.

867
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:49,291
Three.

868
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,750
Four.

869
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,458
Five.

870
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:02,708
Thanh!

871
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,833
I came for you.

872
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,500
I knew you were here.

873
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:18,458
I miss you so much.

874
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,291
Are you tired?

875
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:41,666
I am.

876
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:43,875
I'm exhausted.

877
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,333
I'm not a good husband

878
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:49,375
or a good father.

879
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:51,833
I failed.

880
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,833
It's my fault.

881
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,125
I need you now.

882
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:02,208
I only need you.

883
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:06,333
From now on,
you don't have to worry anymore.

884
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,083
I'm their mother.

885
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:12,125
Can you bring them to me?

886
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:16,125
Can you?

887
01:29:22,666 --> 01:29:23,750
I knew you were here.

888
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:28,833
Yen!

889
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:51,666
Dad!

890
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:55,125
Dad!

891
01:29:55,208 --> 01:29:56,291
Wake up!

892
01:29:59,583 --> 01:30:00,916
You have to fight it.

893
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:02,333
Don't hurt Yen.

894
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:04,875
Back off.

895
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,375
Don't do what it wants.

896
01:30:09,208 --> 01:30:10,041
It's not real.

897
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,541
Yen has to be with mom.

898
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,458
No.

899
01:30:18,416 --> 01:30:19,833
She needs you and me.

900
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,250
There's only one way.

901
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,583
This is the only way.

902
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:34,833
Dad.

903
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,875
I know you can do it. Fight it.

904
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:39,958
You don't have to do this.

905
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:41,666
Give her to me.

906
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,458
I have to save my child.

907
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:48,333
Dad! You already saved us.

908
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,791
We're a family.

909
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,500
You're my father.

910
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:53,125
Mom died.

911
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:56,041
We can't lose you too.

912
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,541
We need you.

913
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,583
I need you.

914
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,333
-Give Yen to me.
-I'll kill her if you come near.

915
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:11,875
I was wrong.

916
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,375
I couldn't keep your mother.

917
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:17,041
Fix it then.

918
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,500
Give her to me.

919
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,125
Our family will be one again.

920
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:24,791
It's the truth.

921
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:29,625
Mom?

922
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:31,916
We'll be together again.

923
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,791
Dad! Mom died.

924
01:31:39,625 --> 01:31:40,708
She's not here.

925
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:45,000
She killed herself
because she wasn't happy.

926
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,333
It wasn't your fault that she was sick.

927
01:31:50,166 --> 01:31:51,458
It's not anyone's fault.

928
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,541
Let her rest in peace.

929
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,541
Let me take her.

930
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:36,333
What's wrong?

931
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,583
What do you want?

932
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:44,083
Your child.

933
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,125
Leave my child alone.

934
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:50,125
If you want to take a life, take mine.

935
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,291
Take my soul.

936
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:56,875
Don't hurt them.

937
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,916
They're innocent.

938
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,333
Dad, look at me.

939
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:02,000
Where are you?

940
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,291
Come and face me!

941
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:04,875
Don't hurt my children.

942
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,250
I want her life.

943
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,416
Dad!

944
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:12,291
I have to save you two.

945
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:18,750
Dad!

946
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:19,916
Come and face me!

947
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:21,916
Come here!

948
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,250
Dad!

949
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,500
Are you ready, Yen?

950
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:38,833
Are you okay?

951
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:43,583
I'm okay. Let's go.

952
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:45,083
Yeah, we're late.

953
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,000
Hurry up!

954
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,250
Dad's cooking.

955
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:54,375
Just a moment. Food is almost ready.

956
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,750
You are actually cooking?

957
01:34:55,833 --> 01:34:57,000
Of course.

958
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:00,791
Just a moment.

959
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:03,041
It's my favorite. Not sure if it's edible.

960
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:04,166
Why wouldn't it be?

961
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,875
When it's too delicious,
don't come crawling back

962
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,708
asking me to cook for you everyday.

963
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:11,250
Looks nice. But will it be
as good as mom's cooking?

964
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,833
I promise, I'll make her proud.

965
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:18,541
It's almost ready.

966
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,666
Just a bit more.

967
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:24,125
Great! Okay, go sit over there.

968
01:35:24,791 --> 01:35:26,041
-Thank you, Dad.
-Okay.

969
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,833
They'll get you when you're asleep.

970
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:37,291
Why does it still hurt?

971
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,833
It strangles me!

972
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:42,625
I can't sleep.

973
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,791
Can you help me, please?
