1
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,458
My name is Nack.

2
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,625
I am an ordinary high school boy.

3
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,166
I am studying
in an all-boys private school.

4
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,625
I live a normal, unexciting life.

5
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,500
I am always with my gang.

6
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,583
There are four guys including me, and...

7
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,375
Nack, let me copy your answers
of the English assignment.

8
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,541
Here it is!

9
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:38,833
Okay. Okay.

10
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,041
After you finish,
me and Toey will copy too.

11
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,041
Okay. Okay.

12
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,500
They are just a few assignments.

13
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,875
Toh, have you seen this video clip?

14
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,291
Well...

15
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,333
Let me see.

16
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,333
Damn, Toey! Why do you always have
a lot of porno clips?

17
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,541
I'm in the chat group of my old friends.

18
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,375
You can name the girls you want to see,
I got it all.

19
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,250
Nack, Dook, you two want some?

20
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:18,500
No!

21
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,583
I prefer sexy cartoon characters.

22
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,875
Let's take a selfie. I want to upload
a new photo on my Instagram.

23
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,791
-All right.
-Nack, come here.

24
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,083
Come, come.

25
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,500
Let's see.

26
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,625
Dook, come closer.

27
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,583
You, come closer.

28
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,041
One more!

29
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,541
Toh! You always update your Instagram.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,583
You got 40k followers!

31
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,416
Wow! You're really a Net Idol!

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,583
But recently,

33
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,041
the number of my followers
hasn't increased much.

34
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,833
Should I pretend to love a boy
for yaoi girls?

35
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,916
What? Why are you looking at me?

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
You, Nack. We can be a fake couple.

37
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,083
-Hey!
-Hey! Come on, Nack.

38
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,666
You know, a fake couple.

39
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,708
-You're crazy! No way!
-Why?

40
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,791
-Right.
-No way!

41
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,750
Wow!

42
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,750
-What's with him?
-Here comes the teacher.

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,875
Don't forget my number one rule.

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,791
When the class begins,
I won't talk to anyone.

45
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,583
I will focus on my studies.
Don't bother me.

46
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,583
-Understand?
-Stand up, please!

47
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,041
Attention!

48
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,000
Good morning.

49
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,375
Good morning.

50
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,583
First of all, I'll announce
the results of the latest Math exam.

51
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,458
The highest score goes to...

52
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,333
Tanapat!

53
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,458
Look at Toy,
he always sits with the bad boy gang

54
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,000
but still gets the highest score
in Mathematics.

55
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,416
That's because he sees a tutor.

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,125
No one in our gang does.

57
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,666
I am too lazy.

58
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,833
My mom works so hard alone.

59
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,500
I don't want to ask for her money
to pay for a tutor.

60
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,750
I think if I pay attention in class,...

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,208
a tutor won't be necessary.

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,458
But what if the teacher
doesn't teach well, like Miss Utai?

63
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,708
It's so boring.

64
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,250
Anyway, look at Toy!

65
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,125
He wears thick glasses like a nerd.

66
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,125
He's good at Mathematics
but he failed English.

67
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,666
I don't know. Anyway, I don't like him.

68
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:51,583
Mathematics is the only subject
where he's better than me.

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,125
Come on!

70
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,500
I'd like to announce the results
of the latest English exam.

71
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,083
The top score of this class goes to...

72
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,541
Narate!

73
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,416
Well...

74
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,416
Nack is so good at English.

75
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,625
You've got the highest score again.

76
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,541
I just want to be as good as you.

77
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,791
In my class,
there's one gay guy who I don't like.

78
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,750
It's not because he's gay.

79
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,291
It's because he's hypocritical.

80
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
-And he always tells a lie.
-Petch.

81
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,125
You know...

82
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,375
Nack is so cruel to me.

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,083
I just walked over to congratulate him

84
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,958
for his English score,

85
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,041
but he...

86
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,791
insulted me with bad words.

87
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,208
He said he's better than me.

88
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,750
Can you play nicely?

89
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,041
Please don't hurt me!

90
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,541
Kla, you're the most beautiful girl here.

91
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,541
Are you sure?

92
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,083
Nack! Nack! Let's play volleyball!

93
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,916
No, thanks. I don't play.

94
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,541
-Ouch!
-Nack!

95
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,708
Are you okay?

96
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,125
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

97
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,000
It's okay.

98
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,583
Hey!

99
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,416
Do you want some?

100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,166
No, I don't smoke.

101
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,041
If you don't smoke, you are a faggot.

102
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,083
Okay, then I am one.

103
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,208
Faggot!

104
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,083
Faggot!

105
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,541
I think Nack, my classmate,

106
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,541
is gay for sure but he tries to hide it.

107
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,583
-How pathetic!
-How pathetic!

108
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,541
Why does he have to hide? What for?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,375
But I think he's handsome.

110
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,250
-What?
-You traitor!

111
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,125
Get the ball!

112
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,666
-Ready?
-Come on.

113
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,083
Go! Move!

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,875
-There he comes.
-Oh, God. Move!

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,333
-Move!
-Go for it!

116
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,416
-Go! Go!
-That's it!

117
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:46,958
Am I weird?

118
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,166
I don't like to play volleyball
like Thai gay boys

119
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,708
and I don't play football
like straight boys either.

120
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,375
My gang doesn't like
to play volleyball and football too.

121
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,416
My gang's popular activity is...

122
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,583
Shit!

123
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,416
Hey. It's below.

124
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,916
Yes. Come on!

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey, Nack, why don't you use Line?

126
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,833
My mom doesn't pay for the internet fee.

127
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,666
She said internet is not necessary.

128
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,041
And there's no internet at my house,

129
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,041
but I don't care.

130
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,458
I want to say "Ni Xue Ouxiang."

131
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,125
-What does it mean?
-This is an idol.

132
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,416
-I see.
-Thank you.

133
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,583
Finally, do you have anything to say

134
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,833
-to your supporters?
-Yes.

135
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,958
My secret of getting good grades

136
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,750
is not limited to consulting
with teachers during class.

137
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,500
I also consult with teachers
at the teacher's lounge.

138
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,875
-Teacher Justin...
-Yeah?

139
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,708
-Yes.
-This one, what does it mean?

140
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,375
Narate, you're a quick learner. Superb!

141
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,875
Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,375
My life goes around in circles every day,

143
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,875
just like a goldfish in the fish bowl.

144
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,666
I always do the same things.

145
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,875
One day, during my senior year,

146
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:48,125
I felt inexplicably depressed and lonely.

147
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,791
Maybe because I just realized
that in less than a year,

148
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,166
I've got to leave this school.

149
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,375
NACK, DOOK, TOH

150
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,416
The place where I have studied
for 12 years.

151
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,875
I was just walking around
and pondering about many things

152
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,333
until I reached...

153
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,625
the school swimming pool.

154
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,666
There...

155
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,833
was where I witnessed a sex scene
for the first time.

156
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,500
It was the first time
I saw people having sex,...

157
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,833
and it was between two men.

158
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:36,125
Before this, when I hear the gay gang
chat about their sex experiences,

159
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,291
I thought it was disgusting.

160
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,625
But when I saw it,

161
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,416
why was I so excited?

162
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,708
Have you said a prayer?

163
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,458
Why must I warn you?

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,666
You don't come to church on Sundays.

165
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,250
That's why you've become negligent.

166
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,208
Dear God,

167
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,291
Jesus Christ.

168
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,708
Thank you, God.

169
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,416
For the food and beverage
that you give us.

170
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,875
Please take care of everything for us.

171
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,166
In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

172
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,208
Amen.

173
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,291
Why do many celebrities
commit suicide nowadays?

174
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,041
Suicide is a sin.

175
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,208
Especially for those Christians.

176
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,875
They won't be allowed to enter heaven.

177
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,833
My pen...

178
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,666
-Tell me if you like it.
-Right.

179
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,250
-Tell me if you like it.
-Come on!

180
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,458
Let me get your ass!

181
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,166
What the heck?

182
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,750
Watch out, man!

183
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,916
Sorry.

184
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,250
Sit here.

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,500
What are you laughing at?

186
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,166
What's so funny?

187
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,041
Petch!

188
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,416
How long have you been here?

189
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,083
I didn't notice you.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,416
I've been swimming for half an hour.

191
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,000
How could you see me?

192
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,541
I saw you walk straight
to the shower room.

193
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,000
And you're not swimming?

194
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,791
I can't swim.

195
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,458
What?

196
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,458
I'm looking for someone

197
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,125
but it seems he's not here.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,583
I haven't seen anyone in here yet.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,666
Do you want to learn how to swim?

200
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,041
I can teach you.

201
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,583
May I have your Line? We don't talk much
even though we're in the same class.

202
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,791
I don't use Line.

203
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,791
My phone isn't connected
to the internet.

204
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,291
How about I give you my phone number?

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
You can call me

206
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,791
or send me a message.

207
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,125
Okay.

208
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,375
Hey! Let me see your phone!

209
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,708
-It's mine.
-It's the famous brand!

210
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,750
Hey, what are you doing?

211
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,166
What the heck, you nerd!

212
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,333
Hey!

213
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,291
Do you want to mess with me?
It's only a mobile phone.

214
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,500
-It belongs to him!
-I want it!

215
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,916
I won't let you!

216
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,500
-Teacher.
-Teacher, this way.

217
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,708
-Teacher.
-He's here.

218
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,291
-He is running away!
-Teacher, come on!

219
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,750
Are you okay?

220
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,583
I'm okay.

221
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,916
Are you all right?

222
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,375
I am all right.

223
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,875
Good. Be careful next time you go home.

224
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,416
COME TO THE SWIMMING POOL TOMORROW.
I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO SWIM.

225
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,416
BRING YOUR SWIMSUIT, PETCH.

226
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,250
Nack, aren't you wearing glasses?

227
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah. I'm wearing contact lenses.
They are fine.

228
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,833
Hey!

229
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,708
You're late!

230
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,375
-Are you wearing contact lenses?
-Yeah.

231
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
How sparkling your eyes are.

232
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,750
Hey, Dook. Do you want a snack?

233
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,375
It's in your bag.

234
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,291
Give me, please.

235
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:26,791
Come on.

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,333
Shit!

237
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,000
What the heck?

238
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,166
What's so funny?

239
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,208
Hey, Toh.

240
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,666
Your dick is smaller than Dook's.

241
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,666
I got a small body,

242
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,458
but a big dick!

243
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,666
He can't argue with that.

244
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,833
That's for the small one.

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,833
Nack, what are you doing in the toilet?

246
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,666
I got to pee.

247
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,708
Why don't you pee at urinals like us?

248
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,625
-Why are you shy? We are all men here.
-Right.

249
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,958
I'm not shy.
I was in there hiding from Draft.

250
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,208
I always see you pee in the toilet,
never at urinals.

251
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,083
-What?
-Don't say anything.

252
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,750
How was it?

253
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,416
Oh, God! Do you have a lot of homework?

254
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,333
-No, I don't have any homework.
-Whom did you send the Line to?

255
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,166
-Teacher, hi!
-Hi!

256
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,458
-Go to your classroom.
-Hi!

257
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,083
Hi. Your socks are too short.

258
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,666
I'll WAIT AT THE SWIMMING POOL
WHEN YOU'RE DONE CLEANING.

259
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,291
FOLLOW ME, PETCH.

260
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,250
Hey, Nack!

261
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,291
Won't you go play video games with us?

262
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,416
No.

263
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,250
-Bye!
-Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,250
You look cute without glasses.

265
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,166
Really?

266
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,875
-I will let go of my hands.
-Hey!

267
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,208
-Just try.
-Hey! Don't!

268
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,041
Are you gay?

269
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,458
No, I'm not.

270
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,583
I've got a girlfriend.

271
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,166
She studies in the all-girls school
nearby.

272
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,333
But I haven't had sex with her yet.

273
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,833
When I see your slim body,

274
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,875
I get a strange feeling.

275
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,666
Maybe I just want to try.

276
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,000
You idiot!

277
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,375
Nack! I'm sorry! Nack!

278
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,625
No, I can't.

279
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,000
What?

280
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,000
How was it? Did you like it?

281
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,666
It was good. I got so excited.

282
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,125
You're good at it.

283
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,541
What are you looking for, Nack?

284
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,708
My math book.

285
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,041
Where did you put it?

286
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,666
I put it in the drawer but it disappeared.

287
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,000
Is it with you?

288
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,625
No. This is mine.

289
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,625
Hey!

290
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,291
This is my book.

291
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,458
What? This is mine!

292
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,666
Prove it if this is yours.

293
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,166
I wrote my name on the cover.

294
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,208
But its cover is torn.

295
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,708
So how do you know it's yours?

296
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,375
Although its cover is torn,
based on the library principle I studied,

297
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,458
I secretly wrote my name on page 55.

298
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,375
There it is.

299
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,875
So you're saying Pong stole it from you?

300
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,166
It's just a book. If you want it, go on!

301
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,708
Hey, what the heck?

302
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,208
Hey! Let go of me!

303
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,583
Hey! Stop!

304
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,500
Damn, Nack, you talk too much!

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,583
Today I'll teach you a lesson.

306
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,041
Toey. Where are my snacks?

307
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,500
-What snacks?
-I put it in your bag.

308
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,375
Hey! It's ridiculous.

309
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,750
-Just look in your bag.
-We are going to take a break.

310
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,791
Hey, Nack.

311
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,583
Are you okay?

312
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,916
What happened to your face?

313
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,250
I was too careless.

314
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,958
I fell and hit my head in the toilet.

315
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,416
Pretty badly.

316
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,208
How clumsy you are
to fall and hit your head there.

317
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,583
It's lunch time. Let's eat.

318
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,791
-Okay.
-You guys just go. I'm not hungry.

319
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,666
Why?

320
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,500
Let's go!

321
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,833
Nack.

322
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,250
Won't you come and play video games
with us?

323
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,416
Yeah. Go on. I can't go.

324
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,583
What's wrong with you?

325
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,625
Let's go.

326
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,125
Go!

327
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,416
I'LL BE HOME LATE.
HELP YOURSELF FOR DINNER.

328
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,250
Hurry up!
We'll be late for the English test.

329
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,041
Hi. Your shoes are against the rules.

330
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,583
-Yes.
-Hi.

331
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,416
-Teacher, hi!
-Hi!

332
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,375
Hi!

333
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,791
Nack, are you sure
you left your phone here?

334
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

335
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,416
Yesterday you seemed absent-minded
the whole day.

336
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,125
Hey, Toh,
have you seen Nack's mobile phone?

337
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,083
No, I haven't. Why would I have seen it?

338
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:03,458
-Just in case.
-How should I know?

339
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:07,333
Hey, you! What are you watching?

340
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,541
Have you seen Nack's mobile phone?
He lost it.

341
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,000
No, I haven't.

342
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,708
Toh, look at this.

343
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,208
What is it?

344
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,458
Dook played three times.
Toh played just once.

345
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,250
Just once and he died.

346
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,500
-Really?
-No.

347
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,708
Just once and he died.

348
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,083
Hey, look at that girl. She's so sexy.

349
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,000
-See?
-Yeah.

350
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,041
Damn you! She's looking at us.

351
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,166
Just stay still!

352
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,416
Were you waiting for a long time?

353
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,916
It was really enjoyable.
I went home pretty late.

354
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,666
Didn't let me go back home.

355
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,833
Damn Toh...

356
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,125
Why are you looking at your camera?

357
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,541
-Can't you play? I mean, football.
-I can't play it.

358
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,750
What the heck?

359
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,083
-He just takes photos every day.
-Right.

360
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,416
So what?

361
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,541
Do you want to play again today?

362
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,375
Sure. Yesterday we got even.

363
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,875
-Just got even.
-Is that right?

364
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:35,541
How about the previous match?

365
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,583
Hey, I found my phone!

366
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:39,375
Congratulations!

367
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,083
Congratulations!

368
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,875
Yesterday, we were searching
for a long time.

369
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,250
But yesterday
you already checked the drawer?

370
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,666
Yeah. How could it be here?

371
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,625
-You probably weren't looking carefully.
-Right.

372
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,916
I searched carefully.

373
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,458
-Now that you found it. Good.
-Right.

374
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,375
That's a relief.

375
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,375
My dear students,

376
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,666
I'd like you to tell me

377
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,000
which faculty you want to get in and why?

378
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,166
I'll give you some advice.

379
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,041
Yeah, Narate?

380
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,750
I wanna be in the Faculty of Arts

381
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,625
because I like to draw pictures.

382
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,541
Yes, that's true.

383
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,750
But your grades in other subjects
are good too.

384
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,208
I recommend you
to get in the Faculty of Architecture.

385
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,500
Why, Miss?

386
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,208
Architects have a much higher income
than painters.

387
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,958
You won't be wealthy
if you become a painter.

388
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:29,500
"Poor Painter." Have you heard that?

389
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:33,208
What about cartoonists?

390
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,833
They can't make ends meet.

391
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:40,083
What about the others? Which faculty?

392
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,125
I must prepare
for the entrance examination.

393
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,166
Studying in the class is not enough.

394

MODEL: HELLO, NACK

395

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,500

SO THAT WE CAN CHAT

397
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:09,375
NACK: WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

398
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:23,875
MODEL: I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU

399

MODEL: GOOD NIGHT

401
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,541
-How was the game yesterday?
-Were you kidding me last night?

402
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,250
No. What happened?

403
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,583
MODEL: HELLO!

404
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:59,208
NACK: WHO ARE YOU?
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME, I'LL BLOCK YOU

405
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:08,375
MODEL: WAIT! DON'T BLOCK ME
I PROMISE THAT ONE DAY, I'LL TELL YOU

406
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,291
I MEAN NO HARM. PLEASE.

407
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,583
Do you have any questions?

408
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,541
I want to be good at English.

409
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,375
Do you have any suggestions?

410
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,416
Sure.

411
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:44,291
The easy way is to watch
a lot of English language movies.

412
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Listen to the soundtrack.

413
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,416
Listen to English songs.

414
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,208
Especially those classic songs
with good meanings.

415
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,541
That would help a lot.

416
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:25,666
Look at you!

417
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,333
Nack, it's obvious that
you love Teacher Justin.

418
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,083
You seem to focus on his class.

419
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,750
I pay attention to every class.

420
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,041
What do you mean by that?

421
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Nack.

422
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,958
Why did Pong say that?

423
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,625
Why does he think that
you like Teacher Justin?

424
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,916
I don't like him that way,

425
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:53,041
although he is handsome.

426
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,041
-Hey!
-Anyway, I'm not gay.

427
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,041
NACK: HELL NO!
HE JUST TAUGHT ME HOW TO SWIM

428
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,708
MODEL: THEN LET ME TEACH YOU
HOW TO SWIM

429
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:03,791
NACK: SO I'M GOING TO SEE YOUR FACE

430
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:15,625
MODEL: YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE MY FACE?

431
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
NACK: SURE

432
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:30,250
MODEL: IF YOU SEE MY FACE,
WILL YOU STILL TALK TO ME?

433
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,958
Toy!

434
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:42,791
It's me!

435
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,541
So funny!

436
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,666
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,750
Wait a minute!

438
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,125
Nack.

439
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,125
Don't you want to talk to me?

440
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,833
Hey! Model.

441
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,333
It's a nice necklace.
Did your girlfriend buy it for you?

442
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,750
No. I don't have a girlfriend.

443
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,083
And this dolphin pendant,

444
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,041
I bought it myself.

445
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:07,000
What about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

446
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:08,791
Not yet.

447
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,416
Toy.

448
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:14,750
May I ask you something?

449
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,166
What?

450
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:20,666
Do you think I look gay?

451
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,291
I don't think so.

452
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,958
I think you're a nerd.

453
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,208
Sweet boy.

454
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're like a sweet boy.

455
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:35,291
What do you mean?

456
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,708
Well...

457
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:41,333
Isn't the English for sweet man
"sweet boy"?

458
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,625
It's too literal.

459
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,708
I don't care. I'll just call you that.

460
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,041
I'll call you "sweet boy."

461
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:54,375
Don't! Your English sucks,
so why use English words?

462
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,916
Does my English suck?

463
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,750
You are my sweet boy.

464
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,541
-When is your birthday, Toy?
-What?

465
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,416
It's on November 7th. What about you?

466
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,583
The same month but mine is on the 11th.

467
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,625
But...

468
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,791
I'm one year older than you.

469
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,458
That makes me your older brother.

470
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,708
Who wants that?

471
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,125
-What? Am I not good enough?
-I give up.

472
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,916
-Are you ticklish?
-No.

473
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,541
Hey! Hey!

474
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,333
MODEL: LET'S SWIM AGAIN TOMORROW

475
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,333
-Toy.
-What?

476
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:26,333
I've got something for you.

477
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,833
What is it?

478
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,791
Happy birthday.

479
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,166
What's this?

480
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,541
For your dolphin to be a couple.

481
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,375
Thanks a lot, Nack.

482
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,666
I've got something for you too.

483
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:58,791
What is it?

484
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,583
Wait a minute.

485
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:15,291
I know you're Christian...

486
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,250
so I bought this for you.

487
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,791
Actually...

488
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,416
Christians don't worship pendants,
even if it's a crucifix.

489
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:28,583
But I can wear it as an accessory.

490
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,791
So, are you going to wear it?

491
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,708
Really?

492
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,458
Let me do it.

493
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,125
Thank you.

494
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,083
You're welcome.

495
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,458
-Toy!
-What?

496
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,916
Why did you have to hide

497
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,208
and talk to me through Line?

498
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,541
At that time...

499
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,083
I was too afraid to talk to you.

500
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,916
We're not in the same gang.

501
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:40,000
We don't talk much.

502
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,375
So why do you want to talk to me now?

503
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,250
Let me see your phone!

504
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,208
-It's mine!
-Hey! What are you doing?

505
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,708
What the heck, you nerd?

506
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,083
Toy, there was a guy
who tried to snatch my mobile,

507
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,750
but someone helped me.

508
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,458
Hey!

509
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:11,166
Why don't you answer?

510
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:12,916
And why are you smiling?

511
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,083
I won't tell you.

512
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,208
You won't?

513
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,250
Take this!

514
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,458
-Let's take a selfie.
-Okay.

515
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:44,875
That's cool.

516
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,708
What? A big guy eating so little.

517
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,375
Look at me. I'm small but I eat a lot.

518
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,583
Hey. When did you guys get so familiar?

519
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:01,625
Toh took Toy into our group for a moment.

520
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,666
He asked Toy to teach him math.

521
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,041
To be taught...

522
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:08,166
or to copy Toy's homework?

523
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,541
Yeah.

524
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:12,583
To copy.

525
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:16,708
Before this, when you were sad,

526
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,083
you didn't go with our gang after school,

527
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,958
so you didn't catch up.

528
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:26,250
Do you guys want something to drink?
I'll go buy.

529
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,166
Milk tea with bubble pearl for me!

530
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,750
Me too!

531
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,125
Longan juice, please.

532
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,416
-Please, don't.
-Longan or not?

533
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,875
-Longan juice.
-Just water for me.

534
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,125
Hey, Nack.

535
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:51,166
Nack, do you know
who helped you from Draft? It's Toy.

536
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,625
Hey, Draft. What are you doing?

537
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:59,958
I'm teaching damn Nack a lesson.

538
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,333
He told the teachers that I smoke.

539
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:04,000
It's not me!

540
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,500
Then, what is this clip?

541
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,916
That clip is when I went
to ask about the study.

542
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,000
I think...

543
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,583
Nack is not a liar.

544
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,541
Who told you that?

545
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,083
And who gave you that video clip?

546
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:22,750
Let's go.

547
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,416
Hey, here they are.

548
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,916
It's yours, Nack.

549
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:43,125
Hey.

550
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,583
Thank you.

551
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,541
Wow, longan juice. Different from others.

552
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,125
Is it good?

553
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:01,041
What? Something wrong with you two?

554
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,916
It's quite weird.

555
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,708
-Why?
-It's not your business.

556
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,041
Shit! Do you want to play?

557
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,083
Why? Why?

558
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,250
Shit!

559
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,958
-There are a lot of them.
-Right.

560
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,208
Ready?

561
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,166
Why?

562
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:24,458
Oh, crap.

563
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:27,208
I'm sorry, teacher.

564
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,750
-Damn.
-What?

565
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,166
I'll take the bubble pearl out for you.

566
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:41,791
Give it back to me!

567
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,750
Your face looks so pale!

568
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,250
The bubble pearl is...

569
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,541
stuck.

570
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,875
-Lay down.
-Lay down.

571
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,500
I'll record the clip.

572
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,000
-Is it out?
-Yes.

573
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:12,125
Yes, it's out.

574
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:13,916
That is karma.

575
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,583
You played me first.

576
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,125
Hey, look at this clip.

577
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:21,375
I'll upload it to my Instagram.
It's so funny.

578
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,333
Damn you! Don't!

579
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,458
Hey, guys.

580
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,000
Let's go out somewhere and have fun
before the final exam.

581
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,333
I can't go.

582
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:34,458
I have to study for the entrance exam.

583
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:37,083
Moreover, my mom won't let me
stay overnight outside.

584
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:40,416
We don't have to stay overnight.
Just a one-day trip.

585
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,416
Okay. Where?

586
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,541
How about Siam Park City?

587
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,583
There are both exciting rides
and swimming park.

588
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,416
That's great. I'll go.

589
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,083
Say cheese!

590
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:54,458
Hey, guys, I'm here.

591
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,958
Guys, this is Act, my brother.

592
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,583
He wanted to relax from studying,

593
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,041
-so I took him here.
-Hello, guys.

594
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,958
Hurry up!

595
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,625
Let's ride the merry-go-round.

596
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,458
Oh, no.

597
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,916
Let's ride the merry-go-round.

598
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,166
That's too childish.

599
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,166
-No. Let's play.
-Why not Roller Coaster?

600
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,541
-Why not Roller Coaster or Viking?
-No, I don't like them.

601
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,041
Let's ride the merry-go-round.

602
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,208
-Let's go!
-Go!

603
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,208
Hey, let me take a break here.

604
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,291
Viking is next, okay?

605
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,000
Okay.

606
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:06,583
Sure.

607
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,208
Hey, Nack. Why don't you take the rides?

608
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,500
I'm nervous,

609
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,916
and I'm very afraid of heights.

610
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:16,083
All I can take is merry-go-round.

611
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:18,375
You chicken.

612
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,166
You guys, go on. Don't worry about me.

613
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:25,250
Okay. Take care of my belongings.

614
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,208
Okay then.

615
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:29,208
This too. Take care of them all.

616
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,583
-Don't lose them.
-Put them there.

617
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,250
-Let's go.
-You sure you don't want to?

618
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,416
No. You go.

619
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:41,000
Nack, why are you sitting alone?

620
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,208
I'm too afraid to go with them.

621
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,333
They want to ride the Viking.

622
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,250
I see. I'll sit with you then.

623
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,583
Be my guest.

624
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,166
Make room for me.

625
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:58,583
Why can't you ride the Viking?

626
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,666
It's too high and exciting.

627
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,833
Hey, Nack.

628
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,041
Hey, what are you doing?

629
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,541
-Hey.
-Where will you drag me to?

630
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:08,208
To the ride.

631
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,833
I'm with you. You don't have to be afraid.

632
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,916
No. I'm afraid of heights. I can't.

633
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:16,541
What?

634
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,041
Come. Don't be afraid.

635
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,291
-Ride with me.
-No.

636
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,958
-Come on.
-No way.

637
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:25,833
It's not that high.

638
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,000
Nack.

639
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,708
-Why don't you go swim?
-Yes, Act.

640
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,500
I'm tired.
I just want to take a break now.

641
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,541
But it's fun.

642
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,750
-But not now.
-No?

643
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,166
So why don't you go swim?

644
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,833
I'm bored. I'll go swim later.

645
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:31,708
Nack.

646
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:33,958
Let's swim.

647
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:36,166
-Where?
-To swim. There.

648
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,333
Hey, guys.

649
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:17,000
Let's take a photo.

650
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:19,333
-Come here.
-Take a photo.

651
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,125
-Come closer.
-For what?

652
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,833
-For what?
-For my Instagram.

653
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,833
One, two, three.

654
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,583
Hey, Nack. I got to go now.

655
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,833
-I'll wait outside.
-Okay.

656
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,333
-Follow me.
-Yes.

657
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:43,750
By the way, before this,

658
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,416
why did I dislike Toy?

659
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:50,541
Maybe I was just jealous of him
because he's better at Mathematics?

660
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:53,416
How selfish I am.

661
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:58,250
If one person can do everything,
we don't have to live in a community.

662
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,000
And now without any prejudice,

663
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,291
I think,

664
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,416
I love Toy.

665
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,541
But in two months,

666
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,375
we will graduate high school.

667
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:15,625
I feel happy, but at the same time, sad.

668
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,833
Today, it's so much fun.

669
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:22,666
But...

670
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,666
after graduation,

671
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:27,333
we may not see each other again.

672
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:29,125
Hey, you idiot.

673
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:31,291
You talk like you're dying.

674
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,416
Although we're in different universities,

675
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,541
we can still meet, you know.

676
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:40,583
By the way, Nack...

677
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,708
may I go to stay at your house tonight?

678
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:49,500
Sure, but why?

679
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:54,333
I need you to teach me Arts and English.

680
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:57,041
And I'll teach you Mathematics.

681
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,583
I think you're not good at it.

682
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,791
And tomorrow is Sunday.

683
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:03,750
We can sleep late.

684
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:08,875
Hey.

685
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,583
Your room is so cute.

686
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,958
There are a lot of puppies.

687
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,500
If we take the red color...

688
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,666
and blue color,

689
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,750
then mix them together,

690
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,416
we will get purple.

691
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:28,833
Watch this.

692
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,041
I've got to mix it.

693
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,208
Here.

694
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:41,833
How was it?

695
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:49,083
But the most beautiful purple is this one.

696
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:52,208
But this purple,

697
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,333
you can't mix it,

698
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,291
you have to buy it.

699
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,916
Let's see.

700
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,791
Purple is my most favorite color.

701
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:25,208
Why do you like purple?

702
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,458
Well...

703
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,416
I don't know.

704
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,125
There's no reason.

705
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,416
But...

706
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,708
if I have to find one reason,

707
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:41,333
maybe because I find it beautiful.

708
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:46,000
Especially this special purple,

709
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:47,500
it's so beautiful.

710
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:53,000
I think you like it because you are gay.

711
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,250
Hey, no.

712
00:55:56,416 --> 00:56:00,791
But maybe because
the purple is the middle tone.

713
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,125
Not female, not male.

714
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:05,333
People think it's the color of gay.

715
00:56:08,916 --> 00:56:10,833
Maybe.

716
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:12,833
-There.
-Hey!

717
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,125
-Do you want to play?
-Got you.

718
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,916
Do you want some?

719
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,000
Hey, come on.

720
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:25,791
Hey.

721
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,166
That's enough. We're already dirty.

722
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,208
I'll go take a bath now.

723
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:52,333
Hey, Nack.

724
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:57,291
Help me hold my legs. I'll do sit-ups.

725
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,041
Sure.

726
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:19,416
Hey.

727
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,458
Grab firmly.

728
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,208
-Press my knees.
-Okay.

729
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,083
It's enough.

730
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,500
I think I should go take a bath now.

731
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:54,875
Here are the T-shirt and pants.

732
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,000
-Here is the towel.
-Okay.

733
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,625
Hey, Toy.

734
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,541
Why are you topless?

735
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,041
Your T-shirt is too small.

736
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:31,708
I can't wear it.

737
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,291
But it's okay.

738
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:38,375
When I'm at home,
I usually sleep without T-shirt.

739
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:48,458
Hey.

740
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:49,708
Nack.

741
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:53,125
You sleep on your bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

742
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:56,583
It's all right. Today, you are my guest.

743
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:58,708
You sleep on my bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

744
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:01,958
Then...

745
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,083
both of us can be on the bed.

746
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,708
It would be uncomfortable for you.

747
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,416
I am all right with it, if you're okay.

748
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,291
Okay.

749
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Nack.

750
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,250
What song are you listening to?

751
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:58,791
Just listen.

752
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,416
It's very late at night.
Why hasn't your mom come home?

753
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Well...

754
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:38,083
She always comes home late.
I'm used to it.

755
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:47,833
So don't you feel lonely,
to be home alone?

756
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,166
Yes, I do.

757
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,083
But...

758
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:03,291
I read comics,
and watch movies and dramas.

759
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:09,791
When I was a child,
and the first time I felt lonely...

760
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,333
I didn't even know what it is.

761
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,291
Someone...

762
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,958
may be able to describe them in words.

763
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:26,916
But...

764
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,041
I feel it more.

765
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,791
Every time,

766
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,625
when the credits come...

767
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,708
I feel desolated.

768
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,083
I feel like...

769
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,000
my body is stiff, especially my head.

770
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:52,833
I feel like...

771
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,250
my nose smells something so acrid...

772
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:00,958
that I want to cry.

773
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:09,375
Nack.

774
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:13,250
From now on...

775
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,083
if you feel lonely...

776
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:20,000
think of me.

777
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:22,916
Or...

778
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,541
you can call me.

779
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,458
Well...

780
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:37,208
you also have Dook, Toh, and Toey.

781
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,458
Toy...

782
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,625
could you do me a favor?

783
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,416
-What?
-Well...

784
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:56,375
can we sleep with the lights on?

785
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:01,166
I'm very scared of ghosts.

786
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,166
I can't sleep in the dark,

787
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,416
so I sleep with the lights on every night.

788
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,000
Are you serious?

789
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:17,208
That's why, at the pool,

790
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:20,125
when I wore a ghost mask to tease you,

791
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,458
it scared the shit out of you.

792
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:27,625
But...

793
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:31,750
with the lights on, I cannot sleep.

794
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,500
The lights get into my eyes.

795
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:42,791
Okay.

796
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:48,000
Just the lantern there, okay?

797
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,041
Okay.

798
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,541
You can hug me...

799
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,833
if it will make you feel
you're not lonely.

800
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,333
You can hug me...

801
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:07,375
if you think of me as a friend.

802
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,708
Take care. Bye-bye.

803
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,750
Hello, Toy.

804
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,666
Are you at home?

805
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,250
Yeah.

806
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:08,750
Is it raining there?

807
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:12,625
Just a little.

808
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,041
If it stops, let's see a movie.

809
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:22,458
Today, I can't.

810
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:24,500
I've got to go with my family.

811
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:29,958
What's wrong with you?

812
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:34,708
I don't know.

813
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,958
I just feel like, I miss you.

814
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:39,750
Hey.

815
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:43,500
It's only yesterday when we were together
the whole day, the whole night.

816
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:48,125
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm feeling right now.

817
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:52,375
Sorry. Bye.

818
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:23,875
Mom.

819
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,583
Why are you home early today?

820
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:38,791
Nack.

821
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,416
Why did you sleep with a guy last night?

822
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,041
Well...

823
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,791
His name is Toy, my classmate.

824
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:50,625
We studied together last night
until it was late.

825
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,375
So...

826
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,916
did you have sex?

827
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,583
Mom!

828
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,583
Why are you asking me that?

829
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:03,791
We didn't have sex.

830
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,458
We are Christians.

831
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:21,541
God made a man

832
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:23,250
to mate with a woman.

833
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:28,833
God does not like gays.

834
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,083
Neither do I.

835
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:37,416
Although they are good people?

836
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:40,875
But you?

837
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,583
You only care about your work,
not your child.

838
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,250
And God wouldn't blame you at all?

839
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,625
How dare you blame me!

840
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:54,625
Did you know

841
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:56,875
that since your Dad died,

842
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:00,708
I've been working so hard,
and it's tiring me?

843
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,000
And you do this to me?

844
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,000
Tell me.

845
01:14:07,083 --> 01:14:09,208
Are you a lady boy or a gay?

846
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:11,000
Answer me.

847
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:13,916
Answer me!

848
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:15,458
Answer me!

849
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:17,500
Answer me!

850
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,291
Answer me!

851
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:52,750
I miss you, Dad.

852
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:02,375
Dad never hit me.

853
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:45,958
Toy.

854
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,166
Nack.

855
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,125
What's wrong?

856
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:15,916
Where should I further my study?

857
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,583
What would you like to eat?
Chicken rice...

858
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:24,958
I want to eat some chicken rice.

859
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,416
We will eat some cookies here.

860
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,750
-I prefer some chicken rice.
-We'll eat chicken rice first.

861
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,791
Nack, would you like some?

862
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:36,333
-It still tastes good.
-Which flavor of cookies should we have?

863
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,708
-Is it your aunt's chicken rice?
-It must be delicious.

864
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,291
It's really chicken rice.

865
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:43,125
Are there a lot of them?

866
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,125
-Do you mean some soup?
-Yes.

867
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:51,083
Do you want to eat?

868
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,333
Hey, why did you do this to me?

869
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:00,000
Go away, faggot!

870
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,125
Let's go.

871
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,500
Damn you, Petch!

872
01:18:52,666 --> 01:18:55,083
Hello, is this Toy?

873
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,000
Yes.

874
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,666
It's Nack's mom.

875
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:05,250
I have something to tell you.

876
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,458
I feel that, recently,
Nack has been obsessed with you.

877
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,875
He always calls you.

878
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:18,875
But I think he's not a lady boy or a gay.

879
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,916
He just feels lonely.

880
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:28,291
And I don't think you are either.

881
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,958
No, I'm not.

882
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Good.

883
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,916
Now, the entrance examination is coming.

884
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,166
May I ask you to stay away from Nack?

885
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:51,916
Yes.

886
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,333
Thank you.

887
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,375
I won't take your time anymore.

888
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,250
Goodbye then.

889
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,916
GAT ENGLISH

890
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:53,291
GAT VOCABULARY

891
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,000
Toy.

892
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,041
Thank you for the answer paper
for Mathematics.

893
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:31,333
Why did you have to give Pong
the answer paper for Mathematics?

894
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:34,208
And let him kiss you?

895
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,583
Pong is my friend just like you.

896
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,833
But you know I don't like him.

897
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:44,750
You know what he did to me.

898
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:46,750
You hate Pong,...

899
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,583
so I must, too?

900
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:51,625
Listen to me, Nack.

901
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,291
Each person can't be 100 percent
good or evil.

902
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:59,125
Just like Pong and my friends
at the back of the class.

903
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,166
They might not pay attention to class,

904
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,125
but they are still my friends.

905
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:06,375
If I were you, I would be
on the same side with the one I--

906
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:07,458
Nack,

907
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:09,958
don't force anyone to like you.

908
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:11,708
When you are so nice to me,...

909
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:14,750
and spend some good time together,

910
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,000
those don't mean anything to you?

911
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,166
I act the same to everyone.

912
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:23,416
So...

913
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:28,875
it's all in my head.

914
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:30,708
What do you think it is?

915
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,583
I'm not...

916
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,500
I think of you as a friend.

917
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:46,458
You said I can hug you.

918
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:49,750
You said I can call you

919
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:51,791
when I feel lonely.

920
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,916
Only if you think of me as a friend.

921
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:56,666
Toy.

922
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:01,166
When two people talk to each other
more and more, and they hug,

923
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,208
who the heck will be able to resist?

924
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:05,416
Then you should not have agreed

925
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,541
that you would not think of me
more than a friend.

926
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:10,125
If I said I couldn't,

927
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:12,750
would you allow me to talk to you?

928
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,416
Or would you let me hug you?

929
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:16,666
Just think...

930
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:19,083
how contradicting it is...

931
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,083
when a couple talk more and hug,

932
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:24,958
but forbidden to feel love.

933
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:28,416
Do you know how much I suffer?

934
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,750
To lie and conceal this feeling.

935
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:46,000
Damn, Toh, you've got the power.

936
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,041
Hey, Nack. Nack.

937
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,208
-Hey.
-Hey.

938
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,875
-What's up with you?
-Are you okay?

939
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:55,208
Do you hear us?

940
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:57,958
Hey, Nack. What's wrong?

941
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,375
Relax.

942
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:07,041
I'm very worried about many things.

943
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,833
I didn't pass
the direct entrance examination.

944
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,750
My GAT/PAT scores are not good.

945
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:19,750
Hey, it's okay. Don't be serious.

946
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,000
If you can't get
into a government university,

947
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,875
you can join us in a private one.

948
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:25,458
Yeah.

949
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:28,708
I don't want to study
in a private university.

950
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:32,041
What's wrong with a private university?

951
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,666
I think it's not about the study.

952
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,500
-Right.
-It's about Toy.

953
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:44,500
Yeah, I think, recently,
you're obsessed with Toy too much.

954
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:52,041
You don't understand me.

955
01:27:46,958 --> 01:27:48,041
Toy.

956
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,291
I'm sorry...

957
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:57,791
for what I did this evening.

958
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,625
I know...

959
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,875
I should not have called.

960
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:10,125
But I can't help it.

961
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,333
I'm glad...

962
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,791
you answered my call.

963
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:26,250
Nack, you should focus
on your entrance examination.

964
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:31,000
I can't concentrate on reading...

965
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:36,125
because I can't get you out of my head.

966
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,458
Enough!

967
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:39,375
If you cannot

968
01:28:39,458 --> 01:28:41,541
think of me as a friend,...

969
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,166
I won't talk to you anymore.

970
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,333
And don't call me again.

971
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,166
Nack, are you home?

972
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:53,708
Are you here? Answer me.

973
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,416
If you're home, open the door.

974
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,333
Nack!

975
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:03,833
You try to open the door.

976
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:08,833
Go inside.

977
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,791
Nack, what are you doing?

978
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,000
What are you doing?

979
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:24,291
-Hey.
-Relax.

980
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,500
-Take it easy.
-Damn.

981
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:28,958
We heard about you from Toy.

982
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:31,708
Don't think too much.

983
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:34,041
We're still friends.

984
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:39,541
No matter what you are,
you're still our friend.

985
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:43,583
Toy still loves you as a friend.

986
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:46,625
He only needs you to prepare
for the entrance exam first.

987
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,083
He has to stay away from you for a while.

988
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:51,208
I know.

989
01:30:52,583 --> 01:30:53,666
But I can't take it.

990
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,625
You must try.

991
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,833
Nack, what are you thinking?

992
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:02,625
If you had done it,
if you had really died...

993
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:03,750
Think...

994
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,666
You will not see Toy, us,

995
01:31:08,291 --> 01:31:09,791
or your mom again.

996
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:19,041
I got it from a song.

997
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,750
You have to love yourself more, Nack.

998
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:28,875
I copy it from somewhere, too.

999
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:32,000
Nack.

1000
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:37,541
Someday, you will feel nothing
about what happened in the past.

1001
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,083
I'm sorry...

1002
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:44,458
that I was angry and I shouted at you
that day.

1003
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,500
It's okay.

1004
01:31:48,916 --> 01:31:50,708
I'm not mad at you.

1005
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:54,833
Nack, whatever happens, you must fight.

1006
01:31:56,250 --> 01:32:00,791
Did you remember the handicapped beggar
that we met?

1007
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:03,583
You felt so sorry for them
that you almost cried.

1008
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:04,916
But they still live and fight.

1009
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:09,583
You are lucky that you were born normal.

1010
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:11,375
You must fight.

1011
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:17,708
No one can really make you feel better
or move on

1012
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,375
except yourself.

1013
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:21,208
Chin up!

1014
01:32:23,708 --> 01:32:25,208
Thank you, guys, really.

1015
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:29,125
Stay with us.

1016
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:33,000
Where are you going? Are you nuts?

1017
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,958
Why does time go slowly...

1018
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,250
when you're sad?

1019
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,583
But when you are happy,...

1020
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:14,416
time flies so fast.

1021
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:40,583
THREE MONTHS LATER

1022
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:50,208
Nack, take a break and have some fruits.

1023
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:08,791
Mom.

1024
01:35:10,875 --> 01:35:12,125
I'm sorry.

1025
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:17,958
I didn't pass the entrance examination.

1026
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:23,875
It's okay. It's all right.

1027
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:25,708
Let's try again.

1028
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,083
Let's try again next year.

1029
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:32,791
I'll have you go to a tutor school
for one year.

1030
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,583
ONE YEAR LATER

1031
01:36:09,083 --> 01:36:11,041
Nack. Nack.

1032
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:13,250
You passed the entrance examination.

1033
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:15,958
I checked it from the Internet.

1034
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:17,708
-Yeah?
-Here.

1035
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,000
That's right, Mom.

1036
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,833
Yeah!

1037
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:27,791
Good job, my boy.

1038
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:33,208
-You did it great.
-Thanks, Mom.

1039
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:50,333
Hey, Nack.

1040
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:58,833
I just heard that you've entered here.

1041
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:00,625
I would have called you.

1042
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:08,083
This is Kay, my girlfriend.

1043
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:09,791
Kay, this is Nack.

1044
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:11,291
-My old school classmate.
-Hi.

1045
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:12,541
Hi.

1046
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:15,125
Take your time, Toy.
I'll go to volleyball practice.

1047
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:17,291
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1048
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,750
See you.

1049
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:23,416
Hey.

1050
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:26,750
How are you, freshy?

1051
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:32,083
Long time no see. You are more handsome.

1052
01:37:35,208 --> 01:37:38,416
How is your Mom? Is she fine?

1053
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,041
Will you be available tomorrow?

1054
01:37:43,541 --> 01:37:46,500
I will give you a sightseeing tour
by bicycle.

1055
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:50,708
Why do I feel less depressed?

1056
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:53,375
That's why they say,

1057
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,916
"Time heals everything."

1058
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,708
I've got to go home now. See you tomorrow.

1059
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,083
Okay.

1060
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,958
Nack, if you're afraid to fall,

1061
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,791
you can hold onto me.

1062
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:34,291
In your life,

1063
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,458
no matter how bad things happen,

1064
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:39,083
we must fight and carry on.

1065
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:42,166
Life goes on.

1066
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:33,708
