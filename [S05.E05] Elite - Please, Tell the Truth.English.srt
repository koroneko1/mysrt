1
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,960
I'M AT THE CLUB.

2
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,000
Rebe's at the club.

3
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,280
Perfect. The fewer people around,
the more credible.

4
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,640
Look, dude.

5
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,960
If Benjamín said
the police were going after him,

6
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:48,920
let them do it.

7
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,920
-We just need to keep our mouths shut.
-Benjamín didn't kill him.

8
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,759
Well, it's either him or Guzmán.
You want them to get Guzmán?

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,920
Obviously not.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,759
It's your call.

11
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,120
I mean, we could always
pin it on Phillipe.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,439
He'll pay two for one.

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,920
First rape, and now murder.

14
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,840
-He always gets away with it.
-Enough, dude.

15
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,079
Samuel, who will it be?

16
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,319
POLICE LINE, DO NOT CROSS

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
This never happened.

18
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,319
-Can we just talk about it?
-No.

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
It's just that

20
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,840
the truth is, I…

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,080
Iván, you're never gonna come near me
ever again.

22
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,560
Okay?

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,439
Hey. What you doin'?

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,639
Tell the lieutenant I'm taking
all them to the club to send them home.

25
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,240
CHARITY AUCTION

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,199
Okay. Now
we each go our separate ways.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,479
-Go with the others, please.
-Yeah, sure.

28
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,159
Are you okay?

29
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,719
What's the matter? Why are you soaked?

30
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
All of you are free to go home now.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
Are you okay?

32
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,800
Yeah, Dad. I'm fine.

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,439
What if he did it?

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Murderer? Our father?

35
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,639
Well, look. Armando nearly killed Ari.
And after everything that he did to me--

36
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,039
Mencía, what's the matter?

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,039
Are you just tired of
getting along with Dad?

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
-Is that it?
-No.

39
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,439
I mean, we're a family.

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,240
If we don't support each other, who will?

41
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,400
Well, we also shouldn't betray each other,
but here we are.

42
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,039
What are you inferring?

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,560
Chill out.
I also don't think Dad's capable.

44
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
As for the rest, don't worry.
We're still the same shitty family.

45
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,439
What's his deal? What's wrong?

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,960
Ari.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Can we talk?

48
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,080
I mean, um… Mm, no.

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,720
Hey.

50
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,480
Hey.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,920
What's up, man?

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,759
-Can I have a seat?
-Yeah, sure.

53
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,160
-Sit down.
-You sure?

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Iván, if you want to talk
about anything, you know I'm always here.

55
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,279
As your friend.

56
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,399
I'm so stupid, crying.

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,759
All good. Cry it out.

58
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,279
I never meant to hurt you.

59
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,079
I want you to know that.

60
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,680
Save that for later, okay?

61
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,279
Now, tell me what's the matter. Go on.

62
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,879
It's Ari, right?

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Let's go. Come on.
We'll lay on the lawn for a while, okay?

64
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,319
I'm sick of
leaving people I care about behind

65
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,480
every time my father changes teams.

66
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,279
Ari and you mean a lot.
I've lost you without goin' anywhere.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,720
Except I'm right here, so chill out.

68
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,800
Seriously, why should I even bother
finding someone,

69
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,720
when maybe next week,
I'll end up in… Dubai

70
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
or… or who knows where, man?

71
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,160
Right.

72
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
I have the opposite problem.

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,879
My entire life,
I've been fiercely searching for

74
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,560
anything that's worth my while.

75
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,240
And nothing.

76
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,160
But at least along the way,
you got to fuck all those dudes, right?

77
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,879
But really, I don't get it.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
Well, because we're all out of sync.

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
We're looking in different directions.

80
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,639
Take us, for example.

81
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,959
I'm crazy about you.

82
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,639
You're into my sister,
who has a boyfriend.

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,199
And Ari, I mean…
Ari looks many places at once.

84
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,279
What are you lookin' for?

85
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,720
In a guy?

86
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,279
Loves me like I deserve.
Someone who loves me the way I'd love him.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,720
I wanna feel like his priority
and have him feel he's mine.

88
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,480
I'd give him my all.

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
And you… in a girl?

90
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,920
What you and I have here.

91
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,399
Connection.

92
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,279
We could talk about anything… or be quiet.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,519
Serenity.

94
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,959
Intimacy.

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
How about we skip class?

96
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,879
A little quality time together?

97
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,800
All right.

98
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,160
Come on.

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Could you be a little more discreet?

100
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,720
Just a little.

101
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
Mm, sure.

102
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,800
You don't have a life,
so you look through ours in the trash.

103
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,199
Know why I do drugs? I can.

104
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,399
And 'cause it makes me
sharper and stronger.

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,759
Does Phillipe know about it?

106
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,360
Wanna ask him yourself?

107
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,399
Do you really wanna know
what his answer is?

108
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,360
No, I just don't want you
dragging him with you.

109
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,279
Aw, how cute.

110
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't you worry, baby. He's happy with me.

111
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,600
Very happy.

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,559
And you know why?

113
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,519
Because I offer him
only the best version of myself.

114
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
No cap.

115
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,879
We found a cell phone in the lake.

116
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Near the spot where the body showed up.

117
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,120
We think the phone belonged
to Armando de La Ossa.

118
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,440
We started recovering
some data, phone calls, messages.

119
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,120
And I have to ask you for your cell phone.

120
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,200
Mine? But why?

121
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,200
To compare the data in your phone
with that of Armando de La Ossa's.

122
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,440
Why do you have it in for me, Lieutenant?

123
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,320
We're just cross-checking data.

124
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,759
Yours, the school's, the data from
the association De La Ossa presided over.

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,799
I've done nothing.

126
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,879
Then you should be
the first one interested in collaborating.

127
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,759
Sure.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
Thank you.

129
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Do you have any other phones?
A work phone, for instance?

130
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,440
No, it's the only one.

131
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
Um, Dad?

132
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,120
Ari, it's all right. Don't worry.

133
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,759
Could I speak to her outside for a second?

134
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,799
Sure. Go ahead.

135
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,600
What's happening, Dad?

136
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,679
Nothing. It's nothing.
I have nothing to hide.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,879
Just relax. Trust me.
They can search what they want.

138
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,919
Come to my office
with Samuel after your classes.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,360
With Samuel? Why?

140
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
Just do as I say.

141
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,080
Come on. Go to class.

142
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
Mencía, no. Not you.

143
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,720
Why me?

144
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,000
If you want, I can stay. I don't mind
skipping classes or anything like that.

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,360
No, it's just
that I have to tell her something.

146
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,919
What have I done now?

147
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,000
Support me.

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,639
I don't know. You got the wrong daughter.
Right, Benjamín?

149
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,559
No. Ari always supports me, but

150
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm just gonna need a favor
that… that she can't do for me.

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,879
I lied to the lieutenant.

152
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
I told him I only had one phone.

153
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,799
I have another
in the right-hand pocket of my jacket.

154
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,039
Take it and hide it really well.

155
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
You know I didn't do it, right?

156
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,879
Who would ever want
to put a murder suspect

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,519
in charge of a holding company?

158
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,279
Or in this office,
to supervise their children's education?

159
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,399
There are a lot of ways to condemn a man.

160
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,799
Not just jail.

161
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,279
Samuel, you once said that…

162
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,559
…that Armando wasn't coming back,
with surprising confidence.

163
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
Did you know he couldn't come back?

164
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,960
I wanted you to feel better.

165
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,519
I hated seeing Ari afraid.

166
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
Armando died on New Year's Eve.

167
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,720
Why did Guzmán leave a few days later?

168
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,879
-Come on.
-No, no.

169
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm not criticizing him. I admire him.

170
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,399
But I think
that covering up for the culprit

171
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,399
has gone from a heroic gesture

172
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,759
to becoming something unjust.

173
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,480
Samuel, was it Guzmán?

174
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,200
Don't know anything.

175
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,039
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,720
I have to go to work.

177
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
No, I'm serious.
How do people do it?

178
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,840
I mean, how do you manage
to meet guys who are worth a damn?

179
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,759
-I'm clueless.
-Easy.

180
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,159
I go to bars in hotels,
gyms for rich guys,

181
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
and practice extreme sports.

182
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
You serious?

183
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,039
Sweetie.
Tinder, like the rest of the world.

184
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,399
-Oh.
-As a therapist, that's your homework.

185
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,080
Yeah, so, you're not my therapist.

186
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,360
All right. Well, as a friend.

187
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,039
As a friend, I'm telling you,

188
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,279
"Move on, Cayetana.
Evolve. I don't know. Try things."

189
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,879
Yeah, but by going on Tinder? You think?

190
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Just… I don't know.
Meeting with a ton of Internet randos?

191
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,879
No, c'mon. I mean,
you talk to one guy, then another guy.

192
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,440
And if you don't feel a spark,
you can manifest someone.

193
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,279
Manifest?
How do I manifest someone?

194
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,480
Just think really hard about a person
and a song that reminds you of them.

195
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,879
Play it on a loop,
nonstop, and they'll appear.

196
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,279
-What do you mean? Appear, how?
-It's not scientific at all.

197
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
Honestly.

198
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,320
But… But you have to trust.
It's life. It's energy.

199
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,200
It's… I'm telling you,
the law of attraction.

200
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
Don't ask why, but it works. I'm leaving.

201
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,679
'Cause if I keep drinking,
I'll end up rambling about ayahuasca.

202
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,080
-Give it here.
-Are you paying?

203
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,720
-Yeah, I got it.
-Thanks.

204
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,240
-Talk soon.
-Ciao.

205
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,759
Omar? I'll take the check, please.

206
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,399
-The check?
-Yes, please.

207
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,720
Sure. Let's ask Omar.

208
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,600
Hello?

209
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
-What are you doing here?
-What's up?

210
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
-Felipe?
-Can I come in, Omar?

211
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,840
Yeah, sure. You know each other?

212
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,879
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah.

213
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,120
We know each other, for sure.

214
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,679
-God.
-Oh man.

215
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,159
-It's so exciting to see you.
-How are you?

216
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,200
What are you doing here?

217
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,759
Nothing. Picking up some food

218
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,240
that the Lake Club's
donating to the center.

219
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,159
-That's random.
-Yeah, well, you know.

220
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,919
Me and my causes,
we can't stop. It's… How are you?

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,879
-Great.
-Yeah?

222
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,399
-You look so handsome.
-Ah, shit, Caye.

223
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,919
Hey, uh, wanna have a drink, or…?

224
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,759
Mm… yeah.

225
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,879
-How about right here? Does that work?
-Yeah.

226
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,919
This place is perfect.
I mean, it brings back great memories.

227
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,320
-For me too.
-Yeah? For you too?

228
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,240
Yeah.

229
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,279
Can you hold off until I'm done loading
my gazillion boxes into the van?

230
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,919
-Sure. I'll wait as long as it takes you.
-Perfect.

231
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,840
-It's freezing, isn't it?
-Yeah, a little bit.

232
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,759
What are you doing?
Did you skip class?

233
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,879
Having some beers, chilling.

234
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,639
Beer, this early?

235
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,159
Dad, join us or leave us alone.

236
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,639
Fine.

237
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,039
You can drink…

238
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,720
…but only under my supervision.

239
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,240
I mean, look.
I have nothing against gays. Nothing.

240
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Idiot!

241
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,720
-Let him.
-What?

242
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,640
Let's see, Cruz.
You have nothing against gays, but…?

243
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,039
There's no but.

244
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,039
Not half a but.

245
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,319
I just don't understand why

246
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,000
you get more excited
about a man than a woman.

247
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,599
Because women are, like, you know,
like gifts straight from Heaven.

248
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,640
Yeah. And men are from hell,
which is a lot more fun.

249
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,960
I'm gonna get some ice.

250
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,079
And get out of the way a bit
'cause this is just…

251
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,920
-What?
-You're such a dick.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,680
-What?
-Go and apologize.

253
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,880
-Why?
-Dad, go!

254
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,079
Okay.

255
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,680
Let me. I'll do it.

256
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,200
Oops.

257
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,599
Patrick.

258
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,359
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

259
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,920
I acted like a dumbass.

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Look, Cruz.

261
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,119
I don't care about
your hetero hang-ups and bullshit.

262
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,839
The fact you treated me
like fucking shit upset me more.

263
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,119
Yeah, it was a mistake.

264
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,680
What was?
Treating me like shit or kissing me?

265
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,599
Both, I guess.

266
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,160
-Both?
-Yeah.

267
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,599
Look, let's do this.

268
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,359
For every lie you tell me,

269
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,519
I'm gonna come closer.
Two steps for each one.

270
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,839
Until we're so close, I can see
if you have the balls to lie to my face.

271
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,960
If you tell the truth,
then… I'll walk away, just like you want.

272
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,799
I'm not in the mood
for this kid shit, all right?

273
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,200
Then don't hook up with kids.

274
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,400
But I already apologized, okay?

275
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,559
Now we each go our own way, right?

276
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Right?

277
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,759
-Each go our own way?
-Yeah.

278
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,480
Yeah.

279
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
You don't want me to go.

280
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,480
Look, Patrick, I'm not gay.

281
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,400
Bi.

282
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,599
Or bi or tri.

283
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,119
I'm a soccer player.

284
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,400
Look, insist all you want.

285
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
Soccer player isn't a sexual orientation.

286
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,119
I mean, Patrick, I…

287
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,960
I'd rather not get involved with people
in my son's social circle, you understand?

288
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,079
That's not something
someone like me can afford to do.

289
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,960
I hear you loud and clear.

290
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
All you had to do was be honest with me.

291
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,880
It's okay.

292
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,799
Really.

293
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,960
We'll just leave it at that,

294
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,440
as if nothing ever happened.

295
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,640
Patrick, wait.

296
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,759
Hey, come here.

297
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,319
Why?

298
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,240
Don't make me keep lying.

299
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,559
Hey! What's up with that ice?

300
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,960
The ice. Cruz.

301
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,160
-Has it melted already, or what?
-Please come to my room tonight.

302
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,759
-Cayetana!
-You scared me.

303
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,599
Hey, question. Do I smell bad?

304
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,359
-I shoulda gone home first.
-What?

305
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,200
-Smell.
-Ah! A little. Just a bit, yeah.

306
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,720
-Seriously?
-No. No, messing around.

307
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,880
Okay.

308
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
-Want a beer?
-Yeah.

309
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,680
-Yep? Um…
-Yeah, I'd love one.

310
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,039
Two Mahous, please.

311
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,519
So? How'd it go?

312
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,519
All these places, and of course,
we run into kids from school.

313
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,319
-This is a bit much, right?
-Mm.

314
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
I mean, a gazillion boxes, right?
That's…

315
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,039
We should at least go say hi.

316
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,920
Hey! I can't believe it.

317
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,640
-How are you?
-Hey, man.

318
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
Look who we have here.

319
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,240
-What's up? How are you?
-Uh…

320
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,759
Felipe. Felipe, like you,
but in Castilian.

321
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,880
Nice to see you, man. Yeah.

322
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,279
We're the same,
all except for… the wardrobe.

323
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,319
-Phillipe…
-Oof.

324
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,720
That's a good joke.

325
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,160
Phillipe, he just got off work.
Do you even know what that is?

326
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
-I just came over to say hello.
-Great.

327
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,319
Actually, it seems
like the stars have lined up.

328
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
You're with him. I'm with Isadora.

329
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
-Hmm, sure.
-Meet my girlfriend.

330
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,279
Hi. How are you?

331
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,440
-How are you?
-I'm great.

332
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,079
You two look a lot alike,
you know that? You do.

333
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,480
You'd make a great couple.
You do make a great couple.

334
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,079
You know, the four of us
could have dinner together.

335
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,039
What?

336
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,000
It'd be fun. Like a double date.

337
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,440
Well, technically, we're not a couple, so…

338
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,920
-Ah. Hmm.
-Mm.

339
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,680
Yeah, but I don't know.
Maybe it could still be kinda fun.

340
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,200
-Are you treating?
-Sure.

341
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
I thought you two
lost touch over Christmas.

342
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,680
Mm. Well, obviously not.

343
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,000
So, I actually met him at an NGO.

344
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,559
-He works there.
-Mm.

345
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,680
With little Black kids starving to death
and sick with AIDS and all that?

346
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,079
You're kidding, right?

347
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,839
No, no, no.
This is essentially just Isadora.

348
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,759
Ah, no. Hey.
Don't be mean. I'm exaggerating a bit.

349
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,960
Hey, listen a minute.

350
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,400
No, so I also have friends

351
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,400
who spend summers
on boats saving the whales.

352
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,799
I personally think
the world's going to shit anyway,

353
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,279
but if you enjoy that, be my guest.

354
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
I don't exactly do this
because I enjoy it.

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,119
No? Then why do you do it? Oh. Shh!

356
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
You're passionate.

357
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,839
You have passion
that is visible 300 kilometers away.

358
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
You can't imagine.

359
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,119
I mean, I want to imagine.

360
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,480
I want the image in my head,
but, no, it's not happening.

361
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,200
Yeah, passion's something else.
Isn't that right, honey?

362
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,200
Look how happy he is.
Look how happy I make him. Look at him.

363
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,039
-Mm. He's entertained, for sure.
-Your guy's entertained. Mine's happy.

364
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,200
-Hmm?
-Uh, question.

365
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,200
Are you rich kids always like this?

366
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:21,559
We're not rich.

367
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,720
Aristocracy, sweetheart.
The waiter's a rich kid.

368
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,559
Hello?

369
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,519
Ah. Oh. He's too far.

370
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,480
Okay, listen. I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

371
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,960
-Order me another drink, please.
-Mm-hmm.

372
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,920
I'll be right back.

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,160
Shit.
She's like an earthquake, isn't she?

374
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,200
Yeah.

375
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,160
Just wait till she gets back
from the bathroom. She'll be a tsunami.

376
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,680
COME HOME. DAD NEEDS US.

377
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,799
HE'LL BE FINE.

378
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,279
THE ONLY THING HE'S GUILTY OF
IS SMASHING MY FACE IN.

379
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,480
What movie did you pick?

380
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,000
And, uh, what is this?

381
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,200
-I was feeling it.
-Oh.

382
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,519
Honestly, doesn't this turn you on,
even a little?

383
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:26,000
You're gonna talk like your dad now?

384
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,119
-No, no. Not at all.
-Yeah.

385
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,599
I'm asking you because

386
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,839
I really want to know what turns you on.

387
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,640
Yeah? Why?

388
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,960
Just to know.

389
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,160
Yeah.

390
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,480
Mm.

391
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,359
Well, yeah. Of course it turns me on.
Why wouldn't it?

392
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,720
But he turns me on more than her.

393
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,960
It would turn me on even more
if she were another him.

394
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
Oh shit.

395
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,119
Apparently,
this really turns me on.

396
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,640
I want to suck cock.

397
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,200
Mm.

398
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,920
It turns me on
seeing how much it turns you on.

399
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,279
You and your fucking ambiguous games, huh?

400
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,359
But I'm not playing.

401
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,799
-You're not?
-No.

402
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:56,079
Wait, you're telling me that,
the two of us here, like this,

403
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,480
that turns you on?

404
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,400
Of course.

405
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,880
-Yeah? Why?
-You're really hot.

406
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
I feel great when I'm with you, and…

407
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,759
this really turns me on.

408
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,839
Why don't you try it?

409
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,359
Because if I did try,
it would be with you.

410
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,359
And I'm really scared of hurting you
as much as your sister hurt me.

411
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
Fuck. I don't know. Wait.

412
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,799
Listen,
stop jerking me around, okay?

413
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,559
It's just that…

414
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
-It's--
-No, Iván. I said no.

415
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,240
We can be friends if you want.

416
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,400
But stop messing with my shit.

417
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,000
But-- It's just-- Patrick.
Where are you goin'?

418
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,240
-To sleep in the guest room.
-But, Patrick. Sleep--

419
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,359
I said fucking stop it! Seriously, you…

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,319
Sleep here with me.

421
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,079
You're crazy, dude.

422
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,319
-Got me that drink?
-You sure?

423
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,359
Well, yeah.

424
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,240
What a sweetheart.
That guy's divine.

425
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,000
Hey. Hello.

426
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,160
Well, you're all suddenly super quiet.
What happened?

427
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,640
Mm.

428
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,759
This red wine is good,
but today it's… especially good.

429
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,880
Well, hold up. What's up?
Why aren't you drinking?

430
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
Baby doll? Sweetheart! Hello? Baby doll!
Four margaritas, please, honey.

431
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,920
-Thank you.
-No, some of us have to work tomorrow.

432
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,279
Let me explain something.
Our whole life is just work, right?

433
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,720
From the first drink
in the morning to the last at night.

434
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,759
And it's forced labor. Very forced.

435
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:35,000
That's why we have to live life
the best we possibly can.

436
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,559
Oh! There it is.
It's here. Come here. Come on.

437
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
Whoo-hoo. Amazing.

438
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really am.

439
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,279
I'll bring something
so you can clean yourself up.

440
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,480
Run 'cause I don't wanna see
your face right now.

441
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,119
-Isadora--
-Everyone's looking.

442
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
Maybe we-- Let's get you cleaned up.

443
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,920
-No. There's no real need. You can't tell.
-Yeah. Yes, there is.

444
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,279
No, you look perfect.

445
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,799
Can you come out with me?
Get some fresh air? I need some.

446
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,440
-Whatever.
-Okay? We'll be back.

447
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,119
-I'll leave this.
-Great.

448
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,920
I was pretending not--
Look how pretty the full moon is!

449
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
-It's beautiful.
-Look--

450
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,640
You're fucking kidding.

451
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,839
-Are you okay?
-Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

452
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,680
Caye, what's wrong? Is she high?

453
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,720
No. No, she's drunk.
You saw how much she had earlier.

454
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,720
-Go inside. We'll be right back.
-Okay.

455
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,400
What was that?

456
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,000
If Phillipe has to hear about
your problem, it should be from you.

457
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,400
I don't have a problem.

458
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,200
Yeah. And I mop floors 'cause I find it
professionally fulfilling.

459
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,759
Oh no.

460
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,440
How awful. No way, no way, no way.

461
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,119
Come on. Get up. I'll take you home.

462
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,920
Uh, yeah.
So I think we're gonna head home now

463
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,599
because she's a little under the weather,
so I'm taking her.

464
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,200
-Should I take you?
-No, no.

465
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,599
I'm not very good company
for anyone right now.

466
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
Let's go.

467
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,519
But are you seriously leaving?

468
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,519
Pfft. I'm really sorry. I wouldn't,
but I can't leave her in this state.

469
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,480
But I want to meet up with you.
Will you call me?

470
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,799
-You wanna see me?
-Yes.

471
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,119
-Okay. I'll hit you up. Call you soon.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

472
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,079
No problem.

473
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,640
-We're leaving. C'mon, Isadora.
-I'm coming.

474
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
-Enjoy dinner.
-I'm sorry.

475
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,559
-Get some rest.
-Good night.

476
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
-Ciao.
-Bye. Ciao.

477
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,119
HAS IVÁN GONE TO BED? I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

478
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:39,880
Fuck.

479
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,640
Uh, please.

480
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,359
Um… I… I can't sleep.

481
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,920
Then count sheep or something.

482
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,720
It's just that… I can't stop…

483
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,720
…goin' over and over it in my head.

484
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,960
What if because my prejudices or fears or…

485
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,880
or……I don't know what,

486
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,440
I might miss out on
something fucking great?

487
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
With someone who is fucking great.

488
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,039
And who makes me feel fucking great.

489
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,720
Dude, stop.
You're gonna make me really angry.

490
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,640
For the last time, Iván. Stop.

491
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,319
No.

492
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,519
I don't want to.

493
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
What? I'm sorry.

494
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
-I'm sorry.
-What are you doing?

495
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
-I'm nervous. Sorry.
-Hey.

496
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,680
-Calm down. Chill out. Chill out.
-Okay.

497
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,440
-Yeah, I should chill out.
-It's okay.

498
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,119
Yeah. Oh, fuck.

499
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,279
It's okay. It's okay. You're good.

500
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,640
It's okay. Let me.

501
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,599
Yeah?

502
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,519
Okay.

503
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,839
Good?

504
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,240
Really good.

505
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Should I try it?

506
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,079
If you want to.

507
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
You want me to?

508
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,599
What do you think?

509
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,759
Of course.

510
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,200
Iván, Iván, Iván.

511
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,960
-What?
-Be careful with your teeth.

512
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,119
-I'm sorry.
-You're good.

513
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,599
-No, don't worry, okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

514
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,960
-Do you want me to keep going?
-Yeah.

515
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
Ah.

516
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,799
-Oh. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

517
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
-No, no. Don't worry.
-Is it okay?

518
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,759
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

519
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,119
-It's good.
-I just want you to enjoy it.

520
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,240
-Oh, I am.
-Are you?

521
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,279
-Turn around.
-What? What?

522
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,640
-No, no, no. Not that.
-I'm not going to do that.

523
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,079
Patrick, not that. Patrick, no.

524
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,720
-Iván, I won't do that.
-I'm not ready.

525
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,799
-Dude, I swear.
-I'm not ready for that.

526
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
-Okay?
-I won't do that, but turn around.

527
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,680
Turn around.

528
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,799
Did that tickle?

529
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,440
-Yeah. But I like it.
-Yeah?

530
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,359
-Do you like it?
-Yeah, yeah.

531
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,799
I don't mind you
doing it to me if you want.

532
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:00,960
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

533
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,839
Okay.

534
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,880
What are you doing?
What? Isadora, what are you gonna do?

535
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,360
Swim some laps, high as a kite?

536
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,000
Maybe. You have so little experience.

537
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,000
You get in the water, and bam!
All your troubles disappear.

538
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,599
It's super normal
to be living in the Four Seasons Madrid.

539
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,239
Baby, I'm the Empress of Ibiza.

540
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,559
Any less wouldn't do.

541
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,239
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm off. Ciao.

542
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,480
Isadora!

543
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,079
Isadora, come on.
Get out. You're gonna drown.

544
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,159
Isadora?

545
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,079
Oh, you're fucking kidding me, girl.

546
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,920
Yeah, FYI,
that wasn't funny at all.

547
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,079
It's over now.

548
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,960
Okay. Ciao.

549
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,159
Isadora, oh my God.

550
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,679
You, wake up.

551
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,679
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
I thought you'd left. Stop, okay?

552
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,599
No. No, I haven't left.

553
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,719
No one should live in a hotel.

554
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,320
I've lived in hotels all my fucking life.

555
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,599
In my parents' hotels

556
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,480
or the hotels where they left me
when they went off to live the high life,

557
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,599
touring the world.

558
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
And I discovered the nightlife.

559
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,440
The people of the nightlife,
the partying, and the drugs.

560
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,280
I got hooked.

561
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,800
And I got hooked on the rush and…

562
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,000
…I don't know.

563
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,159
But suddenly, I was no longer alone.

564
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,199
Are you sure
this is stuff you wanna be telling me?

565
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,159
Can you just shut up
and enjoy seeing me this way?

566
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,719
Now I met Phillipe.

567
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,360
And he's a guy that I like a whole lot.

568
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,280
I like him.

569
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,639
He's someone who… I don't know.

570
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,079
He makes me wanna be better
and leave all this crap behind.

571
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,000
But he's obsessed with you.

572
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:39,960
And you know it.

573
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,280
So as long as you exist, there's no way
I'll ever be able to compete.

574
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,239
All that stuff you found is gonna continue
to be part of my diet for a bit longer.

575
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,519
Uh, okay. So now it's my fault
that you're an addict?

576
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,480
I think it's easier to blame you
than it is to get over my addiction.

577
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,719
I've had enough of you, Cayetana.

578
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
Ah.

579
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,920
You just told me you were all alone,
yet now you say you've had enough of me?

580
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,679
Maybe you're alone
because you push people away, huh?

581
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,119
I don't know.

582
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:25,519
Phillipe…

583
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,280
Maybe you chose him because you knew that,
deep down, you couldn't actually have him.

584
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,960
Don't offer an Argentinian
cheap therapy, baby.

585
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,800
I think you know where the door is.

586
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,840
Just so you know,
I also used to think that…

587
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,360
that I didn't deserve anyone's love.

588
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,239
And that can be overcome, just like drugs.

589
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,280
Psst. You got up early.

590
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,119
-Hey.
-Hi.

591
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,760
You left in quite a hurry this morning.

592
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,199
Yeah. I wanted to shower
and change at my place.

593
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,559
Uh-huh.

594
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,880
Why are you here?

595
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,760
Your father wants
to give me a special thanks

596
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,559
for the thing with the auction item.

597
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,719
Show me to his office?

598
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,519
Uh, yeah.

599
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:23,440
This way.

600
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,320
-I waited.
-Huh?

601
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,719
-I waited for you.
-Right.

602
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,440
I passed out.

603
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,320
What's the matter?

604
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,280
-What?
-What's wrong?

605
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,159
I'm not in the headspace
for stuff like this.

606
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,679
I have a bunch of problems, and… and you,

607
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,880
being who you are,
you can't be put at risk.

608
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
We should just forget it, okay?

609
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,239
This office right here is my father's.

610
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,239
Move aside, sir.

611
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,719
Excuse me. We have orders
to come and search your office again.

612
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,159
Wait. Uh, what? Again?

613
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,360
-I don't know what you're trying to find.
-Excuse me.

614
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,000
-Please. You have to leave.
-But how long?

615
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,280
Please, don't… don't touch me.
I can do it.

616
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,840
This is incredible.

617
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,159
Well, there goes the Nazi, guys.

618
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,920
WE'RE BOTH GONNA BE CAUGHT WITH OUR CELLS.

619
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,000
Ari?

620
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,920
TYPING…

621
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,480
FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO ON EDGE.
IT WASN'T YOU. IT'S EVERYTHING.

622
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:44,920
TYPING…

623
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,800
NO, FORGIVE ME. THIS IS TOO MUCH.

624
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,880
I GUESS IT'S HARD TO SAY OUT LOUD
WHAT HAPPENED TO ARMANDO.

625
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,800
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. TELL ME IN A MESSAGE.

626
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,800
WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN YOU AND IVÁN?

627
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,280
What's that about?

628
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,440
You said it.

629
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,599
There are things better not said out loud.

630
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,119
Ari, not long ago, I was Iván.

631
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,840
I recognize your behavior.

632
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,559
Answer me, and I'll answer you.

633
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,800
But won't my answer determine
what yours will be?

634
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,559
So there is something.

635
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,719
No.

636
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm helping him
with some Patrick problems.

637
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,159
And I don't know what happened to Armando.

638
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,079
Hey. Do you have a minute?

639
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,679
What are you doing here, Mencía?
You gonna practice Olympic phone throwing?

640
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,559
If I practiced a little more,

641
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,400
I would have hit your clingy girlfriend
on the head like she deserved.

642
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,960
Wow. I thought
you were comin' in peace.

643
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,639
I'm sorry.

644
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,480
I'm a dumpster fire.

645
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,639
I'm a mess,
and I have no idea what to do right now.

646
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,159
I think that you're the best person

647
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,480
to give me some good advice.

648
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,599
Well, I think you're right, there. Mm-hmm.
There's this method that never fails me.

649
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,239
Basically, throwin' a coin.
Heads, one thing. Tails, the other thing.

650
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,559
I don't know if I should tell on my dad.

651
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:01,519
What are you saying?

652
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,920
I think my father did it.

653
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
I think he's the one who murdered Armando.

654
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,360
-There's all this weird stuff going on--
-Hey, no. Okay? No. No, Mencía. Okay?

655
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,199
-Don't be thinking that about your dad.
-But you think the same thing.

656
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,840
'Cause he's not my dad.

657
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,920
Look, for you to be strong, you don't have
to reject your father, you know?

658
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,880
The opposite.

659
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,639
It's brave to stand by your family,
even when you don't fuckin' like it.

660
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,000
I mean, my mother did a bunch of stuff
that seriously fucked me up good.

661
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,320
But in the end,
well, she's still my old lady.

662
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,599
And your father's your father.

663
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:48,559
So then, what?

664
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:50,920
Stay quiet?

665
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,079
Yeah.

666
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:01,400
Okay.

667
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,760
Thank you.

668
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,559
Aren't you worried about Mencía?
I am about Ari.

669
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:14,840
Okay, listen to me, kids.

670
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,840
Everyone's gotta save
their own asses, you know?

671
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,199
Let Mencía save her dad's.
Meanwhile, we gotta try and save our own.

672
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,960
The cops have been swarming
this place for days, right?

673
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,880
Maybe today they'll arrest Benjamín.

674
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,360
And if he didn't do anything,
well, then I guess… they'll release him.

675
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,159
Yeah, man. They will.

676
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:35,079
Right?

677
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:58,239
Are you looking for this?

678
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,159
I…

679
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,599
I don't know what I'd do if someone did
to my kids what they did to you.

680
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,880
And trust me, I totally understand
that you want to help your father.

681
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,559
But right now,

682
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,800
you'll help him out a lot more
by talking than keeping quiet.

683
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,079
Mencía.

684
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,760
Help us understand your father.

685
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:34,480
-Lieutenant!
-Not now.

686
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,079
-I need to talk.
-I said not right now.

687
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:37,000
It was me.

688
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,000
I murdered De La Ossa.

689
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,000
Report Guzmán
and put an end to this.

690
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,320
Look, Guzmán didn't do it.

691
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,559
Well, me neither.

692
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,840
Of course…

693
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,800
there might be a third possibility.

694
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,679
I would put all my best lawyers
to work exclusively with you on your case.

695
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,599
And we'd get you out as soon as possible.

696
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,480
And I give you my word of honor

697
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,679
that from that moment on,
you will never ever

698
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,199
have to worry about your future again.

699
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,480
Or about money or about anything… ever.

700
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,280
Standing up for me
can set you up for life.

701
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,760
How many 18-year-olds can say
that their life is sorted out?

702
00:49:57,719 --> 00:49:59,400
You could even come live with us.

703
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,000
And my family would be your family.

704
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,199
Rebe! Rebe, Rebe!

705
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,519
Not here. Not in here.

706
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,039
You need to calm down.

707
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,920
What the fuck has he done, Omar?

708
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,719
Huh? Was it an honor thing?
To save the fucking Nazi or Guzmán or who?

709
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
Maybe he did it to save you too.
