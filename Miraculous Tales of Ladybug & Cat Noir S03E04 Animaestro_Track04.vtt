‎Meh! I'll be the judge of that!

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.700
‎You turned down
‎an invitation to the premiere?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.340
‎I'm a superhero, Tikki, not a star.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.700
‎It's my job to protect the city,
‎not sit around at a movie premiere!

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.060
‎-Well said!
<i>‎-The premiere will be attended</i>

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.100

<i>‎including Jagged Stone,</i>

‎-Adrien?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.140
‎Adrien's gonna be there? Oh, no!
‎Ladybug so should have said yes!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.100
‎So, we've got 600 macaroons,
‎plus 800 petits fours,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.140
‎not to mention the tiered cakes.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.540
‎We should have hired someone
‎to help us serve at the premiere!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.620
‎The premiere of the Ladybug
‎and Cat Noir animated movie?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.580
‎-Yes.
‎-Me! Me! Me!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.460
‎I can totally help you out with that!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060
‎-You mean... as a... server?
‎-Yes!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.060
‎I'll hand the macaroons out to Adrien,
‎I mean... to everybody, of course,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.500
‎not just Adrien.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.020
‎And the fact Adrien will be there
‎has nothing to do with it.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.460
‎Not a thing. Like, not in the slightest!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.300
‎I just want to help out my wonderful,
‎sweet parents who I love so much!

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.860
‎-Hee, hee!
‎-Um...

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.660
‎You guys don't trust me.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.780
‎Then again, I'm such a klutz,
‎even I wouldn't trust me.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.660
‎Of course you're not a klutz, my darling!
‎You're hired! We'll just--

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.060
‎Oh, thank you!
‎You're the best parents in the world!

‎We'll make twice the number, just in case.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.980
‎This is gonna be such an amazing night!
‎I need something amazing to wear!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.460
‎And last, but definitely not least,
‎the amazing macaroon! Ta-dah!

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.420
‎Uh... don't you think your father's
‎800 macaroons will be plenty?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.780
‎No, Tikki!
‎Adrien deserves a special macaroon

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.220
‎to show him just how special
‎he is to me! Just picture it.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.540
‎He's expecting a regular macaroon,
‎but I give him this macaroon.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.900
‎He takes one bite and says,
‎"Oh, It's passion fruit, my favourite!

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.540
‎How can you know me this well
‎when I'm so secretive?"

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.300
‎So I answer,
‎"It's because you're so special to me.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.540
‎I feel like I've known you forever!"
‎Then--

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.020
‎Wait. Is this why you bake
‎a single macaroon every Sunday?

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.820
‎Who knows when the perfect opportunity
‎will come up?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.060
‎And Adrien cannot have a stale macaroon!

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.100
‎Of course not.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.300
‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news.
‎Nadia Chamack coming to you, live,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.660
‎from the premiere
‎we've all been waiting for.

<i>‎The Adventures of Cat Noir and Ladybug.</i>
‎The gorgeous Laura Nightingale,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.260
‎who sang all the songs, has just arrived.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.860
‎Good evening, Laura! I'm your biggest fan.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.140
‎-This is a private event, sir!
‎-Huh? Excuse me, I'm Thomas Astruc,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.100
‎the movie director!

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.340
‎You filmed Cat Noir and Ladybug?
‎What are they like in real life?

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.940
‎Uh... It's an animated movie.
‎It's all cartoon characters.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.620
‎We don't film anyone. See,
‎there's this whole team that draws the--

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.700
‎Whatever! Who'd want to see Ladybug
‎and Cat Noir as cartoon characters?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.860
‎So, put your thumbs here
‎and look straight ahead.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.780
‎Uh, shouldn't there be
‎macaroons on the tray?

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.020
‎Yes, we'll put them on when you're ready.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.020
‎Dad! Mom! I am totally ready!
‎Trust me, I'll be super-duper careful!

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.660
‎Oh, our little girl
‎is spreading her wings!

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.740
‎Ladybug's one of my best buds.
‎I can't wait to see her movie!

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.540
‎Well, I... I'm the director. So, actually,
‎it's more my movie, so to speak.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.020
‎Oh! So, you're the one
‎who created the story?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.900
‎Well, technically, the screenwriters wrote
‎the story, inspired by Ladybug exploits.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.900
‎-Oh, OK! So you did all the drawings?
‎-No, the animators do all the drawings.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.780
‎-So, what do you do, then?
‎-Well, I--

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.420
‎Whoa! Hey, Marinette!
‎Now<i>‎ she</i>‎ can draw! She does it all herself!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.740
‎Check out these groovy sunglasses
‎she made.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.540
‎-Well, that's impressive!
‎-She even designed my album cover!

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.940
‎Uh, thanks! Uh... Macaroons?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.100
‎Phew! So far, so good!

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.060
‎Uh-oh! She's seen him.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.260
‎"Adrien, you are so normal to me...
‎No! 'Special' to me!"

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.340
‎Oh! I'll never get it right!

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.340
‎Whoa! Ha, ha! No.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.180
‎No! Aaah!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.100
‎You, go fetch me a chocolate macaroon!
‎But make sure it's dark chocolate,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.180
‎-not milk chocolate! Got that?
‎-But I'm not a waiter.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.460
‎-I'm the movie director!
‎-Oh, really?

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.820
‎-So, you're responsible for this movie?
‎-Yes! Yes, exactly! That's me!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.980
‎Then you were the one who left
‎Queen Bee out of the trailer!

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.340
‎You're lame, utterly lame!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.260
‎And what were are you thinking,
‎hiring Dupain-Cheng as a waitress?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.380
‎-I didn't hire her!
‎-Actually,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.180
‎it's a really good thing
‎you're doing the serving!

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.020
‎It means that while
‎I'm watching the movie with Adrien,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.500
‎you'll be washing dishes! Ha, ha, ha!

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.980
‎Excuse me! Sorry!

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.460
‎Excuse me! Sorry! Excuse me!

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.620
‎Adrien, you're expected
‎to welcome the Tsurugis.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.500
‎-Oh, no! Not her!
‎-Oh, no! Not her!

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.860
‎-Huh? Stop it!
‎-Huh? Stop it!

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.020
‎ You're copying me! Quit it!

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
‎-No, you quit it!
‎-No, you quit it!

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.420
‎-Do you know her?
‎-I don't just know her, I despise her!

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.140
‎What do you think you're doing, sitting
‎next to my Adrikins? That's my seat!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.780
‎Don't ever touch me again.
‎Don't ever speak to me again.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.620
‎Don't ever look at me again.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.700
‎Konbanwa, Tsurigi-san.
‎Douzo yoroshiku, Onigaishimas.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.980
‎Gabriel-San,
‎per our discussion at our last meeting,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.980
‎-I've brought these documents.
<i>‎-Doumo arigato.</i>

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.460
‎Please follow me.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.660
‎-I'm glad to see you again, Kagami.
‎-Me too, Adrien.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.860
‎-OK. We need a plan!
‎-What do you mean, a plan?

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.100
‎A plan. You know,
‎a seat chart of the theatre!

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.260
‎I don't believe this! Adrien and Kagami
‎will sit next to each other

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.940
‎while I'm two rows behind!
‎Utterly ridiculous!

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.980
‎-I don't even have a seat, so...
‎-If we get rid of Kagami

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.780
‎before the movie starts,
‎there'll be a seat for you!

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.860
‎-We can't do that!
‎-Remember what you said to me once?

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.900
‎"All that is necessary for the triumph
‎of evil is that good people do nothing."

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.380
‎Well, today, the "evil" is her
‎and the "good people" are us!

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.580
‎-I'm not too sure about this.
‎-Fine. Keep on not being sure about it,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.780
‎and tomorrow,
‎they'll be on a plane headed for Japan!

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.140
‎-Adrien? Japan? There's no way!
‎-You think?

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.460
‎They're going to the movies together,
‎their parents are signing papers together.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.100
‎We can't let her do that!

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.500
‎Marinette!
‎Surely you're not teaming up with Chloé?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.180
‎I'm stopping Kagami from kidnapping
‎Adrien and taking him off to Japan!

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.700
‎He's too nice to see
‎what she's really up to.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.900
‎All right. Garbage bag, ladle...

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.820
‎-What? I asked you to get some rope!
‎-All I could find was this cooking string,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.780
‎you know, for tying up roasts?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.660
‎Do I look like someone
‎who knows anything about cooking roasts?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.420
‎Hey, wait!

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.980
‎-Chloé, we can't do this!
‎-Listen, Marinette!

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.140
‎If we don't sacrifice a few macaroons now,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.140
‎Adrien will be eating sushi
‎for the rest of his life!

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.580
‎You'd better not screw this up,
‎Dupain-Cheng!

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.460
‎I'm doing this for you, Adrien!

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.780
‎-Ladybug? Where's Ladybug!
‎-Hey, kids!

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.580
‎Ladybug isn't here. We came here to meet
‎the director of the movie!

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.780
‎Aw...

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.060
‎Forgive me, Mom and Dad,
‎but it's... it's for a good cause!

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.900
‎Whoa! My, my! I am so clumsy!

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.340
‎-Marinette, are you OK?
‎-Ah! Perfect.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.020
‎Hold this for me!

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.180
‎Thank you, Adrien!

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.740
‎Here, Adrien, this is, uh,
‎your favourite-flavoured macaroon!

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.020
‎Of course, I'm just guessing.
‎I mean, how would I know, right?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.860
‎But people do sometimes prefer
‎some things to other things, so...

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.340
‎Thanks, Marinette!

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.260
‎Dupain-Cheng! What were you doing?
‎That was not part of the plan!

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.620
‎Kagami, is something wrong?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.660
‎These shoes belonged to my grandmother!

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.980
‎Ha! This is part of the plan!

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.060
‎Sit down. I'll help you.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.020
‎Phase two, Dupain-Cheng.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.540
‎Can you please autograph this for me?

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.020
‎Kagami!

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.380
‎But if you didn't make the story, or
‎the drawings, then you didn't do anything!

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.980
‎Huh?

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.340
‎Mmm.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.820
‎-What's happening?
‎-Ew!

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.300
‎Gross!

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.020
‎Aaah! This macaroon contains almonds!
‎I specifically told you

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.420
‎-I'm allergic to them!
‎-We were so careful!

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.940
‎-All the macaroons are made from coconut!
‎-Uh-oh... all... but one.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:11.100
‎What? What in the... ? What is that?
‎Who put this cake on this seat?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.740
‎I should have known.
‎Chloé's plans are all disastrous!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.700
‎I spent three years of my life,
‎working day in, day out... for this?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.220
‎What was meant to be my night is ruined!

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.380
‎Here. I'll take those, Tom.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.580
‎Nobody could care less about me.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.740
‎Ah! The behind-the-scenes creator
‎who never gets any of the credit.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.300
‎The perfect type of injustice
‎for my akumas.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.020
‎Fly away, creature of the dark,
‎and evilise his broken heart!

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.540
‎Animaestro, you're going to show
‎everyone who you really are

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.340
‎with a power as limitless
‎as your imagination!

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.540
‎All I asked in return
‎are Cat Noir and Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.260
‎I want them all to see
‎what a director is capable of!

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.900
‎Now I understand
‎why Kagami speaks so much about you.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.340
‎Your father has raised you
‎to be a refined young man.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.900
‎The plan is a total disaster!

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.740
‎Adrien and Kagami are closer now
‎than they were before!

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.780
‎You ruined everything, Dupain-Cheng!
‎What was it with that macaroon, anyway?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.180
‎Uh... it was a special
‎passion fruit macaroon.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
‎But that's the favourite of...

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.180
‎No! Don't tell me that.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.380
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha!
‎You've got a crush on Adrien!

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.420
‎Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:51.060
‎That is ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!
‎You're a nobody in his eyes!

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.740
‎And you'll always be a nobody!
‎Watch. I'll prove it.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.380
‎Adrikins!

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.900
‎Who are you? You can't come--

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.380
‎You really think a director does nothing?

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.820
‎Well, let me show you
‎exactly what I'm capable of!

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.700
‎Come on, get a grip!
‎Hey, Adrikins, you'll never guess...

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.140
‎-Hmm?
‎-Aaah!

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.900
‎Aaah!

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.780
‎Oh, come on now! Don't leave!
‎The show's just getting started!

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.700
‎I'll never take Chloé's advice again!

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.020
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.020
‎Yeah!

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.420
‎We'd have come if we'd known
‎how upset you were gonna get!

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.660
‎-Cat Noir and Ladybug!
‎-What's with that trailer, too?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.580
‎-I am not scared of cats, at all!
‎-You haven't even seen the movie

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.220
‎-and you're already slamming it?
‎-He does have a point, you know.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.220
‎I wasn't slamming it.
‎It's called constructive criticism.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.900
‎-Yay!
‎-Good job, milady!

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.460
‎Oh! It's always about you, isn't it?
‎From now on,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.340
‎everyone will be looking at me!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.820
‎Let's see how much you enjoy
‎the true power of animation!

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.220
‎-I am the only true hero!
‎-Stay behind me, milady!

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.260
‎Aaah!

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.340
‎Are you OK, Cat noir?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.980
‎Watch out!

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.460
‎-How can we beat him?
‎-The thing that doesn't change

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.380
‎-when he transforms is his mask!
‎-The akuma must be in it!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.780
‎Fear the power of cartoons!

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.820
‎How about you fear the power
‎of the... Lucky Charm!

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.580
‎-A camera?
‎-Of course!

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.220
‎Who better to make a movie about Cat Noir
‎and Ladybug... than Ladybug and Cat Noir?

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.580
‎Ya-haa!

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.980
‎He really doesn't
‎take kindly to competition!

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.100
‎ Take their Miraculous.
‎They're at your mercy!

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.420
‎I can't see anything!

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.780
‎Protect your Miraculous.
‎He could be anywhere!

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.620
‎Move!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.020
‎Everything OK down there?

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.540
‎Over there!

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.420
‎He's gone! Why didn't he attack us
‎while we were blinded?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.220
‎I don't know! It doesn't make any sense.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.500
‎Something must have happened we didn't
‎see, which is why we got a camera.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.220
<i>‎Protect your Miraculous.</i>
<i>‎He could be anywhere!</i>

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.700
‎-Did you just pause the image?
‎-No. Did you see him freeze?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.220
‎No, I had my eyes closed
‎because of the smoke!

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.700
‎-Me too.
‎-That's why he didn't take our Miraculous!

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.740
‎-If nobody's watching him...
‎-He stops moving!

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.420
‎Just like a movie! If nobody watches it,
‎it's as if it didn't exist!

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.220
‎Now we know how to defeat him!

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.860
‎Whoa!
‎This is the craziest show I've ever seen.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.300
‎It won't be easy
‎getting people to stop watching!

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.860
‎Looks like this show is a sellout!

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.020
‎Time for the end credits, Cat Noir!

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.540
‎Close your eyes! Stop watching him!

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.420
‎Just because it's colourful and shiny
‎doesn't mean it's not very dangerous!

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.900
‎TV! Of course! Cat Noir, keep him busy!

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.780
‎-So, you jealous of our success, huh?
‎-You can play the smart alec, Cat,

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.700
‎but once I have your Miraculous,
‎people will forget about you soon enough!

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.220
‎You! Yes, you who are watching me!

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.100
<i>‎Wherever you are, close your eyes!</i>

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.500
<i>‎Do not look at Animaestro!</i>
<i>‎Turn off your screens.</i>

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.620
‎Come on! We need each one of you!
‎It's the only way to stop him!

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.020
‎Ha, ha! You can tell everyone
‎to switch off their TVs,

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.860
‎but there'll always be
‎at least one person watching me!

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.820
‎I wouldn't miss this show for anything!

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.100
‎I'm sorry, Nadia, but this time
‎there will be no live coverage!

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.500
‎Huh?

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.980
‎What? No!

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.660
‎Animaestro,
‎hurry up and bring me their Miraculous!

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.780
‎Aaah!

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.100
‎Cataclysm!

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.940
‎Everybody must watch! Animation!

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.060
‎Funny, 'cause I think we're the last ones!

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.340
‎And once we close our eyes,
‎it's time for the end credits, Animaestro!

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.420
‎No!

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.740
‎No! No!

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.820
‎-Shut your eyes tight, Cat Noir.
‎-You know I trust you blindly!

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.860
‎No more evil-doing for you.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.660
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.900
‎Gotcha!

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.620
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.660
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.660
‎What am I doing here?
‎Cat Noir and Ladybug?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.260
‎In the flesh!

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.580
‎-You're about to transform back, milady!
‎-Bug out!

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.220
‎Ladybug, Cat Noir,
‎enjoy your apparent victory!

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.180
‎Because, as in all the best tragedies,
‎triumph always comes before failure!

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.540
‎Chloé, please don't tell Adrien
‎I have a crush on him.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.340
‎In this world, there are those who work,
‎and those who shine!

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.180
‎Forever there will be
‎this division between us.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.140
‎Which is why
‎you and I will never be a team!

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.860
‎I'm not going to tell him.
‎You're not worth the extra attention!

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.180
‎You know what?
‎Take my seat and enjoy the movie.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.780
‎I've seen it ten times or more!

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.620
‎What matters the most is for it to be seen
‎by people who really want to see it.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.540
‎I... I... but--

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.900
‎Sorry! I guess you don't know
‎who I am either.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.540
‎Of course I do!
‎You're Thomas Astruc, the movie director!

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.860
‎Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you,
‎thank you, thank you!

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.180
‎She recognised me!
‎Somebody actually recognised me!

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.180
‎This is the best day of my life!

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.140
‎Awesome you could get in!

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.100
‎And I'm really sorry I didn't get to taste
‎your macaroon. It looked delicious!

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.100
‎It's no biggy! There'll be tons
‎of other macaroons... I mean, occasions!
