it's like I'm being forced to grow up.

6
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:20,840
Why do you always make me worried?

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,000
You're too good at playing with my heart.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,159
I made Kim upset and I don't know how to fix it.

9
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,000
If you wait any longer, it may get worse.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,372
Maybe Mek is the kind of guy who doesn't use the word love to express his feelings?

11
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:34,814
Happy Birthday, Kim.

12
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:43,894
I like you.

00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,111
Say something.

Why are you always like this when you did something wrong?

You always hide

rather than facing it.

33
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,000

You just disappeared without saying a word.

Here's the sheet.

42
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:41,188
Mek.

43
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Take it.

44
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,708
All of you seniors...

45
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,000
now it's time for you to shine

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and show what you've learnt throughout the past 3-4 years.

47
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,398
I suppose you all have a group already?

48
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,761
Yes.

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,345
If you need any advice for your film,

50
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:11,000
feel free to come discuss it with me.

51
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:14,031
Once it gets approved, you can present it to the class next week.

52

Oh!

53

Chancellor will come on our screening day.

some weird power on you again.

- Yes, professor.
- Noted.

58
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,628
What's wrong with you, Mek?

59
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,017
Right.

60
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,482
So...

61
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,283
You don't like Kim?

62
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,000
If something's bugging you, just tell us.

63
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,299
Yeah.

64
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,266
You think we're okay seeing you like this?

65
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,525
Do you remember that time I told you...

66
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,926
that I want to take on something new I'm interested in?

67
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,284
Mm.

68
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:37,319
I just applied for a landscape course in Australia.

69
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,766
And the university replied...

70
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,602
that they accepted me
and I can start my semester this fall.

71
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
So...

72
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,500
What does it have to do with Kim?

73
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,261
If I go to Australia,

74
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,239
what's the future for our relationship?

75
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,495
You just have to make a decision.

76
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,212
There's nothing complicated about it.

77
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,261
Don't tell me your reluctant tendencies strike again.

78
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,738
So what are you gonna do?

79
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,451
You shouldn't be like this.

80
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,239
Not to mention the thesis project.

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,363
Are you sure you can handle all that?

82
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,840
Do you want to drop out and take a break?

83
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,027
We can do it together with you.

84
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,293
Right.

85
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:29,793
You guys, stop it.

86
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,452
I can take care of myself.

87
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,999
Now we need to focus on the thesis.

88
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,894
You don't have to worry.

89
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:40,468
We're not worried about the project.

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,363
We're worried about you.

91
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,398
I'm Mek of Thunderous Sky.

92
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,398
I can weather any storm.

93
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,239
Speaking of which, I feel like kicking off the thesis right now.

94
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,659
Come on. Let's go doing research.

95
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,389
We need to write a paper for the professor, remember?

96
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:02,829
Are you sure about that?

97
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:04,814
Yeah.

98
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,469
Let's go.

99
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:30,531
At least I won the last two digits prize this time.

100
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,867
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,442
It was because of me.

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,841
I'm the one who encouraged you to confess to him.

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,575
In the end, it's good, isn't it?

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
I could finally get it off my chest and be done with it.

105
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,734
Kim.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,186
I already applied for the photography contest.

107
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,500
I've taken up photography again.

108
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,314
Don't you want to celebrate with me a bit?

109
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:11,584
Actually, I went to take photos with Park recently.

110
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Really?

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What got you interested in photography again?

112
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,867
Of course, it's because of my beloved Park.

113
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,584
Wow.

114
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,235
Did you just brag about your boyfriend?

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,053
I'm creating content with Bear, too.

116
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,739
You two are bragging about your boyfriends. Period.

117
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Kimhan.

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,734
Could you do me a favor?

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Is there anything you want me to help with?

120
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Can you find these books for me, please?

121
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,549
Sure.

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think we should go to different sections.

123
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,000
You and I should go find those theory books.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,495
We gather again once we find what we need.

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,495
Okay, sure.

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,847
I don't get it.

127
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,504
The internet exists.

128
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
But why does the professor want us to research in the library?

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I guess there's something more here
than what's on the internet.

130
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:08,695
So...

131
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,106
I'll go find thesis documents from the past years then.

132
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,000
So we can have some references.

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,549
Make sure you pick the good ones,

134
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,018
so I can copy them.

135
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,177
I'm so sorry.

136
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,389
I'm really not available today.

137
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's arrange it next time.

138
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you.

139
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,867
Why did you reschedule it?

140
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,687
Because I'm busy.

141
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,292
Busy my ass!

142
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,314
I already confirmed it with them.

143
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,022
Why are you sitting here?

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,868
You should've gone to work.

145
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,000
So you always help him manage his work?

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,442
You two seem to be very close.

147
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
He's a lot of work, Pete.

148
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,841
I only help him sometimes.

149
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:05,443
Of course, we're close.

150
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Mai and I...

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,628
We've known each other for so long.

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,314
I know...

153
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
what he likes.

154
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
And what he doesn't like.

155
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,660
You seem to understand each other very well.

156
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,314
Are you guys really just friends?

157
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,500
Tim is my best friend.

158
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,712
If we wanted to date,

159
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,266
we would have done it long ago.

160
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm courting Mai here.

161
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,973
Could you give me the chance, Tim?

162
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,000
Can't believe you really said that.

163
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,075
You can do whatever you want.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,500
It's not my business.

165
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,784
He's right.

166
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,505
In fact, I'm the one who you should be asking, no?

167
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,526
I've been trying to approach you all this time.

168
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't you notice?

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,894
I've noticed that since the moment you asked me for my LINE contact.

170
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,610
I see what you did there.

171
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's order.

172
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:11,552
Professor.

173
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,398
Did you happen to see the pile of books on that table?

174
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,133
I have to bring them to Prof. Angkana.

175
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:18,761
Meka already did that for you.

176
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:20,841
Thank you.

177
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:30,000
"Dude, is there something
going on between Mai and Pete?"

178
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,363
"I guess so."

179
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,091
"I think you should know that..."

180
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,558
"Pete is a jerk."

181
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:40,000
"He fools around."

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,925
"Yesterday, I just saw him with a guy from Econ."

183
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:45,137
"Please warn Mai about him."

184
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,659
"Mai and I are not that close."

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
"I don't think it's my place to say it."

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,359
Hi, what's up?

187
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,711
Are you home now?

188
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:10,000
Who are you with?

189
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,000
Pete sent me home just now.

190
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
And he went home already?

191
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, he's gone.

192
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So what is it that you're calling me for?

193
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,234
Do you really like Pete?

194
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:24,000
Why?

195
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,084
I think he's kinda cute.

196
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,239
He takes such good care of me.

197
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Even better than when I take care of you.

198
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:33,549
That means you really like him, right?

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,442
What are you trying to say?

200
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,323
Nothing.

201
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,292
If you like him, it's cool.

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,422
Mm.

203
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,058
Is that all?

204
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:22,500
Mek has something to think about.

205
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,398
What could be more important than this?

206
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,654
What about you?

207
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:26,891
Have you decided?

208
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,000
Later.

209
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,293
A zombie movie is waiting for us.

210
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:19,945
"Today, I'm going to show you..."

211
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:22,945
"how to wear plain-colored clothes
without looking so plain."

212
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,275
"Take my outfit for an example..."

213
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:26,143
Why are you watching Tim's content?

214
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,945
You want to make something like this?

215
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:30,533
Do you think it's possible?

216
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,945
I think I can do this too.

217
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:34,052
Don't you agree, Bomb?

218
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:36,189
Sure I do.

219
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,807
Papa Bear can always make it happen!

220
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,945
I don't want people to see you shirtless!

221
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,991
I need to fetch some clothes for my boyfriend.

222
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,743
There are only us here. Who would see me?

223
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:49,945
No, no.

224
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,469
Here you go.

225
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,472
Maybe I can start by matching an outfit for you.

226
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,227
I think...

227
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:14,266
if I make an outfit mix & match content,

228
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:15,721
it's gonna be popular.

229
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:16,822
See?

230
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,197
You look so cute!

231
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,404
You'll do great with any content.

232
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,266
Lots of people are ready to support you.

233
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,693
Subscription is also on the rise.

234
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:37,807
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

235
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,060
I can make it happen because of you, Bomb.

236
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:56,402
So, Bear...

237
00:20:58,108 --> 00:20:59,945
Why did Mek react like that?

238
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:02,308
Kim was hurt so much, you know?

239
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,330
Mek has something to think about.

240
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,308
What could be more important than this?

241
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,555
Well...

242
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,509
He's going to study abroad.

243
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,830
That's why he hesitated.

244
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,406
But don't tell Kim about this.

245
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,945
Mek wanted to deal with it on his own.

246
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:18,136
Come on.

247
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:19,830
Don't worry.

248
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,303
Everything is gonna be alright.

249
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,477
I believe so.

250
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:25,372
Alright.

251
00:21:57,337 --> 00:21:58,602
I like you.

252
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,487
What's exactly on your mind?

253
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:16,052
I'm so tired of guessing!

254
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:22,808
No meals for you today!

255
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,396
Just starve.

256
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,876
I don't know what your daddy is thinking.

257
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,078
Waiting is hard, you know?

258
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:29,945
Next group.

259
00:23:29,945 --> 00:23:31,289
Thunderous Sky, it's your turn.

260
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,816
The title of our thesis film is...

261
00:23:43,816 --> 00:23:45,128
University of Zombie.

262
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,945
It's about university students

263
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:49,403
who got infected and broke into the campus.

264
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:52,632
Then they spread the infection all over the place

265
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:54,744
and people start to transform into zombies.

266
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:57,105
There are three main characters.

267
00:23:57,105 --> 00:24:00,151
These characters will be the ones to drive the plot and bring us to conclusion.

268
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:01,827
Right.

269
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:06,220
And here's how the zombie costume will look like.

270
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,126
As you can see, it will be bloody...

271
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:16,720
And here're the research info about zombie movies that we found.

272
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,505
Now that you take yourself seriously, Thunderous Sky,

273
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,345
you seem to be doing really well.

274
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:28,945
I think you've done a thorough research.

275
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:30,945
You can start writing your screenplay now.

276
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:34,945
Thank you.

277
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:36,853
Next group, please.

278
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,830
Our project got approved so easily.

279
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,738
It's unbelievable.

280
00:24:43,945 --> 00:24:45,945
Maybe the professor already got tired of seeing your faces,

281
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:48,945
so she just greenlit it as fast as she could.

282
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:50,390
Good then.

283
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,812
So I can graduate fast

284
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:53,582
and start making a living.

285
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:55,445
Right, Mek?

286
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:01,445
What do you guys plan to do after graduation?

287
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,288
I think I'll keep doing editing gigs.

288
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:05,445
I've become used to it now.

289
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:06,452
What about you?

290
00:25:06,864 --> 00:25:08,288
I'll live with Bomb

291
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:10,170
and continue making content for Bear's Experiment.

292
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:11,721
I've thought about it.

293
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,063
The channel is going to be popular.

294
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,502
I'm 100% sure!

295
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:22,203
What about you?

296
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,312
Have you decided?

297
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:27,945
Later perhaps.

298
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:29,945
The zombie movie project is waiting for us.

299
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,949
Let's make the film our most memorable project together.

300
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:37,082
Are you sure you're ready for it?

301
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:38,491
I'm sure.

302
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,693
The hellish week...

303
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:43,830
begins now!

"Check this out."

305
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:46,945
"It's so cool."

306
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,043
Bear.

307
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:49,812
Can you print out another copy for me?

308
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:50,679
Sure.

309
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,020
I'm running out of ideas.

310
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:08,326
Park.

311
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:10,464
Why didn't you trust me?

312
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:13,745
What you came up with is so cliché.

313
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:15,385
It's the same in every movie.

314
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,545
Imagine Squid Game.

315
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:20,724
When they reveal the truth about that 001 uncle.

316
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:23,311
Don't you think it creates more impact that way?

317
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,174
You just freaking gave away a spoiler, man!

318
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:27,945
My idea is cliché. So what?

319
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,945
Have you ever heard of mass media?

320
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,945
We're doing it for the mass.

321
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,945
I have a mass taste.

322
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:36,334
Don't you forget we're making a film for the mass.

323
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:37,987
Bear.

324
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,808
Are you for real?

325
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,758
I've been friends with your for 4 years.

326
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,945
But this is the first time you have great ideas.

327
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:46,487
Damn you, Park.

328
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:51,493
So...

329
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,445
Are you buying my idea, Mr. director?

330
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,056
If so, I'm going take this approach.

331
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:57,671
Go ahead with it.

00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:34,945
Can I really edit a film?

338
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,808
If it fails, we fail together.

339
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,105
It's actually even harder for me.

340
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,697
As a director, if the film turns out shitty,
people are going to blame me.

341
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,445
Why are you guys so serious?

342
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,808
You're acting as if some streaming service
is waiting to buy our work.

343
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,446
Just do our best.

344
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:55,109
Put all energy into it!

345
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,445
Guys, I bought something for you.

346
00:28:26,945 --> 00:28:29,082
Bear, how are you?

347
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:30,762
Are you tired doing your thesis project?

348
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,147
I'm so tired, Bomb.

349
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:36,170
Please make time to eat.

350
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:39,265
And don't only eat instant noodles, okay?

351
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,578
I'm worried about you.

352
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,373
I miss you so much!

353
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,285
Bye for now.

354
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:46,647
Love you so much!

355
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:47,983
Love you too.

356
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:50,212
Bye-bye.

357
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,167
You can do it.

358
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:57,918
How are the Thunderous Sky guys doing?

359
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:01,945
They're pretty busy.

360
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:04,628
Bear said they barely have time to sleep.

361
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,243
Mek too.

362
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,945
Park said...

363
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:13,060
he worked so hard he got sick.

364
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,491
We need to do something about this Mek-Kim situation.

365
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:11,258
We felt that the information we'd prepared last time might not be enough yet,

366
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:13,326
so we decided to to more research.

367
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:14,502
Now, we got the locations...

368
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:17,647
In terms of editing, we'll focus on keeping a slow and steady pacing...

369
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:20,945
to make sure that the audiences get immersed into the film's mood.

370
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,739
We will be filming on Saturday and Sunday.

371
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:30,312
We'd like to end our presentation here.

372
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:31,868
Thank you for your attention.

373
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,078
Thank you.

374
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:39,739
I can't wait to see your film.

375
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,762
You can now start filming.

376
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:46,582
You know this is a zombie movie, right?

377
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:49,697
So I want a lot of blood, but not the type that looks fake when splashed.

378
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,105
- Could you prepare that for me?
- Sure.

379
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:54,220
And if you need anything, just text me.

380
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,551
- Okay?
- Got it.

381
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:56,605
See you.

382
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:58,201
Hey.

383
00:30:58,201 --> 00:30:59,945
How about you try directing sometimes?

384
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:01,945
You have potential here.

385
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:03,498
Stop kidding.

386
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:04,853
Do you really want the project to fail or what?

387
00:31:08,353 --> 00:31:10,308
I feel like I'm a burden to you.

388
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:11,391
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,487
What burden, Mek?

390
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:16,789
If you really are one, I'd have called you out long ago.

391
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:18,445
Your duty is to direct.

392
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:19,945
Just focus on that.

393
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,491
One more thing,

394
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:22,720
we're doing this as a team

395
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,445
and we've already come so far.

396
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,262
Don't think too much.

397
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:28,445
This is not an individual project.

398
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:30,945
It's our project.

399
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:33,612
Oh...

400
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:36,766
Should we bring more people to help us?

401
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,193
The scope is pretty big.

402
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:39,662
Don't worry.

403
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,582
A lot of people are willing to help you.

404
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,563
Mek, our pre-proposal's just got approved.

405
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,445
Don't you feel happy about it?

406
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:06,245
Right.

407
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:07,404
Of course, I'm happy.

408
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,582
I already celebrated in the room.

409
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:09,664
And that's it?

410
00:32:10,945 --> 00:32:11,602
Yeah.

411
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:12,445
Let's go.

412
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:15,312
Let's go home to prepare for shooting.

413
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,556
I saw Mek usually picked you up.

414
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:28,624
Did I say something wrong?

415
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,960
Hello, Tim.

416
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,690
Hi.

417
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,230
You've just finished your class?

418
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:03,800
Yes.

419
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,387
So...

420
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,243
Are you by yourself?

421
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,205
Yes.

422
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,913
I mean...

423
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,186
Are you seeing anyone with me?

424
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Of course not.

425
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,582
I just thought that you're always with Mai.

426
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,847
I'm not used to seeing you alone. That's all.

427
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,394
Are you okay, Tim?

428
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:01,186
Did you and Mai have a fight?

429
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,970
He's just busy lately.

430
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,470
Also...

431
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,677
I guess it's partly because I treated him badly.

432
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,463
So...

433
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Did you do something that made him upset?

434
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,432
I don't really know what to say.

435
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,139
But Mai and me...

436
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,281
We will never be the same.

437
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,705
I think you're very lucky

438
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,366
to have a friend like Mai

439
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:48,149
who always takes care of you.

440
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,206
In a way that friends don't necessarily need to do.

441
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,621
Actually...

442
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,432
Mai didn't have to be friends with me.

443
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,526
When we were in school,

444
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,847
I didn't have any friends.

445
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,083
People often thought I was unapproachable.

446
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,960
But then there was Mai.

447
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,800
Perhaps he pitied me.

448
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,249
He invited me to play with him.

449
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:15,460
He talked to me.

450
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,092
He could also stand my fussy habits.

451
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,724
No one knows you better than Mai.

452
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,130
And no one knows Mai better than you.

453
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:31,488
Isn't it obvious...

454
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:33,337
that you can't live without each other?

455
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,632
But I think...

456
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,743
you may need to show Mai something

457
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,007
so he'll know that he's important to you.

458
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,809
Didn't realize this would become an advice-sharing session.

459
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,036
What about you?

460
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,007
Why are you all alone today?

461
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,309
I usually saw Mek picked you up.

462
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Did I say anything wrong?

463
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,470
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:07,451
It's alright, Tim.

465
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,960
I'm busy lately too.

466
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,073
As for Mek, he's busy with his thesis project.

467
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,083
That's why we are not hanging out together.

468
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,518
Mek and I...

469
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:29,630
We had some trouble.

470
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,667
I was wrong to say that to Mek.

471
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:40,423
Maybe Mek doesn't share the same feelings at all.

472
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,460
I just want it to be clear.

473
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,054
I don't want to be confused with my feelings.

474
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,705
But Mek didn't give me any response.

475
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,412
I don't really know...

476
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:01,960
why he reacted like that.

477
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Although he looks like a brat

478
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,923
and good for nothing,

479
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
when it comes to you...

480
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,432
I think he's serious.

481
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,960
He never gives up.

482
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,187
He might have his reasons for being this way.

483
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,960
You know, he said to me...

484
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,460
"Kim is mine."

485
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,111
"Don't you mess around with him."

486
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,073
"He's reserved for me only."

487
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,507
He really said that to me.

488
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,383
Just give him some time.

489
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,960
It's so hard, Tim.

490
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
I don't want to think about it anymore.

491
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,102
Screw him!

492
00:37:58,054 --> 00:37:59,667
I said what I said.

493
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,073
Now it's his turn to speak up.

494
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,960
I already embarrassed myself.

495
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,266
Speaking of which,

496
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,318
I need to apologize to you, Kim,

497
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,810
for making the situation even more...

498
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,584
...complicated.

499
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Not to mention that I wanted to win against him so much

500
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:24,073
that I ended up making you upset.

501
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,309
It's totally fine, Tim.

502
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,092
I was actually glad that you were a part of it.

503
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,790
To be honest,

504
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,488
I look up to you as my idol.

505
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:41,630
And about that time you made me upset...

506
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,460
It's nothing compared to what Mek is doing to me now.

507
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,149
Stop talking like that.

508
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,877
Hello, mom.

509
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:01,262
How are you, son?

510
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:02,432
Does studying make you tired?

511
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,111
Yeah, I'm so tired.

512
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,337
I barely have time to sleep
and now I look like crap.

513
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,460
I think you look as weary as before.

514
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:12,460
Mom!

515
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:14,725
What about Lee?
How is he doing?

516
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,218
I'm good, mom.

517
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:18,677
Good to hear that.

518
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:21,677
Lee, please take care of Park for me.

519
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,960
Always support each other, okay?

520
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:25,314
Sure, mom.

521
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:27,573
Please take care of yourself too.

522
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Don't lift anything too heavy.

523
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,168
Sure.

524
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Also, I miss your tamarind chili paste.

525
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,960
Can you send me some more?

526
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,130
Sure, I can make a ton for you.

527
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:43,790
You guys seem to be so close.

528
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,432
Of course, he's my son.

529
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,972
You're talking about me, right?

530
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,868
I'm talking about both of you.

531
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,564
I have to do the laundry.

532
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:53,960
If I don't stop talking now,
it's gonna go on forever.

533
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:56,460
Please be careful when you sit and stand up, mom.

534
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:57,960
I know. I know.

535
00:39:58,111 --> 00:40:00,224
You don't have to keep reminding me that I'm old.

536
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,743
Does he complain this much with you, Lee?

537
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,281
Not much, mom.

538
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:07,960
Because...

539
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:09,773
I do everything by myself.

540
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:11,302
Park!

541
00:40:11,302 --> 00:40:13,375
Okay, we gotta go. Bye!

542
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,564
She must be lonely.

543
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,054
Otherwise, she wouldn't call.

544
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,102
You don't come home often enough.

545
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,745
As you can see...

546
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:29,488
I'm super busy.

547
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,583
By the way...

548
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,743
Have you selected a photo to submit for the competition?

549
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,300
Not yet.

550
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,885
The deadline is approaching.

551
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:40,281
Come on. Let me help.

552
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,205
Which photo you think is good?

553
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,281
What about this photo?

554
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,073
The lighting is nice.

555
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
But I think this one's better.

556
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,564
It has you in it.

557
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,826
Are you sure?

558
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:01,205
I'm picking this one.

559
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,318
Because if I win...

560
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,130
I want to share the success with you.

561
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,263
Are we done selecting the photo?

562
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,471
I'm tired of the bed.

563
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:45,017
Where do you want to do it then?

564
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,567
Seeing you now makes me disappointed.

565
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,620
I don't understand why Kim even likes you.

566
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:06,961
Perhaps he has someone else in his heart now.

567
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:08,471
We should get our plan started now.

568
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,961
Let's give these stubborn guys a lesson.

569
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:38,042
Mek, why didn't you come down to dinner?

570
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,913
I kept calling your until my throat hurt.

571
00:42:39,913 --> 00:42:41,370
I said I was working.

572
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:47,070
How can you live in this condition?

573
00:42:52,713 --> 00:42:54,169
I thought everything was going fine.

574
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:55,756
How come it turned out this way?

575
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:58,170
Everybody is annoyed with you.

576
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,413
I know you're hesitating.

577
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:03,627
But sometimes, you don't need to think too much.

578
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:10,707
It's a serious matter.

579
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,762
I can't just think of it lightly.

580
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:14,842
You know, you're not that smart.

581
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:16,599
Using your brain wouldn't help much anyway.

582
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,499
Dao!

583
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,513
I mean...

584
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,414
You should stop thinking too much.

585
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:25,414
If you already use your brain and still can't find an answer,

586
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:27,199
maybe just follow your heart.

587
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:30,713
You're trying to educate me all of a sudden?

588
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:33,198
I said that because I pity you.

589
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:35,313
Seeing you now makes me disappointed.

590
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,342
I don't understand why Kim even likes you.

591
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,856
Perhaps he has someone else in his heart now.

592
00:43:41,256 --> 00:43:43,213
If he wants to be with someone else,
he'd have done that long ago.

593
00:43:43,213 --> 00:43:44,556
You wouldn't have a chance.

594
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:48,556
I wish you got some smart genes from our parents.

595
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:50,413
I tried to find a solution for you and now I'm so tired.

596
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:16,485
Park.

597
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:19,070
Do you think Mek can handle it?

598
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:21,428
He's looking like a sick puppy again.

599
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,514
I think...

600
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,857
He looks more like a zombie than a director.

601
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:31,569
Should we kickstart our plan now?

602
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:38,599
Are you sure it's a good idea?

603
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:42,713
I'm afraid that it will make him feel even worse.

604
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,156
I think we better start now.

605
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:47,670
I'm sick of seeing them not talking.

606
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:50,386
Both of them are so stubborn.

607
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:51,513
You're right.

608
00:44:52,113 --> 00:44:53,442
They're wasting time dancing around.

609
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:54,506
For what?

610
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:56,563
All they do is make us grew more and more anxious.

611
00:44:58,584 --> 00:44:59,405
I think...

612
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,269
we should get our plan started now.

613
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,913
Let's give these stubborn guys a lesson.

614
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,285
What!?

615
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,156
The actor can't come?

616
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:24,327
Okay, okay.

617
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:28,084
What's wrong? Who can't come?

618
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:29,927
The guy who'll play a zombie.

619
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:32,556
He got sick so he can't come today.

620
00:45:37,513 --> 00:45:38,670
What should we do?

621
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:41,670
We need a lot of people to play zombies to make it believable.

622
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,113
Mek, I'll call for some help.

623
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,540
That's nice. Thank you.

624
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,756
Please help make some calls right away.

625
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:50,662
ASAP.

626
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:51,321
Okay.

627
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:53,034
Damn it.

628
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:14,542
The actor is here.

629
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:29,899
Thank you for coming.

630
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:32,556
I never want us to separate.

631
00:46:32,742 --> 00:46:34,599
I want to take care of you like this forever,

632
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,971
but I can't do that from now on.

633
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,013
I can't choose.

634
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,599
- I gotta go.
- Why so hurry?

635
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,470
I'll hang out with Pete.
It'll be fun.

636
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:45,841
I've made up my mind.

637
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,185
Mek.

638
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:49,543
I have something to tell you.
