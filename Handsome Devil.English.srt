1
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,597
[teacher] Okay, lads, you've got 
ninety minutes. Any subject you like.

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,850
Your time starts now.

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,150
[Ned] We've all have one thing 
we're ashamed of,

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,486
the memory of one moment so embarrassing

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,655
we don't think we'll ever get over it.

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,950
A moment that still wakes us at 4 am...

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,369
sweating.

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,247
My terrible moment happened, 
because I was afraid.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,792
I was afraid because I lost the only 
true friend I'd ever known.

10
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,880
People do bad things out of fear.

11
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,766
For me, the good life ended when 
Mom died a few years back.

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,644
Suddenly Dad married Natalie, 
they were living in Dubai

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,063
and I was in boarding school,
in the middle of nowhere.

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,733
A school where rugby was a religion,

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,693
Where I was persecuted daily.

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,780
I mean, legally, you guys shouldn't be
able to force me to go to school.

17
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,656
Legally, I'm basically an adult.

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,034
You're basically an adult but
you're actually like sixteen.

19
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,369
Yes. Sixteen is your actual age.

20
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,664
Which is why the idea of us letting you
leave school is absurd.

21
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,708
So you're pretty much sending me to jail?

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,710
But even prisoners
make an effort to fit in.

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,921
They do jigsaws together,

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,381
play ping-pong with each other.

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,592
Could you please listen to yourself

26
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,260
for the briefest of moments?

27
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,261
-Excuse me?
-Ned,

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,055
conforming is part of being a grown up.

29
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,141
And letting you leave school early would
be sending you to jail, in a way.

30
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,644
Boys who leave school
at your age doom themselves

31
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,854
to a life of sweeping up
supermarket floors...

32
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,774
[Ned] Dad was obsessed with the guys 
who swept supermarket floors.

33
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,692
...and then crime, naturally.

34
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,779
Natalie, Adam Quinn's boy, he was
expelled from school last year

35
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,447
and now, apparently, he's a bum in Paris.

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,282
-No way. Really?
-Yes!

37
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,577
Reading his poetry on the Metro for money.

38
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,745
Practically begging.

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,456
It's desperately sad.
So just think about that.

40
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:07,502
[Ned] A bum... in Paris! 
I would have loved that.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,004
But was I bad enough to get expelled?

42
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,464
This year would tell.

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,924
[jazz music playing]

44
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,603
[school bell ringing]

45
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,736
[indistinct chatter]

46
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,373
[boy humming]

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,257
Got my own room! Magical.

48
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,676
Did-- did you just say you
have your own room?

49
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,678
No way. Let me see.

50
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,139
Oh...

51
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,142
[Ned] Ladies and gentlemen, 
my tormentor-in-chief.

52
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,393
Okay.

53
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,397
Maybe the reason you have
your own room is so...

54
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,567
nobody gets bummed, you know,
in the middle of the night.

55
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,111
And hello to you, Weasel.

56
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,821
I trust the summer treated you well?

57
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,200
"I trust the summer treated you well?"

58
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,536
-[all laughing]
-You are an utter bender!

59
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,873
Easy on this fucking lad!
I haven't seen you in ages.

60
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,416
All right.

61
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,210
[Ned] Back to jail.

62
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,964
And just like prison, if nobody 
likes who you really are

63
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,133
then, buddy, you better 
hide yourself away.

64
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,179
Here's an example: for English essays,

65
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:28,309
I stole the lyrics from obscure songs the
very old Mr. Fottrell would never know. 

66
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,936
But it was a private joke.

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,898
Nobody else knew the song - 
or cared one way or the other.

68
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,568
Everyone at Woodhill College
was obsessed with rugby.

69
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,905
And I didn't hate rugby, but what
happened if you didn't love it...

70
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,824
[boy cawing]

71
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,409
[all laughing]

72
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,203
Yeah... that sound means gay.

73
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:52,583
I have no idea why it means that,
but believe me... I heard it a lot.

74
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,877
-[teacher talking]
-[Ned] I should explain.

75
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,170
[teacher] ...you all recognize this...

76
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,298
[Ned] "Gay" means crap, bad or different.

77
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,884
And the fear of being in any way different

78
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,679
ran through our school from top to bottom.

79
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,389
...ask the lady to dance.

80
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,643
And then, you know, you get into a sort
of... remember...

81
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,062
Right? But do not do that, okay?

82
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,772
So, any questions?

83
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,525
[Ned] There were other kinds 
of schools, of course.

84
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,403
Cool, modern day schools 
where anything went.

85
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,779
But not here.

86
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,245
Today, we're going to be looking at...

87
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,832
[Ned] Talking about sexual identity 
to anyone in our school

88
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,625
that was like staring at the sun.

89
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,377
...any one have any idea?

90
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,380
[students laughing]

91
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,426
[Ned] It seemed you could be whoever 
you liked out in the world.

92
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,969
[boy moaning]

93
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,145
But our school wasn't a part of the world.

94
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,731
[Walter] Firstly, some sad news.

95
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,858
After a short illness,

96
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,404
our dear colleague and friend Glen
Fottrell has passed on.

97
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,322
[student] Get in!

98
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,741
[students cheering]

99
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,827
Students!

100
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,955
[Walter] Which will mean some
re-shuffling in the English department.

101
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,958
In honor of our recently
deceased English teacher,

102
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,004
one victorious student will
be chosen to represent the school

103
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,465
in the National Essay Writing Competition.

104
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,969
There is a first prize of five grand...

105
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,972
[all cheering]

106
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,434
...as a donation to the school.

107
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,727
[all disappointed]

108
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,980
Now... Rugby!

109
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,030
[Ned] Did you ever meet an adult 
who wishes they were a kid again?

110
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,074
That was our headmaster, Walter.

111
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,285
[all cheering]

112
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:58,126
This school has won seventeen Senior cups,

113
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,755
but it has been a long decade
since the last.

114
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,758
We have a fine crop of players.

115
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,887
And the entire school needs to support

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,810
our fantastic coach, Mr. Pascal O'Keeffe.

117
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,437
[Ned] As for this guy, well...

118
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,358
rumor had it Pascal's wife left him
because he was too obsessed with rugby.

119
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,406
And that... that's the guy
who changed everything.

120
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,120
[boy] Oh, let go!

121
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,913
[boy grunting]

122
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
[Lindy speaking indistinctly]

123
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,379
[Lindy] This is the perfect school for
Conor, what with it being sporty and...

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,008
Now young man.

125
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,135
Before we show your mother your digs,

126
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,262
I need you to promise me something.

127
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,224
I am told you left your old school for
repeated and persistent fighting.

128
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,310
We're happy to educate you,

129
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,104
as long as that kind of behavior remains
in your past. Understood?

130
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,940
Follow me.

131
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,279
Get out of that bin, Kennedy,
and cease your egregious play-act!

132
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,406
Yes, sir. Because it's all my fault.

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,866
-[boys snickering]
-[Walter] Apology accepted!

134
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,077
Our coach Pascal O'Keeffe
is a former pupil.

135
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,204
[Lindy] That's exciting!

136
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,915
We've a fantastic crop
of players this year.

137
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,709
[speaking Latin]

138
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,045
Just one more tilt to the title.

139
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,797
Training starts tomorrow.
Do not be late for Pascal.

140
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,383
A nice boy called Ned is in this room.

141
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,010
His parents live in Dubai.

142
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,893
[Lindy] What sort of a boy is Ned?

143
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,811
[Walter] A voracious reader.

144
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,442
Well I'll um...

145
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,320
leave you to say your farewells.

146
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,202
Honey, I'm sorry your Dad
didn't make it. He wanted to.

147
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
-He's just--
-Drunk.

148
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,580
He's busy. He's incredibly busy with work.

149
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,208
You know how hard
he works, it's flat out...

150
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,547
[whispering] Best of luck.

151
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,319
You okay, Miss?

152
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,003
Give me a second.

153
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,050
[Ned] I can't share with a guy like him.

154
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,760
[Walter] Ned, Ned, Ned...

155
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,805
You know, my time in the
Boy Scouts as a young man

156
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,849
was rewarding on so many levels.

157
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,268
Bivouacking, orienteering,

158
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,979
the nautical art of making knots.

159
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,481
And although I may not be able to remember

160
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,693
how to fashion a round-turn
and two half hitches,

161
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,447
I will never forget the lasting
bond of friendship that ensued.

162
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,907
Sir, the Geneva Convention--

163
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,951
My decision is final.

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,204
Leave.

165
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,752
[Ned] Yes, this was a blow,

166
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,755
but it wasn't as if the rugby team would 
be congregating in my bedroom.

167
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,674
[Spainer] We heard you were coming.
Yes, you're younger than us,

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,553
but Pascal says "If you're good
enough, you're old enough."

169
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,181
Look, Conor,

170
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,308
this is the last year for this
dream team, all right.

171
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,684
We all leave in the summer.

172
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,647
I've been captain twice and I'm not
allowed to repeat again, unfortunately.

173
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,858
So, we have to win this thing this year.

174
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,527
If I'm being honest with you,

175
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,863
I don't think the chance is gonna come
around again to this school.

176
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,742
Training starts tomorrow at six.

177
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,829
Do not be late. Seriously. Big no-no.

178
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,585
This is your roommate?

179
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,546
God, I was really starting to wonder
for a second, I mean...

180
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,176
this is a picture of two guys wearing the
face off each other, Conor.

181
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,678
-I mean - really?
-That's not mine.

182
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,434
Touch me, homo, and I call rape. Okay?

183
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,814
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Weasel, give it a rest.

184
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,818
Conor, you're gonna have to seriously
consider moving rooms, okay.

185
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,319
You're going to get AIDS in here.

186
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,073
We cannot have a teammate giving us
AIDS in the middle of a scrum.

187
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,951
Yeah - I'm not totally sure that's how the
HIV virus is transmitted?

188
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,119
And, go fuck yourself, Spainer.

189
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
And as for you...

190
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,790
You just made...

191
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,709
"Weasel's Shit List."

192
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,802
Coming?

193
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,821
[Walter] You were wondering if there's 
another room you can sleep in.

194
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,323
But what's wrong with
the room that you already have?

195
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,242
My roommate...

196
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,583
As a new boy, it can be...

197
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,796
it can be...

198
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,801
-It can be what?
-It's just...

199
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,305
You can be...

200
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,267
Go back to your room, Conor. Good man.

201
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,950
[Ned] The Berlin Wall was built overnight.

202
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,454
The world woke up the morning 
after and there it was.

203
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:13,209
Now, I'm no communist, but there's a lot
to be said for acting decisively.

204
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,300
[cows mooing]

205
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,388
[school bell ringing]

206
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,153
[boys chattering in class]

207
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,077
[Ned] Did you know lizards 
can regrow their tails?

208
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,539
That's how it was in our school 
with English teachers.

209
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,999
One dies, another grows in its place.

210
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,417
No big deal.

211
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,797
[boys chattering]

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,507
[Darren purring]

213
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,010
Darren Finnegan.

214
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,222
Did you make that absurd noise?

215
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,770
Age 16.

216
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,106
Birthday June.

217
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,775
Shoe size eight and a half.

218
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,111
Fan of Formula One car racing.

219
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,737
Allergic to milk,

220
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,865
and therefore all dairy surely.

221
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,745
Father - management consultant.

222
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,957
Mother a stay at home mom.

223
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,337
Bed-wetter I'd imagine
and a coward for sure.

224
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
Congratulations, Mr. Finnegan.

225
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,259
You are today's winner
of the witless tool competition.

226
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,303
Be gone.

227
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,888
[door closed hard]

228
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,726
Anyone else?

229
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,481
No?

230
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,276
Good.

231
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,903
How did I learn all
that stuff about Darren?

232
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,740
[whispering] I read it,

233
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,162
and I read about each
and every one of you similarly.

234
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,456
There is no limit...

235
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,458
to what you can learn...

236
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,918
from reading.

237
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,591
And with that in mind
I'm setting you an essay.

238
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:30,554
The essay is due on Friday,
and the title of the essay is...

239
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,765
"A Family Member."

240
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,604
And before you consider how dull,
how asinine the title of that essay is,

241
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,023
let me tell you I know how
dull and asinine it is

242
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,775
and I want you to own the dullness!

243
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,402
Reveal to me...

244
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,321
who you are,

245
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:49,990
if you dare.

246
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:57,206
In the meantime, we're going to be
reading Lord of the Flies, by Golding.

247
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,918
A cautionary tale about giving power
to an impressionable mass

248
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,462
of fragrant and unkempt urchins.

249
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,799
Not that that's ever going
to happen in my class.

250
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,594
Okay. Books open please, page one.

251
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,432
[boy reading] "The boy with fair
hair lowered himself down

252
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,684
the last few feet of rock.

253
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,894
and began to pick his way
toward the lagoon.

254
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,105
Though he had taken off his school sweater

255
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,356
and trailed it now from one hand,

256
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,816
his gray shirt stuck to him..."

257
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,569
[knocking on the door]

258
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,862
Go away!

259
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,239
Thank you.

260
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:32,991
Wow!

261
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,620
Uh, sorry, sir.

262
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,956
I thought you were a pupil.

263
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,958
No.

264
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,129
What's with the Berlin Wall?

265
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,297
That's a matter of necessity.

266
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,216
Right.

267
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,885
Who's your roommate?

268
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,221
Oh, uh, honestly, I don't know.

269
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,265
Right.

270
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,183
Well I've got a delivery for, uh...

271
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,189
No way you can make him feel welcome, huh?

272
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,735
Yeah, see he's a rugby player so believe
me, my friendship would be a hindrance.

273
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,654
That's quite a persecution complex
you've got going on there.

274
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,072
Thank you.

275
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,866
You gonna let me hear something?

276
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,492
Well, I can't play

277
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,870
and even if I could I don't think
I'd play anything you like.

278
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,289
[whispering] Just play something.

279
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,057
-Okay, so that's 'D.'
-That's 'D.'

280
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,396
-Is 'D' your only--
-D's my only chord, yeah.

281
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,481
I see. Okay, well...

282
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,609
Lift your finger up to that one.

283
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,944
There.

284
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,488
Yep. Now play.

285
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,076
[whispering] Now you know another chord.

286
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,745
See ya.

287
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,955
[door closes]

[guitar strumming]

290
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,797
[strumming between two chords]

291
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,934
Sir, I'm really, really sorry.
I know I'm late.

292
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,685
[stammering] It's just...
I couldn't find my boots.

293
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,313
I thought I put them in my bag and I
thought my bag was in my classroom.

294
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,690
-But--
-Conor, relax.

295
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,735
You're new. It happens.

296
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,446
The lads are running drills out there.

297
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,242
Get ready, I'll go out with you.
Get you introduced.

298
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,831
[Pascal] Once you cross
that white line, Conor,

299
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,458
I want you to concentrate
on just one thing.

300
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,045
Express yourself.

301
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,259
-Good to go?
-Yeah.

302
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,386
After you.

303
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,059
[two chords strumming]

304
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,526
Everyone, this is Conor.

305
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,737
Conor won the Junior Cup
with St. Bart's last year,

306
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,407
kicking nineteen points
in the final, was it?

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,494
I asked him up with us seniors
so he sees what we're made of.

308
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,663
Give him something to aspire to.

309
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,374
Also, give Wallace a bit of competition.

310
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,876
You've met our captain, Victor.

311
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,712
Apart from him far too many names to
remember but I'll give you the gist,

312
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,547
Kieth Chappy, prop.

313
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,216
Tom Quinlin, current place kicker.

314
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,719
We get our speed from this fella.

315
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,805
Scrum half one, two...

316
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,932
Chief wrecking ball.

317
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,021
Okay, line out, first against seconds.

318
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,480
Conor, play at 10 for the firsts.

319
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,026
-Wallace-- where's Wally?
-I'm here.

320
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,861

01:03:28,804 --> 01:03:30,765
-Go on, then.
-Everyone up.

963
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,975
Follow us to the gym.

964
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,811
[Ned] Compulsory cheerleading 
practice ahead of the final.

965
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,481
Pretty much the last place 
on earth I wanted to be.

966
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:53,454
[older student] We're ready to make
a little bit of history!

967
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,667
♪ Wood Hill College for the cup ♪ 

968
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:02,046
♪ We always play with honor 
Whenever we grow stronger... ♪ 

969
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:05,341
[Ned] Lyrically, these songs 
left a little to be desired.

970
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,637
But on this day - the lyrics 
weren't the problem.

971
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,931
It was what was behind them.

972
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,225
This wasn't my team.

973
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,526
And maybe the idea of getting expelled
began to surface once again.

974
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,695
Honestly, I don't remember.

975
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,531
[singing indistinctly]

976
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,830
Sing!

977
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,748
Fucking sing!

978
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,043
Sing!

979
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,171
Sing, you little queer!

980
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,550
[Ned] They wanted me to sing? 
I'd sing like a canary.

981
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,722
I had this big piece of news I could 
share - and what was I keeping it for?

982
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,600
There was nothing wrong with 
being different. I knew that.

983
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,728
And why did Conor get to be adored and
me bullied, and we're about the same?

984
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,105
Oh I'd tell them - I'd tell everyone.

985
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,650
Then they'd apologize. Then everyone
would be on my side for once.

986
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,777
Finally, now I had the conch!

987
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,362
I'll tell you who's gay -

988
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,074
-[feedback]
-oh I'll tell you who's gay all right...

989
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,622
Conor Masters is gay!

990
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,670
[Ned] There it is, folks.

991
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,299
A terrible memory.

992
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,218
Your parents are flying home
from Dubai tonight.

993
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,053
They'll be here first
thing in the morning.

994
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,181
Ned, I'm aware you haven't
had it easy in this school.

995
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,018
But grabbing a megaphone,
disrupting match preparations,

996
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,020
it crosses a line.

997
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,272
Am I expelled?

998
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,608
You'll sleep in the infirmary tonight.

999
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:29,944
We'll meet tomorrow morning at 8 am.

1000
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,574
I expected so much more from you, Ned.

1001
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,869
I expected compassion...

1002
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,789
towards a boy who was new,

1003
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,834
towards a boy who was always going to feel

1004
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,669
a little different than the rest of you.

1005
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,636
You, of all people, I thought
could empathize with that.

1006
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,934
Go on. Leave.

1007
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,235
[Ned] It's funny how it goes, isn't it?

1008
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,030
Now that I seemed to have achieved 
my goal of getting expelled,

1009
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,868
there was nothing I wanted more than to
go back to being a pupil in this school.

1010
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,002
Hey Conor.

1011
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:29,628
Can I talk to you?

1012
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,839
Yeah. Yeah, of course you can.

1013
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,343
Oh, I can't let you in here, sorry.

1014
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,304
Stupid regulations.

1015
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,348
Come on. We'll go for a walk.

1016
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,194
[Sherry] So...

1017
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,404
big day tomorrow, Conor.

1018
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,364
The first final in how long is it?

1019
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,991
Yeah, I can't do it.

1020
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,495
It's just nerves. You're a great player

1021
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,497
in a great team. You'll be fine.

1022
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,040
That's got nothing to do with it.

1023
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,585
Sir, I saw you, with your friend.

1024
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,170
You were together.

1025
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,180
So you saw me with
a friend, Conor. So what?

1026
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,435
Look, I know it's hard,

1027
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:31,857
I know.

1028
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,317
But...

1029
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,653
it gets better.

1030
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:37,279
Trust me.

1031
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,365
-When I'm older.
-Yeah, when you're older.

1032
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,117
Sad fact of life.

1033
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,994
So I'm just supposed to keep lying.

1034
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:44,912
It's not a lie.

1035
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,582
It's not necessarily lying if
you keep something to yourself.

1036
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,169
But if you pretend to be something
you're not, then that's a lie.

1037
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,839
Sir, I remember the lesson with Ned.

1038
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,591
I remember when you called him
out for plagiarizing that song.

1039
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:59,426
"Don't use a borrowed voice," you said.

1040
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,178
"Find your own voice." "Don't be a sheep."

1041
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,597
Sir, you said that lesson
wasn't just for Ned.

1042
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,433
You said it was for all of us.
So why am I exempt?

1043
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,352
Why am I different from everyone else?

1044
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,522
You can't be all things to all men,
Conor, at all times.

1045
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,941
-It's not smart.
-Why not?

1046
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,902
Sometimes you need to keep things
hidden away. To protect yourself.

1047
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,412
There will come a point in the future...

1048
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,123
when you won't have to lie anymore.

1049
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,666
Trust me.

1050
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:32,877
Will there?

1051
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:34,503
Yeah.

1052
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,299
And are you at that point?

1053
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,009
This isn't about me.

1054
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,308
It gets better.

1055
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,270
It gets better...

1056
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,193
That's all I can say to you.
Please believe me, Conor.

1057
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,906
How on earth can
I even begin to believe you?

1058
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,453
Come on, Conor...

1059
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,330
Conor...

1060
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,889
[Victor] Jesus Christ, Conor - it's 11:05!

1061
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:34,688
[Walter] We take this type
of transgression very seriously.

1062
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,149
We'll take the midterm to consider.

1063
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,485
But punishment will be severe.

1064
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,820
I appreciate all that, thank you.

1065
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,240
Tell me though, what
happened to my son's face?

1066
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,202
[Walter] Well, we can't get
an answer on that, I'm afraid.

1067
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,871
Ned?

1068
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:54,333
-Nothing happened.
-Something happened...

1069
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,170
This is nobody's fault but my own.

1070
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,049
More than anything, this is about
preserving the ethos of the school.

1071
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,676
[opening door suddenly] Sir...

1072
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,804
-Sorry...
-Wait outside, Victor.

1073
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,308
I can't, sir.

1074
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,310
Conor's gone missing.

1075
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,899
[Victor] He didn't stay
in his bed last night.

1076
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:20,943
He's gone.

1077
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:23,612
Well have you told Pascal--
I mean Mr. O'Keeffe?

1078
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,740
No. I thought I'd come to you first.

1079
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,410
Well tell Mr. O'Keeffe I want to see him
here. Immediately!

1080
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,577
Go on!

1081
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:31,704
Yes, sir.

1082
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:33,998
[door closing behind]

1083
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,470
Sir, Mr. Curly wants to see you.

1084
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,640
Victor - I thought you were
supposed to be Victor and Conor.

1085
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:52,850
Where's Conor?

1086
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:58,314
Sir, there was an incident yesterday, and
Conor-- he's gone missing.

1087
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,065
Okay - what do you mean "missing," Victor?

1088
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,276
Walter wants to see you, sir. Now.

1089
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,862
Walter wants to see me...

1090
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,115
[whispering] Of course this
has to happen today.

1091
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:10,326
Thank you, Victor.

1092
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,545
Hey, Pascal. Good luck today.

1093
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,505
Are you okay?

1094
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,217
You're delighted, Sherry, huh?

1095
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,678
Over the fucken moon, yeah!

1096
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:33,223
-Uh... what?
-Conor Masters, huh?

1097
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,392
Missing - on the day of the final...

1098
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,520
-Missing?
-Missing! Yes!

1099
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,355
What part of "missing"
don't you understand?

1100
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,411
[knocking on door]

1101
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,276
When we get back...

1102
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,445
can I please jump out in town?

1103
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,364
I really need to do something.

1104
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,533
You must be kidding...

1105
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:42,084
Look, Dad, I know I'm in trouble,

1106
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,253
but I wouldn't ask if it
wasn't absolutely vital.

1107
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,881
Not only are you not "jumping out," Ned,

1108
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,051
you are massively, unbelievably grounded

1109
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,011
until we can figure out
what to do with you.

1110
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,021
Tanner, feet down.

1111
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:06,984
Dan.

1112
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:14,366
I suppose you've
heard about Conor Masters.

1113
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,617
Yeah.

1114
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,620
His parents don't know where he is.

1115
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,498
Well, I've notified
the guards anyway, so...

1116
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,713
And we have an untested player at outhalf.

1117
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,717
And Wallace is - at best--

1118
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,844
Oh who cares about
the fucking rugby, Walter?

1119
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,681
Some boys don't play rugby.

1120
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,185
What about those boys?

1121
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,432
Ned! Ned!

1122
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:21,767
Fuck...

1123
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,487
[Ned] Conor was always running.

1124
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:37,991
I couldn't understand it, 
but now I finally got it.

1125
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,078
You have to know that you're 
running in the right direction.

1126
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,649
Men.

1127
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,154
You might be wondering
where our outhalf is.

1128
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,120
Earlier, as you know, I was called to Mr.
Curly's office

1129
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,080
and informed that the boy has...

1130
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,666
had some kind of breakdown,

1131
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,751
and has gone missing.

1132
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,462
Today of all days, I know...

1133
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:37,718
I don't know if you were aware of the
rumors swirling around,

1134
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:41,555
but it transpires that
he was dealing with...

1135
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,474
serious personal issues.

1136
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,686
Well he's missing today,
and I want to tell you this:

1137
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,066
we are way better off without him.

1138
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,695
I mean, we all have personal issues,

1139
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,156
but look around you!

1140
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,575
Anyone who can't be trusted

1141
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:05,412
to put those issues to one
side can't be part of a team.

1142
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,539
Yeah...

1143
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,003
We all have shit that we're
going through, you know.

1144
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:16,673
But do you run?

1145
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,385
No.

1146
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,348
You stay.

1147
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,602
You stay, and deal with your shit,

1148
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,437
by standing in a field

1149
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,649
blowing a whistle in the fucking rain!

1150
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,449
[indistinct cheering]

1151
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,485
Hello?

1152
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:11,788
Can I come in?

1153
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:13,957
What do you want?

1154
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,003
I want to apologize...

1155
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,505
for being a terrible friend.

1156
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,718
So you knew about me all along.

1157
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,096
I'm so sorry, Conor...

1158
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,645
I want you to play.

1159
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,189
There's still time.

1160
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,149
You said that that wasn't your team.

1161
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,526
You've never even seen us play before.

1162
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,570
Yeah look - I was wrong.

1163
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:48,074
Okay? Turns out I was wrong
about pretty much everything.

1164
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,204
Not everything...

1165
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,878
You don't have to pick a side, Conor.

1166
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,964
You don't have to be one thing or the
other. You can be everything.

1167
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,676
I'm not sure I can play for them.

1168
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,386
For Weasel.

1169
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,515
-For the Coach.
-It's not for them!

1170
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:15,477
You're not playing for them.
You're playing for us.

1171
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,522
It's my team if you're playing for it.

1172
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,650
Reveal to them who you are.

1173
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,402
If you dare...

1174
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:28,782
If you dare...

1175
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,623
Our team yeah.

1176
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:01,565
[referee blowing the whistle]

1177
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,335
Conor.

1178
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,255
What can we do for you?

1179
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,634
Late again. Sorry about that, lads...

1180
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,304
Your mind is shot, right?

1181
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:17,474
You're all over the place.
I understand that.

1182
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,894
How is it shot?

1183
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,313
Well... at this point...

1184
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,441
we all heard about the thing...

1185
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,110
The thing?

1186
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,154
The thing...

1187
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,698
-The thing?
-The thing! The thing! The thing!

1188
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:35,784
Lookit,

1189
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:37,494
it's not your fault,

1190
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,246
but you cannot fit into this team.

1191
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:43,166
-Since when?
-Since-- lookit, you're incompatible.

1192
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,043
Incompatible according to who?

1193
01:22:45,251 --> 01:22:46,252
Us.

1194
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,547
According to all of us.
Isn't that right, lads?

1195
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,597
I don't know if you heard
why I left my old school...

1196
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:03,019
Yeah. We heard you got in some fights.

1197
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,273
...and I don't know if you
heard why I was fighting.

1198
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,947
I was fighting everyone
who found out who I was.

1199
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,659
Every last one of them. But...

1200
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,328
they kept coming.

1201
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,874
I couldn't stop them coming,
and I couldn't fight them all.

1202
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,754
I couldn't stay and keep
denying it so I ran away,

1203
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:31,881
to our school...

1204
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:35,010
Thing is, lads...

1205
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,139
I'd like to stop running away, you know.

1206
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:41,099
I'm done with that.

1207
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,686
Thanks to Ned here...

1208
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,354
you all know who I am.

1209
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,858
I'm the same me I always
was and I really really

1210
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:51,860
really want to be a part of this team.

1211
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,657
I'm here, and I'm ready to play. So...

1212
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,784
if you want me on your side, just...

1213
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,125
Wallace has been

1214
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:10,420
filling in at ten and
doing a perfectly good job.

1215
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:13,006
-C'mon Pascal...
-No I haven't, Pascal.

1216
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:14,382
Believe in yourself, boy.

1217
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,802
I believe I'm fucking shit at out-half.

1218
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:20,555
I'm a winger and you know it.

1219
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,688
Come on, Pascal.
Just put Wallace on the wing.

1220
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,317
Well that's a pity, Victor, 'cos Wallace
has just put himself on the bench!

1221
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,278
There is one coach on this team.

1222
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,697
One voice. Not fifteen!

1223
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:39,199
You hear me?

1224
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,369
Do you hear me, Victor?

1225
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,631
Congratulations Victor,
you're off the team and all!

1226
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:06,559
Tom Quinlan, Keith Shafrey, you're both
subbed off, you pair of eejits.

1227
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,023
You pair of fucking tools.

1228
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:15,443
Lads, I'm sorry, but this lot have
ruined your hard work for the year.

1229
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,828
Anyone else walks over to that
side and they're gone too.

1230
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,379
I'll forfeit the game if I have to!

1231
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,798
I can do that!

1232
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:41,636
That's enough I said! You hear me?

1233
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,028
Ah, for fuck's sake.

1234
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,514
We all have that one
thing we're ashamed of.

1235
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,185
A memory of one moment so embarrassing

1236
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,562
we don't know if we'll
ever be able to forget it.

1237
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:38,443
Single moments when, not only do we
betray everyone around us,

1238
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:42,113
but we betray ourselves too
in the most terrible way.

1239
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,578
[Ned continues] Yes, 
we all have that moment.

1240
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:52,415
But the pain of remembering the
embarrassment begins to fade eventually,

1241
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:55,168
with the help of a good friend.

1242
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:01,758
I will never forget that 
game for as long as I live.

1243
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:05,595
Conor was everywhere. Everyone noticed it.

1244
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:08,097
The determination to shut people up.

1245
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,599
To prove them wrong.

1246
01:27:09,849 --> 01:27:12,727
What he was feeling spread 
throughout the team like a fever.

1247
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,605
People talked about it 
for months afterwards.

1248
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,611
-Conor's playing!
-Yeah. Young Ned found him.

1249
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:09,742
Well he's a good kid. Ned.

1250
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,042
Walter, this is Arthur.

1251
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,170
Hello, Arthur. Walter.

1252
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:25,174
Arthur's me fella.

1253
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,096
We're a bit of "an item."

1254
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,036
[Ned] Like I said...

1255
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:56,122
I don't think I'll ever be able
to get over the embarrassment

1256
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,790
and the shame of what I did.

1257
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:01,419
But in a way, some good
did come out of it...

1258
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:07,842
That year, everyone in school
learned the same lesson.

1259
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:10,845
Not to speak in a borrowed voice.

1260
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,460
[yelling indistinctly]

1261
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:51,636
[yelling indistinctly]

1262
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:38,850
You know, one single year before...

1263
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,562
I'd have given everything I owned
for that kick to be missed...

1264
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:47,525
[Ned] But people change...
