Well, they use high doses for Alzheimer's,

but it was developed
as a truth serum by the CIA.

He'll be nothing but pain.

it was a waste of time,

I'm not giving you the University.

I'm not going anywhere with you.

133
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,759
And Umbrella,
they don't care about a new world.

134
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,761
They want control.

135
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:52,640
And you, of all people, should know that
because it's been our whole lives.

136
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,438
I will die before I go back to that place.

I should have picked you.

And now,
I guess I just wanted to say goodbye.

-[Billie] The virus.

-You're immune.
-I'm not.

Sure, it moves slower,
but the clock's still ticking.

Right down to zero.

146
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,685
[Billie] I just wanted to see you again.

147
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,440
I like to think of you as a happy,

working hard partner who keeps
trying to talk you into having a family.

But then, I worry.

That just feels
a little too settled for Jade Wesker.

We intercepted a signal.

I need you to do.

But, you know, recently,
the one thing she can't get enough of…

00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,474
is literature.

he only cared about himself.

When I was out in the field,
for six months, I…

261
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,142
I had nothing to show for it.

262
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:58,690
So I told myself, stay, finish the job,
so you don't have to leave again.

Otherwise,
it all would have been for nothing.

268
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,501
And I didn't do that for me.
I did that for her.

You… went back?

00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,675
What do you mean, "I had to go back"?

271
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,344
At the bunker.

272

You don't get it. It…
This zero could control other zeros.

275
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,605
Okay. It could make them do things.

do you understand what that means?

Hey, remember when we read
A Midsummer Night's Dream?

305
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,182
And Shakespeare wrote that,

306
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,144
"The object of art
is to give life a shape."

307

-Yeah.
-[Arjun] Yeah.

308
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:29,109
Well, your mother's work is her art,
and it gives shape to her life.

309
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,486
And she'd be lost without it.

310
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,323
Is that why she's always gone?

311
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:43,206
When Mom was young,
her daddy tried to fix the world.

00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:50,338
But, instead, he made it much, much worse.

313
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,426
[Arjun] And your mother, she's spent
her whole life trying to make up for that.

314
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,136
For him.

315
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,181
That's not fair. She didn't do anything.

No, she didn't.

317

But it's the second most important thing
to know about her.

Good.

324
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,328
Because I'm going to have
all your portions.

325

What do you think about that, huh?

[Amrita] We haven't really told anyone.

Good. That fear, the adrenaline?

It is.

384
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,342
I never wanted kids.

385
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:51,306
I was… young and alone.

386
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:58,062
It was the hardest, best thing.

387
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,693
[Jade] Amrita.

388
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,321
I'm so happy for you.

00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,409
-So, ready to bust it out?
-Let's do it.

390
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:17,749
-What's so special about this lovely lady?
-She could control other zeros.

391
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,542
How?

392
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:23,004
Well, we always knew
the virus would evolve.

393
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,049
But zeros can't see. Most can't hear.

394
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,509
So if she was communicating…

395
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,594
It was through smell.

396
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,096
A pheromone maybe. On her breath.

397
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,811
This gland, right here.

[Jade] All right, the zero's cells
are putting out two distinct enzymes.

But…

Exposure to oxygen breaks them down.

409
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,363
Maybe they have to be mixed
with something?

410
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,031
Like?

413
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:42,542
[Jade] Okay. And what's that?
Uh, water, electrolytes, mucus…

414
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,670
[Amrita] Amylase, lipase,
IgA, and lysozymes.

415
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,422
But the ratios…

416
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,799
There are thousands
of possible combinations.

417

00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,177
Well, I think we're all dedicated

475
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,472
to collecting everything we can
from our past

476

and preserving it
in our collective memory,

because that is what the arts were
in their most ancient beginnings.

478

It was a way to imprint deep,
emotional stories on our souls.

we are the stories we tell.

It's like a… a smell.

And when zeros smell it,
they can't hurt you.

If we put this on people
on the ship, on entire cities,

we could build a whole new world,

and you can do anything you want.

That's the world I want for you, Bea.
