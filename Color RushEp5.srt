(Color Rush, Episode 5)

4
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:25,217
Yoo Han won't make it today.

5
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:26,878
Why are you telling me that?

6
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:28,418
He wanted me to.

7
00:00:29,717 --> 00:00:31,217
He didn't say it in a way...

8
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:32,717
that made me want to relay the message,

9
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,128
but that's what he wanted you to know.

10
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:38,697
He could've told me himself.

11
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,498
Why go through Joo Haeng?

12
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:42,668
- Choi Yeon Woo! - Let go of me!

13
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:45,897
What's your problem?

14
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,007
It just crossed my mind...

15
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:52,238
that I want to keep you forever.

16
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,318
He must be avoiding me.

17
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,747
He realized the danger of mono.

18
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,617
It's not like I wanted to know,

19
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:05,117
but he orders me around because I'm the class leader.

20
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,458
I honestly didn't want to know.

21
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,527
Having the wrong kind of friend can be such a nuisance.

22
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:14,768
Yeon Woo, can you grab this for us? Come on.

23
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:16,227
Come on over.

24
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:21,438
- Like this? - Yes.

25
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,878
Let me see.

26
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:31,878
What do you think? Perfect, right?

27
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:34,117
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:36,788
This is what makes Joo Haeng class leader material.

29
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:38,387
Of course.

30
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,027
Attention, everyone.

31
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:45,958
Today, we'll study Korean poems.

00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,428
Please turn to page 171.

33
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,697
Joo Haeng, wake him up, will you?

34
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:55,707
Forget it. Turn to page 171.

35
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,177
Joo Haeng, go ahead and recite this poem.

36
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,137
- Talk about loyal friends. - Sure.

37

(Sangsang High School)

38
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,447
A day without Go Yoo Han...

39
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,058
was quiet and peaceful.

40
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,457
Actually, it was boring.

41
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,327
When he'd spew nonsense,

42
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:24,998
all I wanted was for him to go away.

43
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,207
I must've grown accustomed to it...

44
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,177
considering how I was bored today.

45
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,188
When I walked around the schoolyard...

46
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:44,088
during lunch break,

47
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,257
the quietness surrounding me felt odd.

48
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,357
I felt nervous as if...

49
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:51,797
I had put off something important to do.

50
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,637
Yeon Woo. Choi Yeon Woo.

51
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,368
My Yeon Woo.

52
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,408
My Yeon Woo's the softest.

53
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,577
Have you ever had fun with colors?

54
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,677
No. Why do you ask?

55
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:11,947
(No. Why do you ask?)

56
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,417
How can one even play with colors?

57
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,158
I hated the feeling of loss when the colors fade away...

58
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,528
more than not being able to see them at all.

59
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:26,757
How can Go Yoo Han leave me after forcing his way into my life?

62
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:36,908
Let's see an exhibition.

(Yoo Han)

64
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,757
I wanted to see this with you.

65
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,517
It's a media art exhibition.

66
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,528
Where flowers become you and you become flowers.

67
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,898
Let me escort you to that very world.

68
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,227
What on earth?

69
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:18,477
Yeon Woo, we'll now enter a starlit space.

70
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:28,317
(Recording Time)

71
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,388
Will you be able to handle the blackout today?

72
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,088
I won't.

73
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,997
I'll stay strong no matter what.

74
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:39,857
Fine.

75
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:43,398
Where flowers become you and you become flowers.

76
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:45,797
Let me escort you there.

77
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,237
It's beautiful.

78
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:53,927
Even if I become dependent on my probe,

79
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,067
even if I follow in the footsteps of other monos...

80
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,598
who turn into criminals,

81
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,138
I still want to see the colors.

82
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,867
That is what I desire.

83
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:35,508
- How will you get home? - Me? I'm taking the bus.

84
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:40,408
Thank you for inviting me to this exhibition today.

85
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:44,478
For finding this exhibition, bringing me here,

86
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:47,788
letting me see the colors, and explaining them to me.

87
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,587
Get home safely then.

88
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:53,388
Can probes read their monos' minds?

89
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,888
Hey, let me come home with you today.

90
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,927
Darn, he's irresistible. No way.

91
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,128
Pretend like you didn't hear him.

92
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:03,228
- Is your aunt home? - No.

93
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:05,597
What the... What did I just say?

94
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:07,337
Then, what about your dad?

95
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:09,437
- He's not home either. - It'll be just you and me then.

96
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:12,608
He already knows that I don't have a mother.

97
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,408
How much do you know about me?

98
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,108
Yoo Han.

99
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:18,518
Go ahead.

100
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:21,917
If I let you come home with me,

101
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:24,788
will you grant me a wish?

102
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:26,618
It'll be my command.

103
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:37,297
Hurry up, will you? I'm starving.

104
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,837
Let's eat ramyeon for dinner. It's what I'm craving.

105
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:42,038
- What is he saying? - Come on!

106
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,878
- Ramyeon? Are you kidding me? - Hurry.

107
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,307
Is this fair lady...

108
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:52,248
your mother?

109
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,217
What are you doing?

110
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,817
Chill out. The painting called for me.

111
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:05,557
Yeon Woo, take a seat.

112
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,128
Let's look at it together.

113
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:13,567
My mom...

114
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:15,738
Yes?

115
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,707
She disappeared four years ago.

116
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,978
Truth be told, I saw the missing person flyer.

117
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:27,018
She looked familiar in a way.

118
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:28,587
It was you I saw in her.

119
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:32,618
I want to take a proper look at it.

120
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:36,488
I want to see the colors my dad used to paint it.

121
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:38,898
That's my wish.

122
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,427
Don't cry.

123
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:44,567
I'll let you see it. It's what I'm here for anyway.

124
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:02,947
Yeon Woo.

125
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,087
Stay strong.

126
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:09,927
Come on.

127
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,908
Sky-blue...

128
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,778
A sky-blue dress.

129
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:29,378
Mom...

130
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,347
Brown shoes.

131
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,488
Red lips.

132
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,817
Yellow...

133
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,557
Your headband was in yellow, Mom.

134
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:49,268
I can finally see your true smile.

135
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,437
This is the aura you have.

136
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,008
Where are you, Mom?

137
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,538
I can tell you everything now.

138
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,778
I can teach you all the colors.

139
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:17,628
Mom said that she and I saw the world...

140
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,297
in the same way.

141
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:22,498
She told me that the world isn't just a shade of gray,

142
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,898
but consisted of many beautiful colors.

143
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,738
I'll be the key to your colors.

144
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:33,937
I'm right here for you.

145
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,707
I'll be the key to your colors.

146
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,158
Why are you...

147
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:48,087
so handsome?

148
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:18,217
Yeon Woo.

149
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,118
Are you all right?

150
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,087
Doesn't your head hurt?

151
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,628
It does.

152
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:40,207
Yeon Woo, get behind me.
