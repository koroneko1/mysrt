Nine million pounds, is that all?

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,200
Uh, well, it would be the largest domestic
insurance settlement for 20 years.

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Uh, two million for the Jaguar,
four for the artworks,

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,000
and a… further three million
for general damage to the house.

And get this,
it only turns out to be his own house.

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,800
It's full of all this art, you know,
Mondrians and Kandinskys or something.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,360
It's all bollocks to me, anyway.
But, you name it, he's got it.

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,640
And every single
one was a worthless fake. I kid you not.

Turns out it was all one gigantic
insurance fraud.

[inmate] What?

72

Oh, yes.

Hello, Sir. How are you doing?
Under the… circumstances.

79
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,720
Well, it's taken a bit of
getting used to, to be honest.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,040
But actually, everyone's
been really friendly.

Well, they sold it to me as a Sickert,
but I suspected it was actually a Degas.

[chuckles] Christian, darling,
there's someone at the door.

Turns out I was right.

Now I insured it for 15 million.

in connection
with burglaries at your house.

98

What suspicious insurance claims?

99

insured it for millions, then paid

103

a criminal gang to steal it from his own
house, and he pocketed the insurance.

in recognition of your action,
