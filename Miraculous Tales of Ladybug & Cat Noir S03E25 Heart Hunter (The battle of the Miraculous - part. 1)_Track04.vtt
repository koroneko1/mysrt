<i>Some people lose their first love,</i>

<i>some lose the harmony</i>
<i>in their relationship.</i>

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.820
The decorations are spot on,
aren't they, dear?

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.380
They're ridiculous, utterly ridiculous!
They're fired!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.500
<i>Some people lose hope.</i>
<i>Others lose patience.</i>

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.340
Oh, by the way, I didn't tell you, did I?
I have a girlfriend!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.860
-Really? That's so awesome!
-No, it's not awesome at all.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.620
I just said that to make you jealous.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.460
I can't be in love with you,
Cat Noir, you know that.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.140
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.860
But it still hurts.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.820
<i>While others lose their soul,</i>

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.060
<i>some lose their certainties.</i>

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.420
Ah! You've finally realized

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.620
there's more than just one type of cheese
in the world!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.980
<i>And some have nothing to lose.</i>

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.940
Thanks.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.580
That's it! I got it!
Got to go! Enjoy your meal!

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.820
Yes, Dad, I do know
where the Grand Paris Hotel is!

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.500
Me? Late? I'm never late!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.740
OK, yeah, sure.
But this time I won't be late! Promise!

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.100
-What are you doing here?
-I've been thinking of you,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.140
and I think I've found your melody.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.100
The tune that matches you completely.
Wanna hear it?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.980
-What do you think?
-Wow. It's... it's incredible!

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.460
Hmm.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.820
It's still not quite right.
I can do better.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.380
I'm gonna work on it some more.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.020
Yeah, Dad. I'm on my way.
Sorry, I... I gotta go.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.540
Thanks, Luka.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.420
I'll find the perfect tune for your song!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.940
<i>Audrey and André,</i>
<i>on this most solemn day, in celebration</i>

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.500
<i>of your anniversary,</i>

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.780
<i>I am delighted</i>
<i>to offer this magnificent gift</i>

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.540
<i>I personally designed for you.</i>

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.540
-Hi.
<i>-My dearest Mr. and Mrs. Bourgeois,</i>

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.180
<i>I hereby present you</i>
<i>the Gabriel Couple Cloak,</i>

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.980
<i>a symbol of eternal love and bonds</i>

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.100
<i>of marriage!</i>

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.980
Ouch! You're stepping on my feet!

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.100
Thank you, Gabriel. It's... it's...

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.420
Hideous on you! Ugh! Utterly hideous!

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.300
You wearing it is an insult
to this piece of art!

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.220
Over here!

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.460
-Oh!

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.340
We're not leaving.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.700
We're just gonna help a friend out
over at the buffet.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.620
Thanks, but don't miss
the ceremony because of me!

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.380
Are you kidding?
We can't wait to get away!

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.900
It's a good thing you're as clumsy
as they are boring!

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.460
Could you get rid
of the empty trays for us, please?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.700
Uh... Can we help you? Please?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.900
-All right.
-And before you head back home,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.220
could you bring us some drink umbrellas?

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.060
They're in the kitchen. Thanks.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.700
I'm sure you'd all like to know the secret

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.340
behind our long-lasting marriage,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.140
-and well, the secret is--
-Distance! Give me that!

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.020
It's supposed to be a cloak for couples!

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.500
Don't be ridiculous! Give me that!

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.380
Nooroo, dark wings rise!

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.940
Ha-ha! Touché!

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.340
I didn't feel a thing!

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.860
Yeah, right! Straight to the heart!

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.540
The children haven't returned.
Where have they gone?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.140
Stop embarrassing me
in the whole world of fashion!

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.980
-Take that!
-Hmm!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.180
Are you looking for something?

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.500
-Phew!
- Thanks, Marinette!

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.260
OK. I better get going.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.660
I have to take these umbrellas back to--

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.420
-No, wait!
-Please, escape with us!

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.220
Huh?

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.140
Being disobedient is really entertaining.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.820
I've never had so much fun in my life.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.460
-Are you kidding?
-No, why?

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.580
No reason!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.700
You should have seen your face, Kagami!

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.580
Hey!

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.740
Wow! It's the first time
I've seen with your hair down.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.580
You should see your face, Marinette!

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.100
-Phase two is in place, sir.
-Perfect!

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.260
The ultimate battle
of the Miraculous may begin!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.860
You're so ridiculous!
Everything here is ridiculous!

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.420
-I'm going back to New York!
-Right! Leave us again!

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.140
I'd be more than happy to book you a seat
on the next flight myself this time!

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.140
Love stories don't always have
a happy ending.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.700
They bring out
so many uncontrollable emotions.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.540
Isn't that right, my pretty akuma?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.740
Fly away and evilise their scarred hearts!

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.260
-Your hair looks beautiful!
-She's right!

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.460
I hate you!

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.220
Heart Hunter, I am Hawk Moth!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.380
So, you no longer believe in love?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.740
Well, I'm giving you
the power to destroy it!

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.900
And wherever it is,
whatever its form, devour it!

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.060
All I ask in return are Ladybug
and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.740
Now, feast on love!

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.980
It makes my mouth water
just thinking of it!

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.900
Daddy? Mom?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.500
I am the most powerful
of all the supervillains!

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.220
No, I am! You're just super annoying!

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.460
Oh! They're so in love!

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.340
Oh! My bee-signal!
I gotta let Ladybug know!

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.820
Chloé! My princess!

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.860
You're going to give us all your love!

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.140
Nuh-uh! Sorry. No way.
I don't love anyone!

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.580
-Of course you do, darling!
-You love yourself!

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.060
Hey, hold up, Heartbreakers!
I'm not in a relationship, OK?

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.100
True. But you do love music,
your fans and... that!

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.740
Duusuu, spread my feathers.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.420
My bee-signal!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.740
Who did this?

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.620
Everything is going as planned, Hawk Moth.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.500
I think we're far enough away now!

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.420
Won't you get in trouble
with your parents?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.100
It's not every day we can escape
from everything they expect of us.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.300
What should we do now?

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.420
<i>♪ My name's André ♪</i>

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.020
<i>♪ André Glacier! ♪</i>

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.860
<i>♪ The sweethearts' matchmaker! ♪</i>

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.420
Let's get some ice cream from André!

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.740
André is the sweethearts' ice-cream maker.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.740
The legend says that whoever shares
his ice cream together

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.580
will be in love forever.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.300
I don't believe in those kinds of myths.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.860
But I do believe in ice cream!

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.260
Which flavors for these two? Hmm...

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.860
Orange and peppermint!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.140
A perfect pairing that's always a success.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.460
Nothing could turn it into a mess.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.020
And for you two,
blackberry and peppermint!

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.220
An explosive mix and that's a fact!

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.860
But oftentimes
it's the opposites that attract!

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.300
Orange and blackberry,
quite unusual, it's true.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.340
Not the most obvious,
but it works for you two!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.140
-So, what will it be?
-You pick!

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.420
-I don't get what he's saying.
-Yeah, you pick. We trust you.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.020
Er... Can't you find a blend
for the three of us?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.420
I can. But too many flavors mixed together

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.220
may throw off the delicate balance!

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.660
Uh... I don't know.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.100
Blackberry and peppermint
doesn't seem great.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.500
What if the mint finds the berry lame
and wants to be with the orange instead?

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.900
And it's true that orange and peppermint
are awesome together,

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.460
and orange and blackberry

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.620
just doesn't seem like they go together.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.820
Look,
I think your first idea was the best.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.380
The orange and peppermint ice cream for...

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.180
for my friends here.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.900
Are you sure, Marinette?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.420
I'm gonna head back to the palace.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.180
I told my parents I'd bring them back
those cocktail umbrellas.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.340
-We'll go with you.
-No, no. Don't bother.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.940
Enjoy your ice cream, seriously.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.700
-Where's Marinette?
-She left.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.300
Stop, in the name of the law!

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.020
This love of the city is so delectable!

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.180
And these lovebirds! What a treat!

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.460
Time to transform!

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.660
Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.380
I wish I didn't have
to involve you with this.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.260
I want to be here. I want to help you.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.300
I cannot wait, Ladybug!

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.380
-There she is.
-You love everyone.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.380
You're going to make a first-rate dinner!

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.820
And for dessert? The cat!

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.900
I'm sure he's very tasty!

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.140
It's always the same.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.860
Whenever she's backed up against a wall,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.780
Ladybug engages others
to fight by her side.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.300
I'm convinced
the Guardian of the Miraculous

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.740
is who she seeks every time.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.940
Where are you Cat Noir?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.980
OK. Lucky charm!

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.420
A token for a merry-go-round? Hmm.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.540
Yoo-hoo!

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.260
Bring me my Miraculous, Ladybug.
I'm waiting for you!

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.740
Mayura!

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.740
Bye-bye, little bird!

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.180
Focus, Ladybug! Focus!

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.660
Master Fu! I need your help!

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.780
This costume is very cute, Miss.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.500
But is it really fitting in this place?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.620
I forgot to transform back!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.300
I haven't been followed, Master.
I'm sure of it!

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.580
Ladybug, if you'd like
to have a turn on the merry-go-round,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.100
please pick your favorite horse.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.460
Once the mission is over,
you'll retrieve the Miraculous

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.660
and return it back to me.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.420
<i>Bring me my Miraculous, Ladybug.</i>

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.260
<i>I'm waiting for you!</i>

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.580
The Dragon?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.020
Are you sure?

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.340
Uh... Yes, I'm certain.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.820
- My dear Guardian!

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.740
What a pleasure it is to finally meet you!

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.540
I'm honored that you've chosen me,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.660
but I thought you couldn't give me
this Miraculous again

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.860
-since Hawk Moth knows my identity.
-There's no time!

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.900
I need your exceptional talent!

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.900
Plagg, claws out!

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.540
Don't look at me.
I have to transform back!

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.020
My kwami needs to refuel. Spots off!

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.940
I hope I didn't interrupt anything with...

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.540
that boy.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.540
You did turn up a little unexpectedly.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.980
I'm honored to see you again, Kagami-San!

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.140
We're about to accomplish
great things together!

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.860
Honor is mine, Longg-sama!

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.180
The boy's famous, isn't he?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.820
You're bound to break a lot of hearts.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.820
There's only one person
I don't want to hurt.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.780
Marinette.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.100
She's the only other friend I have.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.180
But Adrien and I are made for each other.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.340
We're so alike.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.900
I can't give him up,
even for the sake of friendship.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.540
Sometimes, choices can be so hard.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.060
We have a mission to do.
Longg, bring the storm!

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.340
Tikki, spots on!

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.100
You're powerless against me, old man,
and Ladybug isn't here to protect you.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.380
Tell me the secret identities
of Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.420
-Never!
-Then help me get

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.660
their Miraculous and I won't harm you.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.860
You're not getting anything from me!

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.180
-Wayzz!
-It's too dangerous, Master!

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.060
-You're too old for this!
-Shell on!

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.980
Very impressive!

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.380
- Shell-ter!

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.420
You're on borrowed time,
you crazy old man.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.300
I'll wait for you to transform back!

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.020
My powers are no more
time-sensitive than yours!

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.500
Obviously you haven't learned anything
about the Miraculous.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.860
I've learned enough to defeat you!

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.740
The end of superheroes has come.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.580
You talk a lot,
but you haven't achieved much so far!

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.420
Your defeat
will be my greatest achievement!

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.460
Huh?

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.020
What about me?
You were supposed to give me a Miraculous!

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.500
This is ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.700
They're <i>my</i> parents, you know.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.820
So I should be the one to save them!

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.420
Ladybug, how nice of you to bring a guest!

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.820
Ryuko, as amazing and daring
as I remember!

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.580
Nice to see you again too, Cat Noir.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.740
Is this one of your
"try to make me jealous move" again ?

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.900
This cat is very much in love!

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.060
Wind dragon!

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.540
-Thank you, Ladybug.
-Not calling me milady anymore?

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.940
-Huh? Of course! I...

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.180
Wait a second.
Are you jealous of Ryuko right now?

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.820
Of course not! Pff!

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.820
Chloé Bourgeois, rejections hurt!

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.980
Your talents deserve to be recognized!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.900
Ladybug and Cat Noir's reign
has gone on long enough.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.980
It's time for Paris to have a new Queen.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.420
And the Queen on my chessboard... is you!

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.300
You've akumatised my parents!

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.140
If I had my Miraculous, I'd--

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.900
You're right,
but I did it for one reason only.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.940
So that you would finally realize

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.100
that Ladybug will never give you
the Bee Miraculous again.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.500
I, however, always keep my promises.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.180
This isn't real. How do you have it?

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.820
Try it and see for yourself.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.220
You're Ladybug's greatest fan.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.980
You've helped her, you've trusted her.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.620
And what has she done for you in return?

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.340
Nothing! She couldn't care less about me!

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.300
I'm done with her. She's irrelevant.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.700
Utterly irrelevant!

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.940
I want you
to de-akumatise my parents first.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.060
Whatever you say, my Queen.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.500
-Majesty, wait!
- Silence!

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.460
You will speak only when spoken to.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.180
Your loss, Ladybug. Pollen, buzz on!

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.940
Lucky charm!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.420
Cat Noir, give me your belt
and cataclysm the street lamp!

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.900
Ryuko, go to the left, and--

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.540
Huh, was I dreaming or did Heart Hunter
just get de-akumatised all by itself?

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.740
Why would Hawk Moth do that?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.860
I'll ask Master Fu!

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.180
Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.820
See? I kept my word.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.260
Your parents are free.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.220
And now I can use a new akuma
to make your powers

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.180
even stronger, my Queen.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.100
Miracle Queen, I'm giving you
the power to reign over Paris

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.180
and command your very own army
of superheroes!

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.620
All I ask you in return--

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.820
Cat Noir and Ladybug's Miraculous.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.020
You shall have them.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.380
As soon as I crush those heroes!

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.660
Longg, open sky!

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.180
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.220
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.300
Don't worry, Marinette.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.300
Master Fu is very wise.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.460
If anything has happened,
he'd know what to do.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.500
But Tikki, if anything's happened to him,
it's because of me.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.220
Kagami!

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.820
Is everything OK?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.100
What happened with Ladybug?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.820
She took me away to...

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.300
protect us.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.980
Because the monster
she was battling against was attacking

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.340
people in love.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.820
-People in love?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.340
Are you OK, Marinette?

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.420
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.580
Actually, no. I'm not fine at all!

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.300
I'm so tired of all the responsibilities,

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.940
of having to put up a front all the time!

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.060
Of never being able to be who I truly am.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.020
It's all right, Marinette.
You can tell me everything.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.860
Or nothing, if you prefer.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.180
You can be yourself with me, you know.
Just yourself.
