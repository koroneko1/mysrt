<i>‎Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>
<i>‎The mayor of Paris</i>

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.380
<i>‎will be unveiling</i>
<i>‎the StarTrain at the Gare du Nord.</i>

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.620
<i>‎This modern train will travel between</i>
<i>‎France and the UK at record speeds.</i>

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.140
<i>‎-Faster than flying by plane!</i>
‎-But how will the train cross the sea

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.260
‎-between France and the UK, Marinette?
‎-There's a tunnel under the Channel.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.700
‎Did a superhero do that?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.380
‎No, just regular men.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.140
‎It's amazing how many inventions
‎have been made since I last had an owner.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.660
‎-There's no stopping progress.
‎-There's no stopping you either!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.900
‎-This is going to be a wonderful sweater!
‎-It's a tradition.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.940
‎I always knit my dad a sweater
‎every year for his birthday.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.660
‎I wanted to do something
‎extra special for him,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.540
‎-but I couldn't think of anything.
‎-You'll come up with the perfect idea.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.580
‎-You always do!
‎-I'd better think of it now.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.220
‎'Cause his birthday is today!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.060
‎Oh, come on now.
‎It really is a shame, Roland!

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
‎It's your son's 40th birthday
‎today and I know how much Tom

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.500
‎would love it if you--

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.500
‎-Oh!
‎-Was that my grandfather again?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.820
‎-Yes.
‎-So he's definitely not coming then?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.020
‎I did everything I could.
‎It would have made your dad so happy!

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.660
‎He doesn't talk openly about his feelings,
‎but I know he's sad

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.460
‎he doesn't see his own father any more.
‎It's a shame!

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.660
‎-I'd really like to meet him some day too!
‎-He hasn't seen anyone for 20 years.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.980
‎-I know. But why not?
‎-Uh, he's a little old-fashioned

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.100
‎in his ways, he is not exactly
‎what you'd call "modern".

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.780
‎-But what happened 20 years ago?
‎-Ah, well, it's complicated.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.940
‎If you really want to know more about it,
‎you should probably ask your dad!

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.580
‎Hey, Dad! Why hasn't Grandpa
‎left his house in 20 years?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.420
‎Oh! Well, because he's very fond
‎of tradition... and... uh...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.300
‎if you want to know more about it,
‎you should probably ask Grandma.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.540
<i>‎He's always lived in the past.</i>
<i>‎Well, it's complicated.</i>

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.100
<i>‎If you really want to know about it,</i>
<i>‎you should ask your dad or your mom.</i>

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.900
‎Ugh! OK. Thanks, Grandma. See you tonight!

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.060
‎Argh! Seriously,
‎why won't anyone just answer me?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.820
‎I'm thinking
‎you've come up with your idea!

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.220
‎You're right. I know
‎what I'm getting Dad for his birthday!

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.100
‎I'll get him and his dad
‎back together again!

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.060
‎I've found
‎Roland Dupain's address! Let's go!

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220
‎-What are you waiting for?
‎-If I tell him who I am,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.540
‎he won't listen to me, just like with Mom!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.420
‎ What do you want?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.900
‎Uh... I'm... a... friend!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.380
‎I don't have any friends!

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.940
‎This won't be easy!

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.740
‎ What do you want?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.780
‎Hello, sir! It's the mail lady!

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.500
‎Do what you usually do.
‎Throw the mail in the trash!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.580
‎ What do you want?

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.980
‎It's for the firefighters' calendar!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.780
‎Ah, toss it in the fire! I hate calendars!

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.300
‎There's no use. It's hopeless.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.260
‎Come on. That's not the Marinette
‎I know, giving up so easily!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.380
‎-What do you want?
‎-Your flour's here.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.380
‎Oh, come in! Come in! It's open.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.700
‎Hello! I'm Marinette.
‎Mr Dupain's granddaughter.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.460
‎I was just about to go in myself.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.580
‎I'll bring him the sack.
‎It'll be a nice surprise!

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.740
‎-Roland has a granddaughter?
‎-He sure does!

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.340
‎-I should probably help you!
‎-No, no! It's... light!

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.660
‎Could I borrow your cap?
‎I want to play a prank on Grandpa!

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.580
‎Say "Hi" to Roland for me!
‎I'll grab my cap next time I come by!

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.980
‎You sure you should be sneaking in,
‎pretending to be someone else?

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.260
‎You've never met him.
‎You don't know how he'll react.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.580
‎Well, it's not exactly a lie. After all,
‎I am actually delivering the flour!

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.100
‎What really matters is that he comes
‎to Dad's birthday party and they make up!

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.140
‎Hide, Tikki!

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.460
‎Put the sack down in the usual place,
‎Gilbert!

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.180
‎Er... Where's his usual place?

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.820
‎-You're not Gilbert!
‎-No, I'm Germaine, his cousin!

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.580
‎Hmm. Aren't you a bit young
‎to be delivering flour?

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.380
‎I'm an intern.
‎I'm doing a flour delivery internship

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.660
‎because someday I want to own
‎my own flour shop!

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.580
‎It's good to be ambitious! You can put
‎the sack down now. Have a nice day! Salt!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.740
‎-So you're a baker then, huh?
‎-Are you a delivery girl or a detective?

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.340
‎Go on!
‎Put the bag down and be on your way!

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.460
‎That oven you have there,
‎it's a '72 Le Panyol, right?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.460
‎It's a rare, wood-fired model.
‎They only made a few 100!

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.780
‎-How did you know that?
‎-My daddy... uh, my bready...

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.900
‎-bread-history teacher taught us that.
‎-Well, that's new!

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.220
‎You need history classes
‎to become a flour-delivery person now?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.260
‎You bet! You have to study for ten years
‎to be a delivery person these days!

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.700
‎Good luck with your internship.
‎Put that down and have a good day!

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.420
‎That's a weird-looking computer!

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.220
‎A computer? In my house?
‎Are you insane? That's a TV!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.660
‎Really? But is it still working?

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.820
‎Nope. Turned it on one day, and, pff!

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.740
‎-Stopped working!
‎-It may not meet cable standards.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
‎We watch everything on the Internet!

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.060
‎The Internet is just as crazy as cordless
‎telephones. That's not how it's done!

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.180
‎How can sound and pictures
‎go through without any wires?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.140
‎Simple! They're sent in wave form
‎to relay antennas connected to satellites.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.220
‎It's awesome! You can talk and see
‎anyone you want, anywhere in the world.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.780
‎I don't need to speak to anyone!
‎Besides, that's not how it's done!

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.220
‎Now put the sack down and leave me alone!
‎I've got work to do!

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.100
‎Do you live alone? Do you have any family?

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.620
‎Ta, ta, ta!
‎You really are a nosy detective.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.820
‎Don't touch a thing,
‎put the sack down, and leave.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.900
‎-Oh! Nice bread dough!
‎-Hey! No! Don't touch that!

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.540
‎-That's not--
‎-Don't worry, I know how it's done!

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.860
‎You take the dough and fold it in half,
‎rhythmically, pressing it flat.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.420
‎-Snapping it slightly.
‎-Snapping it slightly.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.900
‎It gives it elasticity
‎and develops the gluten,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.780
‎so that it holds together well
‎after it's been baked!

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.180
‎You're a schoolgirl reciting a lesson.
‎You don't really know!

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.340
‎I do know my stuff!
‎Maybe even better than you, old man.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.340
‎Better than me? Better than me?
‎Better than me?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.620
‎Charlotte? Marie-Louise? Marguerite?
‎Did you hear that? Better than me?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.660
‎Ha, ha, ha! We'll see about that!
‎Get into position.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.980
‎We'll make some bread together!
‎Then we'll see who's the baker

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.300
‎and who's only good for delivering flour!

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.020
‎See this yeast? It's been grown
‎for over 2,000 years by my family,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.460
‎ever since my indomitable ancestor,
‎Loafamix the Gaul,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.580
‎who made bread in a small Armorican
‎village, fell alongside Vercingetorix.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:11.060
‎To be precise, he was my great-great-
‎great-great-great-great-great-great-

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.940
‎great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
‎great-great-great-great-great-great-

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.940
‎-great-great-great-great-grandfather!
‎-Phew!

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.140
‎But the Romans won. Paf!
‎And started putting vegetables and cheese

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.460
‎on the bread. And now it's pizza!
‎Beurk! Beurk! Beurk!

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.140
‎-I like pizza!
‎-You like pizza?

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.740
‎-You, Germaine, like pizza?
‎-Yes, I do.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.100
‎Argh! She likes pizza! Argh!
‎But that's not how it's done!

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.980
‎You don't put cheese on bread dough!
‎It's just like my son and his wife,

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.980
‎who got it into their heads
‎that adding rice to the dough

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.620
‎would make the inside of the bread
‎lighter! That's not how it's done!

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.940
‎But what if it's yummy?
‎Have you ever tried your son's bread?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.860
‎Ta, ta, ta! No need.
‎I know it's not going to be good!

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.460
‎Making bread with rice flour...
‎That's not how it's done!

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.980
‎Well, I think it's creative!

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.740
‎How?

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.700
‎-So, your son's a baker, then?
‎-I don't have a son any more,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.780
‎-not since he betrayed me.
‎-Because he put rice in the bread dough?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.580
‎That's not how it's done!

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.140
‎If my bread comes out
‎tasting as good as yours,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.100
‎will you agree to do one thing for me?

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.700
‎-Why? What do you want me to do?
‎-Are you a baker or a nosy detective?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.260
‎Ha! Your bread
‎won't be as good as mine anyway!

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.260
‎That song... It's the song my son
‎and I used to sing when we were...

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.660
‎kneading dough.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.660
‎There's no way you could know that song

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.620
‎unless you're... No, that's impossible!

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:01.420
‎-Yes. I am your granddaughter, Marinette.
‎-You're... my granddaughter?

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.780
‎Liar! I don't have a granddaughter!
‎Betrayal! Deceit!

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.220
‎It's like adding new ingredients to bread!
‎Deceptive! That's not how it's done!

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.860
‎Shoo! Get out! Get out! Out with the liar!

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.940
‎No! I'm not leaving!
‎Not until you've tasted my bread.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.580
‎-You promised you would.
‎-You want to stay here?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.220
‎-Stay here then!
‎-Whether you like it or not,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.340
‎you are my grandfather!
‎And today is your son's birthday.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.940
‎-Don't you want to see him again?
‎-La, la, la! I can't hear anything!

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.860
‎Don't look at me like that! She shouldn't
‎have lied to her... not-grandfather!

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.180
‎And her bread... I bet her bread
‎is as terrible as her father's!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.140
‎Hmm. I can smell the bread
‎that's being baked with flames of fury.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.020
‎A perfect recipe for my akumas.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.540
‎Fly away, my little akuma and evilise him!

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.340
‎That's not how it's done by the Dupains,
‎the proud descendants of Loafamix!

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.860
‎Bakerix, I am Hawk Moth,
‎and I see that you're hungry for power.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.900
‎I am giving you the ability
‎to serve punishments to anyone

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.460
‎who doesn't do things
‎like they should be done!

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.940
‎Oh! Of course!
‎Would you like a butter croissant

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.260
‎or a baguette to go with that?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.940
‎No! In return, I want the Miraculous
‎of Ladybug and Cat Noir,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.220
‎two offenders
‎who don't know how it's done!

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.060
‎-So show them!
‎-You can count on me, Hawk Moth!

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.660
‎Grandpa?

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.220
‎There's no Grandpa! I'm Bakerix!

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.060
‎Anyone who doesn't do things
‎the way they should be done

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.300
‎will be served my indomitable wrath!

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.540
‎Soon, Paris will look like it did
‎before the modern world took over!

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.980
‎No! Grandpa!

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.420
‎We'll finish the baking later!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.540
‎Tikki, spots on! Yeah!

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.700
‎-Why isn't this bus making any noise?
‎-Because it runs on electricity!

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.260
‎An electric bus? That's not how it's done!

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.140
‎Buses make noise, they run on gas
‎and spew out stinky black smoke!

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.860
‎-Away with modern buses!
‎-Aaah!

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.980
‎What's all this?
‎There's a flying superbug in Paris now?

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.060
‎Yep! Girl and superhero.
‎You gotta get with the time!

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.940
‎That's not how it's done!

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.500
‎It's up to the police or the army
‎to carry out law enforcement, not you!

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.020
<i>‎Just minutes before</i>
<i>‎the unveiling of the StarTrain,</i>

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.940
<i>‎I've been told that a Gaul</i>
<i>‎is wreaking havoc in Paris.</i>

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.180
<i>‎I'm going to rid Paris of all this</i>
<i>‎modern nonsense, starting with you!</i>

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.420
<i>‎Well, technically,</i>
<i>‎I'm not all that modern.</i>

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.900
‎-My Miraculous is from ancient times!
‎-We didn't have superheroes in my youth!

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.580
<i>‎There will be no superheroes in my Paris!</i>

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.500
<i>‎Aaah!</i>

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.660
‎Looks like Ladybug's the one unveiling
‎a brand-new method of air transport!

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.380
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.380
‎-Aaah!
‎-Don't worry, Milady, I'm right here!

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.500
‎Thanks, but girls don't always
‎need to be saved by boys!

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.380
‎You think I'm a tad old-fashioned.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.660
‎Oh, I've seen worse than you.
‎Just wait till you meet Bakerix!

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.300
‎-Thanks, André.
‎-Aaah!

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.780
‎-What are you doing?
‎-Filming you.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.580
‎Argh! Telephones are for telephoning,
‎not for filming! That's not how it's done!

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.820
‎-Hey! That's censorship!
‎-Just like the good old days!

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.740
‎Oh! Oh!
‎An Egyptian pyramid in the Kings' Court?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.660
‎That's not how it's done!

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.620
‎A blending of ancient and modern.
‎I like this glass pyramid a lot!

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.340
‎It's proof you can be modern
‎and respect the past!

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.500
‎Treachery! Treason!

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.620
‎We'd better destroy that flask of his!

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.780
‎You're right. That's probably
‎where the akuma is, too.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.180
‎You're out of your league!
‎You don't have enough experience!

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.500
‎-We're trapped! Cata...
‎-Save your Cataclysm.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.700
‎We're probably gonna need it!
‎Emergency exit!

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.420
‎Good eye!

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.980
‎What's that?
‎A train that goes under water?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.780
‎Is it a train or a submarine?
‎That's not how it's done!

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.140
‎If you want to go to England,
‎you take a boat!

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.020
‎Ploosh... ploosh... ploosh...
‎You get seasick!

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.980
‎-Whoa!
‎-Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.340
‎I've got bad news for you.
‎This train is out of service!

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.460
‎Aaah!

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.900
‎-We've got a train to catch!
‎-Boarding now!

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.420
‎Be reasonable now.
‎There are a lot of people on this train.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.460
‎Well, then they'd better get off, because
‎it's on its way to the wrecking yard!

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.540
‎Whoa!

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.580
‎-You should ask Queen Bee for some help!
‎-We're doing OK for now.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.980
‎But I'll remember that. Thanks, Chloé!

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.660
‎Aaah!

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.140
‎Not again!

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.820
‎Lucky charm!

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.780
‎Tomatoes in a bottle? I doubt our friend
‎will take too kindly to this!

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.180
‎That's what I'm counting on.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.220
‎In fact, I'm planning to give our friend
‎the least traditional sandwich possible!

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.060
‎How about some super-sour candy chews,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.340
‎plus some super-chemical chewing-gum,

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.420
‎all packed between two slices
‎of white, industrial bread.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.980
‎Oh, stop it, Ladybug!
‎You're making us all drool!

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.700
‎Isn't that right, Bakerix?

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.100
‎-I'm not falling for your tricks!
‎-OK, in that case, I'll just add...

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.740
‎some tomatoes in a bottle!

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.060
‎Now this sandwich will taste like pizza!
‎It'll be so good!

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.740
‎That's not how traditional
‎sandwiches are done!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.660
‎-Do your thing, Cat Noir!
‎-Cataclysm!

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.020
‎Argh!

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.540
‎Aaah!

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.460
‎You're blown away by this sandwich,
‎aren't you?

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.860
‎That's not how it's done!

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.340
‎Well, that's how we do it, anyway!

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.740
‎No more evil-doing for you, akuma.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.180
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.780
‎Gotcha!

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.700
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.260
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.780
‎-Pound it!
‎-Pound it!

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.540
‎My bread! I left some bread baking in
‎the oven! And my granddaughter's there!

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.100
‎-It's dangerous!
‎-I'm sure it's under control!

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.340
‎I must get home!

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.900
‎I'll take him back.
‎I have more time left than you!

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.060
‎Thank you, Cat Noir! Bug out!

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.540
‎Sure you want to go home
‎on a superhero's back?

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.500
‎It's fast, but not very traditional!

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.820
‎When bread is at risk,
‎that's how it's done!

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.100
‎One day or another,
‎things will change, Ladybug.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.340
‎And front-row seats to your downfall
‎will sell like hotcakes!

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.060
‎Marinette! Marinette!

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.140
‎Grandpa? Cat Noir? Is everything OK?

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.340
‎Er... yes... I was just scared
‎the bread might be overbaked!

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.180
‎-It looks all right.
‎-You see? I do know how it's done!

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.260
‎Well, if it's all good, I'll be on my way.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.180
‎No! Wait! We need a judge to determine
‎which of these loaves is the best!

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.260
‎Uh... the thing is, I'm gonna
‎transform back soon, and... Whoa!

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.460
‎You're a real tough cookie,
‎even without your superpowers!

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.820
‎Mmm... both these breads are delicious!
‎Do you have any jam, by any chance?

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.980
‎ That's not how you taste bread!

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.060
‎They're both tasty in different ways.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.980
‎This is more traditional
‎and this has a delicate flavour

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.980
‎that makes it special. Can't choose.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.220
‎I'm sorry, but I really do have to get
‎going. Thanks for the tasty snack!

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.020
‎Mmm. He's right, this flavour is...
‎is... really good.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.420
‎-I did it the way my Dad does it!
‎-But how?

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.540
‎I added rice while you weren't looking.
‎You can never have just one bite!

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.940
‎So now I can ask you do that one thing?
‎Will you come home with me?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.260
‎We're celebrating Dad's 40th birthday.
‎I'm sure he'd be so happy to see his dad.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.900
‎You're not a traditional granddaughter,
‎Marinette! And you know what? I like it!

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.300
‎Roland?

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.300
‎Happy Birthday, Dad!
