1
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,750
Hey, gather up!
Anggun wants to say something.

2
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,083
Uh…

3
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,333
God damn, you guys! I'm blown away!

4
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,125
Totally speechless.

5
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
Uh, I'm a teary mess.

6
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,708
Let's pray for the awards night later.

7
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,125
-Yo, yo, yo.
-According to your faiths and beliefs.

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,541
Amen. That's enough.

9
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,833
Mata Hari hug!

10
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,875
Win or lose, let's party
at Rama's tomorrow night!

11
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,333
You should've paid more attention.
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
Now, listen to me. Remember this.

13
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,541
When someone makes a mistake,
you gotta help out. Okay?

14
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,708
Excuse me, Tariq, may I go home now?

15
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,541
-My family's expecting me.
-What?

16
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,250
Your family?

17
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,833
Aren't we all your family here?

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,583
Not that I wanna.
Just that my mother really needs me.

19
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,333
I was messing up with you.
You're not staying?

20
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,291
I mean, for the awarding?
It's two hours.

21
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,916
Don't think I can wait that long.

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,458
But after the awards,
I'll update the website right away.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,875
All right. Take care. Guys!

24
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,375
Lady Sur is leaving us and going home now.

25
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,541
-Goodbye, all.
-Take care, sweet Sur!

26
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,958
South Jakarta bound!
South Jakarta bound!

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,500
South Jakarta bound! South Jakarta bound!

28
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,583
Ma'am.

29
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,375
-My boss texted you the order, right?
-What order?

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
I can't find my phone.

31
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,333
Don't you remember the order?

32
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,083
-Peace be unto you.
-And unto you peace.

33
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,291
Sur, help me find my phone.

34
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,875
-I forgot where I put it.
-I'll try to call it.

35
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,000
-You can't. I put it on silent.
-Wait.

36
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,958
I thought it was here.

37
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,791
Damn. What's that?

38
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
High-tech stuff!

39
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,750
-Glad you're studying computer science.
-Hey.

40
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,583
Who's calling?

41
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,041
No, Dad. I just triggered the alarm
from my laptop.

42
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,500
-Why are you late?
-The play just finished, Dad.

43
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,333
Stop wasting your time.

44
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,916
It's not even your major in college.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,458
The diner is busy now.

46
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,208
How was it? Did you win?

47
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,708
I should check.

48
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,500
Mom!

49
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,750
Congrats, dear!

50
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:50,000
So rice, liver satay and sauteed kale?

51
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,583
Yup, that's my order.

52
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,625
-Sur.
-Yes?

53
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:56,083
You seem busy with that.
What about your studies?

54
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,291
It's going well, Mom.

55
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,958
It's actually good for my CV.

56
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,666
It shows that I can make a proper website.

57
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,875
It's also good for my scholarship reports.

58
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,125
When's your next report due?

59
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,750
Day after tomorrow.

60
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,458
-How much?
-Twenty-eight thousand.

61
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

62
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,916
Mata Hari!

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,916
Why are you all skipping class?

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,875
Go back to your class!

65
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,875
After the triumph of the play,
Medusa et Perseus,

66
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,750
in the Student Theater Festival,

67
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,541
the faculty will continue to support
the Mata Hari theater group,

68
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:11,166
to join the Asian Student
Theater Festival in Kyoto next month!

69
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,166
I'm hopeful that our dynamic duo,

70
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,333
Rama, the playwright,

71
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,500
and Anggun, the director,

72
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,458
will bring more success to our university!

73
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,000
Attention, guys!

74
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,916
Everyone is expected to be
at Rama's house by 6:00 p.m.

75
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,208
So you guys won? Where's the feast then?

76
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,791
I'm just the website designer, Amin.

77
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,250
You made that website here.

78
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,291
-Pay my power bill then.
-Damn you, loan shark!

79
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,083
All right then.

80
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,083
I'll buy you lunch. What do you want?

81
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,791
Sushi?

82
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,791
You're going to Japan, right?

83
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,625
No way I'm going.

84
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,500
Only 15 guys will go, and I'm a nobody.

85
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,375
-Printing work, Amin.
-Go ahead, boss.

86
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,250
Printing another draft, brother?

87
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,125
Yup. I have to translate it.

88
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,500
I also need to take new photos
for the installation sets.

89
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,166
Anyway…

90
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,000
My dad's looking for a web designer

91
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,916
for a charity gala
with his fellow artists.

92
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,333
I showed him Mata Hari's website,

93
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,458
and he likes it.

94
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,708
Seriously?

95
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,250
I recommended you to him.

96
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,500
So please come to the party.

97
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,416
Bring anyone you want.

98
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,875
Okay?

99
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,583
Thirty copies.

100
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,541
-I can't get it done today though.
-No problem.

101
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,083
Amelia is overworked today.

102
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,375
Amelia?

103
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,750
Why do you call it Amelia?

104
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,500
No reason. Sounds pretty, right?

105
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,791
Find the meaning.
The poor thing works all the time.

106
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,875
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, boss.

107
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
Did you hear that?

108
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,958
-I can take anyone. Come with me?
-No, thanks.

109
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,000
See those piles? Like the Eiffel Tower.

110
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,958
There'll be free food.

111
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,708
I'll pay for the gas.

112
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,625
Rama's house is a bit far.

113
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,083
I knew it. You just need a ride.

114
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,125
I need this job offer.
I haven't gotten my scholarship grant yet.

115
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,208
We'll finish by 8:00 p.m.

116
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
Not a minute later, okay?

117
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,291
Help me copy these then.

118
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,500
The party's dress code
is the '40s. Do you have that?

119
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,083
No shit.

120
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,083
Are you new in Mata Hari?

121
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,875
Yes.

122
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,208
Don't go to that party.

123
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,375
Waste of time.

124
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,708
And why is that?

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,291
You'd better focus
on your scholarship report.

126
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,250
It's due tomorrow, right?

127
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,250
Stop seeking attention
and trying to be popular.

128
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,958
-Eight thousand for six copies, right?
-Yep.

129
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,625
What's her deal?

130
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,416
-I'm leaving, Mom.
-Mmm.

131
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Your hand, please.

132
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,875
-Godspeed. Go get that job!
-Amen, Mom.

133
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,041
I'll come straight home after the meeting.

134
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,916
-I'll be home by 9:00 p.m.
-Hey.

135
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,333
-Where are you going?
-A job interview, Dad.

136
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,750
Huh?

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,875
Who will help your mother then?

138
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,708
It's okay.

139
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,041
I gave her permission.

140
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,291
Why would someone
schedule a job interview

141
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,250
after office hours?

142
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,791
We'll also have a small party
for the award we won.

143
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,166
-Is it a party or an interview?
-An interview.

144
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,125
If it's a job interview…

145
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,208
don't wear such a revealing dress.

146
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,208
But everyone will be dressed like this.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,166
Put something under it.

148
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,166
Hey.

149
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,000
Promise me. No alcohol.

150
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,333
Yes.

151
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,458
Who was that senior back at the shop?
She was so rude.

152
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,041
Farah?

153
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,958
Just ignore her.

154
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,666
She was a member of Mata Hari.

155
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,125
The photographer, I think.

156
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,125
But she was kicked out.

157
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,833
Got into
many complicated flings with boys.

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,916
That's what I heard.

159
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,375
Name please?

160
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,583
Suryani, sir. I'm bringing my friend here.

161
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,083
Suryani.

162
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,916
Damn! This house is huge!

163
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,416
I know, right?

164
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,875
So many statues…

165
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,291
Rama's father is a sculptor.

166
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,166
Amin.

167
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,875
Tuck your shirt in.

168
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,041
-Tuck it in?
-Better that way.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,666
First,
an important announcement.

170
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,083
So the news is,

171
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,916
our flights to Kyoto

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,958
will be sponsored by
Uncle Soemarno and Aunt Lilis,

173
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,041
Rama's parents!

174
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,916
Uncle, Auntie,

175
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,041
thank you for always supporting
the Mata Hari family.

176
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,250
-Anything for you guys.
-What do we say, guys?

177
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,666
Thank you, Uncle and Auntie!

178
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,125
I'd like to thank everyone
who has contributed to our show.

179
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,083
First, our production manager.
Tariq the badass!

180
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,750
Don't let it go to your head now.

181
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,250
You have to arrange for everyone's visas.

182
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,500
Also, thank you to our Medusa
for her divine performance,

183
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,500
Kirana!

184
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,666
Thank you so much.

185
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,250
Our visual art crew, Samsul!

186
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,208
Samsul, thank you.

187
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,333
And last but not least,

188
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:22,458
we had a full house yesterday,
thanks to our super cool website.

189
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,166
So big thanks to Suryani!

190
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,333
-Dad, this is Sur, our web designer.
-Hi, Sur.

191
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,875
-Hi, Uncle.
-What a cool website.

192
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,166
Thank you, Uncle.

193
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,291
I believe Rama told you about the offer?

194
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,833
Yes, he did.

195
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,291
-I'm glad you're on board.
-Thank you for the opportunity, Uncle.

196
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,833
Fill it up.

197
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,916
-Hi, Sur!
-Hi, Sister Anggun.

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
Here. Take this.

199
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
Careful.

200
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,666
Okay. Thank you.

201
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,125
Thank you so much.

202
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,375
Don't get tired working with us. Okay?

203
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,666
Let's toast.

204
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,083
No. Let's start again.

205
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,208
When toasting,
we need to make eye contact.

206
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,875
Otherwise, it's bad luck. Okay?

207
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,250
Look me in the eyes. All right?

208
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,125
Cheers!

209
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,833
Mmm.

210
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,291
What's with the look?

211
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,375
Behold!

212
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,291
Medusa is coming!

213
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,291
Whoever gets shot
by Medusa's gaze must take a shot!

214
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,750
Brace yourself! Brace yourself!

215
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,750
Oh!

216
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,916
Amin, my man!

217
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,541
Chug! Chug! Chug!

218
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,083
Give it to him!

219
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,500
Chug! Chug! Chug!

220
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,750
-Bring me my copies, Amin!
-Isn't it fun? Let's stay a bit more!

221
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,000
Another round! Incoming!

222
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,125
Chug! Chug! Chug!

223
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,958
Take it!

224
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,416
Chug! Chug!

225
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,416
Bottoms up!

226
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,166
Oh!

227
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,291
Sur.

228
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,166
Come on, let's go.

229
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,000
Stay a bit more.

230
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,125
What're you gonna do?

231
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,625
Everyone's still here.

232
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,416
No one will be at your shop.

233
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,000
You promised we'd be back by 8:00 p.m.

234
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,791
Sur, sit here.

235
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,833
Sur. Sit here!

236
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,416
I have my scholarship review, Dad.

237
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,750
-Please, let her go!
-I want to talk.

238
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,333
-Let her do her report first!
-You stay out of this!

239
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:30,291
-It's because you gave her permission!
-I'm taking your shoes, Mom!

240
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,416
I'm late, Dad!

241
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,333
-Listen to me!
-I am late, Dad!

242
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,291
Just take
the public transit, Sur!

243
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,416
You got wasted last night?

244
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,833
Mind watching my phone for me?

245
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,833
You almost missed your appointment.

246
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,541
Good morning, sir.

247
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,041
Sorry I'm late. I was stuck in traffic.

248
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
Why are you wearing a kebaya?

249
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,875
It's not Women's Day.

250
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,416
Not your graduation day, either.

251
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,833
I'm sorry, sir.

252
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:29,541
I have an event after this.
The dress code is kebaya.

253
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
This is my report, sir.

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,041
-This semester, I made a website for--
-Hold it.

255
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,416
I want to ask you something.

256
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,166
Do you often go to night clubs?

257
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,083
No, sir. Not at all.

258
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,208
-Do you drink?
-What? No, sir.

259
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,208
Then what's this?

260
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,000
Explain this.

261
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,583
Why did you upload them
to your social media?

262
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,958
I didn't upload them, sir!

263
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,000
Then who did? Your assistant?

264
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,333
But you did go to
a party last night, right?

265
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,333
I see you're still wearing the same dress.

266
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,500
Let me explain…

267
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,500
She told us that she needs
to wear it for an event after this.

268
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,500
-But, sir, I'm wearing this--
-I am appalled.

269
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,625
Why have you been slacking
since last semester?

270
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,958
Drinking alcohol
is not Indonesian culture.

271
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,125
The alumni is paying for your studies.

272
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,416
Sir, first of all…

273
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,916
I never took those photos, sir.

274
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,291
And then, until now,

275
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:32,458
I still meet
the requirements for this scholarship.

276
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,875
My GPA is above 3.6
and I have perfect attendance, sir.

277
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,250
We know that. However…

278
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,208
Your academic performance
and your behavior

279
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,458
are both important, Suryani.

280
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:46,375
And we give the scholarship
so students may use it for good causes,

281
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,833
not for this kind of rubbish.

282
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,333
But, sir, I've always joined
positive activities.

283
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,375
The website that I made
helped the theater department to win, sir.

284
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,500
Wait a second.

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,375
As far as I know, this faculty
doesn't have any theater group.

286
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,458
Are you really a Computer Science major?

287
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's get to the point.

288
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,250
We have to deliberate.

289
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,291
Whatever the result, we'll let you know.

290
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,291
Your session is over, anyway.

291
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,666
Look at yourself.
I don't think you're fully sober.

292
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,416
Farah Natia.

293
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,083
Amin.

294
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,166
Who pulled a prank on me?

295
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,666
-Amin.
-What do you mean?

296
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,375
Who took those selfies?

297
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,458
How would I know?

298
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,208
Why didn't you wake me up on the way home?

299
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,583
I didn't take you home.
I went home before you.

300
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,333
You left me there?

301
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,208
You told me to go home and so I went.
You were dancing like crazy.

302
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,291
-Wisnu Brata?
-Present.

303
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,333
-Xavier Wibowo?
-Present, ma'am.

304
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,875
-And lastly, Yanuar Joko?
-Present.

305
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,041
All right, class.
Now I will distribute…

306
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:38,958
Miss?

307
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,125
You haven't called my name. It's Suryani.

308
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,125
Have you completed
your registration for this semester?

309
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,750
I have, Miss.

310
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,750
But I haven't paid the tuition fee.
I'm waiting for my scholarship grant.

311
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,125
So please settle that first.

312
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,541
Because if your name's not here,
then you can't join this class.

313
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,041
Let's continue.
We'll start with the first chapter…

314
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,666
Watch it!

315
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,750
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!

316
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:22,166
To control the dengue fever
outbreak in Indonesia,

317
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:26,500
the government is providing
free fumigation in this area.

318
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,166
Please remain inside your house…

319
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,166
Why did you close the diner?

320
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,791
Still waiting for the fumigation?

321
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,916
So from now on,

322
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,000
I have to pay for your tuition too?

323
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,708
"Terminated due to inappropriate conduct."
What does that mean?

324
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,916
This is a mistake, Mom.

325
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,208
Dad.

326
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,541
What are you doing, Dad? Dad!

327
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,416
You've broken the rule
by drinking alcohol.

328
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,916
You are no longer a member of this family.

329
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Dad, let me explain.

330
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,125
Please stop. I haven't explained anything!

331
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,250
I don't need any explanation.

332
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,250
Our neighbors know
that you came home drunk.

333
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,250
A guy was carrying you along the alley,

334
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,708
and he knocked on everyone's doors,

335
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,875
he woke everyone up,

336
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,083
just so he could find our house.

337
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,916
Did you know what time it was? Hmm?

338
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,250
Three in the morning.

339
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,166
-Please, listen to me, Dad.
-Hey.

340
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,916
Since this morning, everyone
has been coming, asking questions.

341
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,875
"What was wrong with Sur?"
"Who was the guy carrying her?"

342
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,833
Your mom and I had to answer all of them.

343
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,458
Said you had a job interview,
you were partying instead!

344
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,916
But I wanted to celebrate
my achievement, Dad…

345
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,541
Achievement?

346
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,833
You lost your scholarship
because of your bad behavior.

347
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,708
You call that an achievement?

348
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,916
Who's going to pay for your tuition now?

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,833
Don't you feel bad for your mother?

350
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,666
Consider this your punishment,
so you may repent.

351
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,791
Chitra? Excuse me…

352
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,375
Do you know who took me home last night?

353
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:45,500
What time did you go home?
I left around 10:00 p.m.

354
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,125
Hey, Sur. Sobered up yet?

355
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,791
Anggun wants to modify
the Gorgon's costume.

356
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,625
Can you add beige to its color?

357
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:54,125
Damn, I must go to the thrift shop again.

358
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,125
-See what you can do.
-I'll let you know tomorrow.

359
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,958
-Tariq…
-Not now.

360
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,583
Hey, morons!
What have you done with the package?

361
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,666
Have you got no sense of urgency?

362
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,666
Do I always have to clean up
after your shit?

363
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,500
-Next time, do it right!
-Sorry, brother.

364
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:15,458
-Tariq…
-Sur, stop bugging me. I'm busy!

365
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,041
Do you know who…

366
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,791
-Rama.
-Hi, Sur.

367
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,000
Sorry, do you know
who took me home last night?

368
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,250
NetCar, right?

369
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,666
Did you order it?

370
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,000
-No, Anggun did. Why?
-Oh.

371
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,250
Stop. Anggun is rehearsing.

372
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,875
Wait, let me get her.

373
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:45,291
Anggun, uh, Sur's asking about the NetCar…

374
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,833
I'll be quick. Sorry.

375
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,750
Okay, Sur. So…

376
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:56,250
Everyone left in their own cars,
so I ordered a NetCar for you.

377
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,708
Did you lose anything?

378
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,625
No, but what time was that?

379
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,666
Let me check the order history.

380
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,500
Was I… Was I asleep or…

381
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,750
Last night you were really drunk.

382
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,375
I tried to wake you up,
but you were out cold.

383
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,583
So I'm really sorry.

384
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,958
I had to find your ID to get your address.

385
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,375
-Can you send it to me?
-Sure.

386
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,583
Uh…

387
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,750
Done. Hey, Ical.

388
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:26,458
Please take out the Perseus helmet.
It needs more aging.

389
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:28,625
-Okay.
-Uh… Got cigs?

390
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,958
Do you know who posted these selfies?

391
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:35,000
Didn't you upload these yourself?

392
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,041
I can't remember.

393
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:40,625
Well, the room was dark,
and everyone was dancing.

394
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:44,166
When the lights came on,
I saw you sleeping on the couch.

395
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,125
So I'm not sure what happened in between.

396
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,375
Do you remember laying down on the couch?

397
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,375
Mmm.

398
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,708
I remember I was very tired,

399
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,458
so I stopped dancing,
then I can't remember anymore.

400
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:59,333
What's wrong with these selfies?
Did they get you into trouble?

401
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:00,666
Well…

402
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,375
It's common to lose control
when we're drunk, Sur.

403
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,666
I once drunk-dialed my ex.

404
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,333
-Anggun?
-Hmm?

405
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,000
-Let's start again.
-Just a sec.

406
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,541
-Uh, did you find Tariq?
-No.

407
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,583
Bummer.

408
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:20,708
Sur, sorry, I have to leave you now.
If anything happens, you talk to me.

409
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,333
I mean it. Okay?

410
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:26,083
Rama, help her out. Let's start again.

411
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:30,416
Sur, if you lost something,
just call me and I'll help you find it.

412
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,708
Rama!

413
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:34,416
The revised installation set has arrived.

414
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,875
Okay. Please unwrap it.

415
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,916
-Text me. You have my number, right?
-Yes.

416
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,750
Turn it on.

417
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:46,125
-This one's a picture of the Milky Way?
-Otong, please copy.

418
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,291
Get me a kimono.

419
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,166
Here's your kimono.

420
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,416
Welcome to the Mata Hari family.

421
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:01,208
Anggun, do you need me?

422
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,458
-Where were you?
-Restroom.

423
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,958
Everyone was looking for you.
Stop fooling around!

424
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,208
What did you drink?

425
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,291
Blacked out like that.

426
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,041
I just had wine, and what was it?

427
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,458
And that one shot,
when we played that Medusa game?

428
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,416
Whiskey?

429
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,291
-What else?
-I forgot.

430
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:29,333
But your eyes seem open.
Doesn't look like you're sleeping.

431
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,041
That's just how I sleep.

432
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,333
Remember when I slept in class
in primary school?

433
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:39,583
I'm sure somebody pranked me.
But why though?

434
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:42,500
Look at this. The sizes are different.

435
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,625
Front camera compared to rear camera.

436
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:49,291
They used the rear camera.
I never do selfies with my rear camera.

437
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,166
-They're the same, damn it!
-It's different!

438
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:55,666
-I'll check if anyone posted videos of me.
-Hey!

439
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,791
Use the scrap paper!

440
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:08,750
Video one.
Gita's mirror selfie, 11:00 p.m.

441
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,375
Video two.

442
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,625
Udiarti's Boomerang
in the garden, 5:00 p.m.

443
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:19,875
Video three.
Dance floor in the living room, 11:30 p.m.

444
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,291
The videos are disappearing.
It's been 24 hours.

445
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,541
Take screenshots then!

446
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,666
Sur.

447
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,416
Learn your lesson.
The next time you drink, be careful!

448
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,875
What lesson, jerk? Here. Look at this.

449
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,333
They did this to the new members.

450
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,958
I knew it was part of their initiation,

451
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,833
but they wouldn't admit
that they did this to me.

452
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,000
12:15 a.m…

453
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,166
I need you, as the dean,
to convince the Board of Alumni.

454
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,416
How could I lose my scholarship
over some selfies?

455
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,250
I've already told you.

456
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,500
The faculty can't interfere
with the board's decisions.

457
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,625
From what I heard,

458
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:31,375
the board monitors the social media
account of every recipient.

459
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,791
Now think about it.

460
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,708
What would happen if your social media
was filled with your drunk photos?

461
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,791
But I didn't violate
any of my scholarship requirements, sir.

462
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,416
Nonsense!
It's obviously in the requirements.

463
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,375
The recipients
shall not commit immoral acts

464
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,083
and must maintain their integrity.

465
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:53,208
Now, how could we regain their trust

466
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:57,708
if you used their money to get drunk?

467
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,000
What the hell are you doing?

468
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:37,500
I'll stay here from now on.
I need to find out who did this to me.

469
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,833
What do you mean?

470
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,000
Starting tomorrow,

471
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,500
I'll hack into Mata Hari members' phones.

472
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,750
Are you nuts?

473
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,083
Playing detective, are we?

474
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,625
Must be the lack of sleep.

475
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,041
Poor Sur.

476
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,333
I see you haven't sobered up yet.

477
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,416
Sur.

478
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,458
This is my territory.

479
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,041
You stay over here.

480
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:32,541
Don't you come near my fish.
If they die, I'll lose money.

481
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,583
How long will you stay here?

482
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,791
We're living together now.

483
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,333
Man and woman, unmarried.

484
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,958
What if the campus found out?

485
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,000
They'd fire me.

486
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,125
Getting fired is nothing.
What if they shame us in public?

487
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,375
I'll try to find evidence
within three days.

488
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,666
The theater members will come here often
to prepare their visas.

489
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,208
I'll work as usual, okay?

490
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,250
Mosquito repellent.

491
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,791
MOM

492
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,625
BLOCK

493
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:31,958
Amin, print this.

494
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,000
Min?

495
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,416
Is the Wi-Fi off?

496
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,375
I can't log in to my email.

497
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,291
There's been trouble
since last night.

498
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,375
Where's your file?
You have it on your phone?

499
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,375
I have it.

500
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,291
Just plug it in then.

501
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,791
The Wi-Fi's never died before.

502
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:57,916
Ask the shitty provider.

503
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,833
Damn it!

504
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,416
-Amin, five pages. How much?
-Seven thousand.

505
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,875
-Thanks, dude.
-Yep.

506
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,625
What now?

507
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:45,083
He left before I finished copying.

508
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,625
What was I supposed to do?

509
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,791
Okay, listen.

510
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,083
Hey.

511
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,666
If I play some folk music,

512
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,000
it means I'm still copying.

513
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,041
Help me buy some time.

514
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,458
If I change to rock music,

515
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,000
it means I'm done.

516
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,500
You can let them go.

517
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,333
What a pain in the ass.

518
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,458
Come on, fix your damn Wi-Fi!

519
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,958
Yeah.

520
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,041
I heard there's gonna
be a student protest?

521
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,166
Who said that?

522
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,708
The dean came and told me.

523
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,875
Ugh. That's just a rumor.

524
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:46,000
Wait! Don't unplug it yet.
This computer has viruses.

525
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,041
-Let me install the antivirus first.
-Huh?

526
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:50,666
Damn it!

527
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,458
Who needs an antivirus for a phone?

528
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,125
You don't want to lose your data, right?
Let me do it.

529
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,083
I don't need it. Piss off.

530
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,708
It'll only take a minute. Wait.

531
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,125
Cut it out, Amin. I don't need it.

532
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,833
Gosh, stop it now!

533
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,833
I need to see my professor soon!

534
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,750
Stop your bullshit.

535
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,791
-Well, I won't be responsible then.
-Don't worry. It's fine.

536
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,041
I need to print this one quickly.
I'll email it to you.

537
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:20,125
The Wi-Fi's dead.
Just plug it into the PC directly.

538
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,208
Really?

539
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:33,166
Moses.

540
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,916
-What's for dinner?
-Just order something from NetFood.

541
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,708
Pick anything. It's on me.

542
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:47,625
Satay maybe?

543
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,083
Udiarti.

544
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,250
Rama.

545
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,166
How's it going? Find anything?

546
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,125
Only four guys came today.

547
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:10,416
There are 40 theater members.
Are you sure everyone will come?

548
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,291
-When will you ever find out?
-Shut up.

549
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:18,000
Starting tomorrow, would you consider
hacking non-theater students?

550
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,833
-Maybe it'll help.
-Yeah, right.

551
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,583
You wanna stalk people, you creep?
Or steal theses?

552
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,625
Just trying to help here.

553
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:29,333
I've stopped selling theses.

554
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,750
I'm not a sinner anymore.

555
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,583
I don't want any dirty money.

556
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,750
It's you who's a stalker now.

557
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,958
I'm only looking
at photos from the party.

558
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,791
Then why are you
looking at their old photos?

559
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,083
Hi.

560
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,375
You got booze?

561
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,208
-Still have some?
-No, I don't.

562
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,916
-Why don't you go home?
-Mmm. Home is a shitshow.

563
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,375
-I'm coming in.
-Stop. I have to work.

564
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,458
You have a girl over?

565
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,166
Yes, it's Amelia.

566
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,000
So Amelia wears shoes now?

567
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,125
Shut up. They're my sister's.

568
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:42,208
Sister, my ass.
Poor Amelia, she'll get jealous.

569
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,291
Just go to the canteen!

570
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,041
Go to your boy toy.

571
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,583
Don't tell me what to do.

572
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:53,625
Why are you acting so busy?
You let me hang out here all the time.

573
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,333
Hey.

574
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,916
Your friend yesterday, what's her name?

575
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,750
-Sur?
-Mmm.

576
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,416
How did she get so wasted like that?

577
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,458
No idea. I went home earlier.

578
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:08,708
How did she get home?
You weren't keeping her safe?

579
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,666
NetCar.

580
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,666
That was awful!
You let her go alone in a NetCar?

581
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,125
What's wrong with that?

582
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,708
She got home in one piece.
What's your problem?

583
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,375
Crazy!

584
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,416
Those idiots!

585
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Can't even use their head.

586
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,958
Okay, Ms. Anggun, how can I help you?

587
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,583
I ordered a NetCar for my friend,

588
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:52,250
but I noticed the car arrived
at the destination so late.

589
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,375
It arrived an hour later than expected.

590
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:58,208
I'm afraid something
happened to my friend.

591
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,416
Um…

592
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,083
Did you experience any
unpleasant treatment from the driver?

593
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,416
Or did you lose anything?

594
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,750
I'm not sure. That's why we need to check.

595
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,791
Mmm…

596
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:13,166
-So were you the passenger?
-That's right.

597
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,500
Okay, then. Did you lose anything or…

598
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,041
That's why I'm not sure,
because I was asleep during the trip.

599
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,291
Can we just check it now?

600
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,708
-The computer's getting hot.
-All right, Miss.

601
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:31,208
Queue number 425…

602
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,875
So far,
the car's route was still on track.

603
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,791
Hold on. I need to make a call.

604
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,666
Queue number 430.

605
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,208
Anggun…

606
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,166
Have you ever been so drunk
you passed out?

607
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,625
I have.

608
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:22,833
But it happened because I skipped dinner.

609
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,666
Did you skip dinner that night?

610
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,541
No, I didn't.

611
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,041
Hmm.

612
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,833
Maybe it was your first time drinking?

613
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:35,416
But, Sur,

614
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,208
if you want to
share anything, I'll listen.

615
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,500
Do you feel like something's wrong?

616
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:45,750
I…

617
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,333
I don't feel any…

618
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,875
-It's just…
-Mmm?

619
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:52,625
Is it possible

620
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,083
that someone drugged my drinks?

621
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,875
Do you mean our guys?

622
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,541
That's impossible!

623
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,375
I know they are out of bounds

624
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,583
but I'm sure
they would never cross the line.

625
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:08,583
Silly.

626
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,625
Should I take a urine test?

627
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,416
Sur.

628
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,083
Are you sure?

629
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,416
Some guys were smoking weed at the party.

630
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,708
Did you take some?

631
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,375
Queue number 430.

632
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:32,416
-I don't remember.
-Hey.

633
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,958
Suppose you take that urine test
and it comes back positive?

634
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,541
Go on. Move it, sir! This is her.

635
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:42,000
Yes, she…

636
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:44,208
I drove her the other night, sir.

637
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,916
Well, if that's true, now explain.

638
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,416
How did you arrive
at the destination so late?

639
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,875
Well, yesterday I had
to stop at Kendil Park.

640
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,708
I had a flat tire.

641
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,833
And I had to change it.

642
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,750
I actually tried to wake her up.

643
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,416
But she wouldn't wake up.

644
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,541
So I continued to change the tire.

645
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,125
And, indeed, it took a while,

646
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,000
because I was alone, and it was raining.

647
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,958
Here. I took some pictures.

648
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:22,125
Take a look.

649
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,083
Can I take some photos, sir?

650
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,833
Oh. Yes, certainly. No problem.

651
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,916
I think I drove through
the nail traps on the road.

652
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,708
Did you change the tire
all by yourself? No one helped?

653
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:45,041
No, sir. I did it by myself.

654
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,166
And I'm sorry, Miss.

655
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,458
I had to help you walk home.

656
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,208
But when I was helping you out of the car,

657
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,791
you threw up.

658
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:59,250
It was all over the backseat
and my carpets.

659
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,333
Mmm. Really? Throwing up all over the car?

660
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:05,541
-Someone's been partying hard.
-We're good, sir.

661
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,125
That's it? Very well then.

662
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:11,958
However, Miss,
Mr. Burhan here is a good man.

663
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:15,208
The driver can actually
file the same complaint

664
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,500
if their customers
behaved inappropriately.

665
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,333
But he didn't.

666
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,875
Mmm-hmm. Shut up!

667
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,458
Uh, Anggun…

668
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,708
One more thing.

669
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,750
Hold on, Sur.
I need to take this.

670
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:40,833
Yeah.

671
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,791
I'm in the parking lot. Why?

672
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,625
Sprained ankle?

673
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,958
Have you called the doctor?
Why did you call me?

674
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,416
Hurry up and make the call!

675
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,041
Sorry. Come again?

676
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,583
No, just… Sorry for all the trouble.

677
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,875
-And thanks for the gelato.
-Anytime, Sur.

678
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,166
Promise to call me if you need anything.

679
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,708
I need to check on Tariq. What a crybaby.

680
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:08,375
-Take care.
-Thank you.

681
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,708
Dinner time, fishy-fishy.

682
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,916
Did you get the Medusa video?

683
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,291
Yes, Fouad and Gabriella were here.

684
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:24,708
-Did you steal any theses?
-Why can't you trust me?

685
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:27,625
I've been running up and down
all day long for you!

686
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,208
Come on! Anyone who catches
Medusa's gaze must drink again!

687
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,000
Who's next?

688
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,333
Who's next?

689
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,250
Okay. This can prove that
he intentionally aimed the Medusa at me.

690
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:47,125
-Any other videos?
-I think so. Just check again.

691
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:54,708
Chug! Chug! Chug!

692
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,291
See that?
He took the glass with a different color!

693
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,333
Damn! I knew it was him!

694
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,333
Sur! What's wrong with you?

695
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,833
-Are you okay?
-It's my low blood pressure.

696
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,416
From Gabriella's video,

697
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,166
I found out where Tariq was
before he came out with the Medusa.

698
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,166
From this dark room.

699
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,291
What was he doing
in that room for so long?

700
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,625
When is this gonna end, Sur?

701
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:02,250
You're broke.

702
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,333
I can't back you up forever.

703
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,541
-When will you go home?
-I don't want to go home.

704
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:11,833
-But at least if you go home, you--
-I said I don't want to!

705
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,000
I've sorted these files.

706
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,375
There are three theses here.

707
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,250
I'll help you sell them.

708
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:42,708
Hey, man.

709
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,583
I thought you were retired.

710
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,375
How many customers today?

711
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,250
Just three.

712
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:56,958
Shit. He's early.

713
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,375
-Adrian from downtown?
-Yes.

714
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,291
-Russian Literature thesis?
-Yes, correct.

715
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:09,583
Hey.

716
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,000
-Here you go.
-Wait.

717
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:17,750
Thanks.

718
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:28,791
Your cut.

719
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,208
So Amin's not here?

720
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:56,166
Yes, he's delivering documents.
He'll be back in half an hour.

721
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,958
I brought
this beef-nutmeg soup

722
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,416
and some money for my daughter.

723
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,791
Mmm.

724
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,250
She is Amin's friend.

725
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,791
-Her name?
-Sur. Suryani.

726
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,875
-Do you know her?
-Yes, I know her.

727
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,750
May I borrow your phone?

728
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,083
One-one-nine.

729
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:22,750
No answer, ma'am.

730
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:26,541
Let me know
if you hear anything.

731
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,083
-Here, save my number.
-Okay.

732
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,791
-Thanks, dear.
-You're welcome.

733
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,958
Why does he listen to this trash?

734
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,333
Your soup is downstairs.

735
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,291
These are what I've found so far.

736
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,041
These are last year's photos.

737
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,875
Mata Hari was holding
an illegal initiation.

738
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:27,541
Is there any photo that shows
you were part of that initiation?

739
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:29,541
Hold on, sir.

740
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,916
Can you see Tariq putting
the drug into his pocket, sir?

741
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,833
He suspiciously locked himself up
in this room for an hour,

742
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,041
and suddenly he brought these drinks out,

743
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,416
then set me up to drink it.

744
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:51,625
What if he'd drugged my drink, sir?

745
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,333
Because I passed out shortly afterward.

746
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:01,500
Well, this is
a serious accusation, Suryani.

747
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:05,875
But on top of everything,
your case is about the selfies.

748
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:10,791
Now where is the evidence
that your selfies were fabricated?

749
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,250
I'm still looking
for more evidence, sir.

750
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,625
If the faculty can help--

751
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:20,125
I know,
but if you can't show me real evidence,

752
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,916
I can't process anything. Hmm?

753
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,458
Such initiations are indeed
illegal on this campus.

754
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,458
I'll talk to the dean
of the Faculty of Arts &amp; Culture.

755
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:33,208
But for your case,
you'll need to find real evidence.

756
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:35,291
Now, I don't see any.

757
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Off you go.

758
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:44,833
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!

759
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:49,250
To control the dengue fever
outbreak in Indonesia,

760
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,666
the government is providing
free fumigation in this area.

761
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,458
Please remain inside your house
until the fumigation is finished.

762
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:03,166
We will get rid of Aedes mosquitoes
from your houses.

763
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:06,291
To stop the outbreak,

764
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:08,333
always take precautions.

765
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,791
I didn't share any photos!

766
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:24,250
Bullshit! Those were
last year's initiation photos

767
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,958
and you were the photographer!

768
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,916
But I never showed them to the dean!

769
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,791
Because of your photos,
the dean cancelled our Kyoto funds!

770
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,583
Why do you hold grudges against us?

771
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,625
-Just admit it.
-It's not me, you asshole!

772
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:40,750
I don't care if you get wasted
all the time, but don't drag us along!

773
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,208
Go drink with your boy toys!

774
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,541
But I lost my scholarship
because of the initiation!

775
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,583
Stay out of this!

776
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:48,875
Huh?

777
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,041
Tariq! Stop! Stop it!

778
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,250
We're fine. We are still going to Kyoto.

779
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,166
I told them that was not an initiation,

780
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:58,000
but that it was
part of our acting training.

781
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,083
But why did she have to leak those photos?

782
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,750
-It wasn't me, asshole!
-It wasn't Farah, you idiot!

783
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,875
Stop accusing her!

784
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,625
-Who then?
-The dean didn't tell me shit!

785
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,375
What's done is done!

786
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:11,000
Now we must regain our focus. You get it?

787
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,125
Farah, I'm really sorry.
We didn't mean to accuse you…

788
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,166
Farah!

789
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:21,791
Enough! Back to rehearsal.

790
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:24,291
-Wait.
-For God's sake.

791
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,500
What did you mean?

792
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,916
Losing your scholarship
because of the initiation?

793
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:30,791
Huh?

794
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,333
You drugged my drink, right?

795
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:38,625
What do you mean?

796
00:56:47,041 --> 00:56:48,208
Tariq!

797
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,083
Come here! Stop hiding!

798
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:54,291
Medusa is coming!

799
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,083
What did you put in her drink?

800
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,708
Why did you give her the glass
with a different color?

801
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:01,833
What do you mean?

802
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:04,458
Why did that drink make her pass out?

803
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:09,125
-Where did you get these videos?
-From everyone's social media.

804
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,125
I saw you put some drugs into your pocket.

805
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,458
What was it?

806
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,291
Answer her!

807
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,416
Well, that's… That's…

808
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,333
Why would I drug her drink?

809
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:23,500
But then why did you
lock yourself up in here?

810
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,875
-I swear I didn't put anything!
-Stop! Enough!

811
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:28,666
Let's go check the CCTV at my house
and put an end to this.

812
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,083
Please, Rama.
It's 14 days before we go to Kyoto!

813
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:36,458
-I need to ship our installations!
-We don't keep any secrets here.

814
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,250
If you actually didn't do anything,

815
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,791
why are you so reluctant
to check the CCTV? Huh?

816
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,541
Go check it yourself!
I have to organize the shipping now!

817
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,125
I don't care!

818
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,666
I want everyone to come tonight!

819
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,208
So there won't be
any mistrust among us! Got it?

820
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,458
Damn!

821
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,291
Just grab any drink you want.

822
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:14,541
Okay, let's go to the night of the party.

823
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,083
Fast-forward until Sur
got the shot from Tariq.

824
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,375
Rewind a bit.

825
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,833
Just switch
to that dark room now!

826
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,125
Switch to the pantry cam.

827
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,041
Zoom it.
See if he put in any drugs.

828
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,625
No drugs.

829
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:04,833
No drugs. Just the whiskey.

830
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,833
Rewind again, Rama.

831
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,625
Why did he stay there for so long?

832
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,416
Here.

833
01:00:00,125 --> 01:00:01,750
Drugs from my therapist.

834
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:07,291
Why do you all keep torturing me? Huh?

835
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:12,458
I always serve you, you, you!

836
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:16,916
If you all need something,
who's been helping you?

837
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:19,333
Who have you been whining to? Huh?

838
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,416
-And now my privacy--
-Okay.

839
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27,583
We're sorry we didn't know
you've been under so much pressure.

840
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,916
All this happened because
you never shared anything with us.

841
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,541
I… I thought I knew you.

842
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:39,333
I didn't know that you've been
taking all of these medications.

843
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:42,041
We are your family, your safe place.

844
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,666
You can tell us anything.

845
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,666
Guys,

846
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,458
let's give Tariq a big Mata Hari hug.

847
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:53,916
What are you doing?
I am sick of you all!

848
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,625
I always have to look okay, always fine.

849
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:58,958
Everything has to be treated
as if we're family.

850
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:02,250
Just let me do my work and leave me alone!

851
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,750
-No, that's not how it works.
-You too, Anggun?

852
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,041
How long have we been working together?

853
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:10,083
How long have you known me?

854
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,458
How could you accuse me?

855
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:14,458
Just so you know,

856
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,166
we lost one working day by coming here!

857
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,208
Just to deal with a bullshit accusation

858
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,583
by a new kid
who doesn't believe she got wasted!

859
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:24,250
It's only two weeks before we go to Kyoto!

860
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:28,041
And after this,
who must clean this mess? Me, right?

861
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:33,208
You complain about shit
and who do you blame? Me!

862
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,625
"Tariq, do this! Tariq, do that!"
That's bullshit!

863
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:39,750
Family? What a fake family!

864
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:40,750
Damn!

865
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:42,916
Riq…

866
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:46,750
Let him go.

867
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,083
Okay, then…

868
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:56,541
Sur.

869
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:00,125
It's clear now.
Tariq didn't put drugs in your drink.

870
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,708
Okay, look.

871
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,375
Sur said someone fabricated her selfies.

872
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,291
-Let's fast-forward to check that.
-Okay.

873
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,666
Thank you.

874
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,833
Thirsty, Sur?

875
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,041
Slow it down, Rama.

876
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,333
Pause it.

877
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,916
For God's sake.

878
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,708
Why do you do this?

879
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,833
Why blame others
if it's your own doing?

880
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,708
Let's fast-forward until
Sur goes home, so it's clear.

881
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,750
Pause it. I took your wallet,

882
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,791
to see your address,
to order you a NetCar.

883
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,625
Just zoom it. That's not a phone, right?

884
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,250
Nobody touched your phone.

885
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,750
Yes.

886
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,166
Tariq went home.

887
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,375
Sur went home.

888
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,166
Jesslyn, Abu, Kirana went home.

889
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,000
After everyone went home, I took off
to take photos of the Milky Way,

890
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,041
for the installation sets' revision.

891
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,625
How is it, Sur?

892
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,166
Satisfied?

893
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,333
Brother…

894
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,625
Can I check one more time?

895
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,791
-I want to take notes, just to be sure.
-Come on, Sur.

896
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:18,583
Why so serious, guys?

897
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,958
My oxtail soup is ready.

898
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,333
Let's eat!

899
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:24,750
Yes, Uncle.

900
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,750
Come on, while it's still hot.

901
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,041
Here, Sur.

902
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,750
Do you know how to operate this?

903
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:36,833
Yes.

904
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,875
What a mess!

905
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:19,541
Why aren't you eating?

906
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,541
Here.

907
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,625
So you won't pass out.

908
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,833
Thank you, Uncle.

909
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:27,375
My husband is so pushy, isn't he?

910
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:28,875
Auntie.

911
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,833
Everyone who has finished eating,
please go back to campus.

912
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:33,833
I heard
about your faculty, Sur.

913
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:39,750
I can't believe you lost the scholarship
over some selfies.

914
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:42,208
Can't you appeal the decision?

915
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:47,291
Uh, I was told that I violated
the moral clause in the requirements.

916
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:50,625
What?
How do they measure someone's morality?

917
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,958
If I may ask you,
how much is your tuition?

918
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,166
4 million Rupiah.

919
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,416
And what semester are you in now?

920
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:02,083
I still have six more semesters.
This is only my first year.

921
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,875
Six semesters. Six times four million.

922
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,291
-It's around 24 million, right?
-Mmm.

923
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,750
I'll help you pay your tuition.

924
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,458
But next week,

925
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:19,208
I expect you
to start working on our website.

926
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:22,083
You'll still get paid, of course.

927
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:24,083
How does that sound?

928
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,041
I'm sorry, Uncle.
I don't want to trouble you.

929
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,791
You're a bright student.

930
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:34,541
Losing your scholarship
because of drinking is nonsense!

931
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,208
Uncle, Auntie, we're leaving.
We're ordering a NetCar.

932
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,208
No, please. Hold on. Rama!

933
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,791
-We're fine, Uncle.
-Drive them home, Rama.

934
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,250
It's hard to get a NetCar from here.

935
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,291
Last time was easy, Auntie.

936
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:52,375
Really? It usually
takes hours to get them.

937
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:54,541
This house is too far from the main road.

938
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,625
There are not many
NetCar drivers around this area.

939
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,333
Please,
let Rama drive you home.

940
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:11,791
Let it go, Sur.
Everyone makes mistakes.

941
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,958
Don't overthink it.

942
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,000
You've got money
from Rama's dad to pay your tuition.

943
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,500
You can relax now.

944
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:24,750
From the CCTV records, I've counted
how many drinks I had before I passed out.

945
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:26,958
How many?

946
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,333
Four.

947
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,791
Can you actually pass out
after drinking four drinks?

948
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,500
I think I have to try drinking again.

949
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,583
If I don't pass out after four drinks,

950
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:56,708
then someone must've
drugged my drinks that night.

951
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,916
Slow down, Sur.
Don't gulp it down like that.

952
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:12,708
I don't feel anything.

953
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,333
Lighting and ambience are important.

954
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,791
I'll set it up like Rama's party.

955
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,208
Sur.

956
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,125
It'd be nice to see the sea now.

957
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,791
I miss the sea.

958
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,166
Look…

959
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:08,375
I've had three more shots.
I'm still not feeling anything.

960
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,000
Try dancing along, Sur. Come on!

961
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:12,583
Get up.

962
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,250
I'm still sober.

963
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,708
Brands matter, you know.

964
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:30,750
Rama's drinks were all imported brands.

965
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,208
I'll drink more then.

966
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:35,250
I can change the music
if you don't like it.

967
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:36,708
Check this out, Sur.

968
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,375
In West Sumatra,

969
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:43,000
there's a photocopier monument!

970
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,708
Ooh.

971
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,833
I think I drank too much.
My face must be red!

972
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,750
No, don't use a mirror!

973
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:27,208
Use Amelia instead.

974
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:31,083
Go on!

975
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:32,875
Come on!

976
01:10:39,416 --> 01:10:40,458
Your face!

977
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:45,625
Look at yours!

978
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,791
-Try your armpit!
-Really?

979
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,333
Foot! Your foot!

980
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:00,833
What the hell?

981
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,333
Just like Mata Hari's installation sets.

982
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,833
Only one portion?

983
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,125
My friend said she's not hungry.

984
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,583
If the car stopped here,

985
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:33,458
it might have run over the nail trap
on the previous block.

986
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,958
Is there a tire shop
near here that opens at night?

987
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:46,083
I'm not sure, man.

988
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,500
I'm only open in the morning.

989
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,250
What are you staring at?

990
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,125
I thought this was
the statue Rama's dad made?

991
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,000
It's not?

992
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,958
The signature on this is different.

993
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,791
But I've seen this statue before.

994
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,166
This photo was in Rama's inbox.

995
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:28,791
Someone must've sent this photo of
Kendil Park's statue to Rama that night.

996
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:29,791
But why?

997
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,833
Are you sure it's not one
of the statues at Rama's house?

998
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:36,166
This one's clearly different.
Not one of his dad's.

999
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,625
Did Rama go to Kendil Park that night?

1000
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,750
Why would he go there at night?

1001
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,875
He said he went in his car after the party

1002
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:51,083
to photograph the Milky Way
for the installation.

1003
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,458
We can't get a hold of him.

1004
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:59,458
You guys should stop depending on Tariq!

1005
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:04,041
So although Tariq
still hasn't joined us today,

1006
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:09,833
I still expect you guys
to do your work well, okay?

1007
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,833
Cross-check everything!

1008
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,083
Yes, Sur.

1009
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:18,375
What if we create
an official email for Mata Hari?

1010
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:22,000
So on Anggun's business card, for example,

1011
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,625
we can write anggun@matahari.com.

1012
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,875
-How long will it take?
-Not long.

1013
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:29,041
I'll send a link to everyone.

1014
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:33,916
You type in your existing email
and sign up for the new one.

1015
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,750
Fine. All department heads,
do what Sur just said.

1016
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,875
Now let's go. Don't waste any more time.

1017
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:42,916
Let's go.

1018
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,916
-Samsul?
-Huh?

1019
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,916
Rama said he modified the installation.

1020
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,208
The Milky Way one.

1021
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:00,500
Yes. Why?

1022
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,958
Can I take a look?

1023
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,083
You're too late. They're already packed.

1024
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,916
The van will take them soon.

1025
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:07,708
What do you need them for?

1026
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:10,541
I want to take pictures of them.
For our website.

1027
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:14,500
Oh. I'll just send you the raw files
that Rama sent me.

1028
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:16,416
Before they were printed on the lightbox.

1029
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,541
-Do you have them?
-Of course. I printed them.

1030
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,333
I'll send you the link later.
Got loads to do now.

1031
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:25,750
-Okay. Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

1032
01:15:38,541 --> 01:15:41,041
Your show's video is uploaded.

1033
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,041
When you went home from the party,

1034
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,291
was it raining?

1035
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:57,625
Yes, it was. Soon after I left.

1036
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:01,583
And I think it was raining
all over the city that night.

1037
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm buying some cigarettes.
You need anything?

1038
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:01,541
Why did you close the door?

1039
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:15,250
Okay.

1040
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,625
Look this way.

1041
01:18:25,666 --> 01:18:26,916
Tilt your head up a bit.

1042
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,541
If you can get
their passwords this easily,

1043
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:32,708
why didn't you do this earlier?

1044
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,208
It's not that easy.

1045
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,125
We still need their login approval.

1046
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:40,000
Wouldn't he be able to find out
if his email was being hacked?

1047
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,125
That's why I need your help.

1048
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:45,791
Lure him to print something in here.

1049
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,916
So when he's logged in
with the computer downstairs,

1050
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,500
I'll also log in
to his email from this laptop.

1051
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,083
He won't realize
there are two devices logging in,

1052
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,541
and he'll approve them both.

1053
01:18:57,125 --> 01:18:58,458
Are you sure about this?

1054
01:18:58,541 --> 01:18:59,666
Doing this shit again?

1055
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,208
His dad's gonna help pay your tuition.

1056
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,000
What if you're wrong again?
And you get caught?

1057
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:10,541
I mean, what's wrong
if Rama actually went to that park?

1058
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,458
Not everyone wants to harm you.

1059
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,166
I promise this will be the last time.

1060
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,958
Then I'll be out of your hair.

1061
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:20,041
But I need to check his location history.

1062
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,041
Sorry, Rama.

1063
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:28,625
The script I was supposed
to print was accidentally deleted.

1064
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:29,791
How come?

1065
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:33,083
When I was removing
files from the computer,

1066
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,083
your script also got deleted.

1067
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,541
You can access your email now.

1068
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,166
The Wi-Fi is fixed.

1069
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:40,750
Okay.

1070
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:43,625
-Done. Should I also print it now?
-No need.

1071
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,083
-Shit!
-I'll take care of it.

1072
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,916
You haven't paid your electricity bill?

1073
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:01,750
I forgot.

1074
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,791
Oh, well.
I've downloaded the files.

1075
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:09,125
Just check the download folder, and…

1076
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,750
Please log out of my email later.

1077
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:13,791
I haven't logged it out yet.

1078
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,583
Yes, I'll do that.

1079
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,583
So what about the fish?

1080
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,666
Uh, I still have some.

1081
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,875
I have the red one. Do you want it?

1082
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,625
Not that fish.

1083
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,375
The fish in the drawer.

1084
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,666
What do you mean?

1085
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,708
Come on, Amin.

1086
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,250
I need them.

1087
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,041
I've been stressing out lately.

1088
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:53,916
Lack of inspiration.

1089
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:59,416
You know,
the fish in the drawer inspire me.

1090
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:04,541
Let me know if you have new fish.

1091
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,416
Sur, Rama left. Turn the lights on…

1092
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,291
Open the drawer,

1093
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,416
or I'll spread this photo
of you selling theses.

1094
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,250
What the hell, Sur?
What's wrong with you? Huh?

1095
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,833
What are you hiding in the drawer?

1096
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:32,833
Drugs?

1097
01:22:32,916 --> 01:22:34,041
No! What the hell?

1098
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,291
Then open it!

1099
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,791
Or I'm sending this photo
to the dean, so you'll get fired.

1100
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:43,875
Open it!

1101
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,125
Yes, be patient!

1102
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,708
-Do you see any drugs?
-What's this?

1103
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,291
That's my hard drive!

1104
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,833
What was Rama talking about?

1105
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,333
You ungrateful piece of shit.

1106
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:14,375
I was back to selling theses
just to help you.

1107
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:15,708
Damn, Sur! What are you doing?

1108
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:18,500
Why did you steal the data?
What are they for?

1109
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:21,125
Sur… Sur!

1110
01:24:25,666 --> 01:24:29,041
Early this year, my sister got sick.
Dengue fever.

1111
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,625
She was hospitalized. I needed money.

1112
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,708
Rama came to me and asked me
to steal the students' data.

1113
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,708
500K for every student,
but that's all!

1114
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,208
I checked all the photos, Sur!

1115
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:46,875
I make sure there are no nudes
or anything like that.

1116
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,583
They are just normal daily photos!

1117
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,500
Rama only needs them for inspiration.

1118
01:24:52,416 --> 01:24:53,625
That's all.

1119
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:56,958
And you see the result,
you guys won the competition!

1120
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:59,458
-You're going to Kyoto!
-Bastard!

1121
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:00,583
I did nothing wrong, Sur!

1122
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,500
Eight hours, please.

1123
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:35,041
14,000 per hour.

1124
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,125
KENDIL PARK

1125
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,958
Did you have anything to eat?
I'll order for you.

1126
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:04,875
I'm good, thank you.

1127
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,708
Two iced teas
and another plate of noodles, please.

1128
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:09,958
Coming.

1129
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:13,000
Why are you hiding from your mother?

1130
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,333
Did you run away?

1131
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:16,958
Got some problems.

1132
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:19,083
Your scholarship?

1133
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:21,875
Earlier, you said you lost it
because of the initiation?

1134
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:24,958
-Actually, I want to--
-I've told you from the get-go.

1135
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,708
You shouldn't have joined them.

1136
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,083
It's better to focus on your studies.

1137
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:34,750
I actually

1138
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,041
have something to ask you.

1139
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:45,083
Did you ever model for Mata Hari?

1140
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,500
What do you mean?

1141
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:55,708
Is this your tattoo?

1142
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:58,500
-What made you think that?
-But it is, isn't it?

1143
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,125
Where did you get that photo?

1144
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,333
Mine's here too.

1145
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,625
This is a photo of my back.

1146
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:10,666
Answer me. Where did you
get those photos from?

1147
01:28:13,416 --> 01:28:14,875
Have you been hacking me?

1148
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,125
You leaked those
initiation photos, didn't you? Huh?

1149
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:20,000
But this is your tattoo, right?

1150
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,750
If it's really yours, we must report this
to the ethics board now.

1151
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:24,166
Stop it. No use.

1152
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,291
If we testify together,
we'll have strong evidence.

1153
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,625
Please help me. Let's report this now.

1154
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:30,625
Stop!

1155
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:44,375
I'd like to submit this evidence.

1156
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:48,208
Photos of Rama's installation.

1157
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:50,041
The photos of my back.

1158
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:55,333
And the metadata of those photos showing
that these photos were taken at 2:00 a.m.

1159
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:58,250
The same time
that my NetCar stopped at the park.

1160
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,375
Mmm.

1161
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:04,083
Are you 100% sure
that these are photos of your back?

1162
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,250
If you have more evidence,

1163
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,083
it could be useful for our investigation.

1164
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,375
-That's all, sir.
-All right then.

1165
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:21,458
I will form a team for this investigation.

1166
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:25,083
I'll call some of the university's
administrators to help us out.

1167
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:28,583
Do you have any digital files
of this physical evidence?

1168
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,708
Yes, sir.

1169
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:32,125
-I'll send them to you.
-Okay.

1170
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:41,833
Sir, could you keep
my identity confidential?

1171
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:44,958
Yes. Of course.

1172
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,666
It's part of our procedure.

1173
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,166
To keep your identity in confidence
during the investigation.

1174
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,625
Hello?

1175
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:52,125
These documents, did you make them?

1176
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:55,208
-Hmm?
-Rama Soemarno just called us.

1177
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,083
He's on the way here with his lawyer.

1178
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:03,875
He wants to report you
to the police for defamation.

1179
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,541
Wait, what is this about, sir?

1180
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:12,250
These documents you made
have gone viral in our campus.

1181
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:15,416
That's why Rama
will file a lawsuit against you.

1182
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,916
Sir, I never made them go viral!

1183
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,125
I gave them
to the ethics board for investigation.

1184
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:24,750
They should be held responsible for this!

1185
01:31:24,833 --> 01:31:26,916
Yes, yes.

1186
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,708
But still, you're the one
who prepared these documents.

1187
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:30,666
And listen,

1188
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:37,041
I don't want the university to get dragged
into this case if this goes to court.

1189
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:41,666
Our faculty is going to send
Mata Hari off to Japan soon.

1190
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,833
We don't want this case
to jeopardize that.

1191
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,375
I've also talked to Rama

1192
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:52,875
to try to amicably resolve this issue.

1193
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,250
Sir, please listen to me!

1194
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,916
Sir.

1195
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,250
Please forgive my daughter.

1196
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,625
She makes mistakes. Please forgive her.

1197
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,833
Please, take a seat first.

1198
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:06,416
Please, sir.

1199
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,750
Sir…

1200
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,958
Let's just settle this here.

1201
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:14,416
My daughter is out of line.
I'll punish her myself.

1202
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,541
Sir, take a seat.
Let us explain everything first.

1203
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,625
I never made those documents go viral!

1204
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:23,750
I submitted them
to the ethics board for investigation!

1205
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:26,250
If they've gone viral, it's their fault!

1206
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,166
Miss, calm down.

1207
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,375
You prepared those documents
and shared them with people.

1208
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:35,250
Now Rama Soemarno is being
labelled as a rapist, a creep, a pervert!

1209
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,583
She's ruined my client's reputation.

1210
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:42,125
And you tried
to hack into my client's phone.

1211
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:44,625
Everything you've done is against the law!

1212
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:45,708
I have evidence.

1213
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:53,375
-Please, forgive my daughter.
-Stop saying sorry!

1214
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,500
See this photo?

1215
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:03,500
This photo was used
for Mata Hari's installation sets.

1216
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:06,791
It was taken at 2:00 a.m.,
when my NetCar stopped at the park.

1217
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:08,083
And it's a photo of my back!

1218
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,333
Sur, watch your mouth!

1219
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:10,791
Sir, please.

1220
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:12,958
Calm down.

1221
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:13,958
Sur.

1222
01:33:14,833 --> 01:33:16,083
That's not your back.

1223
01:33:16,666 --> 01:33:18,416
I want to investigate these photos!

1224
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,000
Let's take these photos
to the forensics team.

1225
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:23,333
And we can check
the other installation photos.

1226
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,458
These were taken without my consent.

1227
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:29,166
I know you are still upset
that you lost your scholarship.

1228
01:33:29,916 --> 01:33:33,291
-It's true, I took the photos at 2:00 a.m.
-Please. Let me take care of this.

1229
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,833
But if you want to know the truth,

1230
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:37,875
I took pictures of the stars.

1231
01:33:38,541 --> 01:33:41,666
Those are the night skies. The Milky Way.

1232
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,416
What's your proof?

1233
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:46,958
It was raining all over Jakarta.
No way you could take those pictures!

1234
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:47,916
Sur.

1235
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,083
Weren't you drunk that night?

1236
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:54,208
Or are you still hallucinating now?

1237
01:33:54,291 --> 01:33:56,791
That's why I need help
to investigate this, sir!

1238
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:57,958
All right then.

1239
01:33:58,041 --> 01:34:00,583
If Sur still insists,
let's take this to court.

1240
01:34:01,333 --> 01:34:04,166
And if we go to court, Sur,

1241
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:08,458
you will face everyone
mentioned in those documents.

1242
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:10,333
-Including the NetCar driver.
-Sir.

1243
01:34:10,416 --> 01:34:12,333
Please, if possible,

1244
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:15,666
let's settle this problem internally.

1245
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,541
-Please, I'm begging you…
-Dad, stop it!

1246
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,708
-Why are you on your knees?
-Shut up!

1247
01:34:21,416 --> 01:34:22,416
Shut up!

1248
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:26,250
You've made mistakes,
and now you want to make another one?

1249
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:28,416
Sir, please.

1250
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,125
Stand up.

1251
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:32,791
What I need is nothing more
than a clarification.

1252
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,458
-Rama, please.
-Let me speak.

1253
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,125
In the Mata Hari family,
we always support each other.

1254
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:40,958
Rama, please let me take it from here.

1255
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,333
And we still consider Sur
as a part of our theater family.

1256
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,041
We prefer to solve
this issue like a family.

1257
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:50,500
Moreover, we're currently busy
preparing a show for Kyoto.

1258
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:54,250
That's why I just want Sur

1259
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:57,333
to make a public apology
and clarification.

1260
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:00,541
Then tomorrow,

1261
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:04,166
we can go back to being
a family again in the theater.

1262
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:06,166
Sir, ma'am.

1263
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:08,291
Regarding Sur's scholarship,

1264
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,875
my father has agreed to pay
for Sur's tuition until she graduates.

1265
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,291
Also, she can still work for my father.

1266
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:18,166
And receive her salary.

1267
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,333
I want to proceed with the case!

1268
01:35:23,416 --> 01:35:24,958
Suryani, enough!

1269
01:35:35,791 --> 01:35:37,083
I, Suryani,

1270
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:41,583
would like to apologize to Rama Soemarno

1271
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:46,291
for making false accusations.

1272
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:51,000
And if all my allegations,

1273
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:53,666
or hypothesis,

1274
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,750
have damaged Rama Soemarno's reputation,

1275
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:00,583
and that of other parties,

1276
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:06,291
I would like to clarify

1277
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:10,250
that all of them were not true.

1278
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:17,250
I deeply apologize

1279
01:36:18,708 --> 01:36:20,083
and I promise

1280
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,750
that I won't do such things anymore.

1281
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:29,958
Rama Soemarno's family and I

1282
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,375
have agreed

1283
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:36,833
to settle this case amicably,

1284
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:41,000
outside the court.

1285
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:48,041
I, Suryani, would like to apologize
to Rama Soemarno

1286
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:52,041
for making false accusations.

1287
01:36:54,583 --> 01:36:56,500
And if all my allegations, or hypothesis…

1288
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:26,083
Mom? Where are we going?

1289
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,875
What's going on, Mom?

1290
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:00,708
You're my daughter.

1291
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:03,500
My daughter.

1292
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:09,458
When you were holding
those photos earlier,

1293
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,750
I knew for certain,

1294
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,166
it was the birthmark on your back.

1295
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:20,333
Sur.

1296
01:38:21,583 --> 01:38:22,833
Tell me.

1297
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:26,458
What happened, actually?

1298
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,083
It's been a week.

1299
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:23,875
Yes.

1300
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:27,750
So unobtainable?

1301
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:39,750
Yati, Sur.

1302
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,791
I just called the lab.

1303
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:48,166
It's unlikely that they'll find
any trace of sedative in your urine.

1304
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:50,500
Because it's already more than three days.

1305
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:52,833
At the time,

1306
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:56,375
I was scared to do the urine test.
There were drugs at the party.

1307
01:39:56,458 --> 01:40:00,375
The lab would never
disclose your test result.

1308
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,625
So you wouldn't need to worry about that.

1309
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,750
But if you and Sur
would like to stay here first,

1310
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:09,500
while gathering more evidence,

1311
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:10,625
you're very welcome.

1312
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:12,583
Sur.

1313
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,541
You stay here.

1314
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,666
It's useless to be with your dad.

1315
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:19,958
What about you, Mom?

1316
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,541
I have to go home.

1317
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:25,083
Who's going to run the diner?

1318
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:28,250
He doesn't have
the right to kick me out anyway.

1319
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:32,000
If anything happens, call me right away.

1320
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:42,166
Siti, please take care of my daughter.

1321
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:44,791
-I'm leaving you some money, just in case.
-Don't worry, Yati.

1322
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,625
-I'll call some friends to help us.
-Hello.

1323
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:54,625
Sur.

1324
01:40:58,375 --> 01:40:59,958
Those are my tattoos.

1325
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:03,500
I'm sorry I didn't help you earlier.

1326
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:09,500
I brought someone here.

1327
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:14,041
His body was
in Rama's installation sets as well.

1328
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:18,375
After my mother died,

1329
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,375
my therapist told me
to do activities to distract myself.

1330
01:41:21,458 --> 01:41:22,500
Thank you, Miss Siti.

1331
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:24,541
That bastard was like family to me.

1332
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,375
I've never showed this scar to anyone.

1333
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,458
That bastard must have taken a picture
of it when I got wasted.

1334
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:35,000
And I was in denial because
I was afraid of losing a family.

1335
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:41,250
Rama was the one
who invited me in to join Mata Hari.

1336
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,333
The activities helped me
to get over an abusive relationship.

1337
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:48,041
I went to Mata Hari's party as well.
I was their photographer.

1338
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:50,750
I enjoy drinking.

1339
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:55,291
But that night, I felt dizzier than usual.

1340
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:56,541
After only two glasses.

1341
01:41:57,458 --> 01:42:00,833
I should've completely blacked out
if he'd drugged me.

1342
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:05,416
But my drinking habit might have
made me more resistant to sedatives.

1343
01:42:07,208 --> 01:42:08,500
And I remember…

1344
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,083
I was taken into a car,

1345
01:42:15,166 --> 01:42:17,166
and I saw someone approaching.

1346
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,875
My clothes were stripped slowly…

1347
01:42:25,458 --> 01:42:27,666
then I heard camera shutters.

1348
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,916
I wrote everything here.

1349
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:35,083
Why didn't you ever
tell anyone about this?

1350
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:36,708
I did.

1351
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,625
They told me
it was all in a drunkard's head.

1352
01:42:40,708 --> 01:42:42,791
That what I heard
was the sound of bottles clinking.

1353
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,583
"Wasn't it normal for you
to get laid after drinking?"

1354
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:49,708
They told me that I was making things up.

1355
01:42:50,666 --> 01:42:52,416
And I decided to leave Mata Hari.

1356
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:54,666
At that time, you…

1357
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:57,125
And Tariq…

1358
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:58,833
Did you guys go home in a NetCar?

1359
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,291
I was told that I did.

1360
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:03,250
Did you remember the driver or the car?

1361
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,208
I didn't.

1362
01:43:05,291 --> 01:43:07,166
I didn't even know who booked the car.

1363
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:09,708
-I have a picture of my NetCar.
-Let me see.

1364
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:13,750
Here.

1365
01:43:15,666 --> 01:43:17,458
No. I don't remember anything.

1366
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:19,791
Stop. Zoom in.

1367
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:27,583
Komodo Parking Lot.

1368
01:43:27,666 --> 01:43:30,458
Do you think this NetCar
is somehow related to Rama?

1369
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:33,750
Since Rama's house is far
and it's hard to get a NetCar there.

1370
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:36,000
You mean a fake NetCar?

1371
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,541
No, because the driver was from
NetCar, it made Rama seem innocent.

1372
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:43,125
That driver could've been asked
to stand by near Rama's house.

1373
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:45,125
So if a booking was made,
he'd get the order.

1374
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,916
So far, I have these pictures
of Kendil Park's statue from Rama's inbox.

1375
01:43:50,583 --> 01:43:52,166
But I don't know who sent them to him.

1376
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:56,416
The only way we can find more evidence
is by checking the driver's phone.

1377
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,125
But you met him in the NetCar office.

1378
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:00,416
What if he remembers you?

1379
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:02,458
He might go and tell Rama.

1380
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,791
I'll go.

1381
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:07,833
I think nobody ordered me
a NetCar whenever I got drunk.

1382
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:11,208
Are you sure?

1383
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:22,041
Thank you, Miss Siti.

1384
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:07,500
Feeling sleepy?

1385
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:09,416
Go have some coffee.

1386
01:45:45,083 --> 01:45:48,208
How was your day, little one?

1387
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:56,000
Ah. I'll go get some rest first.

1388
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:23,208
Excuse me.

1389
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:24,625
Burhan!

1390
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:26,666
-Burhan?
-Mmm?

1391
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,291
Ah. Good afternoon, sir.
I'm from the Mata Hari theater group,

1392
01:46:31,375 --> 01:46:36,125
Rama Soemarno sent me
to give this parcel to Mr. Burhan.

1393
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:39,541
Are you sure it's the right address?

1394
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:43,083
This is Komodo Street, right?

1395
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:47,083
Oh-ho. Komodo is up there, not here.

1396
01:46:49,583 --> 01:46:51,208
Let me see the address.

1397
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:57,708
There's no address written here.

1398
01:47:00,666 --> 01:47:05,333
Rama told me to go to Komodo Street
to give this to Mr. Burhan.

1399
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,125
So I asked people around here,

1400
01:47:08,208 --> 01:47:12,041
where Mr. Burhan lives,
and they told me to come here.

1401
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,958
Our group just won a theater competition.

1402
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:18,375
And we'd like to deliver
gifts to our friends.

1403
01:47:18,875 --> 01:47:21,166
I see.

1404
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:24,208
Thank you.

1405
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:31,375
Sorry, ma'am.

1406
01:47:32,583 --> 01:47:36,208
May I borrow a charger for my phone?

1407
01:47:36,291 --> 01:47:39,666
My phone's dead and I need
to order a car to go home.

1408
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:42,166
Didn't you drive here?

1409
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,791
No, I…

1410
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:47,333
My friends dropped me off
and went to deliver other parcels.

1411
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:49,500
Where are you going?

1412
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:50,750
Further south.

1413
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:53,500
I can take
an offline order, if you want.

1414
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:56,416
That'd be great, sir.
I can pay you with cash.

1415
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,500
Okay.

1416
01:47:57,583 --> 01:47:59,208
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Bye.

1417
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:17,583
Uh, sir, may I use your phone?
I need to call a friend.

1418
01:48:17,666 --> 01:48:21,291
My battery is too low.

1419
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:23,750
I can't take an order if my phone's dead.

1420
01:48:23,833 --> 01:48:26,500
And I left the charger at home.

1421
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:58,250
This looks bad.

1422
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:06,541
May I use your phone
to call a nearby repair shop?

1423
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:10,416
Don't worry.
NetCar Center can help us out.

1424
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:14,125
NetCar's office is far, sir.
An hour from here. I'm in a rush.

1425
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:31,125
This will do, sir.

1426
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:35,250
I'll just call the mechanic,
no new tire needed.

1427
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:38,125
Let me use your phone.

1428
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:42,500
Well, let's just change it together now.

1429
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:07,250
Can you help me lift this tire?

1430
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:10,583
You said you could
change a tire by yourself.

1431
01:50:34,833 --> 01:50:35,750
Tariq?

1432
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,291
Tariq?

1433
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:42,958
What did you do to him?

1434
01:51:08,916 --> 01:51:10,916
What did you guys do to him?

1435
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,583
Please watch him, ma'am.
We have to take this man to the police.

1436
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:20,208
We must act quickly.
He texted Rama already.

1437
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:26,125
Mr. Burhan, I'm done.

1438
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,708
The mechanic is on the way here.

1439
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:31,458
After you change the tire,
take Sur home immediately.

1440
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:33,708
Yes, understood.

1441
01:52:50,833 --> 01:52:51,750
Okay.

1442
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,583
So in this phone,

1443
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,583
there are eight videos
he secretly recorded.

1444
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,875
A video of you, Farah.

1445
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:04,083
Of Tariq.

1446
01:53:05,458 --> 01:53:07,583
Of me, and five other girls.

1447
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,375
It all happened in his car.

1448
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:13,250
No, it could be more.

1449
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:15,875
It might've happened
to everyone you saw in Amin's hard drive.

1450
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:19,166
You call every victim in the video
and tell them to come here.

1451
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:20,500
We'll go to the police.

1452
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:24,375
And don't forget Burhan's car.
We'll bring it along as evidence.

1453
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,041
The police?

1454
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,083
Our videos would just go viral!

1455
01:53:29,875 --> 01:53:32,791
Sur, haven't you learned anything? Huh?

1456
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:35,458
Didn't you see how rich Rama's dad is?

1457
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:37,333
You stole data from people, Sur.

1458
01:53:37,416 --> 01:53:38,333
You hacked them.

1459
01:53:38,416 --> 01:53:41,500
We beat up and abducted that driver!
We'd all go to jail!

1460
01:53:41,583 --> 01:53:44,833
Then why didn't you follow the plan?
Beating him up like that.

1461
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,875
We're not alone now.

1462
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:53,291
If we do this together,
our evidence is strong.

1463
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:56,625
What if we still lose?
And those videos go viral?

1464
01:53:57,583 --> 01:54:01,833
Our naked bodies will be out there
for people to see forever!

1465
01:54:01,916 --> 01:54:05,750
And the campus?
They'll certainly back the bastard up!

1466
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:07,500
And see what our friends did!

1467
01:54:07,583 --> 01:54:10,000
They shared our videos
instead of helping us!

1468
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:11,875
I've been holding this back for months.

1469
01:54:11,958 --> 01:54:14,708
It'll be even worse
to see that bastard walking free.

1470
01:54:14,791 --> 01:54:16,250
To see him every day!

1471
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:28,791
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!

1472
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:33,458
To control the dengue fever
outbreak in Indonesia,

1473
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:37,583
the government is providing
free fumigation in this area.

1474
01:54:38,583 --> 01:54:42,625
Please remain inside your house
until the fumigation is finished.

1475
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:47,958
We will get rid of Aedes mosquitoes
from your house.

1476
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:51,041
To stop the outbreak,

1477
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:54,000
always remember to take precautions, DCB.

1478
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:57,250
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1479
01:54:57,333 --> 01:55:01,250
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1480
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:04,833
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1481
01:55:04,916 --> 01:55:08,541
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1482
01:55:08,625 --> 01:55:12,166
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1483
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:07,291
Until this foolish satyr appears,

1484
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:10,041
and ruins everything.

1485
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:16,458
All because he can't
restrain his earthly lust.

1486
01:57:36,958 --> 01:57:41,166
This Pandora's box
holds unspeakable evils.

1487
01:57:43,458 --> 01:57:45,791
Perseus must banish it.

1488
01:57:45,875 --> 01:57:49,041
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!

1489

01:58:14,333 --> 01:58:17,625
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1496
01:58:19,041 --> 01:58:21,958

Please remain inside your house

1500
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:44,958
'Tis nothing but a beautiful dream.

1501
01:58:45,916 --> 01:58:52,666
Would any mortal
believe in your dream?

1502
01:58:57,333 --> 01:59:00,916
Those mortals will turn into statues

1503
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:05,083
silenced by your deadly gaze.

1504
01:59:06,833 --> 01:59:09,541
For you are cursed…

1505
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:16,291
to be Medusa herself.

1506
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:19,458
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1507
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:23,958

1513
01:59:44,833 --> 01:59:47,791
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1514
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:51,458
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1515
01:59:52,041 --> 01:59:55,250
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1516
01:59:55,333 --> 01:59:58,875
To drain, to cover, to bury!

1517
02:00:08,666 --> 02:00:11,625
Tariq, Farah, take this medicine.

1518
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:15,375
-Thank you, Miss Siti.
-Use the eyedrops.

1519
02:02:15,916 --> 02:02:17,875
This is
all the evidence we have left.

1520
02:02:21,833 --> 02:02:25,083
The rest is nothing but stories.

1521
02:02:25,666 --> 02:02:28,375
Do you think
they're going to believe us?

1522
02:02:34,958 --> 02:02:36,333
The tattoo on your back,

1523
02:02:37,291 --> 02:02:38,416
what does it mean?

1524
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,541
"Even in the darkest hour,

1525
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:47,875
I decided to carry on working."
