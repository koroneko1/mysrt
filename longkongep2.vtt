1
00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.199
Has anyone seen Praewa?

2
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.960
Since final exams last semester,

3
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.599
I haven't heard about her.

4
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.960
I heard she didn't take her final exams.

5
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.400
She was all messed up.

6
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.120
Good riddance.
She won't be useful around here anyway.

7
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.000
My friend said the management of her dorm
also tried to reach her.

8
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.879
Her stuff is still in the room.

9
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.319
But think about it.

10
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120
She is nowhere to be seen.

11
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.280
Isn't that strange?

12
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.000
Right. Her Facebook account
has also been deactivated.

13
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.919
Maybe she got a new identity
and lives somewhere else now.

14
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.479
I don't care where the hell she is.

15
00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.960
I just don't want her to come back here.

16
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.960
You're hiding out here alone again.

17
00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.000
What are you thinking about?

18
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.960
Are you thinking about Praewa?

19
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.520
No, not this way.

20
00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.960
-You're scolding me?
-You jerk!

21
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.199
Hey.

22
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.840
Did you go anywhere during the break?

23
00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.879
No, you?

24
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.319
Me neither.

25
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.080
-Want to go somewhere? We can go now.
-Yes. Let's go.

26
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.159
I saw your house in Khao Yai
in your Twitter post.

27
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.319
It seems like a nice place.

28
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
Then let's go, shall we?

29
00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.759
-Shall we?
-Yes.

30
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.120
Let's go.

31
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.199
Yes.

32
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.839
-Who's that?
-The new staff member.

33
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.040
Jus just recruited her.

34
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.879
Good.

35
00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.240
She seems a lot more like
a normal person than Praewa.

36
00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.360
You can say that again.

37
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.519
What are these for?

38
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.120
To tease you with.

39
00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.040
It was just posted.

40
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.160
Look at the total likes.

41
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.560
THE TEAM WAS ASKED TO GET INTO PAIRS.
THEY CHOSE TO PAIR UP.

42
00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.879
How wonderful.

43
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.720
You guys are so famous now.

44
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.120
We can't help it.

45
00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.240
We are irresistible.

46
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.600
Yuck.

47
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.959
I really wish

48
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.240
you'd end up together.

49
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.920
Amen.

50
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.439
Damn, Brave. I'll kick your ass.

51
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.000
Kin, you said Justin recruited
a new staff member.

52
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.759
Why is she still here?

53
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.920
How should I know?

54
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.120
Does anybody want water?

55
00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.319
Tell me if you need anything.

56
00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:02.720
I'll see to it.

57
00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.480
I don't agree

58
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.759
with letting Praewa back into the club.

59
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.800
But I don't see why we should kick her
out of the club.

60
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.079
Jus.

61
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.319
Did you forget

62
00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.000
that nasty thing Praewa did?

63
00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.560
I didn't forget.

64
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.319
If Praewa has to leave,

65
00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.680
so does Brave.

66
00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.319
Since they both did something wrong.

67
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.439
But Professor Pat,

68
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.240
without Brave…

69
00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.040
in the competition at the end of the year,

70
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.279
we can't win.

71
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.720
I'll make the decision
as the adviser of the Cheer Club.

72
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.120
In any case,

73
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.959
Harin is more important
to the club than Praewa.

74
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.279
Therefore,

75
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.600
Harin won't get any more punishment.

76
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.199
And Praewa,

77
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.000
because she went AWOL,

78
00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.959
that's two strikes.

79
00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.439
Besides,

80
00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:41.120
we have a new staff member now.

81
00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:43.519
There's no more quota for anyone else.

82
00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.439
Do we all agree?

83
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.199
Yes.

84
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.800
Praewa.

85
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.759
Are you okay?

86
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.319
About getting kicked out of the club?

87
00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:30.079
About Aya and the others…

88
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.000
hurting you.

89
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.159
It didn't kill me.

90
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.639
Be careful, Praewa.

91
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.200
Luckily, Professor Pat
didn't give in to Jus.

92
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.000
If she had been allowed back,

93
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.639
I wouldn't want to go to practice.

94
00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.480
It gives me the creeps thinking about
breathing the same air as her.

95
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.279
But Aya,
why would you get upset about this?

96
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:52.840
The more you're like this,
the more satisfaction you give her.

97
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.279
Right now,

98
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.279
she might even be laughing at you

99
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.200
that you're foaming at the mouth.

100
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.840
I think you just have to ignore her.
Can you do that?

101
00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:06.879
But something got me curious.

102
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.240
She came back this time
looking all different.

103
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.480
She seemed unusually calm.

104
00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.120
Are you starting to like her?

105
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.960
Your wifey is right here.

106
00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:17.080
Aren't you worried he'd be jealous?

107
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.200
-Hubby!
-Kin!

108
00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:20.720
-Are you leaving your wifey?
-What are you doing?

109
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:21.919
-Do you dare?
-Kin.

110
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.240
-Do you want this?
-Do you dare?

111
00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:25.559
Don't! Don't be gentle!

112
00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.759
Harder!

113
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.240
-Don't be gentle. Don't stop!
-Kin.

114
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.519
Aya.

115
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.159
What the fuck are you doing? Let me go!

116
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.200
What the fuck?

117
00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:32.759
What the fuck?

118
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.399
Did you fucking curse at me?

119
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.360
What about the shit you did to me?
Don't you think it was fucked up?

120
00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:41.080
It was you, wasn't it…

121
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.000
who got someone to do black magic on me?

122
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.320
What the fuck?
I didn't do black magic on you!

123
00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:53.679
What the fuck?

124
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.320
I'll kill you!

125
00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.399
Get off me!

126
00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:30.759
All right, everybody.

127
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.120
In a few days,

128
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.360
we will know who will be the center

129
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.879
for the university's Cheer Club this year.

130
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.080
Ladies and gentlemen,

131
00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:42.159
we are here with a hot duo,

132
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.960
who are trending both on campus

133
00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:46.600
and on social media.

134
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:49.679
Let's have a chat with them.

135
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.960
Hello, please introduce yourselves.

136
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.159
Hello, I'm Nat.

137
00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:57.360
Hello, I'm Kin.

138
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.000
You have so many fans
who are here to support you.

139
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.879
I'd really like to know,

140
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.480
how did the hashtag #NatAndKin start?

141
00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.960
I actually don't know

142
00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.559
how it started.

143
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.879
I guess someone uploaded our photos
on social media,

144
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.200
and lots of people
commented that they liked them.

145
00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:21.320
Then they started shipping us
and asking to take pictures of us together

146
00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.240
and asking us to do things together.

147
00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:26.159
So do you like it?

148
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.320
It's pretty good.

149
00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:30.559
Actually, Nat and I were close before.

150
00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:33.279
-And we are closer now, right?
-Yes.

151
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.879
So it's like I have a friend
who knows me so well.

152
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.799
Right, Nat?

153
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.840
Lately, we've seen
you guys together all the time,

154
00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:45.000
so much so that many fans ship you

155
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.399
and want you to be a real couple.

156
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.360
Is that right?

157
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.240
Let me put it straight,

158
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.240
are you already a couple?

159
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.440
No.

160
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.120
We are friends.

161
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.759
He's a friend who…

162
00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.600
I love very much.

163
00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.039
Just friends or friends with benefits?

164
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.399
And as favorite contenders
to be the center

165
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.960
for the university's Cheer Club this year,

166
00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:20.279
could you say a few words

167
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.320
about the upcoming winner announcement?

168
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.039
Everybody wants to be the center.

169
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.879
It must be very competitive.

170
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.320
Don't you think, Ping?

171
00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:57.960
You are burning up.

172
00:14:58.039 --> 00:14:59.759
Do you want to go to the infirmary?

173
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.080
Yes. Will you take me there?

174
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.279
Guys,

175
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.399
I'll take him to the infirmary.

176
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.360
I don't think he can continue.

177
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.519
Yes, go ahead.

178
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.519
He looks so pale that I'm scared of him.

179
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.000
I'll tell Jus.

180
00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:29.320
The way they take care
of each other is kind of odd.

181
00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:31.720
They're good at making a buzz.

182
00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:34.559
It looks so convincing
that it gives me the creeps.

183
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:37.159
I know that they want to create a buzz,

184
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.919
but Khaimook isn't here right now.

185
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.720
Who are they playing up for?

186
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.559
That's right.

187
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.200
Let's go.

188
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.240
HEALTH CENTER

189
00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.720
You should get back to practice.

190
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:15.919
I can stay by myself.

191
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.799
I just need to lie down for a bit.

192
00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:20.600
It's all right.

193
00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:24.360
I just want to make sure you are okay.

194
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.759
Yes, I'll be fine.

195
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.600
Just go to sleep.

196
00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:30.639
I'll leave when you fall asleep.

197
00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.840
I'll get you some water.

198
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.080
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.759
It was just a glass of water,

200
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.119
and you couldn't even hold it.

201
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.920
So how could I leave you here alone?

202
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.640
You should go.

203
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.119
Oh, my gosh!

204
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.400
There must be something going on
between them.

205
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.039
I can't ship two people
who are already in a relationship.

206
00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:37.119
Can somebody write an uncensored
fanfic on this couple? Oh, my gosh.

207
00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:44.880
A stubborn doctor has to take care
of a stubborn patient.

208
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.240
They hated each other at first,

209
00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:50.559
but they ended up falling in love.

210
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.799
One fanfic down.

211
00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:01.000
My soul is about to leave my body.

212
00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:03.759
Oh, Captain, is that all you got?

213
00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:05.480
Can you give us more?

214
00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:06.920
Pretty please.

215
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.160
Hey, I have something to tell you.

216
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.400
Today is the best day.

217
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.559
The best day ever in my life.

218
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160
You say this every day.

219
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.720
What did Nat and Kin do today?

220
00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.440
Did they touch each other,
look into each other's eyes,

221
00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:38.039
or what else did they do?

222
00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:42.720
They kissed.

223
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.599
Seriously?

224
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.640
Where is it?

225
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.119
Come have a look.

226
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.759
-Where is it?
-Come on.

227
00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:51.759
Too bad.

228
00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:53.279
Look,

229
00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:55.799
I took it as they were letting go
of each other.

230
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.359
Otherwise, I would have gotten a picture
of them kissing.

231
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.599
-Wait a minute.
-My hands were stiff.

232
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.480
How did you take this picture?

233
00:21:04.039 --> 00:21:08.680
I was just passing by.

234
00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.440
Fricking liar,

235
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:13.440
like l would ever believe you.

236
00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:15.279
If you had taken a picture
of them kissing,

237
00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:17.279
you would've posted it online then?

238
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.480
Of course.

239
00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.279
The total likes

240
00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:23.559
would have been overwhelming.

241
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.400
-My friend...
-So cute.

242
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.359
I think you're violating their privacy.

243
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.880
This photo is already bad enough.

244
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.400
Look at this.

245
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.960
If you're going
to post a photo of them kissing,

246
00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:38.079
I don't even know what to say to you.

247
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.799
What are you even talking about?

248
00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:42.440
Nobody says anything mean to me.

249
00:21:42.519 --> 00:21:45.519
Everybody is happy. Everybody likes it.

250
00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:47.599
I'm doing this for humanity.

251
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.880
Okay, I don't want to argue with you.

252
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.400
I know you're doing this
because you really love them.

253
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.160
But I want you to wonder

254
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.960
if what you're doing
is actually hurting those you love.

255
00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:06.839
And be careful. If you get in trouble,
I won't help you.

256
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.640
But seriously, I still can't believe

257
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.079
that they really kissed.

258
00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:22.319
Both of them seem very masculine.

259
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.799
That doesn't mean they can't fall in love.

260
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.839
That's true.

261
00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:31.039
I just didn't think
that they were this close before.

262
00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:32.920
But now, to Nat,
everything is all about Kin.

263
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.519
To Kin, everything is all about Nat.

264
00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:36.079
I'm so confused.

265
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.279
They're so into each other,
like they've got a love spell put on them.

266
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.720
What love spell?

267
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:43.079
In this day and age,
nobody uses spells anymore.

268
00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:46.440
They are truly in love.

269
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.119
Yeah, right.

270
00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.279
NAT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE ARE YOU?

271
00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:05.279
CALL ME BACK
WHEN YOU TURN YOUR PHONE ON.

272
00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.960
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

273
00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:13.680
I CAN'T REACH YOU.

274
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.559
Nat.

275
00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:38.920
Nat, what's going on?

276
00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:43.640
-Nat.
-Get out.

277
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.799
What's wrong?

278
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.000
-Nat.
-Get out!

279
00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:13.480
UNIVERSITY SPORTS COMPLEX

280
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:09.720
What are you doing?

281
00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.160
Nothing.

282
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.000
Just looking at your candid photos.

283
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.119
You take good photos.

284
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.759
Don't you know
that they don't allow outsiders here?

285
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.079
I'm here to collect my stuff.

286
00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:29.400
After I finish, I'll leave.

287
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.079
Hey, Nat.

288
00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:35.720
Are you free tonight?

289
00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:37.200
Are you okay?

290
00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.200
Your face looks gloomy.

291
00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:40.839
Did somebody put black magic on you?

292
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.759
Yeah, I think so too.

293
00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:45.519
Kat must have worked some magic on him.

294
00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:47.960
You know he does her real good every time.

295
00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:51.640
I'm tired from the practice, you assholes.
Get out of here. Go.

296
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.000
What's with the attitude?

297
00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:55.000
-Let's party.
-Let's go.

298
00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:06.200
You can be with Kat
and do whatever you want.

299
00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.960
Nobody has a problem with that.

300
00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:10.279
But you should have your phone turned on,

301
00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:11.640
just in case of an emergency.

302
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.119
So people can reach you.

303
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.799
Hey.

304
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.680
What's wrong with you?

305
00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:23.039
What are you mad at me about?

306
00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:27.359
I'm not mad.

307
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.000
You are.

308
00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:31.480
Tell me what it's about.

309
00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.920
You're mad that I was with Kat

310
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.359
and didn't answer your call, right?

311
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.960
Why would I be mad at you?

312
00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:42.359
You can fuck whoever you want.
It has nothing to do with me.

313
00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:10.680
Why are you back so late?

314
00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:12.039
Did you eat?

315
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.200
I just got back too.

316
00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:19.680
There are so many activities.

317
00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:23.000
There's rehearsal every day,
it's so exhausting.

318
00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.759
What's wrong with her?

319
00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:59.440
You said it was nothing serious.

320
00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.640
But it has gone too far.

321
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.720
What do you mean, too far?

322
00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:07.000
How is that possible?

323
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.799
I just want them to fall in love,

324
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.279
just a little bromance.

325
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.839
Not like…

326
00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.880
Did anyone else mess with the dolls?

327
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.079
Someone tried
to put more black magic on them

328
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.920
and get the two of them
to have actual intercourse.

329
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.119
Also, the intention is death.

330
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.400
Death?

331
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Hey.

332
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.680
What are you doing?

333
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.640
I'll try my best to undo it.

334
00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.559
Take this with you.

335
00:34:06.359 --> 00:34:08.000
To protect myself from black magic?

336
00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:11.000
To help promote my business.

337
00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:13.119
RICH, LUCKY, CHARMING…

338
00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.320
Wow, did everyone see the clip last night?

339
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.559
At first, I thought
some ghosts were haunting the gym,

340
00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.800
but those weren't ghosts.

341
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.920
It was our favorite shipped couple.

342
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.719
In the clip, everyone can see
the two of them

343
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.480
banging each other in the club room.

344
00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.840
-Who are they?
-I know.

345
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.320
I read about it last night, it's so saucy.

346
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.039
It must be Nan's favorite couple,
Nat and Kin.

347
00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:42.440
It's not hard to guess.

348
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.000
Gosh, that hurts.
Stop talking about this, okay?

349
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.400
Is your ship for real, Nan?
Damn, is it true?

350
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.159
I don't know.

351
00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.880
But, seriously,
I like shipping them together,

352
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.760
but I don't want them to bang for real.

353
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.719
I'm telling you,
I'm not surprised at all. I knew it.

354
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.119
IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE HAVING SEX,
BUT PLEASE USE PROTECTION.

355
00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:04.039
THAT IS SO STEAMY.

356
00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.480
BEST FRIENDS.
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH.

357
00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:07.960
TO ALL THE FANS, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT NOW?

358
00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:12.920
Can you please explain to me

359
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.360
what happened?

360
00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:17.639
Speak.

361
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.000
If you don't,

362
00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.880
I can't help you.

363
00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:27.119
This crazy rumor,

364
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.679
is it true?

365
00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:36.000
We don't really know.

366
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.440
I can't explain.

367
00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:40.639
It was like a dream,

368
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.760
but it also felt real.

369
00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:48.239
We don't even know

370
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.840
what happened that day.

371
00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:52.400
It was like…

372
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.360
we were so drunk

373
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.480
even though we hadn't been drinking.

374
00:35:57.559 --> 00:35:59.039
What story are you making up?

375
00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:00.400
We are not making it up.

376
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.480
You know that we're both straight guys.

377
00:36:03.559 --> 00:36:06.239
-So why did you bang in the club room?
-Jus.

378
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.239
Enough.

379
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.440
All of you.

380
00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:11.199
Did you forget that I'm still in the room?

381
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.719
You said you didn't feel like yourself
because you were drunk.

382
00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:21.960
So that means

383
00:36:22.519 --> 00:36:25.400
everything that happened was real
like what people say.

384
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.159
Right?

385
00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:49.400
What happened?

386
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480
What's the punishment?

387
00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:56.119
Professor Pat took us off
of the list of contenders for the center.

388
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.199
You're okay.

389
00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:10.599
YOU GOT BONED HARD, DID IT HURT?

390
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.039
Who are you?

391
00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:24.239
Why don't you come and see me?

392
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.559
Oh, is it you, Praewa?

393
00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:35.039
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why the fuck are you laughing?

394
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.119
Praewa?

395
00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:52.079
What's wrong?

396
00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:55.480
Kin.

397
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.559
-Hey, Kin.
-Kin.

398
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.800
Kin.

399
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.159
-Kin.
-Kin.

400
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.480
-Kin.
-Kin.

401
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.519
I'm sorry.

402
00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:43.159
Sir, let me take your blood pressure.

403
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.599
It's normal.

404
00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:20.679
But you should get some rest.

405
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.320
Don't get up yet.

406
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.639
Thank you.

407
00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:18.559
ASA SAMAKKEE FOUNDATION

408
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:19.960
KIN

409
00:43:20.039 --> 00:43:21.280
DO IT NOW.

410
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.199
Hey, it's time. Let's go.

411
00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:29.119
What's wrong?

412
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.199
-What's wrong, sir?
-Doctor, please help me.

413
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.199
Don't be scared.

414
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.480
Calm down.

415
00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:37.800
You! How did you get here?

416
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.800
You're dead!

417
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.559
Let go of me!

418
00:44:43.679 --> 00:44:44.559
You're dead!

419
00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.639
You're all dead! Let go of me!

420
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.440
Leave me alone!

421
00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.800
-Nurse, hold him!
-Please calm down!

422
00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:58.719
Sir, where are you going?

423
00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.559
-Don't follow me!
-Please come back!

424
00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:01.760
Sir!

425
00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:06.440
Leave me alone!

426
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.559
-Please calm down!
-Mister, calm down!

427
00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:12.840
Don't!

428
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.400
Get away from me! Leave me alone!

429
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.519
Get away from me!

430
00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:18.880
Don't come any closer!

431
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.119
I said don't come any closer!

432
00:45:21.199 --> 00:45:23.119
I'm scared!

433
00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:24.400
Leave me alone!

434
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.559
-Sir, please calm down.
-Calm down.

435
00:45:26.639 --> 00:45:28.440
-Sir, please calm down.
-Calm down.

436
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.239
-Don't!
-Sir!

437
00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:35.000
Who will watch Kin tonight?

438
00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:37.119
Do we have to?

439
00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:38.039
I don't think…

440
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.199
-Kin!
-Kin!

441
00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:50.639
Kin!

442
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.239
Kin!

443
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.280
It's a student. He fell from the rooftop.

444
