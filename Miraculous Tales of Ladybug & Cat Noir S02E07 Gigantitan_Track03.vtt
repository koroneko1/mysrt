&lrm;<i>-Er, you know, he's a great guy.</i>

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.380
&lrm;<i>But, to all the children of Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>you mustn't copy him, OK?</i>

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020
&lrm;<i>It's very dangerous!</i>

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.300
&lrm;<i>Ladybug's right.</i>
&lrm;<i>So, don't try this at home. OK, kids?</i>

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.500
&lrm;<i>Meanwhile, the question that remains</i>

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.060
&lrm;<i>"Who lies behind the mask of The Owl,</i>
&lrm;<i>the clumsiest superhero in all of Paris?"</i>

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.820
&lrm;The principal, Mr Damocles, has a good
&lrm;heart, but this is bound to end badly.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.020
&lrm;And we can't spend all our time
&lrm;watching out for him, either.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.020
&lrm;It's turning into a full-time job!

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.060
&lrm;Perhaps we should convince him
&lrm;to stop trying

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.380
&lrm;-by scaring him, for example?
&lrm;-And shatter the poor man's dream? No way!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.460
&lrm;Instead, maybe we should help him
&lrm;make his dream come true.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.340
&lrm;He said all he wanted was to be a hero,
&lrm;even if it was just for one day.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
&lrm;Of course!
&lrm;If we make him a hero for a day,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.580
&lrm;he'll be happy and quit playing this
&lrm;dangerous game. Spot on, as usual, Milady!

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.580
&lrm;<i>And you only have ten minutes!</i>

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.500
&lrm;<i>Follow the Owl signal!</i>

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.940
&lrm;[hooting]

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.380
&lrm;We can't let this happen!

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.780
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.820
&lrm;Ha!

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.260
&lrm;-Albert, the signal!
&lrm;<i>-At your service, sir.</i>

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.060
&lrm;It's perfect.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.980
&lrm;Wow! That principal
&lrm;sure is holding a grudge!

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.180
&lrm;We've definitely ruffled his feathers!

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.620
&lrm;We must stop the countdown.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.260
&lrm;If you want,
&lrm;I can distract him with chitchat!

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.860
&lrm;You certainly are the cat for the job!

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.140
&lrm;Let's stay in touch!

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.700
&lrm;Hoo-hoo! Mr Damocles!

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.220
&lrm;I am not Mr Damocles!
&lrm;I am... The Dark Owl!

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.620
&lrm;Let's talk about this. Why don't we just
&lrm;team up, the three of us?

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.700
&lrm;After all,
&lrm;you do have real powers now!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.020
&lrm;Where is Ladybug?

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.900
&lrm;Grappling iron, boomerang, utility belt...
&lrm;The akuma must be in one of his weapons.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.900
&lrm;Yeah, but which one?
&lrm;Ladybug will be here any minute.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.780
&lrm;Then you can place your Miraculous
&lrm;in the box in the middle of the stadium!

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.740
&lrm;Or...

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.260
&lrm;Boom! OK, I get it!

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.020
&lrm;-Try to grab his detonator!
&lrm;-I'm on it!

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.540
&lrm;-[moaning]
&lrm;-Over to you, Cat Noir!

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.140
&lrm;[screams]

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.620
&lrm;Ha! Ooh! Oops! Time flies! This is your
&lrm;last chance to save the helpless kitten!

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.940
&lrm;-What's he got against cats?
&lrm;-Heroes don't hurt innocent beings!

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.220
&lrm;Then give me your Miraculous,
&lrm;otherwise you will be to blame!

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.180
&lrm;Owl Talon!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.900
&lrm;[shouting]

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.420
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.300
&lrm;It's the end of the line for you!

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.860
&lrm;[battle cry]

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.300
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.940
&lrm;A fountain pen?

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.620
&lrm;What are you gonna do,
&lrm;ask him to sign an autograph?

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.060
&lrm;I'm deactivating the detonator, Milady!

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.820
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;-Hoomerang!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.540
&lrm;Albert! Activate the hatch!

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.260
&lrm;[screaming]

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.260
&lrm;I am the Guardian of Paris!
&lrm;I am... The Dark Owl!

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.940
&lrm;Mwahahaha!

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.780
&lrm;-The countdown is still running!
&lrm;-That's impossible!

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.020
&lrm;-Oh, come on! Please!
&lrm;-It looks like...

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.860
&lrm;Mmm! Tastes like whipped cream!

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.260
&lrm;-Oh, no!
&lrm;<i>-Time's up! Albert, drop the bus!</i>

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.740
&lrm;<i>Mwahahaha! You naives!</i>
&lrm;<i>It was a hologram all along!</i>

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.060
&lrm;So, how does it feel to lose,
&lrm;for once, and be humiliated?

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.300
&lrm;Did you really think
&lrm;I would hurt a kitten?

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.140
&lrm;<i>This next trap, though, is very real.</i>

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.940
&lrm;<i>The room you're in is filling up</i>
&lrm;<i>with whipped cream.</i>

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.740
&lrm;<i>Whipped cream's too thick to swim in,</i>
&lrm;<i>but too runny to float on!</i>

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.420
&lrm;I hope it's lactose-free!

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.300
&lrm;You're going to drown,
&lrm;softly but surely!

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.100
&lrm;Unless, that is, you accept defeat
&lrm;and give me your Miraculous!

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.780
&lrm;Do you really think it'll make
&lrm;a difference if I can't see you?

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.380
&lrm;There's nowhere to escape!
&lrm;If you don't give me the Miraculous now,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.820
&lrm;I'll simply take them after The Owl's
&lrm;whipped cream has buried you!

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.140
&lrm;-He's right. We're done for!
&lrm;-Not yet, we're not.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.060
&lrm;-You win, Dark Owl!
&lrm;-The time has come!

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.460
&lrm;Excellent work, Dark Owl!

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.020
&lrm;Close your eyes and no peeking.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.620
&lrm;We can't do this!

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.140
&lrm;Trust me.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.660
&lrm;Spots off.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.740
&lrm;Claws in.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.340
&lrm;-Huh? What... ?
&lrm;-Shh!

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.020
&lrm;<i>Miraculous delivered, sir.</i>

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.380
&lrm;Now I am the only superhero in Paris.
&lrm;And a superhero keeps his word. Albert...

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.900
&lrm;<i>Owl's whipped cream deactivated, sir.</i>

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.660
&lrm;Dark Owl, deliver the Miraculous to me.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.860
&lrm;Albert! Transfer!

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.260
&lrm;Mwahaha! I am the best bird!

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.900
&lrm;They are mine! Ladybug's ability to create
&lrm;and Cat Noir's power of destruction!

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.540
&lrm;Whoever succeeds in merging
&lrm;these two Miraculous

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.340
&lrm;shall be granted a wish
&lrm;that can change reality

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.460
&lrm;and erase the past.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.820
&lrm;This cannot be!

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.260
&lrm;No!

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.020
&lrm;Dark Owl,
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir tricked you!

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.020
&lrm;These are fake Miraculous,
&lrm;made out of salt dough!

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.220
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.180
&lrm;What?

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.420
&lrm;-But that's impossible! How did you do it?
&lrm;-Hey! What did you expect?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.660
&lrm;A superhero never reveals her secrets!
&lrm;I thought you'd know better!

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.020
&lrm;I've got plan A, plan B,
&lrm;and all the alphabet to Z.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.940
&lrm;Did you really think
&lrm;we'd give you our Miraculous?

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.980
&lrm;We're superheroes. We are... Ladybug!

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.260
&lrm;And Cat Noir!

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.260
&lrm;By the way, say "Hi!" to Hawk Moth
&lrm;for us! Hope he enjoys his new toys!

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.580
&lrm;Destroy them, Dark Owl! If you fail again,
&lrm;you can bid your superpowers farewell!

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.060
&lrm;Hoomerangs! Trajectory control, Albert!

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.940
&lrm;We don't know where his akuma is.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.220
&lrm;But we know it's not
&lrm;in any of his weapons!

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.140
&lrm;Cover me!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.620
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.860
&lrm;The first volume
&lrm;of the adventures of Knight Owl?

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.540
&lrm;Do you think you can defeat me
&lrm;by reading to me, Ladybug?

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.820
&lrm;[evil laughter]

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.020
&lrm;Knight Owl has a partner!
&lrm;So must Dark Owl!

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.500
&lrm;-He's all yours, Milady!
&lrm;-Dark Owl's akumatized object

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.580
&lrm;is not on him. It's in his lair!

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.660
&lrm;Don't let him get away, Cat Noir.
&lrm;I'm off to the school! Ha!

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.420
&lrm;See that? Reading comic books
&lrm;can actually save lives!

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.060
&lrm;Albert! Owl Wings!

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.740
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.380
&lrm;Cat versus bird.
&lrm;Who usually wins this fight?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.420
&lrm;Bird! Ha!

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.340
&lrm;[shouts]

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.980
&lrm;[evil laughter]

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.140
&lrm;<i>Intrusion! Intrusion!</i>
&lrm;<i>Intrusion! Intrusion!</i>

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.540
&lrm;A computer! Of course!

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.220
&lrm;I'm right here, Albert!

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.380
&lrm;Dark Owl always triumphs in the end!

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.140
&lrm;You should have read to the end
&lrm;of the comic, Ladybug!

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.820
&lrm;No! No! No!

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.260
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, akuma!

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.940
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.300
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.340
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.980
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.140
&lrm;Ladybug? Cat Noir?
&lrm;What are you doing in my office?

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.420
&lrm;Pound it!

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:57.660
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir... Every day,
&lrm;I get closer to destroying you both,

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.780
&lrm;and soon you'll be nothing more
&lrm;than superheroes in a history book!

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.020
&lrm;<i>And we're happy to announce</i>
&lrm;<i>that this week's winner is, once again,</i>

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.260
&lrm;<i>Paris' new superhero, The Owl! Hoo-hoo!</i>

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.260
&lrm;Calling us was the right thing to do!
&lrm;Good job, Mr Dam... Uh, Mr Owl.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.780
&lrm;At your service, Captain. Wherever someone
&lrm;needs him, he's right there...

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.220
&lrm;The Owl!

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.860
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.500
&lrm;Hoo-hoo!

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.460
&lrm;Hey, Mr Dam... I mean, Owl!
&lrm;Can we take a picture with you?

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.780
&lrm;-Say "Hoo-hoo!"
&lrm;-Hoo-hoo!

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.820
&lrm;Tending to gardens, handing out blankets
&lrm;to the homeless, feeding animals.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.020
&lrm;-The Owl spread his wings!
&lrm;-He's a superhero in his own way!

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.020
&lrm;-Now we'll have more spare time.
&lrm;-Feel like going to the movies?

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.340
&lrm;Sorry. I promised a friend
&lrm;I'd hang out with her as soon as I could!

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.780
&lrm;See you later, kitty cat!

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.700
&lrm;Aw...

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.580
&lrm;I'm not kidding, Marinette.
&lrm;I was Cardboard Girl!

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.820
&lrm;I wish you could've seen it!
&lrm;It was awesome!

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.700
&lrm;Triple dragon kick. Perfect.
&lrm;Marinette wins!

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.380
&lrm;What? No way. I wasn't looking.
&lrm;You cheated!

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.540
&lrm;[laughter]
