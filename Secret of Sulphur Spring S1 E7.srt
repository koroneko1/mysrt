[Harper]
<i>Previously on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,073
<i>Campfire is almost over.</i>

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,508
Whatever's gonna happen,
it's gonna be soon.

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,510
[Zoey]
<i>Today is the anniversary</i>
<i>of Savannah's death.</i>

5
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,579
<i>This is our best chance</i>
<i>to get proof she's real.</i>

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,115
Savannah, we summon you.

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,484
Please, show yourself.

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,718
(can rattling)

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,487
(both screaming)

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,823
Whoa, whoa, wait.
We did it. We made contact.

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,292
[Jess]
<i>I told you to make sure</i>

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,759
<i>that your sister</i>
<i>didn't leave the house.</i>

13
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,660
(door opens)

14
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,062
(snoring sounds)

15
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,563
Is she at the Tremont?

16
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,031
[Harper]
<i>We shouldn't have left.</i>

17
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,167
[Griffin]
<i>We didn't have a choice.</i>
<i>They were about to catch us.</i>

18
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,336
Savannah wasn't found missing
until the morning.
It's still night.

19
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,271
[Harper]
<i>We have to go back.</i>
<i>We can still save her.</i>

20
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,707
[Griffin]
The portal didn't work.

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,742
We failed.
Savannah's gone forever.

22
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,910
What are you two
doing out here?

23
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,912
And don't even think
about lying.

24
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,616
I dare you!
Spend the rest of the night
in the basement...

25
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,118
with the ghost.

26
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,253
[Savannah]
<i>I can do that dare,</i>
<i>no sweat.</i>

27
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,155
You don't have to prove
anything to Jess.

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:58,992
Hello?

29
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,170
[Wyatt]
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

30
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,571
They said to stay
in our rooms.

31
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,141
No way.
I'm not missing this
for anything.

32
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,344
I don't know, maybe--
Shh.

33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,079
They're in the parlor.
Come on.

34
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,883
(muffled voices)

35
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,419
Jess: ...your brother
to cover for you?
What were you thinking?

36
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,122
Ben: I just want to know
what were you doing out there
in the middle of the night.

37
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,390
It's a simple question, Griff.

38
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,160
[Jess]
I'm not taking you home

39
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,427
until you tell us
where you've been.

40
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,564
We're okay. We're safe.
We're home.

41
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,832
Isn't that enough?
Not nearly.

42
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,568
Ben:
According to what Topher
and the twins told us,

43
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,471
you were gone a long time.
Half the night.

44
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:46,374
Harper,
you haven't said a word.

45
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,179
Harper?
It's embarrassing, okay?

46
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,348
We wanted
some private time.

47
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,984
Private time?

48
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,420
I think we need
a little more
of an explanation.

49
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,690
You guys
didn't want us
to see each other,

50
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,227
so we came up
with a plan...
to sneak off.

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,496
And do what, exactly?

52
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,064
E-- Exactly? Well--

53
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,133
We just wanted
to be alone to--

54
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,802
Play cards
and talk--

55
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,637
And have
our first kiss.

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,041
Said it was embarrassing.

57
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,680
Can I go to bed now?

58
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,816
We'll start with grounded
for a very long time.

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,354
No bike, no woods,
no... anything.

60
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,088
[Jess]
Same for you, Harper.

61
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,525
And Topher,
for aiding and abetting.

62
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,260
Ditto the twins.

63
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,395
Thank you, Sarah, Ben.

64
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:46,267
In the very near future,
Harper will be
writing you an apology.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,901
[Ben]
As will Griffin.

66
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,538
No need to see us out.
Good night, everyone.

67
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,506
Harper?

68
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,279
[Ben]
Anything else
you want to add?

69
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,181
I want to hear
more about that kiss!

70
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,383
(door closes)
I don't.

71
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,885
You two,
back to bed.
Now!

72
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,120
Griffin, go with them.

73
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,889
We'll talk more about this
in the morning.

74
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,192
Go!

75
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,930
Do you believe
anything they said?

76
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,032
Not a word of it.

77
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,505
(theme music playing)

78
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,899
Yuck!
Another goner.

79
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,835
I've always said
we needed a generator.

80
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,870
This power outage
has wiped out
our inventory.

81
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,507
Go! Get it out of here.
You know where.

82
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,178
Okay. I'll do it.
No problem.

83
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:06,914
You just sit there
staring into space.

84
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,032
Long night.

85
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,906
So, you and Griffin...

86
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,008
Big romance, huh?

87
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,077
I wouldn't go that far.

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,082
Look, Harper...

89
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,152
I know you're still
keeping things from me.

90
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,688
And I think,
when you do that,

91
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,222
it's not always
the healthiest thing.

92
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,859
You do
the same thing, Mom.

93
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,461
I see the way
you look at Griffin's dad.

94
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,329
It's almost...

95
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,431
like you two have a secret.

96
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,601
I don't know
what you're talking about.

97
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,636
You don't? Really?

98
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:04,505
Yes, really.

99
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,976
I don't understand
how you can expect me
to be honest, when you're not.

100
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,752
Okay, you're right.

101
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,223
I did go to camp
with Griffin's dad.

102
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,861
And I was there the night
Savannah went missing.

103
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:31,932
It was...

104
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,335
a terrible experience.

105
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,072
Which is why
I didn't talk about it.

106
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,342
I hope
you can understand that.

107
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,346
I do.
I do understand that.

108
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,021
You're growing up so fast,
I sometimes forget that.

109
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,726
(machines whirring)
Ah.

110
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,528
We're in business!

111
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,396
Ah!

112
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,764
Oh, uh,
do me a favor.

113
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,799
Go see what's taking
your brother so long.

114
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,174
Mom's looking for you.

115
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,843
All right, all right.

116
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,412
Hold up.

117
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,182
You've gotta be kidding.
Again?

118
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,484
Look, I need your help.

119
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,919
Oh, no. No way.

120
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,155
I'm already grounded,
forced into hard labor--

121
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,257
Ten minutes, Topher.
That's all I need.

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,626
Please. Please.

123
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,361
Please!

124
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,930
Okay, 10 minutes.

125
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,772
You're a good little brother.

126
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,584
♪**♪

127
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,705
Thank goodness, I don't have
to take a flashlight

128
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,139
into the bathroom anymore.

129
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,340
TMI.

130
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,976
Mom, check it out.

131
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,845
Let there be light!
Ah!

132
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,459
Well, I got a surge here.

133
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,094
Check the other outlets.
Got it.

134
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,308
You won't believe it.

135
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,877
My mother confessed!

136
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,778
Wait, what?

137
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,912
She admitted
she went to camp

138
00:07:59,046 --> 00:07:59,880
and knew Savannah.

139
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,249
It seemed like
it was hard for her
to talk about.

140
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,553
I feel like my dad was still
holding something back too,

141
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,721
about what happened
to Savannah.

142
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,524
All I got last night
was "the talk."

143
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,326
Nice save, but
did we have to be kissing?

144
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,896
Sorry, it was
the first thing
that came to my mind.

145
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:17,831
Yeah?

146
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,733
Well,
it certainly wasn't
the first on mine.

147
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,204
They're going to miss me
in five seconds.

148
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,305
I didn't set anything up.

149
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,940
All I bought us
was 10 minutes,

150
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,976
and that's now
officially run out.

151
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,110
You ready?

152
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:34,982
Let's do this.

153
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,589
(banging on door)

154
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,291
Is Harper here?

155
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,460
Ben:
Of course not.

156
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,996
Griffin's been with us
all morning.

157
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,231
Last I saw,
he was checking plugs.
Griffin!

158
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,000
Listen, I think that
they've run off together.

159
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,670
Wait, uh,
we made it very clear.

160
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:57,805
Kids, go look around.

161
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,774
[Zoey]
Griffin!

162
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,078
Uh, I would think running off
would be the last thing
they'd do.

163
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,179
Okay, I know that.

164
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,081
But Harper has said things
to Topher.

165
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:08,782
Tell them, honey.

166
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,752
I saw her before she left.
She said, "Ten minutes."

167
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:12,886
But it was more, like,

168
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,622
"Goodbye, Topher,
I'm never coming back."

169
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,591
Guys, she hugged me.

170
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:18,792
That's just not normal.

171
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,127
(footsteps approaching)

172
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,596
Not down here.
We'll check upstairs.

173
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,965
You too, Topher.
You can help.

174
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,971
I think we need

Why all the sneaking around?
Never mind that.

178
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,761
We need to find out
what happened to Savannah
after the campfire.

179

Isn't she at her bunkhouse?

181
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,965
But you were with her
last night, right?

182
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,332
Uh, we all were.

Uh, meeting bell. Gotta go.

No sign of them
on the property.

00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,488
The old camp area?
No. Nothing.

188
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,657
The treehouse?
First place I looked.

189
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,593
Her phone's off.
Griffin's too.

190
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,896
(Ben sighs)
Obviously, they don't want
to be found.

191
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,734
Of all days,
this day.

192
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,605
Most of my life,
I have worked hard
to forget...

193
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,474
what happened to Savannah.

194
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,512
This can't be
a coincidence, Ben.

195
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,483
You really think
this place is haunted
by Savannah?

196

Come on.

197
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,354
You're starting
to sound like the kids.

198
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,891
All I know is
they shut the doors
to this place for a reason,

199
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:00,227
and you're the one
that opened them up again.

200
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,296
Yeah? Well,
I'll tell you this.

201
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,300
No way will this day end

They're already looking
for Savannah.

If only it mattered.

205
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,586
What if they
do find her this time?

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,756
We know how
this plays out, Griffin.

207
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,323
Same way it did
30 years ago.

208
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,660
Thirty years ago,
we weren't here

209
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,095
hanging out
with our parents.

210
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,930
Now we are. That has
to change things somehow.

211
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,966
It hasn't yet,
and we've tried.

Your mom came clean
about going to camp.

213
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,103
Would that have happened
before we found the portal?

214
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,739
There was no reason for her
to tell me the truth.

215
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,441
I wasn't sneaking around
or asking questions
about her past.

216
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,176
Exactly!

217
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,314
I guess us being here
could be shifting things,
slightly.

218
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,217
Maybe all we need
is a small change
to save Savannah.

219
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,586
When did you
become an optimist?

Why? Savannah's
a good swimmer.

00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,320
Maybe Moss Man

Doubt it. Everyone knows
Moss Man would never--

Enough with
the Moss Man talk.

231
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,894
He didn't grab Savannah.
It's just a silly story.

00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,964
Savannah's probably
just playing another prank.

She'll do anything
for attention.

I didn't know
she was gone.

You guys don't do

I wasn't there
for lights out.

238

But that's only
because these two kids
were causing trouble.

00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,461
Don't worry.
We'll find 'em.

349
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:15,995
I'm not going to--

350
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,597
Let today end
the way that day did?

351
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,434
That's what you said.

352
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,670
I know.
I just meant--

353
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,105
Look, Savannah's disappearance
changed all of us, Ben,

354
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,141
but the way you were acting
that day, it's--

355
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,778
It's like you knew something
the rest of us didn't.

356
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,715
Do you know
what happened to her?

357
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
Is that why you moved back
to Sulphur Springs?

358
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,756
You were right, Jess.

359
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,393
You should
probably head home.

360
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,761
We'll call
if we hear anything.

361
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,663
Right.

362
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,099
I'll do the same.

363
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,346
Here's Officer Stevens'
direct line and cell.

364
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:17,957
(car door closes)

365
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,633
[officer:] (on radio)
<i>Delta 5, we got an update</i>
<i>on the lake.</i>

366
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,636
<i>Rescue reports false alarm.</i>

367
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>Just an old sleeping bag.</i>

368
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,172
There's still time
to find her.

369
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,307
All we have to do
is figure out

370
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,243
how to break out
of a locked police car.

371
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,545
Any ideas?

372
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,113
Maybe if we had
a coat hanger...

373
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,682
or a brick.

374
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,284
Or someone we know.

375
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,486
Ben, over here!
Yo, Ben!

376
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,388
Ben, help!
Ben!

377
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,089
[Harper:]
Ben, help! Over here!
Ben!

378
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,658
(banging on car)
[Griffin:] Ben!

379
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,193
(sighs)
Come on!

380
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,962
He had to have heard us.

381
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,464
Why didn't he stop?

382
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,631
I don't know.

383
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,767
He looked pretty upset though.

384
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:13,513
Savannah?

385
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,615
Hello?

386
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,286
You really think
she's down here?

387
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,288
Jess...

388
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,622
That's ridiculous.

389
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:23,723
Why would she--

390
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,459
Wait.

391
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,764
You don't think
she actually went through

392
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,600
with that stupid dare?

393
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,002
Do you?

394
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,739
I don't know. Maybe.
Maybe?

395
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,541
Wait, what does that mean?

396
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,544
Ben, look at me!

397
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,914
Did Savannah tell you
she was coming here last night?

398
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,150
Is that why you were acting
so weird by the lake?

399
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:52,585
Me?

400
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,854
None of this would be
happening right now

401
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,823
if it hadn't been for you
and your stupid dare.

402
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,426
If anything,
this is all your fault.

403
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,797
How could you?

404
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:07,800
Jess...

405
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,569
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,371
I didn't mean it.

407
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,017
What's going on here,
Bennett?

408
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:27,820
Let's go.

409
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,723
Totally unacceptable.

410
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,024
I was with
an important client

411
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,626
when I heard
that a camper
had disappeared.

412
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,562
Dad, please--
And then I drive three hours

413
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,530
to find you horsing around
the hotel like a clown.

414
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,131
I messed--
A child is missing, Bennett!

415
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,299
I'm sorry,
I messed up.

416
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,401
Again and again
and again?

417
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,835
You're not listening
to me.

418
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,037
It's my fault.

419
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:47,740
It's all my fault.

420
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,881
Not...

421
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,583
another...

422
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:57,984
word.

423
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,667
You heard that, right?

424
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,503
My dad...

425
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,539
He just confessed.

426
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,212
[Harper]
<i>Next time on "Secrets</i>
<i>of Sulphur Springs"...</i>

427
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,547
My dad said
it was all his fault.

428
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,081
That has to mean he did
something to Savannah.

429
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,817
Then why come back
to Sulphur Springs?

430
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,421
Has Harper been going through
the boxes out in the garage?

431
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,756
Your brother is missing
and you're worried
about a ghost?

432
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,090
This is serious!

433
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,993
[Savannah (on tape):]
<i>** ...could ever want **</i>

434
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,532
<i>** Our hearts and minds</i>

00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:50,002
