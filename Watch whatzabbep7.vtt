WEBVTT

00:00.168 --> 00:01.453
I broke up with him.

00:02.396 --> 00:06.536
Teng, I would do everything
to make us back together.

00:06.753 --> 00:10.265
And I would make sure
you don't get to do that.

00:10.340 --> 00:13.726
You are suspended for one month.
I'm so disappointed in you.

00:14.527 --> 00:19.414
You asked me to believe in you,
but you never believed in me.

00:21.659 --> 00:22.993
(Resignation Letter)

00:45.300 --> 00:46.300
Poon!

00:48.500 --> 00:49.527
I'm sorry.

02:08.012 --> 02:10.204
Let me see is they left anything.

02:10.693 --> 02:13.590
- How come you are here?
- Well, well, well.

02:13.839 --> 02:17.801
Isn't it Mr. Sugar Daddy
who paid the rent for Poon last time?

02:18.297 --> 02:19.817
How much does he still owe you?

02:21.816 --> 02:25.114
Oh, he doesn't at all.

02:25.125 --> 02:29.519
Because I kicked him out already.

02:29.595 --> 02:33.470
Well, there's a billionaire
who brought me money.

02:33.481 --> 02:35.340
I'd be out of my mind
if I didn't take it.

02:36.549 --> 02:38.093
Oh, dear.

02:38.104 --> 02:42.519
Don't stare at me like that,
or you will see my true nature.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.170
- I'm kind of embarrassed.
- Did you kick him out?

02:46.671 --> 02:49.497
Have you ever thought about
where he'd going to stay?

02:49.575 --> 02:52.051
Do I have to? It's his business.

03:04.730 --> 03:10.230
And all of his belongings here
belong to me now.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.379
I can sell them cheap if you want.

03:13.403 --> 03:17.121
Hey, don't leave just yet. Come back.
I have a good deal for you indeed.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.167
Poon!

03:25.913 --> 03:26.913
Poon!

03:29.463 --> 03:30.763
Are you here?

03:33.093 --> 03:34.093
Poon!

03:35.354 --> 03:36.554
You again?

03:37.366 --> 03:39.448
- We closed.
- I'm looking for Poon.

03:40.171 --> 03:41.371
Is he here?

03:41.751 --> 03:45.559
After you came ranting here last time,
he resigned.

03:46.842 --> 03:48.042
So where is he now?

03:49.023 --> 03:51.563
- I'm asking you!
- You better calm down.

03:52.382 --> 03:55.672
I don't think it makes sense
to look for him here at this hour.

03:56.013 --> 03:57.325
And most importantly,

03:57.383 --> 03:59.795
how can you be sure
he wants to see you?

04:05.271 --> 04:09.191
Are you telling me
he doesn't want to see me?

04:10.109 --> 04:11.409
Think whatever you want.

04:12.054 --> 04:14.762
I'll be leaving if you don't mind.

04:16.147 --> 04:17.147
Hey.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.402
Wait!

04:36.455 --> 04:39.177
I'm doing my internship in Bangkok,

04:39.290 --> 04:42.100
and Kao is doing his upcountry,
so we didn't meet recently.

04:42.270 --> 04:45.586
I haven't seen Poon since the day
you ordered him a suspension.

04:46.190 --> 04:50.744
I really don't know which friend
he is staying with.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.733
I asked Kao about Poon,

04:52.770 --> 04:57.994
and I only knew that he'd stay
with a friend during this time.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.080
Should we report this
because it seems like he disappeared?

05:01.135 --> 05:02.435
Maybe,

05:02.878 --> 05:06.628
he was kidnapped and imprisoned!

05:06.851 --> 05:09.306
Perhaps, he got an accident,
or something terrible happened.

05:09.794 --> 05:12.619
Gosh!  What should we do?

05:23.883 --> 05:24.883
Poon...

05:27.170 --> 05:28.868
Please come back to me.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.483
Thank you, Poon.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.909
Customers are very impressed
with your food.

06:46.798 --> 06:50.813
No, I owed you.
Thanks to you and Mayom,

06:51.749 --> 06:55.180
I'm working here and have a place
to stay during a hard time.

06:57.004 --> 07:00.623
No, it's because you have been destined
to be a chef at my restaurant.

07:01.938 --> 07:03.884
And you can't escape your destiny.

07:05.927 --> 07:10.358
Well, Poon, I really don't understand.
What is the reason for hiding?

07:11.739 --> 07:13.139
Why do you ask me that?

07:13.558 --> 07:18.238
Ping, Pan, and Pong
keep asking me every day

07:18.761 --> 07:20.415
if I know your whereabouts.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.023
Honestly, I don't know how long
I can keep this a secret.

07:25.034 --> 07:27.134
So what? Just play dumb.

07:27.428 --> 07:31.165
Don't you know Athip
keeps looking for you everywhere?

07:32.779 --> 07:34.946
- Stop mentioning his name.
- Hey!

07:39.486 --> 07:40.786
I understand how you feel.

07:41.606 --> 07:44.932
Something only gets better with time.

07:52.871 --> 07:54.438
If you stop being mad at him,

07:55.608 --> 07:57.637
will your relationship thaw?

07:58.912 --> 08:02.123
Do not let history repeats itself,
you know?

08:05.755 --> 08:07.155
Did you talk about me?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.404
Well,

08:09.668 --> 08:11.241
I was talking in general.

08:21.386 --> 08:22.384
Right.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.286
What was once broken

08:28.625 --> 08:30.324
would never be the same again.

08:38.235 --> 08:40.930
Customers are coming in. Let's go work.

08:43.585 --> 08:45.385
- Tell me if you need anything.
- Sure.

08:57.479 --> 08:59.508
I know Poon's whereabouts.

09:09.063 --> 09:11.282
- Hello!
- Hi, Mr.Taywich.

09:11.292 --> 09:13.581
Here, I bought something for you.

09:13.592 --> 09:15.200
These are for you.

09:16.321 --> 09:17.437
- Careful.
- Thank you.

09:17.448 --> 09:19.918
- And these are for the chefs.
- Oh, okay.

09:19.929 --> 09:22.125
- Please give to them.
- Of course!

09:26.005 --> 09:27.442
Well, well, well.

09:27.863 --> 09:32.191
I think I sense the love in the air.
You paid Miss Amy a visit, did you?

09:32.202 --> 09:36.826
I thought I'd contained myself well.
Is it that obvious?

09:40.176 --> 09:43.914
Yes, and it contrasts with
Mr.Athip's vibes recently.

09:44.036 --> 09:46.973
Eh? What's wrong with Tian?

09:46.984 --> 09:50.205
Oh, Mr.Taywich,
You are so out of the loop.

10:07.538 --> 10:09.704
- Don't worry.  I'll take care of him.
- Please.

10:15.309 --> 10:16.809
Hey, Tian.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.924
Haven't you been eating anything?
You look haggard.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.616
I have been trying,

10:33.093 --> 10:35.553
but I don't feel appetite
when it isn't Poon's food.

10:37.992 --> 10:39.192
I see.

10:40.539 --> 10:44.710
I bought you Pork Crackling
from Chiang Mai. Have some.

10:45.362 --> 10:46.659
No, let's keep them for staff.

10:48.762 --> 10:50.846
How is your relationship with Amy?

10:51.224 --> 10:55.330
We chill,
and I'm not rushing it anyway.

11:08.244 --> 11:10.971
I haven't eaten anything.
How about having lunch with me?

11:12.179 --> 11:13.579
I don't want to.

11:14.448 --> 11:15.572
Let's go have lunch.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.572
Do you remember Teng Nueng?
His restaurant is open now.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.546
No, I want to work.

11:25.432 --> 11:26.432
Come on.

11:37.737 --> 11:39.495
Please. Let's visit him.

11:40.754 --> 11:43.190
- And you can have some lunch.
- No.

11:46.712 --> 11:47.712
Let's go.

11:57.627 --> 11:58.627
Let's go.

12:01.219 --> 12:02.488
Let's go, Tian.

12:02.629 --> 12:05.216
Come on, let's go eat.

12:05.709 --> 12:07.191
Why are you so badgering?

12:07.791 --> 12:08.991
Are you going or not?

12:09.744 --> 12:10.744
Fine, I'll go.

12:11.902 --> 12:12.902
Great!

12:19.358 --> 12:20.358
Oh.

12:22.340 --> 12:25.701
- Hello.
- Hi, Athip.  Hi, Taywich.

12:25.775 --> 12:29.164
We haven't met since the day
of the competition.

12:29.205 --> 12:33.264
I hope your restaurant is always
packed with customers.

12:33.282 --> 12:36.036
and has a hundred branches expansion
this year.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.758
- That would be great, though.
- Right?

12:38.940 --> 12:40.946
Anyway, thanks for having lunch here.

12:41.092 --> 12:43.175
- Please have a seat first.
- Sure, thanks.

12:43.617 --> 12:44.638
This is mine.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.893
Here is the menu.

12:52.795 --> 12:53.895
Thank you.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.131
I will have a Papaya Salad,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.500
Deep Fried Pork with Fish Sauce,

13:03.800 --> 13:05.600
Sweet and Sour Vegetables Stir-Fry,

13:05.635 --> 13:07.934
and Spicy Grilled Pork Salad.

13:09.406 --> 13:10.406
Hmm...

13:16.412 --> 13:19.392
You are here to eat, not to grieve.
Do you want anything else?

13:20.227 --> 13:21.794
- No, thank you.
- Alright.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.972
That's all for now.

13:27.362 --> 13:28.362
Thank you.

13:37.861 --> 13:38.861
Thank you.

13:38.958 --> 13:41.868
Feel free to comment on the food.

13:42.053 --> 13:45.393
Only just by smelling,
I already gave you...

13:46.152 --> 13:48.080
a five-star rating, Teng Nueng.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.428
You are overpraising.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.860
- Have a taste, Athip.
- Sure.

13:57.299 --> 13:58.299
Thank you again

14:09.650 --> 14:11.191
Do you think he will recognize?

14:13.681 --> 14:16.451
I don't know. What do you think?

14:24.411 --> 14:25.411
Oh.

14:26.255 --> 14:27.855
Wow, it's really delicious.

14:29.571 --> 14:30.571
By the way,

14:31.271 --> 14:34.088
What were we talking about
before we left the hotel?

14:39.094 --> 14:42.554
Is it about you regretted fighting
with Poon and wanted to apologize?

14:43.055 --> 14:44.149
What happened actually?

14:46.886 --> 14:50.348
He acted like he wanted to leave me
and work for someone else.

14:51.581 --> 14:52.881
I couldn't bear that,

14:54.823 --> 14:56.437
so I picked a fight with him.

14:57.126 --> 14:58.680
And I want to beat myself up for that.

15:01.437 --> 15:03.380
Come on, you have to go easy sometimes.

15:05.027 --> 15:06.027
Here.

15:06.223 --> 15:08.919
Eat some food
so you can continue looking for him.

15:12.697 --> 15:14.148
It's been a month,

15:16.769 --> 15:18.275
and I don't know how he's doing.

16:00.871 --> 16:02.941
Wait. What's with that beam?

16:04.206 --> 16:06.346
I think I know Poon's whereabouts.

16:11.932 --> 16:13.332
So where is he?

16:15.358 --> 16:18.283
Poon, You can't keep hiding
from me after all.

16:19.588 --> 16:22.050
- Hey!
- Wait, Mr. Athip.

16:22.061 --> 16:24.221
- Don't be so impulsive
- Mayom.

16:25.668 --> 16:28.572
You didn't bother to tell me
even if you knew it all along.

16:29.499 --> 16:30.463
Get out of my way.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.335
Please listen to me

16:33.123 --> 16:35.793
if you don't want what happened
at chef Pipob's to repeat.

16:37.165 --> 16:38.165
What do you mean?

16:40.095 --> 16:42.050
He isn't ready to listen to you now.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.820
He will understand me
if I get a chance to explain.

16:50.161 --> 16:51.161
Wait, Athip.

16:52.046 --> 16:55.345
He won't listen to you
because he is still mad at you.

16:55.732 --> 16:58.549
If you guys meet up now,
there will definitely be a fight.

17:00.546 --> 17:04.326
He's right, Tian. Listen to him.

17:05.150 --> 17:08.093
Even though you talk to him now,

17:08.179 --> 17:09.642
he won't hear you out
if his mind is close.

17:12.627 --> 17:15.892
So what should I do
to make him listen to me?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.031
Your regular customer gave you this.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.146
I'll leave it here.

17:37.172 --> 17:38.472
Wait up!

17:38.735 --> 17:40.816
How did the customer know it was me?

17:41.639 --> 17:43.139
He said he recognize your food.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.434
I have never cheated on you
and I didn't have feelings for him.

18:59.667 --> 19:00.918
Enjoy your food.

19:14.298 --> 19:15.494
Enjoy your food.

19:25.601 --> 19:26.601
Teng.

19:28.813 --> 19:30.851
Did you recruit a new chef?

19:31.510 --> 19:33.226
Why didn't you consult me ​​first?

19:34.938 --> 19:39.952
Did you forget that this restaurant
belongs to the two of us?

19:41.589 --> 19:43.471
At least, you should have told me.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.981
Tan, we broke up, remember?

19:49.482 --> 19:51.460
It'd be difficult for both of us
to work together.

19:52.885 --> 19:55.694
- I want to buy back your shares too.
- I'm not selling.

19:56.808 --> 20:00.568
Didn't I tell you that
I would do anything

20:01.361 --> 20:03.366
to bring you back to me.?

20:04.393 --> 20:06.719
I think I have made it
clear since you mentioned it.

20:07.085 --> 20:09.162
Our relationship was over.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.140
Accept it, Tan.

20:11.856 --> 20:12.905
Teng...

20:13.929 --> 20:16.804
You have changed a lot.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.569
Don't you understand?

20:19.384 --> 20:21.012
Why keep bugging him?

20:25.404 --> 20:27.942
You have come up with all reasons
to break up with me,

20:28.255 --> 20:30.218
Yet you have never told me about him.

20:31.386 --> 20:32.386
About whom again?

20:34.999 --> 20:38.248
Well, I can clearly see now
why you want to break up with me.

20:39.058 --> 20:40.645
It's because you have him, right?

20:41.282 --> 20:42.682
Tan.

20:43.371 --> 20:46.234
Oh, god. I'm not having an affair
with him.

20:47.893 --> 20:49.273
Don't make excuses.

20:50.199 --> 20:51.971
You better tell me now

20:52.370 --> 20:55.721
since when have you cheated on me?

20:55.908 --> 20:58.281
- Do not insult him in front of me!
- Mayom.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.093
Mayom...

21:03.745 --> 21:08.263
Tan, I have never cheated on you.

21:10.113 --> 21:11.715
I don't have feelings for him.

21:23.294 --> 21:24.494
Alright.

21:25.761 --> 21:30.333
If you insist,
I will believe you this time

21:31.387 --> 21:35.950
that you don't have feelings for him
in the slightest.

21:40.036 --> 21:41.684
- Mayom.
- I'm sorry.

21:42.976 --> 21:45.656
- For meddling with your relationship.
- Good!

21:45.820 --> 21:47.221
Finally, you are aware.

21:47.232 --> 21:49.232
- Mayom.
- Teng.

21:49.243 --> 21:50.343
Where are you going?

22:14.514 --> 22:17.994
Mr. Athip, relax.
I believe there must be a solution.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.470
I have got an idea.

22:28.527 --> 22:29.927
Wait a moment.

22:33.342 --> 22:34.542
Excuse me.

22:38.197 --> 22:41.665
Let's try this, uncle Tian.
First, we need a plate.

22:41.676 --> 22:44.126
And sugar which I will put in a bowl.

22:47.456 --> 22:49.356
Now I will mix it with food colouring.

22:52.519 --> 22:53.937
Just a little bit of it,

22:55.904 --> 22:58.156
and mix them together.

22:59.108 --> 23:02.718
Now, lay a stencil paper on the plate.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.430
and scatter dyed sugar over it,

23:07.160 --> 23:09.530
Just a little by little, like this.

23:11.035 --> 23:13.444
I think this is a good idea.

23:13.872 --> 23:16.312
- Who teach you this?
- No one.

23:16.508 --> 23:18.248
It was just popped up in my head.

23:19.879 --> 23:21.379
What do you think, uncle Tian?

23:21.523 --> 23:22.823
Okay by me.

23:23.045 --> 23:24.550
I'm sure Poon will be thawed by it.

23:26.794 --> 23:29.012
Let's practice, uncle Tian.

23:29.604 --> 23:30.804
Here you go.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.712
Here, try it.

24:05.645 --> 24:08.009
- Hello, Athip. Please have a seat.
- Hi. Thank you.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.355
- Can I please get Tom Yum Fried Rice?
- Sure.

24:17.705 --> 24:19.905
- Please wait a moment.
- Thank you.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.357
(It's my bad.)

25:34.438 --> 25:36.067
Come on, just forgive him.

26:10.976 --> 26:12.543
Hey, what's wrong?

26:13.008 --> 26:14.675
You look so downhearted.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.543
I think...

26:18.770 --> 26:20.170
my heart is broken.

26:22.294 --> 26:25.767
Have you already confessed to him?

26:26.405 --> 26:29.292
I made it clear to him
from the beginning,

26:30.156 --> 26:32.140
and he's known my feelings since then.

26:35.018 --> 26:37.994
Dear me, he rejected you?

26:42.252 --> 26:44.392
I think he's probably going back
to his partner.

26:45.134 --> 26:46.134
Hey...

26:46.814 --> 26:49.332
I don't think so.
They broke up, didn't they?

26:49.766 --> 26:51.512
But they can reconcile, though.

26:52.392 --> 26:54.395
And they love each other so much.

26:56.442 --> 26:59.244
That doesn't sound like you.
How come you are so discouraged today?

27:00.363 --> 27:03.354
Didn't you just announce it
the other day?

27:03.467 --> 27:05.373
That you won't let them to reconcile.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.992
But they have been together
for five years.

27:13.986 --> 27:15.756
How can I stop them?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.734
Oi!

27:19.077 --> 27:22.579
What has passed is past.
Don't bother about it.

27:23.441 --> 27:26.831
At least he is now giving you a chance.

27:27.374 --> 27:29.178
- Right?
- I don't know.

27:32.155 --> 27:35.680
So when will you forgive Athip?

27:36.888 --> 27:40.530
I really want to give him a trophy
for his effort to come here every day.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.155
Your medicine, Mr. Athip.
How is your stomachache?

28:20.425 --> 28:22.107
It's intermittent.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.537
- When's the doctor's next appointment?
- Next Monday.

28:26.813 --> 28:29.433
Have you followed the advice

28:29.624 --> 28:31.914
about avoiding spicy food at all?

28:33.504 --> 28:35.004
I can't, though.

28:36.396 --> 28:38.387
Anyway, I'm going out
for lunch shortly.

28:39.150 --> 28:42.125
Does it mean you completely ignore
the doctor's advice?

28:47.551 --> 28:50.751
Do I have any appointments
in the afternoon?

28:52.491 --> 28:54.421
No, but you have urgent matters
to look at.

29:10.942 --> 29:14.706
Mayom, I've been thinking about
reallocating all the space.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.990
I'd like to put more tables in here.

29:20.048 --> 29:21.248
Sure.

29:21.525 --> 29:25.705
And your station needs to be
moved back a little bit.

29:26.021 --> 29:29.161
Are you okay with that?

29:29.230 --> 29:30.430
It's fine with me.

29:37.239 --> 29:40.962
Can you look at me when you talk to me?

29:43.222 --> 29:44.922
Okay now?

29:46.262 --> 29:49.409
It's because of what I said
the other day, right?

29:50.282 --> 29:53.079
Well, I've already told you

29:53.761 --> 29:57.967
that I can keep my personal matters
separate from work.

30:00.241 --> 30:04.176
Hey, I didn't mean to say it that way.

30:04.757 --> 30:07.497
Oh, Mr.Athip is coming over there.
You go take care of him.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.373
You know I'm rooting for him.

30:09.753 --> 30:12.671
I'm sure Poon will see all the efforts

30:13.537 --> 30:15.856
he is putting into him.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.434
You know there is a difference

30:20.779 --> 30:23.181
between reconciling with people
who still love you

30:23.251 --> 30:24.803
and who don't anymore.

30:31.823 --> 30:33.354
- Hello, Athip.
- Hello.

30:37.709 --> 30:39.009
Are you okay?

30:40.607 --> 30:42.007
Yes, I'm fine.

30:43.012 --> 30:44.412
Just a little headache.

31:41.568 --> 31:42.568
Hey.

31:43.685 --> 31:45.485
Are you okay, Athip?

31:49.439 --> 31:50.539
Poon.

31:54.489 --> 31:56.338
You finally come to see me.

31:58.860 --> 32:02.257
Quit worrying about me!
You better worry about yourself now.

32:23.059 --> 32:26.183
Wow, not only you are a homewrecker,
but now you are assaulting me?

32:26.437 --> 32:27.757
So shameless.

32:40.018 --> 32:41.018
Here.

32:44.383 --> 32:47.378
Don't be distraught,
I'm getting better.

32:49.067 --> 32:52.967
Damn, why would you keep ordering
spicy food when you can't eat it?

32:53.298 --> 32:54.929
How many days have you suffered?

32:56.959 --> 32:58.669
Why don't you order something else?

32:59.843 --> 33:01.343
Actually, I can eat some.

33:02.085 --> 33:05.482
But I have stomachache
because I have eaten consecutively.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.764
Most importantly,
I want to eat food you cook.

33:14.946 --> 33:16.068
You...

33:21.065 --> 33:22.381
aren't mad at me anymore, right?

33:24.569 --> 33:25.869
I'm sorry

33:27.047 --> 33:28.447
I was too impulsive.

33:30.359 --> 33:32.587
I misunderstood things
and picked a fight with you

33:33.210 --> 33:35.317
I'm sorry too.

33:36.241 --> 33:40.332
Once I calmed down,
I realized my fault,

33:40.622 --> 33:43.620
and I was tightlipped.

33:44.055 --> 33:47.485
I was too emotional and kept running
away from my own problems.

34:10.794 --> 34:12.898
Apart from forgiving each other,

34:14.415 --> 34:16.531
I think we have to
forgive ourselves too.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.130
You are good at reconciling.
Where did you learn it from?

34:40.358 --> 34:43.420
- I won't tell you.
- You have a secret with me?

34:43.671 --> 34:47.434
We just reconciled,
don't start a fight again.

34:49.473 --> 34:52.551
Poon, promise me.

34:53.576 --> 34:56.706
From now on, we have to open up
to each other

34:57.014 --> 34:58.814
to avoid misunderstandings and fights.

34:59.824 --> 35:01.609
Moreover, don't run away from me again.

35:03.311 --> 35:04.911
I'm doing it right now.

35:05.726 --> 35:09.170
Starting tomorrow, you can return
and work as a chef at the hotel.

35:09.966 --> 35:11.739
So I can see you every day.

35:12.997 --> 35:16.907
I don't think I will return
to your hotel and be a chef again.

35:17.353 --> 35:19.873
Eh? Is there a problem?

35:20.256 --> 35:21.766
I'll handle it for you.

35:21.939 --> 35:22.939
I think...

35:25.348 --> 35:26.648
the problem is here.

35:29.604 --> 35:32.466
It's the matter of boss
and subordinate.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.271
I can't help but feel bad

35:35.403 --> 35:38.945
if you punish me like you did again.

35:39.852 --> 35:43.402
And don't tell me to keep
personal matters separate from work.

35:43.782 --> 35:46.993
Because it's easier to say than do.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.795
In that case,
I have another vacancy for you.

35:56.504 --> 35:59.544
- And it isn't a chef position.
- What is it?

36:02.227 --> 36:03.527
Do you have a paper?

36:05.536 --> 36:07.036
Why do you want it for?

36:23.586 --> 36:25.386
This position is only for you.

36:29.587 --> 36:31.420
(Application for partner position)

36:36.128 --> 36:40.936
Excuse me, but what are
the job discriptions for the position?

36:42.739 --> 36:44.806
You have to cook for me
three times a day,

36:45.638 --> 36:47.956
and say you love me after each meals.

36:48.811 --> 36:52.081
Oh, it's too hard. I can't do it.

36:53.801 --> 36:56.503
You already got the job
even if you haven't applied for it.

36:58.570 --> 36:59.770
Be my partner, Poon.

37:02.668 --> 37:05.746
You haven't told me the pay

37:06.990 --> 37:11.712
and benefits I'll get
for being your partner.

37:13.460 --> 37:17.794
Well, it's a lifetime contract,
24/7 and no holiday job.

37:18.615 --> 37:20.215
Doesn't it sound too exploit?

37:21.124 --> 37:22.791
As for the pay,

37:24.659 --> 37:26.339
I'll give you all my heart.

37:30.047 --> 37:31.862
Should I accept it?

37:31.900 --> 37:33.733
- Yes, you should.
- No.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.147
Why do I have to sign it, anyway?

37:37.762 --> 37:39.888
- I'll make you sign.
- What for?

37:40.296 --> 37:41.829
No, I can sign it myself.

37:42.892 --> 37:44.445
- I'll sign it.
- Come here.

37:50.467 --> 37:53.787
He's better now, but I'll take him
to the hospital to make sure.

37:54.931 --> 37:57.601
Uh, can I take a half-day leave,
Mr. Teng Nueng?

37:58.350 --> 37:59.350
Sure.

38:00.548 --> 38:01.548
By the way, Athip,

38:01.771 --> 38:04.837
You should refrain from
eating spicy food for now.

38:06.358 --> 38:10.986
I don't think so because I always
feel like I can't get enough of it.

38:15.111 --> 38:18.492
I'm glad you guys have reconciled
with each other.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.658
- Well.
- I feel so relieved.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.965
Thanks again, Teng.

38:24.515 --> 38:28.115
I am lucky enough to get a chance
to reconcile with him.

38:28.391 --> 38:32.102
And I hope you and Mayom
can open up to each other too,

38:32.371 --> 38:34.290
before it's too late.

38:38.590 --> 38:40.699
Sure, I'll give it a try.

38:53.727 --> 38:54.727
Eh?

38:55.378 --> 38:57.142
Save it for tomorrow.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.610
It's late now,
and you better have some rest.

39:00.170 --> 39:03.501
Put the light back on, Mayom.
I have almost finished it.

39:16.190 --> 39:20.190
I used to handle these fussy document
when I was a chef at the hotel.

39:21.065 --> 39:23.237
So let me help you finish it.

39:25.518 --> 39:26.518
Thank you.

39:45.751 --> 39:48.484
Done. So I'll be leaving now.

39:48.955 --> 39:51.440
Oh, are you leaving?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.005
Do you have time for me?
I want to talk to you.

40:00.643 --> 40:01.643
Oh, wow.

40:03.255 --> 40:05.465
So hiring you is a good idea, though.

40:05.815 --> 40:10.446
During the day, you are a chef,
and you turn into a watchdog at night.

40:11.714 --> 40:13.913
At least I'm doing what I have to do,

40:14.308 --> 40:18.586
unlike someone who shows up
only when he wants to.

40:19.237 --> 40:21.397
- You mean me?
- Tan!

40:22.843 --> 40:27.657
If you are here only to pick a fight,
please just leave.

40:33.611 --> 40:34.911
- Ouch.
- Hey.

40:35.296 --> 40:36.696
Does it relapse, Teng?

40:37.212 --> 40:40.735
You haven't gotten enough rest, right?
Have you taken medicine?

40:41.620 --> 40:44.032
- Would you like hot ginger juice?
- Are you okay?

40:46.296 --> 40:49.204
Don't you know that
he has a medical condition?

40:49.763 --> 40:51.422
And you claimed you know him so well.

40:54.635 --> 40:56.745
See?  I told you.

40:57.261 --> 40:59.000
No one can take care of you
better than me.

40:59.349 --> 41:02.370
What a shameless claim!
Take care, my ass.

41:02.983 --> 41:05.579
- You have always aggrieved him.
- Shut up!

41:05.827 --> 41:09.035
You have been meddling with
our relationship all along.

41:09.272 --> 41:14.055
Teng and I would have already gotten
back together if it wasn't for you.

41:14.465 --> 41:16.836
Come on, you blame everything
but yourself.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.830
You keep asking for a chance,
and you destroy it every other time.

41:20.854 --> 41:23.500
- Why bother in the first place?
- You are too much!

41:25.852 --> 41:29.057
I can do much more than this. Try me!

41:30.532 --> 41:34.094
Wow, not only you are a homewrecker,
but now you are assaulting me?

41:34.105 --> 41:37.291
- You should be ashamed.
- I'm still better than you, though.

41:37.543 --> 41:41.153
You keep bugging him
even though he broke up with you.

41:41.794 --> 41:43.463
You are just a play gooseberry!

41:43.474 --> 41:45.505
- So what, TwatCunt?
- Hey!

41:47.816 --> 41:51.032
Stop! Please don't give me
more headaches.

41:53.842 --> 41:54.842
Ouch.

41:57.191 --> 41:59.434
Let's have a seat, Teng.

42:01.077 --> 42:03.167
Get the medicine! It's in the bag!

42:07.184 --> 42:08.384
Are you okay?

42:13.790 --> 42:14.790
Give it to me!

42:16.768 --> 42:18.068
This is the medicine.

42:28.475 --> 42:29.475
Water.

42:32.492 --> 42:35.850
If you want to help him so badly,
go make a cup of hot ginger juice.

42:46.977 --> 42:48.070
I'll get you the eye mask.

43:07.736 --> 43:09.689
Can we get back together now?

43:16.172 --> 43:17.921
Tan, I have changed.

43:19.801 --> 43:21.301
I don't love you anymore.

43:22.913 --> 43:26.223
I can't believe you choose someone
you have just met

43:27.145 --> 43:30.649
over me who have been with you
for five years.

43:34.421 --> 43:37.370
I really can't believe
you are such a fickle person.

43:41.998 --> 43:43.692
You can judge me any way you'd like.

43:44.852 --> 43:46.945
But I know exactly what I am doing.

43:49.053 --> 43:51.963
If you think he's better than me,
have it your way.

43:52.784 --> 43:56.724
But don't change your mind or
ever regret what you have done to me.

44:02.883 --> 44:04.483
Once we really broke up,

44:07.350 --> 44:09.173
you acted like we never loved
each other.

44:12.840 --> 44:16.147
Don't blame me. You chose it yourself.

45:07.275 --> 45:08.475
Teng.

45:10.673 --> 45:12.073
Teng Nueng.

45:17.232 --> 45:18.532
I'm sorry.

45:19.837 --> 45:21.837
I should have noticed it earlier.

46:01.755 --> 46:03.278
This is all I can do for you.

46:05.458 --> 46:06.845
Take care and get well soon.

46:19.096 --> 46:20.629
Can you stay with me for a while?

46:22.478 --> 46:24.011
I really want to talk to you.

46:36.395 --> 46:39.095
- Is the soup ready?
- Wait a minute. It's boiling now.

46:39.106 --> 46:42.330
Oh, my. Your kitchen is so chaotic.
Haven't you got a new head chef?

46:43.388 --> 46:45.088
Won't you change your mind?

46:45.400 --> 46:47.800
I want you to work here with me.

46:48.057 --> 46:51.157
I have to work at Teng's restaurant.

46:53.155 --> 46:54.451
Do you see that box?

46:54.600 --> 46:57.395
Go have a look,
and tell me what it is in there.

46:57.896 --> 46:59.140
Hey.

46:59.249 --> 47:02.304
Don't you think
it's a little bit too much?
