‐ What are you doing?
‐ What I should have done yesterday.

475
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:06,063
Excuse me. Hey!

476
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:12,361
Uh... so...

477
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:14,404
Not that it's anyone's business,

478
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:17,616
but Mia didn't cheat on me.

479
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:22,663
And it's also not her fault
that we broke up.

480
00:23:24,456 --> 00:23:27,709
It's not anyone's fault. Um...

481
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,254
The truth is...

482
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,633
I'm gay...

483
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:38,137
and I'm with Benji now.

VICTOR:
I‐I don't want it to be a secret anymore,

486
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:46,353
because I'm happy about it. Like...

487
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:48,647
Like really, really happy.

488
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,524
STUDENT [softly]: That's cool.
STUDENT 2: Yeah.

‐ So, uh... yeah.

00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:59,616
Uh, we won't be
taking any questions at this time.

VICTOR:
Dear Simon,

493
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,463
it wasn't as smooth as I planned,

494
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:15,883
but Benji and I are
officially out at Creekwood.

495
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:18,969
To be honest, I don't know
how people are gonna react,

496
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:21,472
and I don't care.

497
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:24,016
You taught me everything I know
about being brave.

498
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:25,267
And, and who knows?

499
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,644
Maybe one day I can inspire someone
to be themselves,

500
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:29,271
the same way you inspired me.
