&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>

&lrm;-Hail &lrm;<i>Scarlet Moth!</i>

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.380
&lrm;<i>-Hail Scarlet Moth! Hail Scarlet Moth!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Today shall be known as Villains' Day!</i>

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.260
&lrm;<i>-Hail Scarlet Moth! Hail Scarlet Moth!</i>
&lrm;-Oh!

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.100
&lrm;It's time, Scarlet Moth.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.980
&lrm;Hail Scarlet Moth!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.340
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,
&lrm;I can feel your close presence.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.900
&lrm;If you want to save Paris
&lrm;and all its people,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.900
&lrm;I'll give you one last chance.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.300
&lrm;Give yourselves up
&lrm;and bring me your Miraculous!

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.820
&lrm;Penny for your thoughts?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.260
&lrm;It's like he's been preparing for this
&lrm;for a long time, but we...

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.900
&lrm;-We're not prepared for this.
&lrm;-Yes, we are!

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.580
&lrm;We've already fought them all and won.
&lrm;And there are five of us this time.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.660
&lrm;If we want to win,
&lrm;we have to defeat Hawk Moth,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.980
&lrm;even though we've never fought him before.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.580
&lrm;Hawk Moth!
&lrm;I hope you enjoyed Volpina's illusion,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.180
&lrm;because the real Ladybug
&lrm;will never hand you over her Miraculous!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.340
&lrm;And we've got a better idea.
&lrm;You're going to give us&lrm;<i> your</i>&lrm; Miraculous!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.180
&lrm;-You may have akumatized warriors...
&lrm;-But we're a whole team of superheroes!

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.860
&lrm;You're going to wish you never wore
&lrm;that utterly ridiculous costume!

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.500
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha! I understand you want a fight.
&lrm;Then so be it!

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.540
&lrm;Guitar Villain, Frightningale, music!

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700
&lrm;-Awesome solo!
&lrm;-[sings]

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.820
&lrm;[TV]&lrm;<i> So it begins!</i>

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.140
&lrm;<i>The scarlet army is on its way to crush</i>
&lrm;<i>these pathetic Miraculous holders!</i>

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.460
&lrm;Don't forget our main objective,
&lrm;Hawk Moth!

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.380
&lrm;Well, it's a simple plan, then.
&lrm;Go for the big, bad boss.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.580
&lrm;-Let's get him!
&lrm;-I'll cover you!

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860
&lrm;You can count on me, Ladybug!

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.580
&lrm;Cyclone!

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.100
&lrm;Horus, give me your wings!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.900
&lrm;Thunderbolt!

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.260
&lrm;Carapace, shield!

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.460
&lrm;Your swords are no match for Cat Noir!

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.700
&lrm;Show 'em what you've got!

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.220
&lrm;Queen Bee, Pharaoh's pendant!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.860
&lrm;Well done!

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.900
&lrm;Hmm? Aaah!

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.300
&lrm;Rena Rouge, rescue!

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.020
&lrm;Good aim, Chloé!

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.460
&lrm;It's Queen Bee to you, Fox.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.860
&lrm;-We make a pretty cool team!
&lrm;-Not bad. But it's not over yet!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.140
&lrm;-It's all going to plan, Catalyst.
&lrm;-Nothing's more delightful

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.980
&lrm;than leading them to believe
&lrm;they have a chance of winning

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.460
&lrm;when their future
&lrm;has already been decided!

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.860
&lrm;Over to you, Dark Cupid!

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.300
&lrm;People of Paris!
&lrm;Just like our superheroes,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.660
&lrm;we will never give in
&lrm;to evil and villainy!

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.500
&lrm;Together, we shall resist!
&lrm;Together, we will triumph!

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.740
&lrm;-[phone rings]
&lrm;-Huh?

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.580
&lrm;Uh... Ahem! Yes, honey?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.660
&lrm;-What are you doing? Hurry up, André!
&lrm;-Yes, yes, my dear. I'm on my way!

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.300
&lrm;Ahem! Meanwhile,
&lrm;I will supervise Paris' defence...

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.020
&lrm;from my helicopter!

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.940
&lrm;Thank you!

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.940
&lrm;Audrey, my darling,
&lrm;where... where's Chloé?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.700
&lrm;Out playing superheroes again, probably.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.620
&lrm;Chloé shouldn't be playing
&lrm;the superheroine!

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.140
&lrm;It's unacceptable, utterly unacceptable!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
&lrm;Mademoiselle will have to be punished!

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.500
&lrm;Nice work, Dark Cupid!

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.020
&lrm;The Bourgeois family is now in place
&lrm;to follow my plan. Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.500
&lrm;Style Queen, Malediktator, Despair Bear.
&lrm;Chloé never does what she's told, huh?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.180
&lrm;Well, now I'm giving you the power
&lrm;to punish her once and for all!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.340
&lrm;There's bad weather on the way!

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.420
&lrm;Your forecast was wrong, Ice Queen!

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.740
&lrm;-No!
&lrm;-Gotcha!

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.060
&lrm;Your days of attacking innocent people
&lrm;will soon be over, Hawk Moth!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.340
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.420
&lrm;Hmm.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.220
&lrm;Get ready! I'm gonna need all of you!

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.380
&lrm;The time has come, Dark Cupid!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.500
&lrm;What?

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.820
&lrm;What a incredible twist! Those lousy
&lrm;heroes didn't even see it coming!

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.820
&lrm;Hawk Moth is using Dark Cupid to create
&lrm;all the negative emotions he needs!

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.620
&lrm;-This is a nightmare!
&lrm;-Stay focused!

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.100
&lrm;Villains must never prevail!

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.340
&lrm;Fall on them like rain, my scarlet akumas!

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.140
&lrm;Hmm?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.380
&lrm;Watch out!

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.380
&lrm;Oh, no!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.100
&lrm;<i>Now watch Scarlet Moth's relentless plan</i>
&lrm;<i>to get rid of your precious protectors!</i>

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.100
&lrm;[evil laugh]

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.180
&lrm;Carapace, watch out!

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.820
&lrm;Rena! No! Not you!

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.540
&lrm;Grr!

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.540
&lrm;Hands off!

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.980
&lrm;You flyweight!

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.300
&lrm;Rena Rouge,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.940
&lrm;don't let negative emotions take over
&lrm;or you might get akumatized too!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.020
&lrm;-And that's exactly what Hawk Moth wants!
&lrm;-Hold on!

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.700
&lrm;You are not cut out to be a hero!

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.580
&lrm;Let go of me, you weakling!

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.500
&lrm;Shh... Easy...

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.180
&lrm;You don't have to worry about me, Ladybug!

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.860
&lrm;I'll never let my emotions
&lrm;get the better of me!

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.940
&lrm;You should never say "never".

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.380
&lrm;Chloé!

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.740
&lrm;Daddy? Mommy?

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.620
&lrm;Queen Bee, focus!

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.620
&lrm;By the power vested in me,
&lrm;stop playing superheroes!

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.180
&lrm;I am now... Rena Rage!

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.340
&lrm;No!

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.420
&lrm;Carapace, no!

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.580
&lrm;There is no more Carapace!

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.180
&lrm;There is only Shell Shock!

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.420
&lrm;Stop!

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.820
&lrm;Queen Bee!

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.340
&lrm;That's Queen Wasp to you, Cockroach!

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.660
&lrm;This might be a good time
&lrm;to use that lucky charm of yours!

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.820
&lrm;I needed all of us to make it work.
&lrm;I can't do anything with it now!

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.100
&lrm;Game, set and match, Ladybug.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.940
&lrm;-I don't see how we'll get out of this.
&lrm;-We can't lose hope,

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.380
&lrm;-or we'll get akumatized too.
&lrm;-Pretty cataclysmic situation, huh?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.740
&lrm;Cataclysm! That's it!
&lrm;Beneath us, Cat Noir!

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.300
&lrm;Of course! Cataclysm!

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.540
&lrm;No more Ladybug and Cat Noir!
&lrm;Have they destroyed themselves, or... ?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.980
&lrm;I'm about to transform back!

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.660
&lrm;I'll go this way. You go that way!

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.420
&lrm;That was a close one!

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.180
&lrm;Claws in!

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.460
&lrm;Enjoy it, but don't take too long.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.900
&lrm;Let's share it. You're gonna need it too!

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.780
&lrm;Thank you, Plagg!

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.860
&lrm;Animan! Track down Ladybug and Cat Noir.
&lrm;They must not escape!

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.180
&lrm;You OK, Ladybug?

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.980
&lrm;Hawk Moth has never re-akumatized so many
&lrm;people in one go! Something's changed.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.740
&lrm;Maybe he's figured out how to boost
&lrm;his powers, just like we did.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.540
&lrm;You still think we can win?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.540
&lrm;Like you said, we can't lose hope!
&lrm;People are relying on us.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.660
&lrm;But our team crumbled.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.380
&lrm;Then let's go back
&lrm;to what's always worked, a duo!

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.020
&lrm;You and me against the world, Milady!

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.700
&lrm;[growling]

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.580
&lrm;They're coming!

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.980
&lrm;You like water rides?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.860
&lrm;Don't forget to put your diving gear on!

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.420
&lrm;Tikki, power up!

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.740
&lrm;Plagg, power up!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.100
&lrm;Whoa!

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.860
&lrm;Syren!

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.260
&lrm;Better get fishing!

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.460
&lrm;It'll take time to de-akumatize
&lrm;all his villains one by one.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.180
&lrm;Which is exactly why
&lrm;we have to take on Hawk Moth directly.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.820
&lrm;He's using his cane
&lrm;to re-akumatize his victims.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.340
&lrm;If we can destroy it, he won't have
&lrm;an army fighting for him any more.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.460
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha! Behold my triumph, Parisians!

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.700
&lrm;Your champions are trapped!

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.700
&lrm;-Spots off!
&lrm;-Claws in!

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.860
&lrm;Aaah!

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.100
&lrm;You sure don't want to miss
&lrm;what's coming next!

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.780
&lrm;Time to show everyone
&lrm;that the real Ladybug is back!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.020
&lrm;Look! The heroes are back!

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.060
&lrm;Whoo-whoo!

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.500
&lrm;Stop filming, Prime Queen!

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.780
&lrm;No more escaping for you, knaves!
&lrm;Down with the enemy!

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.820
&lrm;I suggest we take a little detour!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.580
&lrm;Couldn't agree more, Milady!

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.100
&lrm;-Any miraculous ideas, Milady?
&lrm;-Besides running and surviving, you mean?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.260
&lrm;Parisians,
&lrm;we can be heroes, just for one day!

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.500
&lrm;Yes! Yes!

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.820
&lrm;What? A revolution? Charge!

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.500
&lrm;Run!

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.700
&lrm;Are you OK?

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.060
&lrm;-It's awesome seeing you guys again!
&lrm;-Parisians are all on your side!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.380
&lrm;We'll slow them down.
&lrm;You two go save the world!

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.780
&lrm;You are all fantastic, thank you!
&lrm;Take care!

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.340
&lrm;Thank you!

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.220
&lrm;Get them, my giants!

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.340
&lrm;Destroy Ladybug and Cat Noir and anyone
&lrm;else who tries to stand in your way!

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.220
&lrm;[honking]

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.260
&lrm;Car. Vroom!

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.980
&lrm;People are amazing!

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.780
&lrm;That's precisely why you should never
&lrm;give up hope, Kitty!

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.900
&lrm;They're more resistant than I expected.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.340
&lrm;But we still have
&lrm;the last phase of our plan!

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.100
&lrm;You take care of the ice-cream man.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.860
&lrm;With pleasure.
&lrm;All this fighting's made me hungry!

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.980
&lrm;It's down to the three of us, Hawk Moth.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.700
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.140
&lrm;Lucky charm!

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.100
&lrm;It's a sign, Hawk Moth. A sign that your
&lrm;Miraculous will wind up inside this box!

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.860
&lrm;Are you sure
&lrm;you're not making a serious mistake?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.380
&lrm;How do you know
&lrm;the wish I was planning to make

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.020
&lrm;wouldn't have been beneficial?

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.820
&lrm;If you were to make a wish,
&lrm;there'd be a price to pay.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.900
&lrm;Why don't you tell us your wish,
&lrm;Hawk Moth?

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.900
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous and find out.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.860
&lrm;Unlike you,
&lrm;I'm not afraid to use these powers.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.700
&lrm;Since you are so good,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.860
&lrm;why did you never bother
&lrm;to change the world for the better?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.420
&lrm;We are changing the world for the better
&lrm;every day by our actions,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.860
&lrm;not just by wishing it
&lrm;or at the expense of innocent citizens!

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.660
&lrm;Whatever your wish, it can only be evil,
&lrm;judging by all the havoc you wreak.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.700
&lrm;The time has come.
&lrm;You're about to triumph, at last!

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.980
&lrm;It's not too late.
&lrm;You can fight for good, with us.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.420
&lrm;Aaah!

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.900
&lrm;No!

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.180
&lrm;-You're such a coward, Hawk Moth!
&lrm;-But there's no hiding this time!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.020
&lrm;Now!

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.380
&lrm;No!

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.020
&lrm;No! Argh! Ah!

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.060
&lrm;All right, kids. Watch what a man
&lrm;who's got nothing to lose can do.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.020
&lrm;You're never going to win,
&lrm;not today or any other day!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.900
&lrm;You're still so green, young superheroes.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.580
&lrm;You can't even stay transformed
&lrm;after you've used your powers!

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.980
&lrm;Need a hand?

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.580
&lrm;You're caught in our net, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;You're not going anywhere!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.340
&lrm;Venom! I'll paralyse him,
&lrm;then he'll be all yours, Ladybug!

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.180
&lrm;Hawk Moth, I am Mayura.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.260
&lrm;You're up against the wall,
&lrm;plagued by despair.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.540
&lrm;Let me help you.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.620
&lrm;No! Don't do that!

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.060
&lrm;Let your despair be embodied
&lrm;in a powerful protection!

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.780
&lrm;What is that monster? Aaah!

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.500
&lrm;A feather! The second Miraculous
&lrm;that Master Fu lost...

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.620
&lrm;Was a peacock!

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.580
&lrm;Ladybug! Hawk Moth!

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.860
&lrm;He must have escaped
&lrm;when that monster appeared.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.340
&lrm;Hawk Moth is no longer working alone.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.140
&lrm;He had help from the owner
&lrm;of the Peacock Miraculous.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.340
&lrm;Maybe this will help us track him.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.100
&lrm;Argh! Argh!

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.420
&lrm;Master?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.220
&lrm;There goes our last chance of finding him.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.500
&lrm;He must have de-transformed!

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.980
&lrm;We've gotta split, guys.
&lrm;But before that... Miraculous Ladybug!

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.100
&lrm;Here.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.580
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.140
&lrm;I told you never to use
&lrm;the Peacock Miraculous!

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.580
&lrm;I had no choice, sir! I had to save you!

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.420
&lrm;[coughs]

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.820
&lrm;It's damaged! It's way too dangerous.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.940
&lrm;I want to help you
&lrm;all the way to the end.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.500
&lrm;Thank you, Nathalie.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.860
&lrm;For everything.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.620
&lrm;There's no way I'm trying
&lrm;your homemade stuff. Too risky!

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.500
&lrm;[sobs]

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.100
&lrm;Taken! Taken as well!

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.260
&lrm;But there's a free seat over there!

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.740
&lrm;Here, here, here.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.580
&lrm;-Aaah!
&lrm;-May I?

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.380
&lrm;No... Um... go away, no... I mean...
&lrm;go ahead! Please stand... I mean, sit!

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.580
&lrm;Thanks!

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.060
&lrm;-[phone rings]
&lrm;-Oh!

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.980
&lrm;Oh, no! My father wants me to attend
&lrm;a charity event he's throwing.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.500
&lrm;I can't stay.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.540
&lrm;I wanted to tell you, Rose was right
&lrm;earlier. You're always helping people.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.580
&lrm;Like when you helped Juleka
&lrm;overcome her class photo curse,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.700
&lrm;or when you partnered Nathaniel and Marc
&lrm;to make a comic book,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.340
&lrm;or when you helped me get to the movies
&lrm;so I could see my mother on the screen.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.980
&lrm;That's why everyone
&lrm;helped you with the picnic!

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.780
&lrm;So, today, it was our turn to help you!
&lrm;You're our everyday Ladybug.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.540
&lrm;Have a good evening, Super-Marinette!

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.460
&lrm;Adrien!

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.980
&lrm;Uh... uh... uh... I... uh...

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.820
&lrm;Thank you!

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.380
&lrm;You're welcome, Marinette.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.900
&lrm;[cheering]
