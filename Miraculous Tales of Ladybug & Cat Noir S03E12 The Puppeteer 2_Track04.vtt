<i>‎But there's something about me</i>

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.140

‎-Ready to go, Adrien?
‎-Since this is going to take a while,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.460
‎can I bring a friend?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.660
‎-Wassup, bro?
<i>‎-I must go back to the Grévin wax museum.</i>

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.020
<i>‎-Do you want to come with me?</i>
‎-Sure thing, dude! I'll be right--

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.580
‎Uh... Actually,
‎Alya and I are hangin' together today.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.780
‎-Wait. Could Alya come too?
‎-Can I bring two friends?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.620
‎Hey, wait!

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.740
‎-Hey, girl!
<i>‎-You are coming with me and Nino</i>

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940
<i>‎to the wax museum! Adrien invited us!</i>

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.740
<i>‎Uh? What? But...</i>

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.700
‎There's no saying "No". We're coming
‎to get you now. You don't have a choice!

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.220
‎Could Marinette come?
‎That way, you guys could--

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.540
‎-Shh!
‎-You could stare at the statues together!

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.140
‎Marinette loves, uh... she loves statues!

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.100
‎Which is perfect since the wax museum
‎is, er, full of 'em! Ha, ha, ha!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.820
‎-Can we make that three?
‎-Mmm-hmm.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.300
‎But, Marinette,
‎what about my superhero costume?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.540
‎Humph! Everyone always forgets about me!

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.980
‎Sorry, guys! I'm looking after Manon
‎this afternoon. Go ahead without me.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.460
‎Would four work?
‎Actually, more like three and a half?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.780
‎I'll see what I can do.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700
‎Then I'll leave Marinette alone--

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.420
‎Hey, why are you leaving Marinette
‎all alone? Don't you like her?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.540
‎-What are you talking about?
‎-Nothing! It's got nothing to do

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.500
‎with us leaving you and Adrien alone
‎to look at the statues

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.060
‎as, er, just friends, of course!

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.220
‎-Ah!
‎-Don't worry, Manon!

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.100
‎Alya and Nino are going out

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.980
‎and they want to spend
‎time together without us!

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.900
‎-Phew!
‎-Really?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.540
‎But I thought you and Marinette
‎were boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.900
‎She has lots of photos of you
‎all over her bedroom!

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.100
‎She loves fashion and I'm a model.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.980
‎But then why are there so many hearts
‎drawn on them?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
‎Ha, ha, ha! Those aren't hearts!
‎Those are... upside-down spades!

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.140
‎I was just coming up with some new,
‎uh, patterns for my fabric designs!

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.740
‎-You told me you wouldn't tell Nino!
‎-I haven't!

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.980
‎-Right, Nino, I didn't tell you anything?
‎-She didn't tell me, and besides,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.580
‎-I told her I won't tell!
‎-So you didn't tell anyone

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.100
‎-what Alya didn't tell you? Or did you?
‎-What are you talking about?

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.660
‎Nothing!

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.060
‎-Hi, Véronique!
‎-Thanks for coming on such short notice.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.820
‎I'm sorry. A piece of your statue
‎went missing again!

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.860
‎Just goes to show‎how popular you are!

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.340
‎Look!
‎We get to go in even though it's closed!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.420
‎It's like we're princesses!
‎Hey! Did you hear me?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.740
‎Be careful this time. Marinette should
‎spill the beans to Adrien, not us!

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.780
‎So, no matter what Adrien asks you,
‎just deny, OK?

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.740
‎Whee! Ha, ha, ha!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.020
‎Mr Jagged! Can you give me
‎a oddy-graph, please?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.980
‎Why isn't anyone
‎paying attention to me today?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.540
‎Ha, ha! That's because this isn't the real
‎Jagged Stone. It's a wax statue of him.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.260
‎The Grévin wax museum
‎is the kingdom of illusions!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.340
‎Wow! But he looks for reals!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.860
‎The museum opened in 1882. We have about
‎200 wax statues on exhibition at any time.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.340
‎We bring new celebrities in
‎on a regular basis,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.500
‎-the most recent one being Adrien!
‎-So, you and Alya want some alone time?

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.860
‎So, no matter what Adrien asks you,
‎just deny!

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.900
‎Not at all!
‎That's not why we came here at all!

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.700
‎Then it's nice of you to come here
‎to keep me company!

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.860
‎That's not why we came here at all,
‎either!

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.420
‎Really? So why did you want to come?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.580
‎Did it have to do with Marinette?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.340
‎No, you've got it all wrong, dude!

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.860
‎Not with Marinette or with you,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.740
‎and even less with you and Marinette
‎alone by yourselves!

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.060
‎I'm confused.
‎She wants to be alone with me?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.220
‎Marinette, alone with you? No way, dude!

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.460
‎You couldn't be further from the truth!
‎It's the exact opposite, actually!

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.780
‎Marinette doesn't want to be with me?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.900
‎Aaah! Manon! Come here!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.820
‎Does she hate me?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.820
‎No, no, dude! She likes you a lot!
‎I mean, no! I mean, yes! I mean... barely!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.020
‎She barely likes you a lot! There!

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.620
‎You sure? I'd be really bummed
‎if I knew Marinette didn't like me.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.060
‎The museum opened in 1882.
‎We have about 200 wax statues...

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.620
‎Why did you tell Nino everything?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.180
‎I didn't, I swear! Besides,
‎even if I had told him everything,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.620
‎he'd still be clueless!
‎Ugh! Who cares anyway?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.220
‎I've set everything up with Nino, so you
‎can finally poor your heart out to Adrien.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.420
‎-Wait. What?
‎-We'll take off, leaving you two solo,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.820
‎-then you can spill your beans!
‎-Aaah! Aaah!

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.100
‎Not with Marinette or with you

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.300
‎and even less with you and Marinette alone
‎by yourselves!

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.660
‎No! Not like that! I'm so not ready!

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.940
‎I'd have to practise first,
‎and wash my hair,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.580
‎-and I'm not wearing my lucky socks!
‎-It's up to you,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.020
‎but I'm just telling you, today's the day!

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.780
‎Aaah! Manon! Come here!

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.500
‎Look, Marinette!
‎My mommy's a famous person too!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.620
‎Yeah! Yeah, right! OK!

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.540
‎Welcome to the workshop!

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.700
‎This is where our sculptors create
‎and repair all of our statues.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.780
‎And this is where we store our wax!

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.340
‎It comes straight from
‎our very own beehives, up on the roof.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.820
‎I heard we have to do your hand again,
‎right, Véronique?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.780
‎-The beard's really well done.
‎-It's genuine yak hair.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.780
‎OK! We have to leave you for a while,
‎if you don't mind.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.220
‎It'll ding when it's over.
‎We'll be back later.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.100
‎-Take your time!
‎-Ah! Ah!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.420
‎ I didn't know Nino
‎was a famous person too!

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.540
‎-Boo!
‎-Ha, ha, ha, ha!

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.060
‎My turn! My turn!
‎I wanna play statues, too!

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.980
‎Marinette! Let's go and play
‎hide-and-seek and statues in the museum!

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.340
‎We can't, Manon.
‎We came here to keep Adrien company!

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.020
‎We'll play with you!
‎Marinette, take care of Adrien!

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.580
‎-He must not get bored a single second!
‎-Uh? What? But I...

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.700
‎No, don't leave me alone with him!

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.580
‎I mean, that's not what I meant to say.
‎I... I...

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.540
‎-Are you mad at me, Marinette?
‎-Huh? No, of course not!

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.140
‎-Why would you say that?
‎-Because Nino told me--

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.340
‎I've no idea what Nino told you,
‎but it's totally not true!

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.940
‎Oh, so that means you like me, right?
‎I was afraid you didn't like me!

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.740
‎Of course I like you! Well, like "like"
‎but not like that! What I mean is...

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.260
‎You're not exactly a "good friend",
‎you know.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.500
‎Uh... OK. But then... If I'm not
‎a good friend, what am I to you?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.140
‎You're... Toilets!
‎I really gotta go to the toilet now.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.740
‎-See you later.
‎-Oh, Adrien! What is it with the girls?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.460
‎At least you don't have these kinds
‎of troubles with cheese!

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.020
‎Stop pranking, Plagg! Put that head
‎back down before you cataclysm it!

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.900
‎I'm sure I did something to mess up
‎our friendship by accident.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.820
‎-I'm so clueless about these things!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.340
‎I got to make it up to her.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.820
‎Manon? Where are you hiding?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.740
‎Oh, wow!

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.780
‎Excuse me, lady, what exactly is your
‎superpower? Making me fall super-in-love?

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.500
‎I don't need a superpower for that!

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.100
‎I know we're not ourselves
‎when we're akumati‎s‎ed,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.300
‎but it's weird to see ourselves
‎like that, as supervillains!

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.380
‎You're not looking properly.
‎These aren't supervillains.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.220
‎These are all the people
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved!

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.940
‎You're right.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.140
‎-Hey! What are you doing?
‎-Ooh! I've been akumati‎s‎ed!

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.260
‎-Now I'm Tickle Man!
‎-Ha, ha! No! Not the tickles!

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.380
‎Help! Ladybug! Cat Noir!

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.900
‎Oh!

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.180
‎Come on! What about me?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.300
‎Why doesn't anyone want to play with me?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.100
‎A little girl who feels all alone.
‎Children cannot be disregarded!

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.660
‎Well, she can count on me
‎to give her my full attention!

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.220
‎Fly away, my little akuma,
‎and prey on her despair!

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.620
‎Puppeteer, Glad to see you again!
‎So, no one wants to play with you, huh?

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.340
‎I'm giving you the power
‎to play with them!

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.820
‎We'll have lots of fun!

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.260
‎Aaah! I'm so tired of not being able
‎to just tell him how I feel!

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.780
‎But I'm so scared, Tikki!
‎Always so scared he'll reject me.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.900
‎You're overthinking it. You should try
‎playing a different character.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.020
‎-Like... like role-playing?
‎-Yes! A super-cool character

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.060
‎-who's not afraid of anything!
‎-Yeah! Role-playing. I can do that!

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.980
‎-Seriously, who cares about friendship?
‎-Marinette's important to me.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.220
‎So I'll do everything
‎to make her feel good when she's around!

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.980
‎-Like giving her cheese?
‎-Like cheering her up, making her laugh,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.100
‎doing pranks, like you always do for me.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.060
‎-Hmm?
‎-I'm super cool! I'm super cool!

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.860
‎Watch this, Plagg!

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.620
‎What exactly are you doing?

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.220
‎Shh!
‎I can't let her think it's the real me!

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.060
‎I'm super cool. I'm super cool. I'm super
‎cool. I'm super cool. I'm super cool.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.340
‎Aaah!

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.380
‎Oh! It's only his statue.
‎How come I didn't see it earlier?

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:17.500
‎Wow! It looks... so real!
‎The wax is nearly as hot as skin.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.700
‎It even smells exactly like him!

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.660
‎Oh, beautiful statue of Adrien! Your wax
‎is so soft! Your yak hair is silky!

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.020
‎Your eyes are so green!
‎Oh, shall I be a statue too?

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.420
‎Everything would be so much easier!

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.180
‎Why haven't we been moulded together
‎in the plaster of destiny,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.900
‎marble to marble, wax lips
‎against wax lips, entwined for eternity?

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.300
‎-Eternity sounds like a long time!
‎-Aaah!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.300
‎I'm sorry! I didn't mean to scare you.
‎It was just a prank.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.780
‎Not funny! Not funny at all!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.580
‎Forgive me. Even after all these months,
‎I'm still not used to being a good friend.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.820
‎Nino! Come on, I'm tired of hiding!
‎Where are you?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.820
‎Ha!

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.380
‎ This is so much fun!

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.580
‎Puppeteer, don't forget
‎to bring me back my little toys,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.980
‎Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:49.380
‎I'm gonna play with you, you,
‎and you, and you.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.100
‎Were you serious when you were talking
‎to the statue? I mean, me as a statue?

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.460
‎Serious? Me? Ha, ha! You gotta be kidding!
‎I'm the queen of pranks! Ha, ha!

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.700
‎I knew you were playing a prank on me,
‎so I just wanted to get you back! Gotcha!

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.220
‎So you didn't mean
‎all those things you just said?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.620
‎Of course not! It was role playing! I was
‎in love with the statue! Not with you!

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.980
‎If I had feelings,
‎it wouldn't be for a statue!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.460
‎Rather like for a regular human being!
‎Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:26.180
‎OK, so, as I am a human being, you must
‎still like me a bit, then, right?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:31.420
‎That's right. I like you a little bit,
‎just like a regular human being! Ha, ha!

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.460
‎Can somebody throw me
‎into a vat of wax right now, please?

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.860
‎Hawk Moth?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.140
‎-Marinette! Go get some help!
<i>‎-Oh, no!</i>

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.340
<i>‎You're going to play with me, this time!</i>

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.980
‎-Manon?
<i>‎-Nope! I am The Puppeteer!</i>

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.220
<i>‎And I want to play</i>
<i>‎with you and my statues!</i>

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.380
‎-Be careful!
‎-Don't worry about me!

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.940
‎Tikki, spots on!

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.820
‎Go and find a safe place to hide!
‎I'll handle this!

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.820
‎Plagg, claws out!

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.220
‎-Whoa! You've captured Hawk Moth!
‎-I wish!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.100
‎-Oh! A wax statue!
‎-The Puppeteer's back.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.540
‎-She must be here somewhere.
‎-We gotta save her.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.500
‎The heroes' room!
‎That's where she found his statue!

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.700
‎After you, milady!

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.100
‎Look out!

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.220
‎It's not her! It's a statue!

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.180
‎Look! The real Puppeteer had a wand,
‎remember?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.900
‎Then this Puppeteer must have taken it!
‎That's where the akuma must be!

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.300
‎OK! Who wants to play
‎"Red Light, Green Light"?

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.220
‎-How about hopscotch?
‎-Enough jokes, kitty!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.980
‎There's a little girl at stake!

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.860
‎The worse the situation,
‎the more I realise how amazing you are!

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.580
‎How do you do that?

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.380
‎-Do what?
‎-If I mean so much to you,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.740
‎how is it so easy for you to say these
‎nice things to me, even in bad situations?

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.100
‎The really important things
‎are the hardest to say, aren't they?

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.340
‎It's precisely when it's important
‎that it's important to say it!

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.540
‎Ah! The workshop! She's gotta be there!

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.460
‎Got it!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.820
‎Aaah!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.740
‎Aaah! That's so gross!

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.820
‎That should hold them for a bit.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.060
‎Wait!
‎We don't know what's behind this door!

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.740
‎Let's stack the odds in our favour!
‎Lucky charm!

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.260
‎A cardboard tube?
‎What am I gonna do with this?

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.020
‎I'll figure it out. Let's go!

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.500
‎I've got tons of friends!

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.580
‎But you,
‎no one wants to play with you, Ladybug!

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.980
‎You forget I always have Cat Noir with me!

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.100
‎-Really? Cat Noir, capture Ladybug!
‎-Aaah!

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.340
‎What's wrong with you? Oh, it's a statue!

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.940
‎Cleaning done! It deserves a scratch
‎under the chin before going up.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.820
‎Is that a new perfume, milady?
‎This one smells like... wax!

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.420
‎Cataclysm!

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.540
‎We're done playing games!

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.780
‎-Give me that!
‎-No!

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.340
‎You lose, Ladybug!

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.660
‎Now you won't be able
‎to steal my wand again, meanie!

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.420
‎Take her Miraculous!

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.020
‎Hands off, you pale imitation!

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.220
‎-Only one cat is allowed to have her hand!
‎-Thanks, kitty!

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.860
‎Have you found out what to do
‎with your Lucky Charm?

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.980
‎I do now!

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.860
‎-Let go, you fake!
‎-Ha, ha, ha!

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.340
‎I've almost beat you, Ladybug.
‎Cat Noir, give me her earrings!

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.420
‎Cat Noir, give me her earrings!

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.940
‎-What's happening, Puppeteer?
‎-I don't know! My wand's stopped working!

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.020
‎Surprise! I swapped them earlier.
‎You lose, Puppeteer!

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.740
‎I don't care! If you break my wand,
‎I'll turn them into real wax statues!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.020
‎No! Don't do that!
‎Fine. I'll give you your wand back.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.660
‎Huh?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.980
‎What is that? Hey! If you're
‎the real one, then that means that...

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.660
‎-Too late!
‎-No!

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.220
‎No more evil-doing for you, little akuma.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.100
‎Time to de-evilise!

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.260
‎Gotcha!

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.500
‎Bye-bye, little butterfly!

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.980
‎Miraculous Ladybug!

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.780
‎-Pound it!

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.660
‎Soon, I'll be pulling the strings,
‎Ladybug,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.260
‎and that day will come
‎sooner than you think!

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.300
‎There we are! All back together again!

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.460
‎Hey, wait! Manon has to see this!
‎Oh, but where is she?

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.300
‎Maybe she's behind
‎that weird statue over there!

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.100
‎Hmm?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.540
‎-Boo!
‎-Aaah!

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.700
‎ Gotcha!

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.060
‎To Manon's place, please!

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.500
‎To Marinette's.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.220
‎I'm sor-- !

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.900
‎-You go first.
‎-No, please, you.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.420
‎I shouldn't have kissed the statue.
‎I didn't know it was you, if I had,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.900
‎-it wouldn't have been a prank, because--
‎-No, no! It's my fault.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.020
‎When you left the workshop, I was
‎so worried you were mad at me,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.860
‎-it made me do this prank and...
‎-Of course I wasn't mad!

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.060
‎-I'm sorry that I made you believe that.
‎-Is that true? We're still friends?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.740
‎Of course! But maybe we should stop
‎playing pranks on each other!

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.180
‎Ha, ha! I know. I'm not good with jokes.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.340
‎The girl I'm in love with
‎doesn't like 'em!

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.140
‎The girl... you're... you're in love with?

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.340
‎-Are you OK, Marinette?
‎-Yeah, yeah. I'm glad we're friends!

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.220
‎-See you tomorrow at school?
‎-Yeah.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.340
‎You heard him. Adrien is in love with
‎another girl. And me... I'm just a friend!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.860
‎Oh, I'm sure life has many surprises
‎in store for you, Marinette!

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.340
‎Yeah. That one would have been
‎one very silly first kiss anyways.
