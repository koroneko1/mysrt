1
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,039
Guzmán.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,920
Guzmán.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,519
I need to ask you a few questions.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
What happened?

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,359
LAKE CLUB

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,320
Look, I need you to tell me
what you saw here tonight.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,240
What happened?

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,799
Guzmán.

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,600
Relax, son.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Everything's gonna be okay.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
Boys, lanes one and two.
Girls, three, four, and five.

12
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,599
-Any particular reason for this?
-For what?

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,799
For dividing us by gender,
not by skill level.

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,040
The best swimmers could be in lane one,
and the worst in lane five.

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Just split up like I told you to.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,959
On your marks…

17
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,479
Your next follow-up's not till next year,
which gives us three months to relax.

18
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,680
Azucena.

19
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,000
Please, come in.

20
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
Muñoz, go to class.

21
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
In his own words, the school has been

22
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,439
a truck going downhill
with no brakes for two years.

23
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Fuck.

24
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,400
And he's here to fix it.
Starting now, it seems.

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,599
With no notice. He fired me
with the school year underway. At my age!

26
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,479
Fucking school. I'm going with you.

27
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,599
Don't be silly. You're staying right here.

28
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,240
See?

29
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,520
I should've gone backpacking.
I told you. Why am I wasting my time here?

30
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,520
Honey, this is your last year.
Then you're done.

31
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,759
I know. What's the point of graduating?

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,840
In case you change your mind
and decide to continue your studies.

33
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,039
Stay here with Omar.

34
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,599
Don't worry about me. I'll figure it out.

35
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,159
Where'd they find this dude?

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,000
Discipline.

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Excellence. Achievement.

38
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,159
You might be asking yourself

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,199
what a CEO
is doing running a school like this.

40
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,879
The answer is very simple.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,879
Like with any family,
whenever one of its members has a problem,

42
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,360
the father
quickly swoops in to the rescue.

43
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,360
And I think
we can all be in agreement that…

44
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,120
Let's be honest.

45
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,680
For the past few years,
Las Encinas has steered off course.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Thanks so much
for honoring us with your attention.

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,480
Shit, sorry. I just worked late--

48
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,519
No, no, no, no, no, no. No excuses.

49
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,560
No, I can't tolerate excuses.

50
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,959
Want some words to live by?
And this really goes for all of you.

51
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Don't ever waste your time on excuses.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,959
Instead, focus on…
those three simple words.

53
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,800
"Discipline, excellence, achievement."

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,759
Welcome to this brand-new chapter
of Las Encinas.

55
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,160
Great race today.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,279
-Great rival.
-Honestly, I gave it my all.

57
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
I needed to get to know you better
so I could outthink your strategy.

58
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,439
I kinda just go into turbo mode
and don't think.

59
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Well, maybe that's the secret,

60
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
not thinking too much
and going into turbo.

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,079
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ari.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Guzmán. Welcome to the school.

63
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,680
Thank you.

64
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,399
Hey.

65
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,959
-Were you at the new principal's talk?
-Yeah.

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,199
Doesn't he seem like that basic dude
who says he's nice but is just a poser?

67
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,639
But he's not a poser. He's really cool.

68
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,839
You know that 'cause…?

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,720
He's my father.

70
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,319
You're joking.

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,439
Ciao.

72
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,800
See ya later, Ari.

73
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,399
Hey.

74
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,120
What's up?

75
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Hey, your eyes are wandering.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,720
Wasn't checking out your package.

77
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
I was looking at your scar.

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Was it serious?

79
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah, it was.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,639
The fuck was that?

81
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,199
Car accident.

82
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,120
Yours?

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,319
Leukemia.

84
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,279
I almost died in the accident.
Bedridden for two years.

85
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,560
I had to do physical therapy
to move again.

86
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
They thought I was a goner for sure.

87
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,040
Until it miraculously went into remission.
But it could come back.

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,519
All right. You win.

89
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,040
It's nice, you know? Your package, FYI.

90
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
Since I was looking at your scar anyway,
I kind of thought…

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,439
Sorry. Didn't mean
to make you feel awkward.

92
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,399
That's okay.

93
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,920
And he's nice, too. All right.

94
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,480
When they're cute and nice,
they're straight.

95
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,120
My gaydar is pretty great.

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,360
You might want to get it tuned up,
your gaydar.

97
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,399
Nice ass, dude.

98
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,839
Since I was looking at your scar anyway.

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,920
I just got here from London,
so I'm a little lost here.

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,240
Well, let me know
if I can help in any way.

101
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,959
Great. Then you can take me around Madrid
and introduce me to the gay nightlife.

102
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,279
I don't know many gay clubs, you know.

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,839
Are you serious?

104
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,240
Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,879
Hey there, handsome.

106
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,160
This is Patrick.
Just got here from London.

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,920
Starting today, he's in our class.

108
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,000
My boyfriend, Omar.

109
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,160
Well, nice to meet you.

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,600
Kiss him hello.

111
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,800
Okay.

112
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,360
They kick you out of London
for being too European?

113
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,720
No. Because my father's
the school's new principal.

114
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
Omar Shanaa?

115
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Can you come to my office a moment?

116
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,399
Our peaceful coexistence at this school

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,879
is built on the basis of honesty.

118
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,360
That includes all of us.

119
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
The principal must be honest
with his students and vice versa.

120
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Can we agree on that?

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,039
So let's be honest.

122
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,159
Shanaa. Do you deserve a scholarship here?

123
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,120
-Of course he does--
-Please don't interrupt.

124
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
I mean, my sister also came here
on a scholarship, so--

125
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,759
Yes, it's an impressive record.

126
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,639
Your sister's, I mean.
She really did deserve to be here.

127
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,519
-Do you think you do?
-Azucena saw something in me.

128
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Could you tell me what exactly?

129
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,440
Because if you failed
at an average public school, then, well…

130
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,840
…I don't think
it's because of your academic excellence.

131
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,840
I couldn't study
because I was taking care of my boyfriend.

132
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,399
He had leukemia.

133
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,039
I don't know if you've had
to take care of someone 24 hours a day--

134
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,759
Yes, I have. I'm aware of all that.

135
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,120
And… I really think
what you did was commendable.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,799
I really do, but we need to understand

137
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,440
that when we are talking
about scholarships,

138
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,480
they're awarded for academic achievement,
not our personal circumstances.

139
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,279
You following so far? Good. Hmm.

140
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,039
García.

141
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,480
And you?

142
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,799
I have an 80% GPA.

143
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
But you were also expelled
for serious misconduct. Isn't that right?

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes, but that was
due to personal circumstances.

145
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,159
And in this situation,
we're only assessing

146
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,919
academic achievement, right?

147
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,399
Since I don't want
the rest of your classmates

148
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,279
to think you're getting some kind of…
some kind of preferential treatment,

149
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,799
I'm gonna give you a placement exam
based on this past academic year

150
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,600
so that you can prove that you are,
in fact, deserving of the privilege

151
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,960
of having a scholarship to this school.

152
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:47,039
Hold on. What are you talking about?
Preferential treatment and privilege?

153
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,080
-Benjamín, I didn't go here last year--
-That's all for now. Have a good day.

154
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,559
I really dig your vibe.

155
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
If you don't think that's awkward.

156
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:28,840
Thanks, I guess. I don't know
what vibe, but feel free to say it.

157
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,039
It's not awkward.

158
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,720
I mean, your attitude,

159
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,639
the way you look,
the way you walk down the hall.

160
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,360
Honestly, just all of you.

161
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,639
Shit. You just gave me a full-body scan
in one split second.

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
Name's Rebeka, with a k.

163
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,480
And I let people
I think are cool call me Rebe.

164
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,799
Hi, Rebe.

165
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm Mencía. Encantada.

166
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
My pleasure.

167
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,039
I'm sorry you're pissed off, Ander.

168
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,679
I'm not to blame
for the actions of my father.

169
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,240
I'm not to blame
for being pissed at what he did.

170
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,159
The thing with your boyfriend
and the other guy sucks.

171
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,200
And the mom thing.

172
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,320
-Let's be honest. This school needed--
-What?

173
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,279
Look, man.

174
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,759
I'm not saying your mother and Omar
were dealing drugs or killing anybody.

175
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,919
At least not that I know of.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,240
But who knows, if someone like my dad
had been here to be,

177
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,960
maybe, more on top of things--

178
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Here to patch things up with me
or just bust my balls, dude?

179
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,120
Patrick, what is this?

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,440
Look at him. He was just
puttin' the moves on me in the shower.

181
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,960
-Now he's some kind of badass?
-Ander, calm down.

182
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,559
You think I hit on you?
You don't have a fucking clue.

183
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,919
You and your father
can both go fuck yourselves.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,879
Go on.

185
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Come on.

186
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,440
Patrick.

187
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,159
What's up with this guy?

188
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,840
Okay, all right, all right.
Let me see if I get this straight.

189
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,879
The Barbie on the right
and Sauna Ken right there

190
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,559
are the new principal's children,
and today is your first day too.

191
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,279
Look, if it's any consolation, though,

192
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I have pretty much exactly
the same opinion you do

193
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
about both my dad and my siblings.

194
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,480
Uh…

195
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,120
No.

196
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,519
Not gonna work for me.

197
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,559
Good luck now, sweetheart.

198
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,879
Maybe today you'll even talk to me.

199
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,360
Or not.

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,159
I get the hint.

201
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
Dad, it's always the same thing.

202
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,159
We come into a new place
like a fucking bulldozer.

203
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,039
-Watch your mouth.
-Sorry. Like a bulldozer.

204
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,159
And in the end,
we're the one they take it out on.

205
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,559
Can you define "bulldozer"?

206
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,320
Firing the other principal
out of nowhere, for example.

207
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,120
But that's what I came here for.

208
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,120
He didn't warn us
we were leaving London either. You know?

209
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
That's how Benjamín operates.

210
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,399
Mencía, please, let's not.

211
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,879
I got the cold shoulder
from my whole class today.

212
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,799
And you did, too.

213
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,840
Like, seriously,
you don't always have to take his side.

214
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,279
Did that happen?

215
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,200
No. It went great.

216
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,399
Let's get glasses to toast.

217
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Sure, so I made it all up.

218
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:55,639
And the exam to kick out
the kids on scholarship? Why do that?

219
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,639
I get that you want to fix things,
but pace yourself.

220
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,519
What are you gonna have left
for next week?

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,559
You just got here. Your first morning,
you've turned the place on its head.

222
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,399
-Bam! I don't--
-Let's change the subject.

223
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,200
We're supposed to be celebrating us
all being in Madrid together,

224
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,559
if I can get a waiter.

225
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,320
-Ari. Jesus.
-Why's everyone so slow here in Spain?

226
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,240
And there's all these weird smells.
Um, like patchouli.

227
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
-Ari.
-Patrick.

228
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,000
Dad's on a mission.
We're here to support however we can.

229
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,720
No, we're only here 'cause we're minors.

230
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,519
If I was old enough,
I wouldn't be here looking at your faces.

231
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,879
You know, I almost forgot
how much of a treat you are.

232
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
Okay, look, I'm going home.

233
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,200
It's been fun,
but I'm sick of this posing.

234
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
-Mencía, sit down.
-Mencía, sit down.

235
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,440
Forget it. With that attitude,
we don't even want her here.

236
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,840
Although, I do agree with Patrick.

237
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,919
-Maybe the exam for the scholarship kids…?
-Oh my. Some backup.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
I mean, maybe you can give them
a weekly evaluation till Christmas

239
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,840
or something more gradual,
where they could study.

240
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,159
Would you please stop interfering
in my work?

241
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,000
Mencía is enough on your plate.
You're not making any progress with her.

242
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,679
Dad.

243
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,440
No, it's okay. He's not wrong.

244
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,720
I need the restroom.

245
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I know, but this is super weird.

246
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,879
Nadia, please.
I'm gonna lose my hard-on. Fuck.

247
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,480
Nadia, I'm begging you.

248
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,879
I'm really sorry.
It's just… No can do. Can't do it.

249
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,440
Fuck. This is a nightmare.
I just wanna touch you.

250
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,120
What?

251
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,480
How's my brother doing?

252
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,200
Your brother's fine.

253
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,240
Your guy's there,
adapting, working hard, studying.

254
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,440
-You're looking out for him, aren't you?
-Of course I'm looking out for him.

255
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,519
I promised you I would, and I'm doing it.

256
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,880
You can picket all you want, do graffiti,
bend over backwards. It won't do anything.

257
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,640
Awesome. So why exactly
did you join us at the sit-in then?

258
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,039
To show you I'm on your side
and not your enemy.

259
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,160
And also, definitely
to bust my old man's balls a bit.

260
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
I guess I'm getting kicked to the curb.

261
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,480
No, maybe there is a way.

262
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,640
Benjamín has one massive weak spot,

263
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
my sister, Ari.

264
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,720
So I thought, if you sweet-talk her a bit,

265
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,799
she's the only one
able to convince my father.

266
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,160
We'll do it. Any volunteers?

267
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,119
You.

268
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,720
-Why me?
-What do you mean, "Why?"

269
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,519
The girl's bougie, pretty,
and apparently kind of a bitch.

270
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,000
So, basically, your type.

271
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,759
No, no, no. Samuel's invisible to Ari.
She'd be more into Guzmán.

272
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,920
Not all girls
are looking for rich guys like you are.

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
Cayetana, can you go back to mopping?
You missed a spot. Thanks.

274
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,160
Oh wow, you guys
are friends with the cleaning lady?

275
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,680
Ah, it's a long story, but, um…
we'll tell ya another time.

276
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,240
You're so inclusive. And I'm here for it.

277
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,400
And yeah, she's right. For Ari,
a guy like Samuel's practically invisible.

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,400
-Thanks.
-Guzmán.

279
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,799
No, forget it. I tried something like that
once before,

280
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
and you know how that turned out.

281
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,079
It ended with you getting together
with my sister.

282
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
And we're very happy together, Omar.

283
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,680
You don't have to fall in love with her,
you know.

284
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,720
-Just convince her to talk to her dad.
-Yeah, I know. But no.

285
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,160
Help me, O-Guzmán Kenobi.

286
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,319
You're my only hope.

287
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,480
Help me, dude.

288
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,480
-What?
-What?

289
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,240
What is it?

290
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,640
What is what?

291
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,359
-I mean, what's making you smile?
-I'm not smilin'.

292
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,559
Nothing. It's just, I think
maybe I kind of like your vibe too.

293
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,000
-Well, thanks.
-Thank you for havin' our backs out there.

294
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
So, do you have any plans for tonight?

295
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,359
You're lookin' pretty good yourself.

296
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,000
Do you want a drink… or anything?

297
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,839
Sounds like a plan.

298
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,519
Hey, are you and your brother and sister
triplets or something?

299
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,160
Patrick and Ari are the twins.
I'm the baby and the smartest kid.

300
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
-That's why I skipped one grade ahead.
-Ah.

301
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,480
Hey, can you please bring us two shots?

302
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,000
You know, it's funny.
I didn't take you for one of those girls

303
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,240
who falls apart over some dude.

304
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,880
Yeah. Me neither, believe me.

305
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,400
Until this one guy showed up…
and completely fucked me over.

306
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,680
Got it.

307
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,319
Guys are great if you wanna fuck
and take the edge off just a bit,

308
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,079
but when you wanna take things
to the next level…

309
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,079
I don't think I've experienced that level.

310
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,599
-So what's his name?
-What?

311
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
The guy who fucked with you.

312
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,400
Oh, uh,
one of the guys taking the exam. Samuel.

313
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,640
Who, that short dude?

314
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
Well, I mean, look.

315
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,039
He doesn't seem as short
when he's lying naked in bed.

316
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,200
-Yeah, sure.
-But you're right.

317
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,920
Well, I'll do what I can

318
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,119
to get you to totally drive his name
out of your mind

319
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,079
and replace it with another one.

320
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,440
That'd be…?

321
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,119
Mencía.

322
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
You're like a little time bomb, aren't ya?

323
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,839
And… And the fact is, right now,

324
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,799
I'm not sure I'm ready to have things
blow up in my face… again.

325
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,680
I get you.

326
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,960
But this has been great. Really great.

327
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,680
I mean, actually, it's been, like, months
since I've hung out with someone

328
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:58,400
the entire night like this
and felt so… so relaxed,

329
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,720
so… comfortable,
so good.

330
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,240
Well, that's just a small taste
of that whole next-level thing

331
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,480
I was telling you about.

332
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,400
I gotta peace out. Okay?

333
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,000
So, I'll see you.
I'll see you, uh, in class.

334
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,119
In a few hours, I guess. Ciao.

335
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,559
Thank you, María.

336
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,759
Where's Mencía?

337
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,599
It's always the same with you.
You're a train wreck.

338
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,640
-Are you just coming in right now?
-Yeah. It was a night.

339
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,680
I, um, I actually had to take a friend
to the, um… to the ER.

340
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm dead tired. I'm going to bed.

341
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,000
Dad, I got her.

342
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,759
Mencía, are you seriously
not even gonna bother coming up with

343
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,799
a more credible excuse?

344
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,680
This is none of your business.
Stay out of it.

345
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,000
Of course it's my business
because you're hurting me too.

346
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,559
I mean,
haven't you hurt us all enough as it is?

347
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,079
Wow, Ari.

348
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,880
That was an incredibly,
incredibly low blow.

349
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,319
-You know what I was trying to say.
-For the last time, get out of my face.

350
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:49,960
Oh, hey.

351
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:55,799
Well, you weren't a big fan
of the sit-in and protest, I gather.

352
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,119
We've learned
we've got to have each other's backs here.

353
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,640
-Well, I'm partial to helping my family.
-Yeah.

354
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,799
Hey, why don't we start over?

355
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,799
Just pick up
where we left off after the race.

356
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,480
Wait, from what point?

357
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,039
The point when you said
my dad was a poser pretending to be nice?

358
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,279
No, when you said you needed
to get to know me better

359
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,960
so you could beat me or whatever.

360
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,680
-Mm-hmm.
-You know what I think?

361
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
If you knew me,
you still couldn't beat me.

362
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,559
But I'm willing to let you get to know me
just a smidge.

363
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,079
Then we'll see.

364
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,559
Wanna go get a drink after school?

365
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,680
Hmm.

366
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,160
Ander,
it sucks that things got fucked up today.

367
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,279
'Cause the way we started out
was fuckin' amazing.

368
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,680
Why don't we go out tonight
and patch this up?

369
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,079
There's a gay meetup thing today
at the Barceló Theatre.

370
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,359
Great music and hot guys.

371
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,000
And don't worry about your boyfriend.

372
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,279
I'm, uh, gonna try to steal
the answers to the test

373
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,759
from my dad somehow.

374
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,960
And?

375
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,720
He's implying
if you go out and suck his dick…

376
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,200
…then maybe, sure,

377
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,759
he might give you the answers
to the exam tomorrow.

378
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,119
Ander, Mencía was very clear.

379
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,720
Ari's our target.

380
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,279
You don't have to go
anywhere near Patrick.

381
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,720
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

382
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,880
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

383
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,160
-Let's cut to the chase.
-Thanks. Okay. About what?

384
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,799
What do I need to know about you
to beat you?

385
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,599
Why so obsessed with winning?

386
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,200
Oh, 'cause you're not obsessed?

387
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
I used to be.
Then life put my priorities in check.

388
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,640
Come on.

389
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,279
You sound like an old man.
What are you, 40?

390
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,839
Well, when your sister dies
at the age of 16,

391
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,640
then your best friend dies,
and your girlfriend starts a new life--

392
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,799
Wait, you have a girlfriend?

393
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,000
Of all the things I said,
that's all you heard?

394
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, I already know
what it's like to lose someone

395
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,799
and have your whole life
turned upside down.

396
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,039
You don't look
like you've ever lost anything.

397
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,839
What's the last thing you've lost?
A hamster?

398
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,400
My mother.

399
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,519
And almost my brother too.

400
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,440
She died in a car accident.

401
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,920
I'm sorry. I'm a dickhead.

402
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,680
I've lost three hamsters.

403
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,480
And I'm still trying to get over it.
You also bring your girlfriend here?

404
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,359
The past's the past, you know?

405
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,319
Hey.

406
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,400
In our class,

407
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
is everyone as personable
and charming as you are,

408
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,960
or are you one of a kind?

409
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,039
Well, thanks.

410
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,359
They're just on their guard
'cause of your father.

411
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,319
But if you loosen up, they will too.

412
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,000
-You'll be one of the gang.
-Loosen up?

413
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,519
The whole exam for Samuel and Omar,
you don't think that's a bit cruel?

414
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,880
Look, maybe there are other ways to prove
that they deserve the scholarship.

415
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,720
Hmm. Could you ask your dad
to maybe let up a bit?

416
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,400
I already hinted as much,

417
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,880
but once my father
makes his mind up about something…

418
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,920
I see.

419
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,319
But, anyway, maybe I can try again.

420
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,200
Hey, would you?

421
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,599
That's fucking great. Thanks.

422
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,880
Really, thanks a lot.

423
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,359
You're welcome.

424
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,400
No.

425
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,079
Uh, do you wanna come out to dinner
with me and your sister?

426
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,240
Go out with… why?

427
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,440
So we can spend some time together
and open a dialogue.

428
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,599
I think it's a good idea.
Patrick suggested it, but--

429
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,680
But he's not coming? That's Patrick.
He makes a mess and then runs away.

430
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,920
-Are you coming or not?
-Yeah, no. Sounds good, but I'll pass.

431
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Okay, look, um,
I'm tired of making an effort with you.

432
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,920
-I'm done.
-Dad, come on.

433
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,480
No, just… just forget it. It's clear
you're not capable of handling her.

434
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,200
Now that's more the tone
I expected out of you, Benjamín.

435
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,279
Let's be honest, it was…
Well, it wasn't really your thing.

436
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,839
That perfect father-of-the-year vibe.

437
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,039
You couldn't even fool yourself.

438
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,759
How's this?

439
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,640
From this moment forward,

440
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,759
you're blocked from accessing my money
on all your accounts.

441
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,720
I'll give you whatever is required by law.
No more, no less.

442
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,240
Fine. Then I'll just get a job, won't I?

443
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:56,000
-Oh, you will?
-Mm-hmm.

444
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,160
In what?

445
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,599
You haven't worked a day
in your miserable life.

446
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,799
Mencía. You brought this all on yourself.

447
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,559
I don't know how to make you understand
you don't have to fight Dad and us.

448
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,319
Look, Patrick went out
with some classmates today.

449
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,119
And I--

450
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,759
You had a date with Guzmán,
and you're floating on air, aren't you?

451
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,400
You're such an idiot.

452
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,319
Guzmán went out with you
to get those guys out of that exam.

453
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,079
I know 'cause it was my idea.

454
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,440
Yeah. Ari, they're all using you.
So drop it.

455
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
He's majorly in love with his girlfriend
and wants nothing to do with you.

456
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,119
All he wanted
was to talk you into convincing Benjamín

457
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,960
because that's all anyone
is going to be interested in you for, Ari.

458
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,480
Or did you really let yourself think
a guy like Guzmán would be interested?

459
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,359
Have you taken a look at yourself?

460
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,079
Wake up! You look like an idiot.

461
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,079
I'M LEAVING HOME RIGHT NOW.

462
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,839
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU.

463
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,680
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU WHERE WE MET LAST NIGHT.

464
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,400
Shit.

465
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,559
May I?

466
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,719
Thanks.

467
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
Can I sit with you?

468
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,519
Listen, thanks for the drink,
but I'd rather just keep sitting here.

469
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,880
-Alone.
-Well, when you put it that way.

470
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,000
Someone stand you up?

471
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,159
All right, all right.

472
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,119
See you later.

473
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,159
Hold up.

474
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,400
Sorry.

475
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,400
I feel like a bitch.

476
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,760
You didn't deserve
the way I just treated you.

477
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,159
Have a seat if you want.

478
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,199
What's in the bag?

479
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,199
I'm kinda looking for a place to crash.

480
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,119
Ah?

481
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,679
Excuse me. Another round.

482
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,039
This place is great.

483
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,960
Welcome to paradise.

484
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,079
What's the matter?

485
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,079
Is it about Mencía?

486
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,760
No.

487
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm okay.

488
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,679
-Benjamín.
-Yes, uh, dessert.

489
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
-Ari, you want to share--
-No.

490
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,559
I'm not here to take your order.
I'm working bar up there.

491
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,639
Sorry to bother you,
but I'd like to talk to you.

492
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,840
Right now?

493
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,599
You're unbelievable.

494
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,079
-Oh, did you already tell him, or…
-What? Tell me what?

495
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,079
This is about tomorrow's exam, I assume?

496
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,559
Because it seems like everything
is about that damn test.

497
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,480
-Ari.
-No, he's gonna ask you to excuse him.

498
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,519
-Is that it?
-No.

499
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,039
-Right?
-If I have to take the exam, I'll take it.

500
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,239
It's about Omar.

501
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,920
Please don't make him take it.

502
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,880
-Anything for dessert?
-Wait just a second.

503
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,239
No. Yes, we do want dessert.

504
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,599
Dude, can you take a walk
and come back in a few? Okay?

505
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,440
Listen to me. You asked him
whether he deserved to be at Las Encinas.

506
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,880
Well, he does, I promise.
He always gives 150%.

507
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:04,440
He helps his parents,
his boyfriend, and he helps me.

508
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,320
Because I'm his best friend,
and we live together.

509
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,199
And he's the only family I have, sir.
And I'm so sick of it.

510
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,440
Losing all the people
I care about the most.

511
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,400
-Samuel, what's going on here?
-Nothing.

512
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,559
I am so sorry.

513
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,239
-No, no, really. It's no big deal.
-I'll take care of this.

514
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Of course, this will all be on the house.
My apologies.

515
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,280
Go collect your things
'cause you're fired.

516
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,760
You think I should listen to you?
Forget about the exam?

517
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,239
Find another evaluation method?

518
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
No.

519
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,159
Give them the exam tomorrow.

520
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,320
Hey, Satan. What are you doing?

521
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,719
Satan? Moi? I'm a sweet little cherub.

522
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
Cherub, my ass, dude.

523
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,039
-What're you up to?
-Nothing.

524
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,679
Well, go do nothing over there.

525
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,800
I have a boyfriend.

526
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,920
Yeah, but did you know it's not cheating
if the action's over the clothes?

527
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,679
-Oh, it's not?
-Uh-uh.

528
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,960
So, that's that. So back the fuck off.

529
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,840
Don't misbehave. Hey!

530
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,960
But I'm not doing anything.

531
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,519
It sounded like
you wouldn't hook up with me

532
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,440
even if someone paid you, right?

533
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,960
Are you hooking up with me right now?

534
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,079
You aren't, are you? So, that's that.

535
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,800
Here's a secret.

536
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,199
It's riskier to try and tell yourself no
than it is to say yes.

537
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,840
And your clothes are on,
so it's not cheating.

538
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,519
Stop, man. Stop.

539
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,119
Look, how far would you go to help Omar?

540
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,840
Or is this no longer about helping him?

541
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,679
Okay, that's enough. All right?

542
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,840
I'd do anything I could to help Omar.

543
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,760
Just like he did everything for me
when I couldn't get out of my fucking bed.

544
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,119
I'd do anything but betray him.

545
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
It's all yours.

546
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,400
No need to worry about your father
or anything.

547
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,119
Whatever you need,
as long as you need it. Okay?

548
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,360
Um, but hold on a minute.

549
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
I don't know if--

550
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,519
No,
I have more than one room in my name.

551
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,199
-It's for work.
-Oh.

552
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,559
Meetings, celebrities, and all that.

553
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,360
Um, well, okay.

554
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,119
What do you do, then?

555
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,360
Um, you know
when a politician's really powerful?

556
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,760
Like a president or a minister,
for instance?

557
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,679
Well, actually, they don't have
that much power. 'Cause I'm in charge.

558
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,480
-Like Rasputin.
-Ah.

559
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,719
I read a lot. I'm also extremely smart.

560
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,119
Yep.

561
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,159
Well,
if you ever need anything or get hungry,

562
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,840
call up room service and have them
put it on my bill. All right?

563
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,400
Appreciate it.

564
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,559
Are you all right?

565
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,639
Uh, yeah. Fine.

566
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,239
It's just that, I mean,

567
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,159
it's a very big room
to sleep in all alone.

568
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,239
Would you consider staying here
and sleeping with me?

569
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,960
-Just sleep, you mean?
-Yes.

570
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,840
-No.
-No?

571
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,800
Okay. Good night.

572
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Armando.

573
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,360
You're name's Armando, right?

574
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,079
-Mm-hmm.
-Um…

575
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,679
Come on and stay.

576
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,800
Dad, Mencía's gone.

577
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,800
She'll be back.

578
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,800
Yeah, but Dad…

579
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,760
She can't go far without any money.

580
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
And I think we're used to this sort
of stunt she pulls to get attention.

581
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,519
16 MISSED CALLS

582
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,679
EVERYTHING IS OK

583
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,920
Shanaa, in an hour, you and García
take the exam in the computer lab.

584
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,039
That's it. I'm completely fucked.

585
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,000
Hello, pretty boys.

586
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,400
Leave us alone, will you?

587
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,320
You might be interested in this.

588
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,519
The answers?

589
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,800
So, you went out last night after all?

590
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,320
Well, you have the answers there.
That's what matters.

591
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:31,599
I see.
Is there anything I should know, or…?

592
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
Mm, no. We just danced a bit.

593
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,800
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

594
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:38,679
Yeah.

595
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,119
I didn't think
he'd give them to us. But look.

596
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,880
How do we know these are even accurate?

597
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,719
-Why would I wanna dick you over?
-To get me out of the way? I don't know.

598
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,360
Look,
we got off to a fucking terrible start.

599
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,079
And this is the only way
I could think of to apologize.

600
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,039
If you wanna know if I really mean it,
just use those answers and find out.

601
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,119
LOAD EXAM RESULTS

602
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,039
Seventy-three out of 100.

603
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:57,719
You passed.

604
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:04,960
I spoke to your manager…
to ask him to hire you back again.

605
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,599
I explained to him
that you were only trying to help.

606
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:11,920
Thank you.

607
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,079
But García,
let me offer you a word of advice.

608
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:18,199
Sure.

609
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,960
Stop fighting other people's battles
for them, and focus on your own.

610
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,920
All that being said,
you displayed great confidence,

611
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,440
your argument was concise,
direct, a clearly stated thesis.

612
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:35,280
And although you went a little overboard
with the emotions,

613
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,679
it was a sound strategy.

614
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,960
I can never have too many students
at this school

615
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,960
who have such a facility with words.

616
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,920
Welcome.

617
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,599
All right.

618
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,400
How do you think you did on the exam?

619
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,519
Um… mm…

620
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,480
I did okay. Uh, I think so.

621
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,119
You just think?

622
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,119
Ninety-seven out of one hundred.

623
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,039
Someone who got an almost-perfect grade
knows they did.

624
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,400
It takes someone who's incredibly dense

625
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,159
to get almost 100%
when they're trying to cheat.

626
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,519
Yeah, well…

627
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:26,239
Mm, either dense or a hard worker.

628
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,000
Okay then.

629
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,840
I guess I'm staying right here

630
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,880
with my scholarship,
my uniform, the works.

631
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,159
That'll be all.

632
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,239
Great. Have a good day.

633
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:52,440
And?

634
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:54,599
-So? Tell us.
-That's awesome. Look at you!

635
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:55,800
Really, what did you get?

636
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,079
Uh, 97.

637
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,800
-You serious?
-You did?

638
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,519
And look at that. You were so worried.

639
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,599
That's so wild. That's crazy.

640
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,679
Yeah, and he was so worried.

641
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,599
Hey, dude. Um…

642
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,400
Hey, thanks a lot.

643
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,679
I mean it.

644
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:18,199
-It's nothing.
-Thank you.

645
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,800
-Ah, yes!
-Oh man!

646
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,480
Did you tell your father yet?

647
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,079
-No, I haven't.
-So, all we did was dance?

648
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,360
-You don't think that.
-Your sister's gonna flip.

649
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
Seriously.

650
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,800
Mm.

651
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,960
Hi.

652
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:51,360
Guzmán.

653
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,440
This is your girlfriend's Instagram, yeah?

654
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,039
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

655
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,599
I've been chatting with her.
She is such a sweetheart.

656
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,599
We got along super well.

657
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,960
Told her about our date yesterday.
The way the sparks flew, all of it.

658
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,039
Come on.
Go to your posts. Move it!

659
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,519
You ready?

660
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:18,519
Guzmán, get in the water.

661
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,039
I told you
I only needed to get to know you better

662
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,159
so I could beat you.

663
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,559
You lied to me to get what you wanted,
and I just lied to you.

664
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:53,440
You.

665
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:54,440
What?

666
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,079
Tell your friend I haven't written
to his girlfriend so he can breathe.

667
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:00,800
If either of you thought
you could dominate or get one over on me,

668
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,480
well, think twice next time.

669
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,639
The girl is alive.

670
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,440
I repeat, the girl is alive.
