00:08.160 --> 00:10.880
<i>But there's something about me
that no one knows yet.</i>

00:11.160 --> 00:12.440

00:43.000 --> 00:44.960
Ah!

00:44.960 --> 00:47.320
Miss Bustier,
may I go to the nurse's office?

00:47.320 --> 00:50.840
‐ Miss Hedy is back!
‐ We can't leave her unattended!

00:50.840 --> 00:53.600
Marinette, would you accompany
Rose to see the nurse?

00:53.600 --> 00:56.360
‐ Marinette?
‐ Aaah! Yes, of course!

00:59.320 --> 01:01.600
So, who's Miss Hedy?
An imaginary friend,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.960
like Unicorn Lili
you had in sixth grade?

01:03.960 --> 01:05.560
No... uh....

01:05.800 --> 01:08.040
Hedy is just the nickname
I have for my headache

01:08.040 --> 01:09.840
when she pays me a visit.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.280
That'll teach me to leave
the house without Mr Brekkie!

01:12.280 --> 01:14.040
Wakey wakey, I'm Mr Brekkie,

01:14.040 --> 01:16.120
the big breakfast
to keep you healthy!

01:17.960 --> 01:20.800
I love how you see the world
through "Rose" coloured glasses!

01:20.800 --> 01:23.680
And come back as soon as
you can! Say hi to Sissi for me.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.800
‐ Sissi?
‐ Nur‐sissi's office!

01:26.800 --> 01:31.160
Don't worry, Marinette,
"Sissi" never keeps me long.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.560
Everything's OK, Rose
just missed breakfast, is all.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.000
What?

01:48.320 --> 01:50.640
Juleka, if you skip Mr Mealy,

01:50.640 --> 01:52.200
your big, tasty,
energy‐packed lunch,

01:52.200 --> 01:54.440
Hedy might pay you a visit too!

01:54.440 --> 01:56.200
‐
‐ Juleka?

01:56.200 --> 01:59.400
I was just trying
to make a joke. No! Juleka!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.240
Juleka!

02:13.360 --> 02:16.600
Oh, how well I know
that feeling of loneliness,

02:16.840 --> 02:19.720
the intense anxiety
that no one else can share,

02:20.040 --> 02:22.680
and that only an akuma can ease.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.120
Fly, and evilise
that lonely heart.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.960
Juleka!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.120
Aaah!

02:43.120 --> 02:45.680
Oh, excuse you, Adri‐me,
I didn't mean to crush on you.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.680
I mean, crash into you!
Marinette,

02:47.680 --> 02:50.560
this is no time for nonsense!
I'm looking for Juleka.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.560
She ran out of the cafeteria
in tears and ‐‐

02:52.560 --> 02:54.280
Maybe she's in there.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.080
Aaah!

03:00.960 --> 03:04.160
Ah, sorry! I'm just so lovesick!
I mean, uh, worried sick

03:04.160 --> 03:07.200
about Juleka! That's why I'm
so flustered and klutzy and...

03:07.720 --> 03:09.400
I'm such a fool.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.680
I don't know
if I upset her earlier.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.760
What you say doesn't always
make sense, but it's never mean.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.280
There's got to be some other
reason. Come on, let's find her.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.880
Stay back. And not a sound, OK?
I'll handle it.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.960
Juleka, is everything OK?

03:32.800 --> 03:35.520
‐ I just want to be alone.
‐ You want to be alone?

03:35.520 --> 03:36.840
I understand. Oh!

03:38.640 --> 03:40.280
‐ It's OK!
‐ They found Juleka!

03:40.280 --> 03:42.600
‐ She's in the boiler room!
‐ The boiler room?

03:43.600 --> 03:47.080
I'm so sorry. I really am
the worst class rep ever.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.880
But I don't get it, did I say
something that upset you?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.520
It's not you, it's Rose.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.440
‐ What do you mean, Rose?
‐ I'm worried about her.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.520
Oh, no, don't worry, she's fine.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.640
She's just resting
in the nurse's office.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.720
Juleka, you know you can tell us
anything. We're your friends.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.800
I promise
we won't tell anyone else.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.800
Rose isn't
in the nurse's office?

04:15.800 --> 04:20.040
‐ She's in the hospital?
‐ Yeah, she is.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.320
Why is she in the hospital?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.720
She was sick
when she was a little girl.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.800
She was sick
when she was little?

04:29.800 --> 04:32.360
‐ But it's over now, right?
‐ It can come back any time.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.320
‐ It can come back any time?
‐ But she's always so cheerful.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.680
‐ We would've never guessed.
‐ She made me promise

04:37.680 --> 04:40.040
‐ not to tell you guys.
‐ Oh, of course,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.880
she made you promise.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.880
Please don't tell her
I said anything.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.360
Don't worry, Juleka,
we won't treat her differently.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.520
Rose will never know
that you told us!

04:49.520 --> 04:51.920
I'm re‐programming
my conversational software

04:51.920 --> 04:55.520
as we speak in order to avoid
any future reference to this.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.680
Even if I get bitten
by a zombie dolphin

04:57.680 --> 05:01.640
who takes control of my brain,
I won't say a thing. Never ever!

05:04.360 --> 05:06.160
Don't feel bad about telling us.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.160
You hung on to that
as long as you could,

05:08.160 --> 05:09.800
but it was just too heavy
to bear alone.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.760
‐ Thank you.
‐ That's what friends are for!

05:12.760 --> 05:16.000
Rose trusts you, and you can
trust us. We won't say anything,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.160
but now we can help you
if you need.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.240
Impossible! How could
such an abyss of loneliness

05:25.240 --> 05:27.240
and despair simply vanish?

05:34.560 --> 05:35.960
Good morning!

05:38.320 --> 05:40.680
I told you
everything was all right.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.000
‐ Hi, Juleka! Hi, Rose!
‐ Hi!

05:50.000 --> 05:51.720
‐ Hi there, girls!
‐ Hi!

05:51.720 --> 05:56.040
Oh! I love you, Rose!
I don't say it enough!

05:56.040 --> 05:58.600
Uh, I love you, too, Marinette!

05:58.840 --> 06:01.040
Rose! You're our sunshine
here at school!

06:01.040 --> 06:04.480
The student population's good
mood rises 95% in your presence.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.360
Correct, Markov!

06:06.360 --> 06:08.920
You put the "happy"
into our mix‐tape of life!

06:09.400 --> 06:11.960
You guys mean so much to me,
too, and you're right,

06:11.960 --> 06:13.800
we never
say it to each other enough!

06:14.200 --> 06:16.200
Oh, what an awesome way
to start the day!

06:16.720 --> 06:18.080
Oh...

06:23.480 --> 06:26.000
Thank you, but it's not
that heavy, you know?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.600
Uh, carrying your bags
helps me build my muscles!

06:30.400 --> 06:32.480
Thank you!

06:32.480 --> 06:34.520
These chairs
are so uncomfortable

06:34.520 --> 06:36.480
I decided to make one
for everyone

06:36.480 --> 06:39.720
and, lucky you, you just happen
to be the first to get one!

06:39.720 --> 06:40.760
Thank you?

06:41.680 --> 06:44.080
Don't worry, I shall transcribe
all the classes for you,

06:44.080 --> 06:46.640
so you no longer tire yourself!

06:46.640 --> 06:49.720
Thank you, but I actually like
writing my own notes for class!

06:58.200 --> 07:00.000
Oh, you guys can go ahead of me!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.680
Let Rose through!

07:01.680 --> 07:03.480
Everyone out of the way
and let Rose through.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.320
Uh... 'cause it would
make me very happy?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.200
Huh?

07:20.360 --> 07:23.280
I get the feeling you need to
tell me something, am I right?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.040
Mmm‐hmm.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.200
Come with me.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.920
‐ I told them about you.
‐ You told them?

07:32.160 --> 07:35.640
Oh, no! they'll never act normal
around me ever again!

07:35.640 --> 07:40.080
‐
‐ Jul, this is all my fault.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.320
I should never
have told you my secret.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.360
I make you worry about me
all of the time...

07:44.360 --> 07:47.320
Hey! You know what? No big deal!
I'm going to take care of this!

07:47.560 --> 07:49.960
I should've told them
a long time ago.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.560
I'll just explain everything,
and it'll go back to how it was!

07:57.760 --> 08:00.560
We were worried. You've been
in there 4 minutes, 47 seconds.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.000
People usually spend an average
of 3 minutes, 24 seconds.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.040
I was about to tear
the door off its hinges!

08:06.040 --> 08:07.960
I was ready to dive in
and save you!

08:08.200 --> 08:10.760
I see how worried I've made you.

08:10.760 --> 08:14.640
Please forgive me. If I never
told you about my illness,

08:14.640 --> 08:17.040
it's because it's not
my problems that matter,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.320
but the way I get through them
that counts

08:19.320 --> 08:21.400
and how do I get
through them each day?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.560
By giving them all
cute little nicknames?

08:23.560 --> 08:25.400
By always being supreme.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.800
By always singing
just a bit too loud?

08:27.800 --> 08:30.440
Exactly! And I always
want to be that Rose!

08:30.440 --> 08:32.480
I don't want you
to see me differently.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.720
I want you to just laugh
and have a great time with me,

08:35.720 --> 08:38.640
not carry my book bag
or embroidered cushions,

08:38.640 --> 08:40.920
or worry every time
I go to the bathroom.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.880
I don't want you
to feel sorry for me,

08:42.880 --> 08:45.640
because no one is
happier than I am, OK?

08:46.520 --> 08:48.480
No more embroidered cushions,
I promise!

08:48.720 --> 08:50.480
No more muscle building!

08:50.480 --> 08:52.600
No more extraneous
displays of affection!

08:52.840 --> 08:55.560
Oh, well, I kinda like
the displays of affection.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.200
‐ Aw!
‐ Aw!

08:59.200 --> 09:02.240
See? I told you
everything would be all right!

09:05.920 --> 09:08.760
Today, we're going to study
viruses, germs, bacteria

09:08.760 --> 09:11.320
and all the terrible illnesses
caused by them!

09:11.320 --> 09:13.760
‐ Atchoo!
‐

09:13.760 --> 09:16.480
Quick! Call her parents!
Hurry up! Put these on!

09:16.480 --> 09:17.960
I can't get hold of them!

09:17.960 --> 09:20.000
‐ Nino, call an ambulance!
‐ Marinette?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.200
Alix, call the fire department!

09:22.200 --> 09:23.440
Stop it!

09:25.200 --> 09:27.200
You guys promised!

09:27.720 --> 09:29.000
I'm sorry.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.480
Oh, no, Juleka! Wait!

09:34.200 --> 09:36.600
Even stronger
than a painful secret,

09:36.600 --> 09:39.360
and more painful
than the anguish of solitude

09:39.360 --> 09:43.560
is the guilt of the girl
who betrayed her dearest friend.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.080
It digs a bottomless pit
into her heart.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.480
Fly away my little akuma,
and take this amok with you.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.200
Juleka! Juleka! I'm sorry!
This is all my fault. Open up!

10:03.200 --> 10:05.760
<i>This is all my fault!
I'm so sorry.</i>

10:05.760 --> 10:07.360
Everyone feels guilty
'cause of me.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.200
Oh, no, Juleka! No one
feels guilty because of you!

10:11.200 --> 10:14.120
Juleka!
Juleka, talk to me! Juleka!

10:16.840 --> 10:19.840
Reflekta, I am Shadow Moth.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.560
Why let yourself be eaten up by
such intense feelings of guilt,

10:23.560 --> 10:26.320
when you can turn them
against all of those

10:26.320 --> 10:28.680
who didn't keep their word?

10:28.680 --> 10:30.960
Jul, please, resist!
Don't listen to him!

10:33.760 --> 10:35.000
Hang on, I'll be right back!

10:36.720 --> 10:39.320
Your Sentimonster Guiltrip
is perfect.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.280
All who have broken promises and
are ruining your friend's life

10:42.280 --> 10:45.000
will take the guilt trip
of a lifetime!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
The first
to plead guilty is me.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.880
No! Wait!

10:54.880 --> 10:58.000
Juleka is about to become
a villain! Somebody help!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.800
I am a science teacher,
not a superhero.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.760
Everyone remain seated and...

11:10.840 --> 11:12.160
Plagg, claws out!

11:13.480 --> 11:15.040
Tikki, spots on!

11:21.400 --> 11:24.000
What on earth is that?

11:24.920 --> 11:26.880
Aaah!

11:26.880 --> 11:28.880
‐ I'll save you!
‐ Everybody, get back to class!

11:28.880 --> 11:30.640
Aaah!

11:31.720 --> 11:33.560
Don't worry, Juleka!
I'm going to save you!

11:34.720 --> 11:36.640
Hang on,
we'll get you somewhere safe!

11:36.640 --> 11:39.800
Juleka is in there, and I'm not
gonna let her be all alone!

11:39.800 --> 11:43.400
No! Looks like we're gonna do
a little cave exploration.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.280
Hang on tight!

11:54.760 --> 11:57.680
The air flow is too strong!
I can't hold back anymore!

11:57.680 --> 11:59.880
Aaah!

11:59.880 --> 12:04.200
Yes! Ladybug, Cat Noir, you just
dove head first into my trap!

12:04.200 --> 12:06.040
And you'll never escape from it.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.840
Your Miraculous are mine!

12:10.320 --> 12:11.400
Aaah!

12:14.680 --> 12:17.360
Wow! It's way cooler
in here than on the outside!

12:17.360 --> 12:19.360
I don't know.
I have this strange feeling.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.760
Look out!

12:27.400 --> 12:30.160
It's like being inside
a giant pinball machine!

12:30.160 --> 12:32.160
Yeah, but I think
it's in multi‐ball mode!

12:35.280 --> 12:40.960
Everyone got captured
because of me.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.240
‐ What's wrong with him?
‐ Everyone got captured...

12:46.560 --> 12:48.640
Is it me or did he
just turn into Reflekta?

12:48.640 --> 12:52.320
She must have been re‐akumatized
by Shadow Moth and that <i>thing.</i>

12:52.600 --> 12:54.240
Is her Sentimonster!

12:54.240 --> 12:57.240
We've gotta find out
where Reflekta is hiding.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.880
Stay on your guard.

12:59.560 --> 13:04.480
I never should have let them
leave the classroom.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.000
It's contaminating everyone
with its purple balls.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.120
It won't be easy
finding the real Reflekta.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.240
If I'd worn my competition
swimsuit, I'd have been faster!

13:17.240 --> 13:20.240
I never should have
let go of Ivans' hand!

13:20.240 --> 13:23.160
They all look the same, but they
still have their own voices!

13:23.160 --> 13:27.040
I can't even help my best bud
face up to his old man.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.720
Oh, Nino!

13:30.840 --> 13:32.640
This is all our fault.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.640
If we'd stopped Shadow Moth,
they wouldn't be in this trap!

13:36.640 --> 13:39.040
Oh, no! This can't be happening!
Not now!

13:40.560 --> 13:42.160
Cataclysm!

13:46.320 --> 13:50.800
Cat Noir! No! If we get turned
into Reflekta and frozen,

13:50.800 --> 13:53.120
Shadow Moth
will take our Miraculous!

13:53.120 --> 13:55.200
We should just give him
our Miraculous.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.880
You're right, kitty cat.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.480
How could I ever believe
we could take on

14:00.480 --> 14:03.240
such a powerful Sentimonster
by ourselves?

14:05.240 --> 14:08.560
Ladybug! Cat Noir!
You guys are totally the best!

14:08.560 --> 14:11.200
I knew you'd come to save us!

14:12.280 --> 14:14.760
I'm sorry you had to come.
It's all my fault.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.040
I'm not a good friend.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.680
I should have never
told Juleka my secret.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.760
No! I must not think like that!

14:21.760 --> 14:25.320
Yes, I'm glad I did! That's what
made us closer and stronger!

14:27.360 --> 14:29.480
Oh! Of course!

14:29.480 --> 14:32.200
She's fighting her negative
thoughts with positive thinking!

14:32.200 --> 14:34.440
It stops her
from turning into Reflekta!

14:34.440 --> 14:36.960
We must do the same!
Cat Noir! You can do this.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.920
Think positive! You're
the greatest partner ever!

14:40.600 --> 14:43.000
Ladybug?
Do you really mean that?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.960
Yes, I probably don't
tell you this enough,

14:44.960 --> 14:46.920
but I couldn't
do this without you

14:46.920 --> 14:49.480
and it'd be a lot less fun, too!

14:50.160 --> 14:53.760
Why, that's a meow‐rvellous
thing to say!

14:53.760 --> 14:57.360
And you're just about
purr‐fect yourself, Milady!

14:57.360 --> 15:00.080
Ha, ha! Nice to have you back,
kitty cat!

15:00.080 --> 15:02.440
You really think we'll be able
to get out of this one?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.240
Of course! Don't forget that
I still have my... lucky charm!

15:11.560 --> 15:16.160
Oh, yeah, an ice axe, of course!
An ice axe to... uh...

15:18.520 --> 15:20.120
You don't know
what to do with it?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.280
Of course I do. I'm just
keeping you in suspense!

15:23.280 --> 15:26.440
I could try using my cataclysm,
but sending a Sentimonster

15:26.440 --> 15:28.960
out of control
when you're inside it...

15:28.960 --> 15:30.960
probably isn't the best idea,
huh?

15:30.960 --> 15:32.800
Nope, it's not.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.800
Ugh! All this negativity
is messing with my brain!

15:35.800 --> 15:38.760
Go, Ladybug! Go, Cat Noir!
You're the best!

15:38.760 --> 15:41.800
You're going to save Juleka,
'cause I totally believe in you!

15:41.800 --> 15:44.840
Yes, but we need
more positivity to do that!

15:44.840 --> 15:46.800
I know just the person
who can help us!

15:51.280 --> 15:53.920
Rose Lavillant, here is
the Miraculous of the Pig,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.240
which grants the power
of Jubilation!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.920
You will use it
for the greater good.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.720
Wow! It's so beautiful!

16:04.280 --> 16:06.600
‐ Whoa! You're so cute!
‐ Whoa! You're so cute!

16:06.600 --> 16:08.600
‐ What's your name?
‐ My name's Daizzi,

16:08.600 --> 16:11.240
‐ and I'm your kwami.
‐ They'll give you your powers.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.280
You just have to recite
these words,"Daizzi, rejoice!"

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
Daizzi, rejoice!

16:31.040 --> 16:32.160
Wow!

16:32.760 --> 16:36.080
‐ Cat Noir, may I introduce...
‐ Piggella!

16:37.480 --> 16:39.360
Wow! Looks like
you've found a solution!

16:39.880 --> 16:41.680
I told you, think positive!

16:41.680 --> 16:43.600
I can't wait
to see her in action!

16:43.600 --> 16:44.800
Come on! Let's go!

16:46.240 --> 16:48.160
Because of me,
everyone feels guilty.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.520
Rose, Marinette,
Adrien, Ivan, Mylène.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.520
Because of me,
everyone feels guilty.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.440
Rose, Marinette,
Adrien, Ivan, Mylène.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.600
Because of me,
everyone feels guilty.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.520
‐ Juleka!
‐ Rose, Marinette, Adrien,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.960
Ivan, Mylène. Because of me,
everyone feels guilty.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.720
Rose, Marinette,
Adrien, Ivan, Mylène.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.760
Because of me,
everyone feels guilty.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.040
Gift!

17:19.160 --> 17:20.760
Uh, that's a superpower?

17:20.760 --> 17:23.080
Piggella 's power
shows the person it affects

17:23.080 --> 17:25.200
their heart's greatest desire.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.760
A normal day in class,

17:30.760 --> 17:34.080
where everyone just
acts normal to Rose! That's it!

17:34.080 --> 17:36.240
That's Juleka's greatest wish.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.640
‐ Wow! Impressive!
‐ The power of positivity!

17:46.640 --> 17:49.040
We don't always need
a fight to succeed!

17:55.800 --> 17:57.880
Gotcha!

17:57.880 --> 17:59.800
Bye‐bye, little butterfly!

18:03.120 --> 18:06.320
‐ What happened?
‐ Everything's all right now.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.440
I'm Piggella. Ladybug, Cat Noir
and I have come to save you.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.400
Uh, the Sentimonster and its
buddies don't seem very happy.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.760
Reflekta isn't here
to control them!

18:16.760 --> 18:19.040
Quick, where's the object
the amok went into?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.960
‐ The feather?
‐ In the trash.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.120
You threw it in the trash?

18:23.320 --> 18:25.840
You can tell yourself
all the lies you want.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.480
You can't escape the bottomless
pit of your guilt!

18:28.480 --> 18:29.440
Yes, you can!

18:31.080 --> 18:33.800
‐ Just change the music!
‐ Great job, Piggella!

18:33.800 --> 18:36.680
It's not the problems,
but how you get through them!

18:38.360 --> 18:40.320
We gotta get out of here fast!

18:53.800 --> 18:57.560
Aaah! The wind is too strong!
We won't get out this way!

18:57.560 --> 19:00.320
‐ I guess we're all out of luck!
‐ Luck? Of course!

19:01.240 --> 19:02.840
That's what this is for!

19:08.520 --> 19:10.480
Got it!

19:17.440 --> 19:19.280
Time to de‐evilise!

19:22.760 --> 19:23.320
Gotcha!

19:25.040 --> 19:26.480
Bye‐bye, little feather!

19:30.160 --> 19:33.200
You may have won the day
with your positivity this time,

19:33.200 --> 19:35.880
but you can count on me
to fill the rest of your days

19:35.880 --> 19:39.320
with negativity
sooner than you know.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.640
Pound it!

19:52.560 --> 19:54.880
Juleka, this is a magical charm.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.720
It'll protect you from becoming
a victim of Shadow Moth again.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.000
Miraculous Ladybug!

20:05.600 --> 20:08.120
‐
‐ Juleka!

20:09.880 --> 20:12.840
Thank you, Ladybug.
Thank you for saving Juleka!

20:19.600 --> 20:22.640
Aren't you gonna get
your Miraculous back, Milady?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.800
She already did!

20:24.280 --> 20:26.960
That girl is truly incredible!

20:26.960 --> 20:29.600
She never needed a Miraculous
to be a superhero.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.120
I'm taking my present back.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.720
You'll have to wait until your
birthday, like everyone else!

20:40.720 --> 20:42.840
Oh, come on, guys,
she's not made out of glass!

20:42.840 --> 20:46.280
Oh, no! I'm gonna
pass out from laughter,

20:46.280 --> 20:48.360
so someone take me
to the nurse's office!

20:51.360 --> 20:54.200
Hey! How come you never laugh
when I say something mean?

20:54.200 --> 20:58.000
‐ Because <i>you</i> actually mean it.
‐ Huh! True!

21:00.080 --> 21:03.160
It feels great to have you back,
guys! Please, don't ever change!
