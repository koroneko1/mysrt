1
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,648
Miss Sophie.

2
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,192
I've closed up the shop.

3
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,820
You should come too, Sophie.

4
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,989
I'll just finish this. Go have some fun.

5
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,075
All right, then. I'm off.

6
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,369
I'm going.

7
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,497
Look, it's Howl's castle.

8
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,040
What? Howl? Where?

9
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,084
Look how close it is.

10
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,169
Oh, no.

11
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,296
I wonder if Howl's in town.

12
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,347
It took off.

13
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,141
No, just hiding from all the soldiers.

14
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,853
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

15
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,438
They say Howl tore her heart out.

16
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,356
How scary...

17
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,025
Don't worry, he's not going to want yours.

18
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,028
Hurry up.

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,407
Really?

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,076
Oh, cut it out...

21
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,074
Hey, you, little mouse. Lost your way?

22
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,243
Oh, no... I'm fine.

23
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,829
Then how about a cup of tea?

24
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,122
Care to join me?

25
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,832
No, thank you. I'm busy.

26
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,710
She sure is a cute little mouse.

27
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,004
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

28
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,880
Let me pass!

29
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,426
See, it's those whiskers of yours.

30
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,845
She's even cuter when she's mad.

31
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,388
There you are. Sorry, I'm late.

32
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,765
Where've you been?

33
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,183
Who are you?

34
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
I'm with her.

35
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,771
Why don't you two take a little walk.

36
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,444
What the-- Hey, wha--

37
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,739
Don't hold it against them.

38
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,033
They're harmless.

39
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,327
Where to? I'll be your escort.

40
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,955
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari's.

41
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,708
Act normal. I'm being followed.

42
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,043
Just walk.

43
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,191
Sorry I got you involved.

44
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,029
This way.

45
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:11,621
Hold on.

46
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,129
Drop your legs and start walking.

47
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,929
Good. Don't be frightened.

48
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,904
You are a natural.

49
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,629
I'll draw them off.

50
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,464
Wait here until the coast is clear.

51
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,133
Yes.

52
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,301
That's my girl.

53
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,274
Any chocolate Letties?

54
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,900
Look this way, Lettie.

55
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:23,943
Here you go.

56
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,111
Let's go for a walk, Lettie.

57
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,112
My sister?

58
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,574
Come back soon, Lettie.

59
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,454
Sophie?

60
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,040
How did you land on the veranda like that?

61
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,500
Have you become an angel?

62
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,753
It feels like I'm in a dream...

63
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,047
Lettie, why not use the office?

64
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,593
Thanks, but I should really be working.

65
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,347
What? You sure he wasn't a wizard?

66
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,349
He was so kind...

67
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,436
He rescued me...

68
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,230
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart.

69
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,943
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up.

70
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,947
Don't worry, Howl's only after beauties.

71
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,866
There you go again.

72
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,203
Listen to me, we live in dangerous times.

73
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,206
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl.

74
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
Sophie?

75
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,961
Oh, you...

76
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,674
Lettie, the madeleines are done.

77
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,052
Okay, be right there.

78
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,428
All right.

79
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,848
I'm going home.

80
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,100
It's a relief to know you're doing well.

81
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,229
Hello, Lettie.

82
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,438
Nice to see you.

83
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,400
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

84
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,530
It meant so much to Papa.
Besides, I'm the eldest.

85
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,743
That's not what I meant.
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

86
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,245
Well, I...

87
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,579
Bye, Lettie.

88
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,081
Come by the shop next time.

89
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,082
Sure.

90
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll be on my way.

91
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,128
Sophie, you've got
to look out for yourself.

92
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,490
Sorry, the shop's closed.

93
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,035
I thought I'd locked the door.

94
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:26,042
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats.

95
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,171
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself.

96
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,175
This is just a simple hat shop.

97
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,391
I think you had better leave.

98
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,896
You're very brave,
taking on the Witch of the Waste.

99
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,106
The Witch of the Waste?

100
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,076
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell.

101
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,536
My regards to Howl.

102
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,001
Is this really me?

103
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,337
I've got to stay calm.

104
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,522
I've got to calm down.

105
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,608
It's no use panicking, Sophie.

106
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,779
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

107
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:24,702
I've got to calm down.

108
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,465
I'm back!

109
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,841
Welcome home, Ma'am!

110
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,759
-Welcome home.
-How do you like it?

111
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,720
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

112
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,013
Amazing.

113
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:44,972
It suits you.

114
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,308
Don't you think it's wonderful?

115
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,267
Sophie!

116
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,230
Mrs. Hatter,
Sophie hasn't come down to work yet.

117
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,149
I wonder what's the matter?

118
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,236
Sophie!

119
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,828
Don't come in.

120
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,247
I've got an awful cold.

121
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,999
I don't want you to catch it.

122
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,835
You sound just awful...

123
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,879
Like some 90-year-old woman.

124
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,757
I'll stay in bed today.

125
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,510
You sure? All right, then.

126
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,847
Here we go...

127
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,860
You'll be fine, old lady.

128
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,114
You're still healthy,
and these clothes finally suit you.

129
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,869
But I can't stay here.

130
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,048
Ouch, ouch.

131
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,801
It's not easy being old.

132
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,564
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

133
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,536
Like a hand, granny?

134
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,498
Such a gentleman, but I'll manage.

135
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,294
Sure, old lady, but where are you off to?

136
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,921
Just a bit farther
than where you're going.

137
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,761
I don't recommend it, granny.

138
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,472
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead.

139
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,433
Thank you.

140
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,477
Going to the Folding Valley, at this hour?

141
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,938
Says her youngest sister's there.

142
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,080
I've hardly made any progress at all.

143
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,252
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth.

144
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,637
That'll make a good cane.

145
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,764
Up we go.

146
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,314
Might be a bit too thick.

147
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,491
Ouch, ouch.

148
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,785
What a stubborn branch.

149
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,706
Never underestimate Grandma Sophie.

150
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,541
Heave.

151
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:14,598
A scarecrow, eh? I thought you were
working for the Witch.

152
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,810
But how do you stand by yourself?

153
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,523
Your head's a turnip.

154
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,276
I've always hated turnips.

155
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,988
At least you're not upside down anymore.

156
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,823
So long.

157
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,790
It's so cold.

158
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,501
The town's still so close.

159
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,636
Don't follow me.
You don't owe me a thing.

160
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,055
You must be a magical whatever-you-are.

161
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,058
I've had enough of witches and spells!

162
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,437
Just go stand wherever you like!

163
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,919
This is a perfect cane.
Thank you kindly.

164
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,257
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

165
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,104
Seems you get more cunning with age.

166
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,950
What a huge battleship.

167
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,707
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old.

168
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,478
I smell smoke. Maybe there's a cabin.

169
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,792
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

170
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,963
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

171
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,475
What is this?

172
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,977
You call this a castle?

173
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,291
Is that the way in?

174
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,211
Just wait up there.

175
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,048
Hey, there!

176
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,052
Are you going to let me on, or not!

177
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,517
My shawl!

178
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:02,201
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip.
I'm going in.

179
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,452
Thank you.

180
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,456
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine.

181
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,044
This time, it's really goodbye.

182
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,047
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip.

183
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,132
May you find happiness.

184
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,558
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

185
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,822
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore.

186
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,750
That's some spell you're under.

187
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,754
It won't be easy to break.

188
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,757
The fire talked.

189
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,260
And you can't even tell anyone about it.

190
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,345
You're Howl?

191
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,933
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

192
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,688
Well, then, Calcifer,
can you break the spell I'm under?

193
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,440
Easy.

194
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,109
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

195
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,695
I'll break your spell in a flash.

196
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,282
In other words, bargain with a demon.

197
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,868
You sure you can keep that promise?

198
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,537
Demons don't make promises.

199
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,540
I suggest you look elsewhere.

200
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,001
But I'm an exploited demon.

201
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,546
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death.

202
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,799
I'm the one who keeps this castle moving.

203
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,470
My, you've got it rough.

204
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:31,058
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break.

205
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,019
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too.

206
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,565
All right. A bargain, eh?

207
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,155
Granny.

208
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,740
Granny.

209
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,413
Boy... I've got my doubts about her.

210
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,344
Hey, who's this?

211
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,179
Porthaven!

212
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,348
When did she get in?

213
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,898
Stand by.

214
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,863
Why, Mayor, sir.

215
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,867
The sun is already high.
Is Master Jenkins at home?

216
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,202
The Master is out.

217
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,872
I answer in his stead.

218
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,333
An invitation from His Majesty.

219
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,710
It has come to war.

220
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,671
His Majesty desires every wizard

221
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,674
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland.

222
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,136
His presence is imperative. That is all.

223
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,348
War, how awful.

224
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,226
And who might you be?

225
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,645
Calcifer let me in.

226
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,940
Don't look at me.
She wandered in from the Wastes.

227
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,567
The Wastes?

228
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,862
That's strange.
You're not a witch, are you?

229
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,865
A witch could never get in.

230
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,159
Porthaven, again.

231
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,578
A customer?

232
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,123
Stand by.

233
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,544
State your purpose.

234
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,254
Mama sent me.

235
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,382
The usual spell?

236
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,969
Behave yourself, now.

237
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,321
It's not the Wastes.

238
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,324
Granny, are you a witch, too?

239
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:39,120
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land.

240
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,165
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it.

241
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,458
Sure.

242
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,379
Many thanks.

243
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,675
I can't have you making up things.

244
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,593
You should give up that disguise.

245
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,721
It's not a disguise, it's magic.

246
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,225
The Kingsbury door.

247
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,852
Stand by.

248
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,236
Is this the residence of Wizard Pendragon?

249
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,487
It is, indeed.

250
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,782
I bear an invitation from His Majesty.

251
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:20,287
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace.

252
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,248
Our thanks to you.

253
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,515
A city fit for a king.

254
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,351
Get back in or you'll lose your nose.

255
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,734
Stop wandering around.

256
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,898
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad.

257
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,942
This is a magic house, isn't it?

258
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,943
Oh, boy!

259
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,154
Where does the black one lead?

260
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,572
Only Master Howl knows.

261
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,658
I'm having my breakfast.

262
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,212
But you've got bacon and eggs.

263
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,383
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away.

264
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,805
I'll cook for you.

265
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,306
But you can't.

266
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,684
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

267
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,604
That's right, I won't cook for you.

268
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,649
Oh, here's my hat.

269
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,613
All right, Calcifer. Be a good fire, now.

270
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,282
Forget it, I'm a demon.

271
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,952
I answer to no one.

272
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,622
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you.

273
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,583
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

274
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,922
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in.

275
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,007
So, what'll it be?

276
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,514
That's right, there's a good fire.

277
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:49,310
Hey! Hey! I'll burn the bacon.

278
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,938
Calcifer's doing what she says.

279
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,774
I'd like some tea, too.
Have you got a kettle?

280
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,067
Sure.

281
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,370
Welcome home, Master Howl.

282
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,622
You have letters from the king.

283
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,375
To Jenkins and to Pendragon.

284
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,972
Calcifer, you're so obedient.

285
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,974
She bullied me.

286
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,352
Not an easy thing to do.

287
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,229
Who exactly are you?

288
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,399
I'm Grandma Sophie.

289
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,235
You see, I'm your new cleaning lady.

290
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,904
Give me that.

291
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,036
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs.

292
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,641
Yummy.

293
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,935
Yummy.

294
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,944
And who hired you to clean?

295
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,404
Why, I hired myself.

296
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,865
I've never seen such a filthy house.

297
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,744
Markl, plates.

298
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,708
You're all ganging up on me.

299
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,585
Please join us, Sophie.

300
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,717
Sit over here.

301
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,441
Pick one.

302
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,944
Everything else is dirty.

303
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,949
I've got my work cut out for me.

304
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,327
Markl.

305
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,453
Yes.

306
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,164
Sophie.

307
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,583
Thank you.

308
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,670
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread.

309
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,838
Our daily bread.

310
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,340
Haven't had a real breakfast
in a long while.

311
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,100
So many manners to teach...

312
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,854
So, what's that in your pocket?

313
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,232
What?

314
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,700
I wonder what it is.

315
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,160
Let me.

316
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,002
It's scorched into the table.
Master Howl, this is...

317
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,588
Ancient sorcery.

318
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,006
And powerful, too.

319
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,841
The Witch of the Waste?

320
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:11,721
"He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless man.

321
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,098
Your heart shall be mine."

322
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,600
Well, so much for the table.

323
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,366
Wow, it's gone!

324
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,868
The scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell.

325
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,163
Brethren, continue your meal.

326
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,459
Calcifer, move the castle 100 kilometers.

327
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,967
And send hot water to the bath.

328
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
Not that, too!

329
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,056
Do you work for the Witch of the Waste?

330
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,436
Don't be stupid! The witch--

331
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,776
Actually... the witch... I--

332
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,989
Confound it!

333
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,992
Damn that Witch of the Waste.
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

334
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,161
Let me finish eating this.

335
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,752
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out.

336
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,298
Every last one of you, mocking me.

337
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,307
There's a spell I need.

338
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,517
Later.

339
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,728
A witch rages within.

340
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,819
Sophie.

341
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,866
Sophie, I'm going out.

342
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,119
I'll die without some fresh wood.

343
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,580
What, what are you doing?

344
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,167
I'll fall, I'll fall I'm in peril.

345
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,502
I'm sweeping the ashes.

346
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,628
Won't be a minute.

347
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,672
Oh, no. Oh, no.

348
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,424
I'm in danger.

349
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,010
I'm in danger...

350
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,595
I'll go out.

351
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,517
Oh, no I'm slipping...

352
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,817
Hurry, Sophie.

353
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,092
Try not to torment my friend.

354
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,642
Master Howl, are you going out?

355
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,607
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away.

356
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,197
What did you do, Sophie?

357
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,699
She abused me.

358
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,119
If I die, Howl goes with me.

359
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,704
I'm the cleaning lady.

360
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,082
It's my job to clean.

361
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,002
No, not the 2nd floor!

362
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,506
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry.

363
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,592
Save my room for later.

364
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,890
My little outburst gave me back
my strength.

365
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,855
What a strange house.

366
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,976
Amazing!

367
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,270
Calcifer, Calcifer!

368
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,606
Are you moving the castle?

369
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,066
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am.

370
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,776
You're incredible, Calcifer.

371
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,405
Your magic's first class.
I misjudged you completely.

372
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,576
You think so?

373
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,661
You really think so!

374
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,337
Oh, no, not yet!

375
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,870
How beautiful.

376
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,164
It's called Star Lake.

377
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,088
Something's stuck in there.

378
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,590
Oh, dear. Lend me a hand, Markl.

379
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,841
Sure.

380
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,182
And up!

381
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,809
A scarecrow.

382
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,894
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head.

383
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,855
You sure like being upside down.

384
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,242
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me.

385
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,286
He followed me here.

386
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,663
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

387
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,333
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land.

388
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,449
Turnip, don't pull it so tight.

389
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,210
Seems like he likes doing the laundry.

390
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,629
It'll dry in no time.

391
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,426
Turnip must belong to the demons.

392
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,219
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him.

393
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,306
You're right,
maybe he's a demon.

394
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,102
But he led me to this wonderful place.

395
00:39:57,394 --> 00:40:00,231
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie.

396
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,859
Why, thank you.
We'd better be getting back.

397
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,986
How mysterious.

398
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,365
I've never felt such peace.

399
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,361
Stinks.

400
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,156
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

401
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,970
Keep flying and one day
you won't be able to change yourself back.

402
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,019
Isn't it great! Sophie did this for me.

403
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,107
The fighting is fierce.

404
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,819
The country's ablaze, from the south coast
to the northern border.

405
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,656
I hate the fire and gunpowder.

406
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,408
They have no manners.

407
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,119
My own kind attacked me.

408
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,663
The Witch of the Waste?

409
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:24,166
Hack wizards masquerading as monsters.

410
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,795
They'll cry plenty later on,

411
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,005
when they can't regain human form.

412
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,717
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry.

413
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,470
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

414
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,930
Yes, well...

415
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,598
Hot water for my bath.

416
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,517
Oh, no, not again.

417
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,843
Is that Howl?

418
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,137
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

419
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,437
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

420
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,563
No matter.

421
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,273
Morning.

422
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,361
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

423
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,280
I've never seen the ocean.

424
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,033
Such beautiful, sparkling water.

425
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,118
Same as it always is.

426
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,379
I myself hate potatoes.

427
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,714
Pay up.

428
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,215
Thank you.

429
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,300
Thanks.

430
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,679
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

431
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,056
That one looks tasty.

432
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,641
I myself hate fish.

433
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,019
The fleet's come home.

434
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,103
Is that smoke?

435
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,980
There's been another battle.

436
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
Really? Sorry, lady. Later.

437
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,901
That ship's on fire!

438
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,385
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

439
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,471
No, I've no stomach for such things.
Let's go home.

440
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,724
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this.

441
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,689
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

442
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,441
Don't move.

443
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,777
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

444
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,826
They're gone.

445
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,203
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

446
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,836
Look! Up there!

447
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,130
That's what dropped those bombs!

448
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,881
An enemy airship, Sophie.

449
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,681
Sophie, flyers.

450
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,017
Ignore the flyers.
They're enemy propaganda!

451
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,232
Are you okay, Sophie?

452
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,615
A glass of water, please.

453
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,783
Sure.

454
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:03,385
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

455
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,513
My hair's turned this weird color!

456
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,474
What... what beautiful hair.

457
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,600
Take a good look!

458
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,228
You mixed up everything
on the shelves and ruined the spells.

459
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,982
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up.

460
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,775
Cleaning, always cleaning.

461
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,738
I told you not to get too carried away.

462
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,239
It's hopeless.

463
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,910
How humiliating.

464
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,121
It's not that bad.

465
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,924
This new shade's quite lovely.

466
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:46,929
I'm done for. What's the point
in living, if you aren't beautiful...

467
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,318
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

468
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,779
He's calling on the spirits of Darkness.

469
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,907
He did this last time a girl dumped him.

470
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,287
Please, Howl, that's enough.

471
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,250
You can just dye your hair again.

472
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,263
I've had enough of you, Howl!

473
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,266
I've never once been beautiful!

474
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,852
I've had enough of this place!

475
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:19,062
Thank you, Turnip.
You're a kind scarecrow.

476
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,940
Please come back, Sophie.
Howl's in trouble!

477
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,569
Cut it out, Howl I'm going out.

478
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,946
Sophie!

479
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,449
Get over here.

480
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,994
My, he's dramatic.

481
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,245
Is he dead?

482
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,498
Don't worry.
A tantrum never killed anyone.

483
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,292
Help me, Markl.

484
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,798
Get that hot water running, Markl.

485
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,885
C'mon, you can still walk.

486
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,273
You look after him now, Markl.

487
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,524
Sure.

488
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,028
I'll have to clean up all over again.

489
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,886
I'm coming in.

490
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,855
Here's some hot milk. Drink up.

491
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,821
I'll leave it here.
Drink it while it's hot.

492
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,284
Don't leave me, Sophie.

493
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,002
Try a little milk?

494
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,141
The Witch of the Waste
is trying to find my castle.

495
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,895
You're right, I saw her henchmen
down at the port.

496
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,232
The truth is, I'm a coward.

497
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,902
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away.

498
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,654
I'm scared to death.

499
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,659
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

500
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,622
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her.

501
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,168
But she terrified me and I ran away.

502
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:52,424
Now the king's ordered me
to report to him.

503
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,051
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

504
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,637
How many names do you use, Howl?

505
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,140
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

506
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,769
Can't you refuse the king's invitation?

507
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,020
See that...

508
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,733
The oath I took at the Sorcery Academy.

509
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,613
Say, Howl... Why not visit the king?

510
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,364
What!

511
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,658
Just say it to his face.

512
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,496
"Stop this foolish war.
I refuse to help you."

513
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,375
Sophie, you don't know what they're like.

514
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:33,006
But he's the king, right? A king thinks
only of what's best for his people.

515
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,883
I know!

516
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,302
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

517
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,932
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

518
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:45,310
Just tell him your son
is an idle good-for-nothing.

519
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,313
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me.

520
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,732
Madam Suliman?

521
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,862
You're wearing that hat?

522
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,406
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

523
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,533
Off I go.

524
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,784
Sure.

525
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,953
See you later!

526
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,547
This charm assures your safe return.

527
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,426
Don't worry, I'll follow you in disguise.

528
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,220
There. Off you go!

529
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,064
I'm sure this will never work.

530
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,201
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow.

531
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,419
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise.

532
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,051
Not that...

533
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,482
The Palace is so far away.

534
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,319
Howl? Don't tell me you're Howl.

535
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:08,161
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things.

536
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,497
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

537
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,878
How nice to see you.
The little hatter, right?

538
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,922
The Witch of the Waste!

539
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,008
Thank you so much
for delivering my note to Howl.

540
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,513
How's Howl doing?

541
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,682
Quite terrified.

542
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,977
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady.

543
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,813
My, how delightful.

544
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,109
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

545
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,696
Job hunting. I'm sick of working for Howl.

546
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,822
And yourself?

547
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,158
The king invited me.

548
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,830
It seems that idiot, Suliman,
finally needs my power.

549
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,458
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me?

550
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,502
That's impossible.

551
00:54:57,585 --> 00:55:01,715
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them.

552
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,134
See you later, then.

553
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:08,054
Hey, wait a minute. Just wait!

554
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,891
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane.

555
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,202
What's wrong with you?

556
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,956
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

557
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,583
Please continue on foot.

558
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,585
That Suliman.

559
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,630
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs.

560
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,977
We'll catch up. Pay her no mind.

561
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,172
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

562
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,977
You... Hey... Wait.

563
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,771
What is it?

564
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:43,983
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

565
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,821
I told you...

566
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:48,988
I don't know how.

567
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,157
Then, start studying up.

568
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,997
I don't get it.

569
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,334
Where does she get all that energy?

570
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,427
I have to put you down.

571
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,521
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it.

572
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:27,068
It's been 50 years now,
since they drove me out of here...

573
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,157
I've been longing for this day...
Ever since.

574
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,159
Good luck to you, then.

575
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,454
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out.

576
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,622
Come, Howl.

577
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,834
You heartless wench.

578
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,545
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too.

579
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,610
Hurry up!

580
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,654
Madam, follow me.

581
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,991
First, you should help her.

582
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,077
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

583
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,414
But the king himself invited her.

584
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,833
Hang in there!

585
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,461
Just a little farther.

586
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,714
And you call yourself a witch?

587
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,759
Who asked you?

588
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,347
You suddenly look older.

589
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:41,684
Madam Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

590
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,771
Pull yourself together.

591
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,273
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

592
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,821
Madam Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

593
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:58,034
Pendragon... That name sounds familiar.

594
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,746
Of course it does.
That was the name of my hat shop.

595
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,830
It was?

596
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,291
Please wait here.

597
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,715
A chair!

598
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,051
It's mine!

599
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,731
Howl, get back here.

600
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,366
Madam, this way please.

601
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,845
I understand you're Howl's mother.

602
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,848
Yes. My name is Pendragon.

603
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,851
I'm sure you're weary. Please have a seat.

604
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,644
Yes.

605
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,824
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty's witch.

606
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,374
Um, that dog is...

607
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,709
Ah, you mean Heen?

608
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,213
He does my errands.
I asked him to escort you.

609
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,719
Howl won't join us, then?

610
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,474
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses.

611
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,227
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty.

612
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:33,147
What a shame.

613
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:36,484
He was my last apprentice...

614
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,655
A student of such marvelous gifts.

615
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:44,659
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir.

616
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,331
But then, a demon stole his heart,

617
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,667
and he abandoned me.

618
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:57,004
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses.

619
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,508
Mrs. Pendragon.

620
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,885
That boy is dangerous.

621
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,181
His power is too great
for one with no heart.

622
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:12,353
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste.

623
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,229
Bring her.

624
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,487
What happened?

625
01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:26,742
I just restored her to her real age.

626
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,411
All her powers are gone.

627
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,915
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch.

628
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,377
She made a bargain with a demon

629
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,547
who consumed her,
body and soul, long, long ago.

630
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,634
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

631
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,803
to disreputable wizards and witches.

632
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:49,348
If Howl comes here to serve the kingdom,

633
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:52,185
I will teach him how to break free
from the demon.

634
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,439
If not, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers.

635
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:58,649
Now just a minute.

636
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,279
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here.

637
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,490
Something's not right.

638
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:09,869
Forcing your aged guests to climb
stairs, dragging them into strange rooms.

639
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,162
It's like a trap.

640
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,664
You call Howl heartless!

641
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:18,085
Yes, he's selfish, cowardly
and unpredictable.

642
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,214
But he's straight as an arrow.
He only wants to be free.

643
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,592
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

644
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,428
He'll battle the demon on his own.

645
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,222
I believe in him.

646
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,475
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl.

647
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,395
Howl... Howl's coming?

648
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,941
I want Howl's heart, I want it.

649
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:43,528
That's enough from you. Howl's not coming.

650
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,323
Howl will most certainly come.

651
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,868
Now, I've found his weakness.

652
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,668
Your Majesty.

653
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,378
As you are.

654
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,004
How are you feeling?

655
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,422
Thank you for asking.

656
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,759
Meetings bore me.
I flew out for a breather.

657
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,803
How lovely.

658
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,513
These are?

659
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,140
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

660
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,642
I see.

661
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:22,900
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic.

662
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:28,281
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs.

663
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,950
But they just fall on neighboring towns.

664
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,661
That's how magic works. Right, Suliman?

665
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,746
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

666
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,456
Suliman!

667
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:44,547
This is the final battle.
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp.

668
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:51,679
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news.

669
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:52,930
Thank you kindly.

670
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,641
Have my generals assembled?

671
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,481
It's been awhile, Howl.

672
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,734
Delighted to see you doing so well.

673
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,986
I saw right through you.

674
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,946
I've kept my oath.

675
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,824
I've no wish to fight you.

676
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,326
I'll take my mother.

677
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,286
I won't let you go.

678
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:38,893
Don't look down, you'll be dragged down.

679
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,522
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are.

680
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,412
Howl, don't! It's a trap.

681
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,926
Hold tight.

682
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,436
Sophie, sit up front.

683
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:09,108
Oh, no, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along.

684
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,694
Nice doggie.

685
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,448
You're just Suliman's spy.

686
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,075
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

687
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,869
Sophie, you steer.

688
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,413
What! I can't possibly do this!

689
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:23,873
They're after us.

690
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,339
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes.

691
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,300
What! That's impossible!

692
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,511
Don't worry, the ring will guide you.

693
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,847
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

694
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,515
Summon Calcifer?

695
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:45,644
It's glowing.

696
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,357
Follow the light.
You'll be there by nightfall.

697
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:54,028
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

698
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,655
Your presence gave me the courage for it.

699
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,908
She's too terrifying to face on my own.

700
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,704
You've saved me.
I was in grave danger back there.

701
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,208
Don't let go!

702
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,382
-You're good.
-Stop joking!

703
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,720
We've got a lead now.

704
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,723
I can give you five minutes
of invisibility. Now's your chance.

705
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,728
Howl!

706
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,951
No, thank you.

707
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,746
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages.

708
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,333
I supposed Howl thinks he's escaped...

709
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,253
His mother's awfully young.

710
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,347
We're not far. That's my hometown.

711
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:52,229
Don't try to be cute. I don't trust you.

712
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,213
The castle. They've come to meet us.

713
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,220
Sophie!

714
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,389
Markl, help!

715
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,225
I don't know how to stop this thing!

716
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,238
Sophie!

717
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:45,699
Doggie.

718
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,535
Markl.

719
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,829
I'm home.

720
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,248
Sophie, are you hurt?

721
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,334
You're home!

722
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,379
Thank you for coming to meet us.

723
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,370
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

724
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:52,141
I wonder if Howl's back.

725
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,821
Howl?

726
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,969
Howl? Is that you?

727
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,349
Are you hurt? In pain?

728
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,352
Stay away.

729
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,646
I want to help you.

730
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,690
I want to break the spell you're under.

731
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:09,194
You can't even break your own spell.

732
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,697
But I love you!

733
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,949
Too late.

734
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,413
Howl!

735
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,178
Howl must be back.

736
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,724
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick.

737
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:41,310
We're both running out of time.

738
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:44,354
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

739
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,941
I can't tell you that. I'm a demon.

740
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,154
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

741
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:55,240
Howl has given you something
very precious.

742
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,326
What is it? Where is it?

743
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,204
That's confidential information.

744
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,831
And if I threaten to dump water over you?

745
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:05,584
How dare you! Howl will die with me.

746
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,064
Good morning, Turnip.

747
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,191
We've got to be brave.

748
01:15:32,444 --> 01:15:34,488
Ready, Sophie!

749
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,991
Okay! Open wider, Calcifer.

750
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,204
Here goes! Push!

751
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,956
Heave!

752
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,635
I... said... move!

753
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,220
Come on!

754
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:23,912
They call it a castle,
but once you get inside, it's a junk heap.

755
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,458
It's time to eat!

756
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,508
Here, old girl.

757
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,512
But, Sophie she's the Witch of the Waste.

758
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:42,222
No need to worry.

759
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:44,433
Why's she staring at me?

760
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:46,977
Such a pretty fire.

761
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:50,814
Howl.

762
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:52,107
Hello, everyone.

763
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,191
Welcome home.

764
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,402
Master Howl, can we keep this dog?

765
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:59,031
An old Witch and Madam Suliman's dog.

766
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,408
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

767
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:05,662
Don't look at me!
They flew in with Sophie.

768
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,417
Sophie, always dramatic...

769
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,337
So you're Turnip.

770
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:17,841
You're under quite a spell, too.

771
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:21,136
Seems everyone in our little family
has problems...

772
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,263
He's so handsome.

773
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:26,933
This is a busy day. We're moving.

774
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:28,226
Moving?

775
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,438
Good. There aren't any shops here.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

776
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:35,359
Madam Suliman
can track us down in no time.

777
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:39,696
But you'll have to stay behind.
The magic in your spell's too risky.

778
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:47,371
All right, that's done.

779
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,248
Move it, Calcifer.

780
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,890
Excellent.

781
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:08,517
Stay right where you are.

782
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:13,939
Be gentle...

783
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,527
Here goes.

784
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,824
We've moved. You can get up now.

785
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,245
Amazing, Master. It's huge.

786
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,623
What a pretty fire.

787
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,097
This is--

788
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:32,726
I added a bathroom.
For our growing family.

789
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:36,521
Sophie, come here! Sophie!

790
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:42,319
I added a bedroom, too. Get in.

791
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:54,539
This is... Why?

792
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,959
I thought it would suit you.
Do you like it?

793
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,797
Yes, it's perfect for a housekeeper.

794
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,842
I got you some new clothes, too.
Open them later. Next.

795
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,429
Sophie! Come here! Quick!

796
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,806
A courtyard!

797
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,433
There's a shop, too.

798
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,769
Let's go, Heen!

799
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:19,648
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit.

800
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,695
My gift to you, Sophie. Step outside.

801
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:53,014
It's my secret garden.

802
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,225
Beautiful.

803
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,854
Did you make it with your magic?

804
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,024
Only a little, to help the flowers.

805
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,703
Thank you, Howl!

806
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,246
It's like I'm dreaming.

807
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,520
Sophie.

808
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:46,443
How mysterious.
I feel I've been here before.

809
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,528
I could cry with happiness.

810
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:49,946
Come.

811
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,414
Look.

812
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,379
A sweet little house.

813
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,340
My favorite hideaway.

814
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,719
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone.

815
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,597
Alone?

816
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:19,935
My uncle, a wizard,
left me this place as my private study.

817
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,812
Make yourself at home there, Sophie.

818
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:27,609
What's wrong?

819
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,444
I'm scared.

820
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,489
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside.

821
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:37,577
Howl, tell me the truth.

822
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,497
I don't mind if you're a monster.

823
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:49,756
I want to make sure
that you can all live comfortably.

824
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:54,260
Why not open a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

825
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,971
You'd be good at it, Sophie.

826
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,307
And then, you'd go away?

827
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,145
I want to help you, Howl.

828
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,274
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

829
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,361
Sophie, you are beautiful.

830
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:19,077
The good thing about being old
is that you've got so little to lose...

831
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:34,718
Why is that thing flying out here?

832
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:35,677
A battleship?

833
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,178
On its way to burn cities and people.

834
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,888
The enemy's? Ours?

835
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,015
What difference does it make?

836
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:54,696
Murderers.

837
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:05,123
Look at all those bombs.

838
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,390
It stopped.

839
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,059
Did you do that?

840
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:26,686
I'm just tinkering with it.
It won't crash.

841
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,065
Howl!

842
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:33,860
Oops, looks like they're onto us.

843
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:46,664
Madam Suliman's henchmen. Let's go back.

844
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,000
Run! Move those legs.

845
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,432
Hurry on in!

846
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,434
No! Don't let go!

847
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,403
What happened, Sophie?

848
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:20,323
I've had it with this place!

849
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,127
Good night, Sophie.

850
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,545
Good night.

851
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,968
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end.

852
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:42,470
Thank you, Markl.

853
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:43,847
Need the toilet?

854
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,306
I'm fine.

855
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,433
Good night.

856
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:48,601
You're in love.

857
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,858
Sighing away like that.

858
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:08,371
I thought so.

859
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:10,999
Were you ever in love?

860
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,002
Of course I was. I'm still in love.

861
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:15,086
What?

862
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:18,798
Men, why ever should we want them...

863
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,092
But a young man's heart is so delicious!

864
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,094
Unbelievable.

865
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:26,180
And so adorable, too.

866
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:31,019
What is that?

867
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,395
Air raid siren.

868
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,314
Air raid?

869
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:39,819
It's not for here.
But best not go out tonight.

870
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:45,909
Suliman's creatures are searching
high and low for our house.

871
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:52,916
What a good fire, hiding us so well.

872
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,620
Sophie, a stranger got in!

873
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:39,170
Mother.

874
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:41,631
Sophie!

875
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,886
Where have you been!
I searched for you everywhere!

876
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:49,889
But, oh, look how you've aged!

877
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:52,600
It's all my fault.

878
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:56,980
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

879
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,023
Mother...

880
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:03,861
I barely recognize the house.

881
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,822
Who is that?

882
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,907
Oh, your landlady.

883
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:11,160
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

884
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:14,330
He's such a wonderful man.
And he's rich, too!

885
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,999
We can all live together again.

886
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:18,751
You'll never have to clean again.

887
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:22,547
But I'm happy here...

888
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,173
Really?

889
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:25,258
Oops, I forgot.

890
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:28,219
My car's waiting. I've got to run.

891
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,852
I'm so glad I found you again.

892
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:38,187
We'll really catch up next time.

893
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,523
In the meantime, you take care.

894
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:50,241
A peeping-bug, eh?
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

895
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:51,868
All yours, Cal.

896
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,838
May you find happiness, Mother.

897
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:06,549
Thank you. You too, Sophie.

898
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:13,806
I've done what I was told.
Take me back to my husband.

899
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,768
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased.

900
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,772
Forgive me, Sophie...

901
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,235
Look at all these people.

902
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:30,239
They're all running away.
The town will be empty.

903
01:29:30,364 --> 01:29:32,617
Do you wish to run, too?

904
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:35,745
That's what that lady spoke of...

905
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,499
So, she did. I'm glad we made up.

906
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,834
Don't go, Sophie!

907
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:46,089
I love you, Sophie. Please stay.

908
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,426
I love you, too, Markl.
Don't worry, I'll stay.

909
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,844
Really!

910
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,263
Are we a family?

911
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,265
Yes, we're family.

912
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:58,309
Oh, good!

913
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,112
I'll never let Suliman get hold of Howl.

914
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,297
But the paper says we won.

915
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:31,259
Only fools swallow such lies.

916
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,847
How strange. I can't get Calcifer going.

917
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,307
Grandma, will you stop that?

918
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,101
Such an awful stink.

919
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:43,229
Why deny an old lady her pleasures.

920
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,731
Open the window, Markl.

921
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,821
I wouldn't open that now...

922
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:58,161
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly keep them out.

923
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:01,289
Markl!

924
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:13,426
Close it quick!

925
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:22,560
Look after Grandma, Markl.
I'll check on the shop.

926
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:45,541
How dare you, now? If you have
energy to spare, put out the fires.

927
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:10,733
Howl!

928
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:25,915
Dramatic as usual...

929
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,096
Howl!

930
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,642
I'm sorry.
I had too many enemies, tonight.

931
01:32:45,559 --> 01:32:48,312
Howl, oh, Howl.

932
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:07,415
Master Howl! Sophie!

933
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,129
Calcifer, be strong.

934
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:22,096
Madam, was that a gift from Suliman?

935
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,433
That granny fed me something nasty.

936
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:28,436
Why, if it isn't Howl.

937
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:32,773
I feel we need a nice long chat.

938
01:33:33,357 --> 01:33:37,153
Likewise, Madam.
But we have no time right now.

939
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:41,949
How unlike you. You're not running away.

940
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,701
Until later, then.

941
01:33:44,618 --> 01:33:47,705
Stay here, Sophie.
Calcifer will protect you.

942
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,707
I'll see to things outside.

943
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,668
Wait, Howl!

944
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,338
Don't go! Please stay.

945
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,216
Another round of bombs is coming.
Even Calcifer can't stop those.

946
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,552
Let's run away. Don't fight.

947
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,555
I'm through running away.

948
01:34:05,264 --> 01:34:08,392
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

949
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,685
You.

950
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,399
Howl!

951
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:41,444
That's our town.

952
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:47,199
There's Howl.

953
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:57,668
Howl!

954
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:09,513
Sophie! Turnip...

955
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:15,144
Markl, come inside!

956
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,314
Move? You're nuts. There's nothing there.

957
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:21,775
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting.

958
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,903
He's better off a coward.

959
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:25,571
Grandma, get up.

960
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:27,156
Going for a stroll?

961
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,533
Suliman will find us right away.

962
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:33,287
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive.

963
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,663
Sophie!

964
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:36,040
The castle's falling apart.

965
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:38,375
That's all right Markl, take Grandma.

966
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,502
Sure.

967
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,172
You, too, hop on.

968
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,176
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace.

969
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:50,179
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you.

970
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,097
Watch it!

971
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,517
Cut it out! Cut it out!

972
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,770
If I leave, the house will collapse.

973
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:58,729
Fine!

974
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,026
We're out.

975
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,195
I'd better go last.

976
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:10,616
Even I don't know what'll happen...

977
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:41,689
I told you it would collapse.

978
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:43,065
Rain!

979
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,278
Is that heading for town?

980
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,988
Look after Grandma, Markl.

981
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:50,948
Turnip, find us a way in.

982
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,410
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll take care of you.

983
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:59,582
Markl, we can get in here.

984
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:11,927
The roof's leaking. I'll go out.

985
01:38:12,428 --> 01:38:13,762
Wait here.

986
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:16,140
It's wet, here...

987
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:23,272
Hurry.

988
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:26,984
Too damp.

989
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,406
Bring Grandma here, Markl.

990
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:34,533
The castle's empty.

991
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:38,537
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

992
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,292
Calcifer, please. You're my last hope.

993
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:46,670
I want to go to Howl. Move the castle.

994
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,383
I know you can do it. You're so strong.

995
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:55,179
But there's no chimney here...

996
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:56,722
And the wood's damp...

997
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:01,810
As the saying goes,
"The best blaze brightest in adversity".

998
01:39:01,935 --> 01:39:04,688
I've heard that, but...

999
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:05,898
You really think so?

1000
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,025
You're so pretty, Cal.

1001
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,318
Sit here, Grandma.

1002
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:12,404
Then, give me something of yours, Sophie.

1003
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:13,656
Of mine?

1004
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:16,325
I can't do it alone. How about your eyes?

1005
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:17,576
My eyes?

1006
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:19,161
This?

1007
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,271
Amazing, Calcifer! You are the best!

1008
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,607
Imagine what I could do
with your eyes and your heart.

1009
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,736
Heart! You have a heart?

1010
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:38,240
Oh, my!

1011
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:53,130
There's Howl. He's trapped.

1012
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,304
Hurry, Calcifer!

1013
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:02,431
Don't!

1014
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,141
Grandma!

1015
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:06,101
Stop it!

1016
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:08,937
Howl's heart.

1017
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,190
Cut it out!

1018
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:21,950
Grandma!

1019
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:26,079
It's hot, hot!

1020
01:41:26,538 --> 01:41:27,873
Let go!

1021
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,917
You'll die, Grandma.

1022
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,127
No, it's mine!

1023
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:51,980
Sophie!

1024
01:41:55,692 --> 01:41:56,860
Sophie!

1025
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:00,989
She's so mean. That's mine.

1026
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:47,828
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done.
I poured water on Calcifer.

1027
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,750
What if I've killed Howl, too...

1028
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:22,988
It's moving... Is Howl alive?

1029
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:24,990
Show me where he is.

1030
01:43:46,678 --> 01:43:48,305
The castle door...

1031
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:07,592
Heen...

1032
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:44,004
Howl...

1033
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:05,233
This must be Howl's childhood...

1034
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:26,148
Howl! Calcifer!

1035
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:31,736
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you.

1036
01:47:33,363 --> 01:47:35,323
Wait for me in the future!

1037
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,318
I'll walk there Heen. I'll walk.

1038
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,320
I can't stop crying.

1039
01:48:37,802 --> 01:48:39,179
Howl.

1040
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:48,605
I'm sorry I took so long.

1041
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:51,524
You've been waiting all this time.

1042
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:58,698
Take me to Calcifer.

1043
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,762
Is he dead?

1044
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:04,597
No, he's fine.

1045
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,437
Grandma...

1046
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:14,149
Don't look at me. I don't have anything.

1047
01:50:14,566 --> 01:50:15,483
Please.

1048
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,446
Grandma.

1049
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:24,784
You want it that badly?

1050
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:26,036
Yes.

1051
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:30,957
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it.

1052
01:50:31,499 --> 01:50:32,876
There.

1053
01:50:34,085 --> 01:50:36,421
Thank you, Grandma.

1054
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:53,813
Calcifer.

1055
01:50:55,106 --> 01:50:57,817
Sophie... I'm all worn out.

1056
01:50:57,942 --> 01:51:01,321
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

1057
01:51:01,446 --> 01:51:03,907
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.

1058
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:08,912
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me.

1059
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,497
I'd better try, then.

1060
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:17,170
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird.

1061
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:19,422
It's still only a child's heart.

1062
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:23,510
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

1063
01:51:23,593 --> 01:51:26,679
and may Howl recover his heart...

1064
01:51:38,483 --> 01:51:39,484
I'm alive!

1065
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:41,111
I'm free!

1066
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,661
He moved, he's alive!

1067
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,875
You broke Calcifer's spell!

1068
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:11,724
Turnip!

1069
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:26,322
Turnip, are you okay?

1070
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:28,283
I'll get you a new stick, right away.

1071
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:32,996
Thank you, Turnip.

1072
01:52:40,962 --> 01:52:42,464
Thank you, Sophie.

1073
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:45,925
I'm a prince from the next kingdom.

1074
01:52:46,009 --> 01:52:48,094
A cruel spell turned me into a scarecrow.

1075
01:52:48,386 --> 01:52:51,639
A spell that only a kiss
from your true love could break.

1076
01:52:51,723 --> 01:52:56,352
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn't saved me,
I would have died.

1077
01:52:56,728 --> 01:52:59,105
My, you're good-looking.

1078
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,900
What a racket. What's the fuss?

1079
01:53:02,817 --> 01:53:05,111
I feel terrible.
Like I'm trapped under a rock.

1080
01:53:05,570 --> 01:53:07,864
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden.

1081
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:11,784
Oh, Sophie,
your hair is just like starlight.

1082
01:53:12,243 --> 01:53:13,328
It's so beautiful.

1083
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:15,788
I love you, Howl! How wonderful.

1084
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:20,585
Looks like your true love
is in love with someone else.

1085
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:24,714
You'd best go home
and make them stop this war.

1086
01:53:24,797 --> 01:53:26,132
That's exactly what I shall do.

1087
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:29,844
When the war is over, I shall return.

1088
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:32,388
"A fickle heart is the only constant
in this world".

1089
01:53:33,139 --> 01:53:35,308
My, you have a way with words.

1090
01:53:35,433 --> 01:53:37,810
I'll wait for your return, then.

1091
01:53:44,776 --> 01:53:48,321
Why should you contact me now?

1092
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:50,323
What on earth have you been up to?

1093
01:53:53,618 --> 01:53:55,870
A happy ending, I see.

1094
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:57,747
You two-timer.

1095
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:06,464
Well, there it is.

1096
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:10,343
Bring the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defense.

1097
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:14,597
Let's put an end to this foolish war.

1098
01:54:15,473 --> 01:54:17,016
It's Calcifer!

1099
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:20,061
You didn't have to come back.

1100
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:26,276
I really missed you all.
Besides, it looks like rain...

1101
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:28,444
Thank you, Calcifer.

1102
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,684
THE END

1103
01:59:09,767 --> 01:59:11,936
