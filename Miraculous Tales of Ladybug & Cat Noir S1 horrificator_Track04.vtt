&lrm;You're suggesting we run... Officer Jones?

&lrm;What a bratty snob.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.020
&lrm;Put the mask back on.
&lrm;You're playing a monster.

&lrm;Mylene, we need you to stay in character.

&lrm;[Ivan] You're lame!

&lrm;You're right.

&lrm;But fighting won't bring Mylene back.

&lrm;I'm the producer and I'll do all I can

&lrm;13 seconds from now.

&lrm;Thank you, Max.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.900
&lrm;We still have editing, post-sound,...

&lrm;Who's gonna take Mylene's part?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.300
&lrm;Me, of course.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.140
&lrm;You haven't read the script.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.820
&lrm;Of course I have...
&lrm;The first scene anyway.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.540
&lrm;It ends with a kiss
&lrm;between Agent Smith and Officer Jones.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.500
&lrm;[she shrieks]

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300
&lrm;You wrote that?

&lrm;Hold up.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.540
&lrm;I didn't write that.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.500
&lrm;I wrote it. It was just a little tweak

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.260
&lrm;to move the story forward.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.740
&lrm;What? You edited my script
&lrm;without even telling me?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.460
&lrm;That's low!

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.980

&lrm;Who cares who wrote what?

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.540
&lrm;We've got to film this thing right?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.780
&lrm;She's right.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.460
&lrm;We can only use the school until 6pm sharp

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.500
&lrm;which leaves us 9 hours, 12 minutes
&lrm;and 12 seconds, 11, 10, 9, 8...

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.340
&lrm;[Max counts down]

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.460
&lrm;Adrien and Chloe kissing
&lrm;cannot happen... No way!

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.140
&lrm;It makes no sense story-wise anyway.
&lrm;The main character's...

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.340
&lrm;Hold on.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.820
&lrm;We can't just let Mylene leave.
&lrm;It's wrong.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.860
&lrm;We all chose her to play
&lrm;the lead female role

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.140
&lrm;and we're all in this movie together.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.700
&lrm;She needs our support.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.020
&lrm;I'm gonna find her and bring her back.

&lrm;Up until now, you have felt fear.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.620
&lrm;From now on, you will cause fear.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.700
&lrm;And after you've shown them
&lrm;how they make you feel,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.020

&lrm;We're in the middle of a shoot
&lrm;and I'm the director, FYI.

&lrm;I say "cut," no-one else, comprende?

&lrm;And I'm the producer.
&lrm;Mylene's supposed to be the star.

&lrm;We're out of time.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.500
&lrm;And for what I can see, Mylene is MIA.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.580
&lrm;From the top.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.220
&lrm;Here we go again.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.220
&lrm;Agent Smith doesn't need
&lrm;a man in her life.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.340
&lrm;Sniffles just got munched on.

&lrm;Do you wanna finish this film or not?

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.140
&lrm;Let's make Agent Smith a nurse instead.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.740
&lrm;That'll fix everything.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.740
&lrm;Sorry, but how exactly?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.700
&lrm;I don't know
&lrm;but I'll look amazing in a uniform.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.340
&lrm;We're not rewriting

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.580
&lrm;the script again!

&lrm;"Alya" is not going on those credits!

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.180
&lrm;[Chloe] Nobody cares!

&lrm;Everyone calm down.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.980
&lrm;This movie's a team effort.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.460
&lrm;Your nurse idea is perfect, Chloe.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.460
&lrm;Of course it is because it's mine.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.260
&lrm;But Chloe, you don't have a uniform.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.980
&lrm;Which is why
&lrm;that idea was never believable.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.340
&lrm;You should go to the nurse's office
&lrm;and try on some uniforms.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.620
&lrm;[fingers click] Kim, Max, come!

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.700
&lrm;You've been promoted
&lrm;to wardrobe and bodyguard.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.020
&lrm;Nice going, Miss Producer,
&lrm;now we have no lead again.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.580
&lrm;Yeah, but now we've got rid of Chloe.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.580
&lrm;And now what?

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.380
&lrm;We go find Mylene. She's here somewhere.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.740
&lrm;I told you, tick-toc, there's no time.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.540
&lrm;-We need a lead, now!
&lrm;-Marinette can do it.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.300
&lrm;What? No! I can't act. I'm the producer.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.180
&lrm;But you wanna kiss Adrien, don't you?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.780
&lrm;[she sighs]

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.340
&lrm;Yes, but not like this.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.980
&lrm;A nurse's uniform, how brilliant am I?

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.020
&lrm;Even that dimwit,
&lrm;Marinette, liked the idea.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.340
&lrm;[swishing]

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.220
&lrm;I'm only doing this as a favour.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.220
&lrm;When Mylene returns
&lrm;she'll have her role back.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.220
&lrm;Of course she will, chill out.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.420
&lrm;And just think, after tonight,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.820
&lrm;you'll finally have kissed Adrien.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.980
&lrm;[Marinette squeals]

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.820
&lrm;Hey, wait a minute.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.180
&lrm;Marinette never likes my ideas,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.140
&lrm;I think you've all been duped.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.260
&lrm;You guys take care of the uniform
&lrm;just in case.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.820
&lrm;-Did you hear something?
&lrm;-No, what?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.900
&lrm;Totally unbelievable.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.300
&lrm;What's that?

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.140
&lrm;I said...

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.620
&lrm;It's got to be believable.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.780
&lrm;Don't worry. You'll do fine.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.500
&lrm;Ready to roll? Camera...

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.420
<i>&lrm;Horrificator, take 16.</i>

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.340
<i>&lrm;Action!</i>

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.060
<i>&lrm;I'm not scared of that monster,</i>
<i>&lrm;Officer Jones.</i>

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.740
<i>&lrm;Cut! I knew it.</i>

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.500
&lrm;What did I say about people saying "cut"?

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.420
&lrm;Well played, Marinette.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.700
&lrm;All that speech on working together,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.620
&lrm;Then you stab me in the back!

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.340
&lrm;Your stupid movie won't get
&lrm;into the festival if I'm not in it

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.660
&lrm;because my daddy
&lrm;is one of the judges!

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.220
&lrm;[horrific screaming]

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.740
&lrm;Did you hear that?

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.860
&lrm;If this is one of your silly ploys
&lrm;to get rid of me

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.980
&lrm;you can forget it, besides...

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.500
&lrm;[horrific screaming]

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.100
&lrm;I definitely heard that.
&lrm;We'd better scope this out.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.260
&lrm;A snack for the road?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.260
<i>&lrm;Hey! Anybody here? Kim? Max?</i>

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.340
&lrm;Where are you?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.980
&lrm;I saw the same pink goo in the bathroom.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.300
&lrm;That's Kim's.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.220
<i>&lrm;They've vanished.</i>

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.220
<i>&lrm;Or they're playing a sick joke.</i>

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.500
&lrm;We should tell Principle Damocles
&lrm;what's going on.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.900
&lrm;Nino, come on, stop filming.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.820
&lrm;No way. This is just getting good.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.020
&lrm;Looks like it's time
&lrm;to bring in the alter ego.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.260
&lrm;Yo, Adrien, where you going?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.380
&lrm;I left Officer Jones's jacket.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.940
&lrm;She'll probably wear it in all the scenes.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.900
&lrm;[snarling]

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.780
&lrm;[splodging]

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.940
&lrm;Time to transform, Plagg.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.580
&lrm;What are you doing?

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.220
&lrm;[he gasps]

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.460
&lrm;They'll think I've disappeared too.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.020
&lrm;[Plagg] And you say I stink of camembert.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.340
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.900
&lrm;[knocking] Mr Damocles? Sir?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.340
&lrm;[gasping]

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.220
&lrm;[Rose] Even Principle Damocles is missing.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.780
&lrm;Time to transform.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.820
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.540
<i>&lrm;Anyone seen Agent Smith?</i>

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.940
&lrm;I mean, Marinette.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.020
&lrm;[gasping]

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.260
&lrm;Oh on. This is Marinette's phone.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.300
&lrm;[grunting]

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.340
&lrm;Quick, check the windows.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.180
&lrm;Crazy.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.180
&lrm;We're trapped. I'm calling daddy.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.740
&lrm;Dudes, phones never work in horror movies.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.540
&lrm;-No bars.
&lrm;-No coverage.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.380
&lrm;Told you so. Boo-ya!

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.700
&lrm;[gasping]

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.940
&lrm;Is everything OK?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.140
&lrm;Ladybug in my movie, this is legit.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.940
&lrm;And on my Ladyblog.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.500
&lrm;We've got to evacuate the building, OK?

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.780
&lrm;No...

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.820
&lrm;That's easier said than done.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.540
&lrm;Double legit!

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.980
&lrm;I tried to cut through it
&lrm;but it's totally indestructible.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.100
&lrm;So we're trapped inside for now.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.020
&lrm;Stay put and try to relax.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.540
&lrm;Let's take a stroll.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.380
&lrm;We know Hawk Moth's taken
&lrm;another victim in this school.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.980
&lrm;There's one way to get rid of
&lrm;this goo and free everyone...

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.300
&lrm;capture that Akuma.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.140
&lrm;Exactly,
&lrm;I love it when you read my mind.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.860
&lrm;We'd better find this thing first
&lrm;and its prisoners.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.580
&lrm;Wow, you did it again.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.860
&lrm;Don't mind me.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.380
&lrm;Finding missing peeps,
&lrm;solving a mystery,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.260
&lrm;with Cat Noir and Ladybug!

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.540
&lrm;This movie's gonna be so swank.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
&lrm;Stay together, right behind us.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.020
&lrm;You too, Spielberg.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.500
&lrm;[snarling]

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.220
&lrm;[whimpering]

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.740
&lrm;[he squeals]

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.860
&lrm;Absorb their fear,
&lrm;Horrificator, feed on it!

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.740
&lrm;It will give you strength.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.860
&lrm;And soon enough,
&lrm;you'll be giving me strength too.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.220
&lrm;We're better off on our own
&lrm;than with the others.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.500
&lrm;Why stay with them
&lrm;when we can hide on our own?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.260
&lrm;There!

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.660
&lrm;Anyone recognise that shoe?

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.140
&lrm;That's Adrien's shoe.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.620
&lrm;That's weird, there's no pink slime.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.260
&lrm;Yes, there is.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.860
&lrm;[snarling]
&lrm;[screaming]

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.060
&lrm;Everybody, run!

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.740
&lrm;Awesome.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.820
&lrm;So awesome.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.860
&lrm;[she chuckles]

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.180
&lrm;[disgusted sigh]
&lrm;What's your name, Drool-ator?

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.860
&lrm;Cat's aren't afraid
&lrm;of slimy toads like you.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.060
&lrm;We'd better find that Akuma.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.220
&lrm;I see nothing but miles of slime.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.740
&lrm;Help!

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.140
&lrm;Fear, it's fear
&lrm;that gives it its strength.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.220
&lrm;[she screams]

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.900
&lrm;[fearful cries]

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.100
&lrm;[screaming]

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.700
&lrm;It's taken Nath' and Alix.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.740
&lrm;The more people are scared of it
&lrm;the more powerful it gets.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.580
&lrm;By defeating fear, we defeat it.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.660
&lrm;First we've got to get out
&lrm;of this sticky situation

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.940
&lrm;before it dries.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.300
&lrm;[she squeals]

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.820
&lrm;Did you see how it left Ivan alone?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.860
&lrm;Yeah, what's that all about?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.980
&lrm;I think the monster is Mylene.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.740
&lrm;Where are Sabrina and Chloe?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.580
&lrm;We'll find them...
&lrm;If we can find a way out.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.740
&lrm;It's a good thing
&lrm;I come up with brilliant ideas.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.420
&lrm;No-one's gonna get through that barricade.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.380
&lrm;We can relax
&lrm;and let them do the hard work.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.900
&lrm;[Sabrina yelps]

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.420
&lrm;[growling]

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.940
&lrm;[screaming]

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.740
&lrm;We're too late.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.740
&lrm;But look,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.660
&lrm;we can track the monster.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.260
&lrm;[Nino giggles]

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.020
&lrm;Oh, yeah, I'm so amped!

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.060
&lrm;-Turn you amp down, will you?
&lrm;-My bad.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.820
&lrm;Their fear will make you powerful enough

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.340
&lrm;to defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.700
&lrm;Get their Miraculouses!

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.100
&lrm;Anybody here?

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.020
&lrm;Ladybug, it's me,

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.260
&lrm;Chloe Bourgeois!

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.260
&lrm;Don't worry, we'll get you out.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.180
&lrm;Well hurry up already!

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.540
&lrm;Is everyone here?

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.780
&lrm;[muffled] Yes!

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.940
&lrm;-Mr Damocles?
&lrm;-Present.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.540
&lrm;-Alix? Nathaniel?
&lrm;-Yeah!

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.700
&lrm;Adrien?

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.820
&lrm;Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980
&lrm;[relieved sigh]

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.420
&lrm;What about Marinette?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.220
&lrm;Yeah, we've got everyone.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.260
&lrm;They won't budge.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.220
&lrm;Get us out!

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.140
&lrm;Calm down. We'll get you out.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.900
&lrm;[growling]

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.780
&lrm;OK, now this is getting scary.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.620
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.300
&lrm;Guitar strings, are you kidding me?

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.780
&lrm;Guitar, music... Mylene's song.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.100
&lrm;That's it. Enough is enough.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.380
&lrm;Cataclysm!

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.340
&lrm;[crashing]

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.780
&lrm;OK, we're all going to sing.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.620
&lrm;Sing? So that's your plan.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.220
&lrm;The only way is to get
&lrm;your fear under control.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.220
&lrm;Do you all know Smelly Wolf?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.620
&lrm;Seriously? Smelly Wolf?

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.660
&lrm;Care to join us?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.620
&lrm;OK, everyone,

&lrm;Wow, it's working.

&lrm;[excited squeaks]

&lrm;[purring]

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.580
&lrm;That's the button I gave Mylene.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.900
&lrm;That's where the Akuma is.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.860
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, Akuma.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.940
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.260
&lrm;Gotcha!

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.780
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.740
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.180
&lrm;Pound it!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.220
&lrm;[Nino] Awesome.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.380
&lrm;You don't scare me, Ladybug!

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.540
&lrm;I'll destroy you in the end,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.020
&lrm;someday, somehow... I'll destroy you!

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.180
&lrm;What do you think, Mr Mayor?
&lrm;Off the hook right?

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.900
&lrm;We didn't make the cut.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.660
&lrm;He said the monster
&lrm;was a horrible replica, no joke!

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.740
&lrm;Don't worry,
&lrm;this is how all movie directors start.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.780
&lrm;Yeah, even if that final kiss
&lrm;wasn't quite what we expected.
