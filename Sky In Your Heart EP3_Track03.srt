There will be a ritual slaughter tomorrow.

5
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,669
It’s Gong, the children’s pig.

6
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,333
- Hey!
- Teacher Prince.

7
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:51,943
Thanks for taking care of me when I passed out.

8
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:56,669
Thank you for helping me with the check-up the other day.

9
00:00:58,793 --> 00:00:59,502
Hey!

10
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:00,549
Hold on.

11
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:23,717
You two look perfect together. Congratulations!

12
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:24,457
Thank you.

13
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,384
Hey, Kuafah.

14
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:31,845
I’ll go greet him.

15
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:33,086
You can take her inside.

16
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,270
Sure.

17
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,468
I’ll see you inside.

18
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,219
Thanks for coming, Kuafah.

19
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,851
I thought you wouldn’t come.

20
00:01:54,943 --> 00:01:55,840
May.

21
00:01:58,345 --> 00:01:59,448
Do you remember…

22
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,291
the day we broke up?

23
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,131
(You don’t remember?)

24
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,475
Hey.

25
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:11,758
Doctor.

26
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:16,198
I asked if you remembered or not.

27
00:02:16,394 --> 00:02:17,198
Today,

28
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,391
we need to give the village chief’s son a welcome.

29
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,997
I forgot.

30
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:24,901
You go ahead.

31
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,713
I don’t feel like it.

32
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,332
You must.

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
He’s bringing lots of snacks for the children.

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,085
I need a hand with those. Come on.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,846
Quickly.

36
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,343
Who the heck is he?

37
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:45,445
A politician?

38
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,266
Why does he get such hospitality from everyone?

39
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:48,907
Hey, keep it down.

40
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,730
You can complain but not so loud.

41
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,177
People might tell the village chief.

42
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,505
Who the heck is this guy?

43
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,945
- Relax, man.
- You’re louder.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,797
Het gets an umbrella too.

45
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,880
Sorry to keep you waiting, kids.

46
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,574
I’ve brought you tons of snacks.

47
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,772
Yeah!

48
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:25,379
Wee-ah, go get it.

49
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:28,600
Stand right here.

50
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:30,164
Here you go.

51
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:31,494
Let’s get a picture.

52
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,505
A picture with that crappy snack box?

53
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,850
Smile.

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,556
1 2 3.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,045
The umbrella.

56
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,400
Okay.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,509
Share these with your friends.

58
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,129
Enjoy.

59
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:45,674
Can you carry them?

60
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,033
Those are for the kids.

61
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,561
This is for you, Teacher Prince.

62
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,855
To thank you for always taking good care of them.

63
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,941
But…

64
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,509
Who are those three guys?

65
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,992
They are new volunteers.

66
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:19,430
My apologies.

67
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,403
I didn’t know that.

68
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,688
If I’d known, I would have brought some gifts for you too.

69
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:23,686
It’s okay.

70
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:26,656
Actually, you can have my photo as a gift.

71
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,070
Let’s do it.

72
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,250
Come here. Don’t be shy.

73
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,902
Okay. I’ll airdrop it for you.

74
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,160
Would you excuse me? I’ll go feed the children.

75
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,394
Let’s go, Teacher Prince.

76
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:44,960
Want to take a photo?

77
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:47,000
Who is this Aou guy, anyway?

78
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,040
He seems close to Teacher Prince.

79
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:50,713
Ah!

80
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,120
They’re boyfriends.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,691
What?

82
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,550
Boyfriends?

83
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,436
Yes.

84
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:57,748
They’re always together. They must be dating.

85
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:58,368
Fabby!

86
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,247
Fabby.

87
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,138
Not fabby.

88
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,693
My Teacher Prince.

89
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,548
Right.

90
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,051
And he just walked around side by side with the teacher.

91
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,766
He’s just a show-off.

92
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,318
Why do you sound jealous of the teacher?

93
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,478
That’s nonsense.

94
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,762
(Where are you anyway?)

95
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course, I’m at our place.

96
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,093
Dao,

97
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:30,998
I finished showering.

98
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,718
Whose voice was that then?

99
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,435
Khabkluen’s, wasn’t it?

100
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:37,688
Eh...I’m studying.

101
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,106
I gotta go. Bye.

102
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,563
What?

103
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,456
Almost caught.

104
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:46,400
Was that Fah?

105
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:47,597
Yes.

106
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,929
I didn’t see you there in the shower.

107
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,113
I missed you so much.

108
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:53,960
Too much.

109
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,144
Can I have a kiss?

110
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:56,819
That’s so random.

111
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,754
Come on.

112
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:01,679
Did you really take a shower?

113
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,335
Why?

114
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:03,975
You still stink.

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,722
Seriously?

116
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:05,447
Yes.

117
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,078
Sniff again.

118
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,803
Go back and take a shower again.

119
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:13,792
- Really?
- Yes.

120
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,809
But why does someone who hasn’t showered smell so good?

121
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,129
Of course, I do.

122
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,130
Well, if I’m smelly,

123
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,851
how about you give me a shower?

124
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:32,263
No. I will take a shower first.

125
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:33,567
What? You said I was smelly.

126
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,344
Yeah, you wait until I finish.

127
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,734
I haven’t been completely clean yet.

128
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:37,750
Yes, but you need to wait.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,468
Kids these days.

130
00:07:42,138 --> 00:07:43,987
They just can’t be left alone together.

131
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,141
You’ll see.

132
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:46,882
I’ll chew you two out when I go back.

133
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,152
Hey.

134
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,498
Hi, there.

135
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,492
Looks who’s here.

136
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,624
You came home quite late tonight.

137
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,536
I get you though.

138
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,614
Your boyfriend is finally back.

139
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,215
What boyfriend?

140
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,829
Don’t play dumb.

141
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,955
The kids told me.

142
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,628
I never knew you liked that type of man.

143
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,087
I think you’re misunderstanding.

144
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,920
Aou is an older friend I respect.

145
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:16,800
Besides,

146
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:20,322
he always takes care of everyone who volunteers here.

147
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,568
Everyone?

148
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,060
He only takes care of you.

149
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,240
He didn’t care about my friends and me.

150
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:29,438
He just got back. There are tons of things for him to do.

151
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,575
Taking his side, I see.

152
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,509
And why do you call him Phi?

153
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,553
I’m also a lot older than you.

154
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,455
‘Phi’ is reserved for people I respect only.

155
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:46,737
If you want me to address you like that, behave.

156
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:49,918
Well then…

157
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,600
Address me like you already do.

158
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,547
Teacher Prince. Dr. Fah.

159
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:58,493
My son is sick.

160
00:08:58,493 --> 00:08:59,828
He has bad stomach pain.

161
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,465
Can you please come take a look?

162
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:11,556
I gave him digestive tablets.

163
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:14,494
He should be fine really soon.

164
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,116
He must have had too many snacks.

165
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,464
But it still hurts.

166
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,455
You will be fine.

167
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,307
How about…

168
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:25,981
I give you magical treatment?

169
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:33,527
Abracadabra, I wish all your pain turns into butterflies

170
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,601
and flies away.

171
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,707
So?

172
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:39,903
Wow!

173
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,240
Dr. Fah surely has magic.

174
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:46,609
Don’t tell anyone.

175
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:47,830
It’s my secret.

176
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:51,040
Thank you so much, Dr. Fah and Teacher Prince

177
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,021
for coming to see him.

178
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,808
Would you like some drinks?

179
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,932
Well then

180
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:57,528
I’ll go with you and help out.

181
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:58,729
Of course.

182
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,812
Dr. Fah, would you like some snacks?

183
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,023
Aou gave us a lot.

184
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,409
No, thank you.

185
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:21,537
Ever since Teacher Prince came, Aou has been giving us lots of snacks.

186
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:27,647
I want them to be together for a long time so I will get unlimited snacks.

187
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:33,108
Wee-ah.

188
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,318
What if I tell you Teacher Prince isn't dating Aou?

189
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:40,128
What?

190
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,486
Then who is he dating?

191
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,794
Wanna know?

192
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,661
Get your ear closer.

193
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:58,658
Hot news!

194
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,091
Dr. Fah and Teacher Prince got together in April.

195
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,171
What an unfaithful man.

196
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,178
I gave you all my heart.

197
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:04,884
Yayah.

198
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,047
How did you get into my house?

199
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,177
Yayah, get up.

200
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,022
No.

201
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:08,955
I won’t.

202
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:09,678
What are you guys up to?

203
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,184
Hot news!

204
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,562
Teacher Prince is dating Mesa.

205
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:42,280
What?

206
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,813
It’s top secret. Do not tell anyone.

207
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,134
What?

208
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,173
Really?

209
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,966
Oh, boy! This is big news.

210
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:53,125
Okay.

211
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,111
These are your medicines.

212
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,127
I don’t think there’s any problem.

213
00:11:58,214 --> 00:11:59,319
I do!

214
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,904
Is it true, Dr. Fah?

215
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,444
What is it, Yayah?

216
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:08,204
Stop playing dumb.

217
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,170
I know everything.

218
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:11,658
What an unfaithful man.

219
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:13,928
I gave you all my heart.

220
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:17,023
You’re just a lying city man.

221
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:20,913
What are you talking about, Yayah?

222
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,283
I didn’t do anything.

223
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,080
A lying city man.

224
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,108
Prince.

225
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,862
How could you do that to my heart?

226
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:36,432
What did I do?

227
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,156
I was away for just a while.

228
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:39,554
I trusted you.

229
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:41,703
You fell for that sweet talker from the city.

230
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:42,820
I’m sad.

231
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,844
I’m so sad.

232
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,361
I’m sad.

233
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:48,650
Don’t talk to me.

234
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:55,787
Goodbye, Teacher.

235
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:01,852
Hey,

236
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:04,313
I need to talk to you about something.

237
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:06,400
About what?

238
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:12,896
The villagers have been calling me weird names.

239
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:13,857
Really?

240
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,231
Me too.

241
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:16,232
You too?

242
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:18,741
What is happening?

243
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,408
Well, well.

244
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:23,345
A sweet couple here.

245
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:27,163
What do you mean, Sompor?

246
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:33,093
The villagers say actually Dr. Fah and Teacher Prince are dating.

247
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,940
That’s not true.

248
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,680
I’ve been observing.

249
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:40,876
Teacher Prince always helps Dr. Fah with work.

250
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,111
Because the village chief told me to.

251
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:50,417
Then why do you call Dr. Fah mister but call other people Phi?

252
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,117
Because…

253
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:04,528
Dr. Fah is the special one.

254
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,542
I mean…

255
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,394
Specially annoying.

256
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,306
Specially spoiled.

257
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,531
And specially whiny.

258
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,977
That’s why I address him that.

259
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:21,323
That means Dr. Fah isn’t a good man, is he?

260
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:22,066
That’s right.

261
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:23,481
A very bad man.

262
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:24,830
Wait a minute.

263
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:26,235
What are you telling the kids?

264
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,151
I’ll get out of your way then.

265
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,531
Bye.

266
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,612
Get home safe.

267
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,133
A very bad man.

268
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,810
VILLAGE CHIEF OFFICE

269
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,283
Doctor Fah.

270
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:53,121
Why is he doing this to me?

271
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,323
Will you eat or cry? Choose one.

272
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,829
Well, I’m sad.

273
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,343
You’re not a teenager.

274
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,749
You don’t get me.

275
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:04,651
Come on.

276
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:08,166
I’ve had so much experience with love.

277
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:11,768
Don’t be bitter.

278
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:16,490
Because I just found you a perfect marriage prospect.

279
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,234
What?

280
00:15:21,215 --> 00:15:22,085
Here.

281
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,042
Eat.

282
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,567
Hey, Fah. There you are.

283
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,785
Want a drink?

284
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,051
Hold on, master.

285
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,738
I have medical check-ups for the children tomorrow.

286
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,801
Are you really my friend Kuafah?

287
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,188
Who are you?

288
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,010
Give me back my friend.

289
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,597
Are you nuts?

290
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,650
Give back, my ass.

291
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,318
It’s nothing.

292
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,930
I just don’t want a problem with the teacher.

293
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,385
Tired of hearing his complaint.

294
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:00,806
Fah,

295
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,602
are you dating Teacher Prince?

296
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:04,660
Huh?

297
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,076
What are you talking about?

298
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,997
The locals have been gossipping.

299
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,044
The locals have been gossipping.

300
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:14,112
They even say you two are getting married in April.

301
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,591
That’s absurd.

302
00:16:15,986 --> 00:16:18,650
I just hated Aou

303
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:23,555
so I started a rumor that you and the teacher were boyfriends.

304
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,101
I have no idea how the guy in the fake news turned into me.

305
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,051
I get it now.

306
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:33,650
You reap what you sow, man.

307
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,168
I didn’t sow for me.

308
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:38,171
I did it for my friend here.

309
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:40,822
Good then.

310
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,337
Mesa.

311
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:49,499
What if Teacher Prince and I become boyfriends for real?

312
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,697
Will you be mad?

313
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:52,764
Beat up.

314
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:53,800
You will beat me up?

315
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,842
Beat JJ up.

316
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,006
Asshole.

317
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:56,775
Kidding.

318
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,257
I think I should be okay with that.

319
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,592
At least it’s you, not Aou.

320
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:06,506
That’s so true.

321
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,431
That Aou guy is such a bragger.

322
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,339
Come on. Let’s drink.

323
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:15,325
Good idea.

324
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,014
Wait! No.

325
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,465
I told you I won’t drink.

326
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,580
Don’t you deceive me.

327
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,696
Well, we always drink together.

328
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,108
Maybe next time.

329
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,026
Bye.

330
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:27,851
See you.

331
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,515
How did the rumor turn upside down?

332
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,280
Sorry. I’ve come to the wrong place.

333
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,954
This is my place.

334
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:51,439
Yayah?

335
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:56,853
Yayah, wake up.

336
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,650
How did you get here?

337
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,914
I walked here.

338
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,490
Don’t bother me. I’m sleeping.

339
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,806
Yayah, get up.

340
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:06,792
If people see us, they might get the wrong idea.

341
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,559
No. I won’t go home.

342
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,662
Yayah, get up.

343
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:10,576
No.

344
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:11,272
I won’t.

345
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:13,387
I don’t have anywhere else to go.

346
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:14,315
No.

347
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,086
Get up!

348
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,111
No!

349
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,059
- I’m not going home.
- Get up!

350
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,077
What are you guys up to?

351
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,882
An arranged marriage?

352
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,226
Yes.

353
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:40,854
He’s the son of the chief from another village.

354
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:44,881
And why don’t you like him?

355
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,497
Is he a bad guy?

356
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,178
Not like that.

357
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:50,178
We knew each other as kids.

358
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:52,630
I remember he wasn’t good-looking.

359
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:55,509
And he ate my snacks so much that his belly got fat.

360
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,530
Well, I don’t like people for their looks.

361
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,640
I like their personalities.

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,443
Hot and masculine personalities.

363
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
Just like Kuafah.

364
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,948
I should tell your dad you're here.

365
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,429
Please don’t.

366
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,795
I don’t want to get married.

367
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,746
But

368
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,890
we can’t be alone together. It can be scandalous.

369
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:21,319
Come on. Let her stay.

370
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:27,874
I just said I couldn’t be alone with her. It’s dishonoring.

371
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,406
I didn’t say you two would be alone together.

372
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,350
Thank you for letting me stay over.

373
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:48,975
Tonight only.

374
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:51,897
We will discuss this again tomorrow.

375
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,181
Yayah,

376
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,058
I have a question.

377
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:02,538
Why don’t you meet him first?

378
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,449
Maybe you two will fall in love after spending time together.

379
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:10,210
Prince, love isn’t about time.

380
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,760
We can feel it once our eyes meet.

381
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,889
Right, Kuafah?

382
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,315
I think I should sleep in the middle.

383
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:30,601
Otherwise, things might get messy.

384
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:33,650
Prince!

385
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,392
You’re such a blocker.

386
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,020
Get some rest.

387
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:40,938
As for you,

388
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:43,035
you need to work tomorrow.

389
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:14,004
(Love isn’t about time.)

390
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,536
(We can feel it once our eyes meet.)

391
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,880
I’ll tell the village chief to come fetch her here tomorrow.

392
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,455
Are we sending her home?

393
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,581
Yes.

394
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,490
Hey, Doctor.

395
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,438
Yayah disappeared.

396
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,449
Yayah disappeared?

397
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:56,490
The villagers said they saw Yayah running away from the village.

398
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:56,990
What?

399
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,056
Yayah.

400
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:00,366
Yayah.

401
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,943
We haven’t found Yayah yet?

402
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,688
We haven’t.

403
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:35,085
She might be at one of the relatives’ houses as always.

404
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,237
She should be back once she gets over it.

405
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,052
Can I help you?

406
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,092
I heard Yayah ran away.

407
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,150
She did.

408
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:54,452
She needs to get married soon so she’s making little waves.

409
00:22:54,778 --> 00:22:56,778
I don’t know what she’s afraid of.

410
00:22:56,778 --> 00:23:00,343
The groom is someone she’s known since a young age.

411
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:06,921
It might be too soon. She hasn’t prepared for that.

412
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:08,620
I think…

413
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,311
They should get to know each other more.

414
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,306
Then they can get married later.

415
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,435
We can’t do that, Teacher Prince.

416
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,364
When a man and a woman meet and don’t get married,

417
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,039
it violates our beliefs.

418
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,524
Besides, it’s our tradition.

419
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:26,360
Tradition?

420
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,431
That’s right.

421
00:23:27,946 --> 00:23:32,157
For generations, our village and their village have bonded by marriage.

422
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:36,173
Yayah’s mother is also from that village.

423
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
That’s quite reasonable.

424
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:44,392
But

425
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,997
old days have passed.

426
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:51,812
Marriage should be built on love.

427
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:54,412
That way they can live a long and happy married life.

428
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,397
Bravo.

429
00:23:57,457 --> 00:23:59,181
I agree with every word he said.

430
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:00,852
As someone who loves…

431
00:24:03,474 --> 00:24:05,292
and understands Teacher Prince,

432
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,682
I support the idea of marrying someone we love.

433
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,445
Right, Dad?

434
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,252
And someone I want to marry is…

435
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,185
Hey!!

436
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:20,494
I just realized that Teacher Prince and I need to run an errand.

437
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:23,532
Will you please excuse me?

438
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:24,796
Wait.

439
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,327
What errand?

440
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:28,567
Just go with it.

441
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,640
Follow my lead.

442
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:32,507
Goodbye.

443
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:41,732
Teacher Prince is blushing because of me.

444
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,972
So we didn’t get the conclusion because of Aou?

445
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:50,388
I’ll yell at his face.

446
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,770
You go home now and you’ll be trapped in a marriage.

447
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:56,151
Yeah, I forgot.

448
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:57,836
Go rest inside.

449
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,703
We will try to find a way out.

450
00:25:13,894 --> 00:25:16,812
Seriously, why did you lie to her?

451
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:20,266
You know we can never change the village chief’s mind.

452
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,104
What do you want me to do then?

453
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,350
Send her home?

454
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,442
Yes.

455
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:32,733
Each place has its own tradition.

456
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:37,739
Can you take responsibility if something happens to Yayah?

457
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,401
Whatever.

458
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:48,481
I’ll tell the village chief to come fetch her here tomorrow.

459
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,510
Hey, Doctor.

460
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:27,942
Yayah is gone.

461
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:30,093
No, Dao. I need five more minutes of sleep.

462
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:31,149
No!

463
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,227
Yayah disappeared.

464
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:33,397
Yayah disappeared?

465
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,227
She must have heard what we said last night and ran away.

466
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,972
It’s not safe for a girl to travel alone.

467
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,598
Let’s go find her.

468
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:45,410
Let’s search separately.

469
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,410
I’ll look at the village chief's house.

470
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,941
You look around here.

471
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,848
Yayah.

472
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:02,714
Yayah.

473
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,378
Yayah hasn't been back yet?

474
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:08,304
She hasn’t.

475
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:12,892
Aou is now searching for her in our relatives’ houses.

476
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:16,812
This daughter of mine always causes trouble.

477
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,972
Dad, I have bad news.

478
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,292
The villagers said they saw Yayah running away from the village.

479
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:22,957
What?

480
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,243
Where? Let’s go.

481
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,798
From what they said, she shouldn’t be far from here.

482
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:41,094
How about we go different ways?

483
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,080
Sounds good.

484
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,217
Yayah.

485
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,499
Yayah.

486
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:51,603
Ouch!

487
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,260
Dad. Are you okay?

488
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:55,383
Ankle sprain.

489
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:57,574
Yayah!

490
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,212
Yayah.

491
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:00,892
Yayah, stop running.

492
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:01,600
Come here.

493
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:20,386
You.

494
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:23,166
Get up.

495
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:24,361
You’re heavy.

496
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:34,365
What are you doing?

497
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:38,087
I told you not to get involved with other people’s business.

498
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:42,821
Yayah.

499
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:44,835
Are you here?

500
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,212
Yayah.

501
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:02,199
Yayah.

502
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:04,388
Are you in there?

503
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,013
Meow

504
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,693
This cat has such a high-pitched voice.

505
00:29:12,693 --> 00:29:13,953
Show yourself.

506
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,207
How did you know?

507
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:24,518
Why are you running away?

508
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,776
I don’t want to marry someone I don’t love.

509
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,706
You guys are taking me home.

510
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,472
I don’t want to.

511
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,776
I’m sorry.

512
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:38,863
I have no clue what to do.

513
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:43,572
I know you’re the only one who understands me.

514
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,133
Can I ask you a favor?

515
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:55,678
I feel sorry for her.

516
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,796
If you were her, would you do it?

517
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,372
Marrying someone you don’t love.

518
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:04,724
Enough with the word ‘Love.’

519
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,946
Love. Love. Love. Love.

520
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,852
I don’t believe in love.

521
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,907
Many couples declare their love but break up anyway.

522
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,652
Not every couple.

523
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:17,813
No, not every couple.

524
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,212
But…

525
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:25,791
People who love each other don’t always get a happy ending together.

526
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,961
Forget it.

527
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:34,975
You’re still young.

528
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,337
You won’t get it.

529
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:41,518
I do get it.

530
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:52,254
Let’s talk about this in the village.

531
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,763
It’s about to rain.

532
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:54,854
We should hurry back.

533
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,520
Why are you standing there?

534
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,372
Take me back to the village.

535
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,593
I kept running away from you.

536
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,897
I don’t remember the way back now.

537
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:18,813
What?

538
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,047
We’re here again.

539
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:49,278
What the heck?

540
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,297
I thought I walked straight.

541
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,292
How come I end up in the same place?

542
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:56,133
I think we should go left.

543
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,577
Go right.

544
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:02,652
I have a feeling we just went that way.

545
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,603
Your feeling got us here three times already.

546
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:10,547
It’s somehow my fault?

547
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:14,174
You’re the reason we ended up here.

548
00:32:14,588 --> 00:32:18,092
Who would think you’d chase me this far?

549
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:22,613
I just wanted to buy Yayah more time so she could get in Uncle Phang’s car.

550
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:24,934
Now we’re stuck in the woods.

551
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:25,829
Freakin’ unfortunate.

552
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:26,337
Hey!!

553
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,372
What?!

554
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,898
What?

555
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,798
Nothing.

556
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:34,403
I just wanted you to stop talking.

557
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,070
Have you ever got kicked by someone younger?

558
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:41,373
Bring it on.

559
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,125
Shit!

560
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:48,618
I didn’t do that.

561
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,055
I know.

562
00:32:52,528 --> 00:32:54,528
Must have been the wind.

563
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:01,812
Keep walking.

564
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,404
I think we’re nearly there.

565
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:16,015
If we turned right as you said, we’d be nowhere.

566
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:17,419
Shut it.

567
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:21,978
Wee-ah.

568
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,338
What are you doing in the woods?

569
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,275
It’s not the woods. This is just behind the school.

570
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,212
What?

571
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:29,852
Behind the school?

572
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:32,641
That means we’re close to the village, aren’t we?

573
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,481
By the way…

574
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,958
Are you picking up flowers for girls?

575
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,560
No.

576
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,207
These are wedding decorations.

577
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:44,468
Wedding?

578
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,132
Whose wedding?

579
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,092
Yayah’s wedding.

580
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:50,908
She finally agrees to the marriage.

581
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:51,593
What?

582
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:58,589
I wish you a long happy relationship together.

583
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,877
Grow your family with lots of children.

584
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:02,168
Seems like someone is in pain.

585
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:05,141
I guess being in a wedding just triggered his misery.

586
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:07,474
Is it wrong that I don’t love myself?

587
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:10,313
Since I already gave her all my love.

588
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,793
Did you meet your future husband?

589
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,663
I did.

590
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,999
He paid a visit to the village and we accidentally met.

591
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,675
And why do you agree to marry him now?

592
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:56,703
After we talked, I knew right away he’s a good man.

593
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,398
Unlike before.

594
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,456
Yeah?

595
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:01,595
How?

596
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:05,216
His personalities are handsome and masculine.

597
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,980
He’s such a sweet talker too.

598
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,924
The second I looked into his eyes, I fell hard.

599
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,473
I’m so blushing.

600
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:19,715
Those things don’t sound like personalities but congratulations, Yayah.

601
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:24,423
From now on, Dr. Kuafah is free.

602
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,663
You can date Teacher Prince. I don’t mind.

603
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,521
Wait.

604
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:31,555
Did you say date, Yayah?

605
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:36,451
Rumor has it you two are dating.

606
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:37,926
No.

607
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:39,263
That’s nonsense.

608
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:43,635
They say you two are getting married in April.

609
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,414
That’s absurd, Yayah.

610
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:49,026
Hey, help me.

611
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,543
Stay cool.

612
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:56,144
They will find out eventually what’s true and what’s not.

613
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:57,424
Why?

614
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:59,303
You want it to be true?

615
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,643
Come on!

616
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,911
To be honest, you look kind of cute in a sarong.

617
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,756
That’s right.

618
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,682
I wish you a long happy relationship together.

619
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:29,691
Grow your family with lots of children.

620
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:36,244
Love and take care of her.

621
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,772
You have a husband now. Please behave.

622
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,290
Take good care of each other.

623
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,077
Love and cherish each other.

624
00:36:55,077 --> 00:36:57,092
Learn to forgive when needed.

625
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:12,909
Welcome all of you to Buai and May’s wedding.

626
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:17,474
I have a question for both the groom and the bride.

627
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:25,974
What I like the most about May is her cuteness, delicacy,

628
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:29,145
and consistency.

629
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,430
Seems like someone is in pain.

630
00:37:42,853 --> 00:37:45,794
I guess being in a wedding just triggered his misery.

631
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,108
Whatever. Just shut up.

632
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:51,346
Let’s just drink.

633
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,525
You didn't learn the lesson, did you?

634
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:56,970
But we’re safe here.

635
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,823
We don’t drive.

636
00:37:58,961 --> 00:37:59,833
Don’t be shy.

637
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,698
Cheers.

638
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:02,749
Cheers.

639
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:05,851
Get drunk all you want.

640
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:17,831
♪ Where could I move on to? ♪

641
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:25,527
♪ My heart is set on you ♪

642
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,182
Why did you bring me home?

643
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:36,055
I want to drink with JJ and Mesa.

644
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
They both passed out.

645
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:41,222
They got carried home already.

646
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:43,592
Passed out?

647
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:46,101
Those two lightweights.

648
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:48,002
Losers.

649
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:51,578
Lo-sers!

650
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:54,924
Before calling them names, you should see yourself.

651
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:56,461
Why?

652
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:58,503
What’s wrong with me?

653
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,338
I’m this way.

654
00:39:01,577 --> 00:39:03,577
What’s wrong with me?

655
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:06,798
I’m still cool.

656
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:08,187
I…

657
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:23,679
How did I get here?

658
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:28,504
Your bed is a mess because you threw up on it.

659
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:30,557
So I brought you here.

660
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:34,288
If you don’t like it here, you can go to your friends’.

661
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,159
No. I’m too lazy.

662
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,906
I don’t want to nestle with them.

663
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:42,548
Here.

664
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:05,401
Why did you need to drink so much?

665
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,762
Are you in love with Yayah or what?

666
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:09,995
No.

667
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:13,606
I was just thinking about my ex.

668
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:20,470
Your friends told me about that.

669
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,532
You went to her wedding.

670
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,565
Yeah.

671
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:28,597
How dumb, right?

672
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:31,227
No.

673
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:34,796
At first,

674
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:38,263
I wanted to congratulate her.

675
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,654
Gave her a smile because she has someone good in life.

676
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:50,934
But I couldn’t get over her.

677
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:55,522
May, do you remember the day we broke up?

678
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:01,249
Yes.

679
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:07,343
You asked me if I still needed you.

680
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:12,388
What if I say I still do?

681
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:16,200
You don’t need me, Fah.

682
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,737
You just don’t want to lose me.

683
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:27,253
Can I ask you a question?

684
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:29,433
Why are you marrying Buai?

685
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:31,473
When we were in school,

686
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,152
he was a burden to you.

687
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:36,752
He never worked on anything himself.

688
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,153
You were always the one helping him.

689
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:43,263
How is he better than me?

690
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,100
You’re right.

691
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:48,708
He’s not as good-looking as you are.

692
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,774
He’s not as smart as you are.

693
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,741
He’s not as rich as you are.

694
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,066
Then…

695
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,558
Why?

696
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:02,369
Because Buai can’t live without me.

697
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:05,809
But you can just fine, Fah.

698
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,724
After hearing the answer,

699
00:42:13,654 --> 00:42:15,126
I was sent to repent my sins here.

700
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:25,427
Is it wrong to be smart?

701
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:31,291
Is it wrong to focus so much on building a life that I didn’t have time for her?

702
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,303
Is it wrong that I don’t love myself?

703
00:42:37,573 --> 00:42:41,823
Since I already gave her all my love.

704
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:23,862
You will get better.

705
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,448
Abracadabra, I wish all your pain turns into butterflies and flies away.

706
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,511
This feeling is priceless.

707
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:33,730
I just want to feel it and hang on to it for as long as I can.

Dao, I can go see you on your birthday this year.

710
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:03,344
These are the presents I gave my brother for his previous birthdays.

711
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:05,567
Why don’t you try to make something by hand?

712
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,871
Can you try it on for me?

713
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,858
You and my brother are around the same size.

714
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:12,863
Fah normally has girls over.

715
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:16,065
But tonight, he only drank. He didn’t bring any girl home.

716
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:18,907
He’s become a different person after he came back from the mountain.

717
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:20,938
Hey!

718
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:22,522
I have news for you.

719
00:45:22,522 --> 00:45:23,587
Teacher Prince is sick.
