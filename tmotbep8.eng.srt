1
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,840
I never thought you would be such a liar.

2
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Can I believe anything you've said?

3
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,319
If you can't answer it,

4
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,879
why bother thinking about
impossible questions like that?

5
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,479
You should think about the question
that you can answer.

6
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,599
Do you still want Tofu in your life?

7
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,159
I promised Nut

8
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,280
that I would take care of her.

9
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,039
Even if he's still mad at me,

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,639
I need to keep my promise.

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,199
True love.

12
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,120
…Even though my identity

13
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,639
might not seem so trustworthy.

14
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,159
But everything I've done for you

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,919
has always been sincere.

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Kuenchai.

17
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,199
Hey.

18
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,319
Good morning.

19
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm back.

20
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,039
Is it really you, Tofu?

21
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,319
You won't leave again, will you?

22
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,800
Stay here from now on.

23
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,439
If Nut still wants me,

24
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,240
I won't go anywhere.

25
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,960
Fine.

26
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,919
I won't send you away.

27
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,439
You might as well stay forever.

28
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Are you serious?

29
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,919
Yes.

30
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,240
I'm leaving, Mom.

31
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,120
Okay.

32
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,560
Nut.

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
Nut.

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
You forgot your lunchbox.

35
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,800
Thank you.

36
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,360
Enjoy the food.

37
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,199
Were you in Chiang Mai or the forest?

38
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,000
How do you not know anything?

39
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,279
You lost out.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,600
I was occupied with Tarn.

41
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
Then I saw it on Facebook,

42
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,879
Tofu's post saying he missed Nut.

43
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,319
Gen.

44
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:20,800
Are Nut and Tofu…

45
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,839
Prib, look over there.

46
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,959
It's written all over his face.

47
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,360
You said that when you come back,
you would claim what's yours.

48
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,199
It's too late. Give it up.

49
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,560
Did I make a mistake stepping away?

50
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,920
Nut, come here.

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,199
I knew it.

52
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,399
-What is it?
-All smiles, aren't you?

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,720
That's right. So what?

54
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,600
The other day you were so upset.

55
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,800
But today, you're smiling like a lunatic.

56
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,120
If I were to guess,

57
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,879
I would say

58
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,920
you've settled things with Tofu.

59
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,199
Yes. We talked.

60
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,199
You sorted it all out?

61
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

62
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,399
You picked him up from Song's.

63
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,399
How did you know I had picked him up?

64
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,399
Now, it's my turn. What about you?

65
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,319
You two chat often, right?

66
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,720
Not really.

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,759
Just every night?

68
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Hold on. I'm not done with my questions.

69
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,279
Don't try to change the subject.

70
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,759
You're a sly fox.

71
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey Nut. Come back here.

72
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,040
We were talking about you. Come back.

73
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,519
How is everyone?

74
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,480
I missed everyone a lot.

75
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,240
You leave home only one night, Beary.

76
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,600
Don't overdo it.

77
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,360
Missing your dual-language complaints
for just one day

78
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,199
made me feel lonely.

79
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:49,439
Don't be sarcastic.

80
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,360
Be nice, everyone. Tofu just got back.

81
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,199
But my Little One has disappeared.

82
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,639
It's all your fault.

83
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,160
Now, you have the nerve
to behave like this.

84
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,079
You're just like
all the other humans in this country.

85
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,399
Sweeping problems under the rug.

86
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,839
Wow. You're angry about your girl,
but you can still preach your politics.

87
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,319
I really respect you.

88
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,279
Items like you, that represent
middle-class wealth,

89
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,959
surely have no idea
that ideology is driven by anger.

90
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,120
I'm sick of listening to you droning on
about the class gap or whatever.

91
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
Instead of mocking me,

92
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,720
why don't you use the time
to educate yourself?

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
This house is just a bubble.

94
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,519
You're so used to being oppressed

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,639
that you're afraid of asking questions
or voicing your views.

96
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,279
All you do is act fierce

97
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,000
and mix Thai and English words
to hide your fear.

98
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,960
Everyone, please calm down.

99
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,440
It's my fault.

100
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,799
I apologize.

101
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,720
I promise you

102
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
that I'll bring back Ms. Left Slipper.

103
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,840
Your promise means nothing.

104
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,240
It's in your upper-class blood
to use people then discard them.

105
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,200
What more do you want?
Tofu is trying his best.

106
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,799
You knew it was an accident.

107
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,000
Your girl volunteered,
meaning that she willingly took the risk.

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
You can't keep blaming him

109
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,840
and ordering him around
like you do with her.

110
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,759
When have I ever made her do anything?

111
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,519
She likes watching dramas,

112
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,879
but you force her
to watch documentaries with you.

113
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,159
Have you ever asked her if she wants to?

114
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,000
You claim you want democracy.

115
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,879
What kind of democracy
won't accept different opinions.

116
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,360
The patriarchy.

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
A societal system dominated by males.

118
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,279
Prib?

119
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,240
You made Nut fried pork for lunch, right?

120
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
Yes. I made it myself.

121
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,759
I knew it.

122
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,519
Normally, Nut doesn't eat
from his lunchbox.

123
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,679
If you didn't make it,
who else could it be?

124
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,759
Can I ask you one more time?

125
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,279
Do you like Nut?

126
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,039
I like him.

127
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,159
I want him to be
more than just a boyfriend.

128
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
I want him as my owner.

129
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,159
I want him as my boss.

130
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,879
I want him as my family.

131
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
As my everything.

132
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,200
That's enough.

133
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,080
I get it.

134
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,759
Can I ask you one more question?

135
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,919
Do you know what Nut wants
for his birthday?

136
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,159
I once read Mrs. Na's book,
The Little Prince.

137
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,799
I remember this one section

138
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,759
where the fox tells Little Prince

139
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,879
that every Thursday,

140
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,240
the hunters have a dance ritual
with the village girls,

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,960
which allows the fox
to take a stroll in the vineyard.

142
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,679
Thursday

143
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,159
is thus a special day.

144
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,480
If the hunters could dance on any day,

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,559
Thursday will not hold
any special meaning.

146
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,720
I understand now

147
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,279
why humans value special days.

148
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,159
Since there's no certainty in this world,

149
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,000
relationships may change any day.

150
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,480
On our special day,

151
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,600
we deserve happiness

152
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,000
to make it more special than other days,

153
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,279
don't you think?

154
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,759
You hired someone to follow me.

155
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you mean.

156
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,799
Don't act all innocent.

157
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,320
That guy Chut confessed to me.

158
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,279
You've had him follow me
since we separated.

159
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,279
Are you a psychopath?

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,600
Why are you doing this?

161
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,559
Because I am your wife.

162
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,759
The wife you don't live with

163
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
and never share anything with.

164
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,600
If I didn't have someone follow you,
how would I know what's going on?

165
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,919
I'm no psychopath.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
I'm doing this because I care about you.

167
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,960
You care about me?

168
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,240
You only care about yourself.

169
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
You're afraid of losing face,
and being humiliated.

170
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,799
You were afraid I was going to see Na.

171
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,519
So afraid that you bought a house
next to hers.

172
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,279
Even though I keep insisting
that Na and I are over,

173
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,080
you can't help but be paranoid.

174
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,440
How can it be over
when she's the only one you've ever loved?

175
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,559
When we married,
you were in love with her.

176
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,399
When you were with me,
you thought about her.

177
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,240
When you weren't with me,
you went to see her.

178
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
I'm no psychopath.

179
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,159
I'm doing all this

180
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,279
because I love you.

181
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Do you hear me? I love you!

182
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,759
But I don't love you.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720
I married you
because your father pressured me,

184
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,799
and you were the only woman
I was close to.

185
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,639
If I had known
everything was just a scheme,

186
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,960
if I had been more assertive
with you back then,

187
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,840
I wouldn't have been stuck
with a woman I don't love.

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,879
I know that you don't love me.

189
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
You want to go back to her.

190
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,240
I won't let you.
I won't agree to a divorce.

191
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,399
If I can't be happy, then no one will be.

192
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,399
Where are you going? What are you doing?

193
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,960
Let go of me. Let go.

194
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,840
Let go!

195
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,960
How many times have I told you
not to jump up at the table?

196
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,320
Do you not understand?

197
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,759
Have I already given you food?

198
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
Na!

199
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,559
What's the matter?

200
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,879
Look at this!

201
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,279
Look!

202
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,000
Look at it.

203
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,279
Look at it.

204
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,840
Look at it and get it into your thick head

205
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,480
that the guy you think is your husband
is actually my husband.

206
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,200
Do you hear me? He is my husband!

207
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,600
-Jan!
-Look!

208
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,879
-You!
-Jan!

209
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,639
Take a look! These are our wedding photos.

210
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,559
Saen is my husband!

211
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,440
Sibmeun was yours,

212
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,559
and he's dead!

213
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,320
He left a dysfunctional family.

214
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,759
The mother is crazy and the son is gay!

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,240
Mrs. Na.

216
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,840
You act like a victim
who was driven to madness.

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,039
You used your suffering
to make people feel sorry for you

218
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,039
when you made the wrong choice yourself.

219
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,519
You agreed to marry him!

220
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
You were the one who left Saen!

221
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,519
Did you hear that? You left Saen!

222
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,879
Did you hear that?

223
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,120
In the end,

224
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,200
the one who everyone thought was an angel
only cares about herself.

225
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,600
You chose stability over the person
who was devoted to you!

226
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,279
You're just as selfish as me!

227
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,919
Let go of me!

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let go.

229
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,799
Get off her.

230
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,639
Stop fooling yourself!
It's time you accepted the truth!

231
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,039
Do you hear me? Stop fooling yourself!

232
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,519
He is my husband!

233
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,559
He is my husband! Do you hear me?

234
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,320
-Na.
-Do you?

235
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,079
I want to know

236
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,960
why you and Mom didn't get married.

237
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,519
I should…

238
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,880
You probably know

239
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,880
that your mom and I were once in love.

240
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,759
However, our relationship changed
after Jan came along.

241
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,880
You want a loan from my father?

242
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes.

243
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,519
Na's grandmother is seriously ill.

244
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,920
Her treatment is expensive.

245
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I would like to help her.

246
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,680
I envy Na.

247
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,799
She is really lucky to have a guy
who loves her so much.

248
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Seeing as you've helped me so much,

249
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I'll talk to my father for you.

250
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,400
Really?

251
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,119
Thank you so much.

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
No problem.

253
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,599
I know that you need money.

254
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
But this is a lot.

255
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,759
It's not a problem.

256
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,359
Please accept it.
I sincerely want to help.

257
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Here.

258
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,839
Thank you.

259
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
Try turning it on.

260
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,200
At first, Jan was just my boss,
my colleague.

261
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,720
Once I owed her money,

262
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,279
things started to get worse.

263
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,279
I'm not coming back to Bangkok
this weekend.

264
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,440
Again?

265
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,160
But it's my birthday this Saturday.

266
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,200
Saen?

267
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,599
Saen?

268
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,240
Did you get cut off?

269
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,000
Saen is in a meeting.

270
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,039
Do you have a message for him?

271
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,640
Please let it be about work only, though,

272
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,759
because he's working right now.

273
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,039
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,519
I'll call again later.

275
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,279
Kwan said she might be late

276
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,440
and that we should go ahead and order.

277
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,279
Why didn't you tell me?
We didn't have to come so early.

278
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,240
It's no big deal.

279
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,880
Since we had to go out anyway,
we should get something to eat.

280
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,119
Why don't you order?

281
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,240
This dish is really delicious.

282
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,519
What would you like?

283
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
Here are their recommended dishes.

284
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,359
Isn't that Na and Sib?

285
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,519
They seem close.

286
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,559
I guess it's not that surprising though.

287
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,039
He's your twin brother.

288
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,799
He probably just helps in taking care
of his busy brother's girlfriend.

289
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,799
How nice of him.

290
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,400
Your mom and I

291
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,119
almost got married.

292
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,599
Here's what I owe you.

293
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,920
This is the first installment.

294
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,880
I'll pay you back

295
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,119
all the money you loaned me.

296
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,200
But I wanted you to have this money.

297
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,680
I don't want it back.

298
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,480
But I must repay you.

299
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,960
Thank you…

300
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,599
for the trouble you went to.

301
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,599
You must be sick of helping me.

302
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,680
You won't have to anymore.

303
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,680
I'm returning this to you.

304
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,039
What do you mean?

305
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,480
It's Sibmeun, isn't it?

306
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,160
It has nothing to do with him.

307
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,160
I made this decision on my own.

308
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,240
The other night,
Grandma's condition got worse.

309
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,359
Sibmeun promised her
he would take care of me.

310
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
And I think it makes sense.

311
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,160
We're getting married,
so Grandma won't have to worry.

312
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,640
Here he is.

313
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,759
Please excuse me.

314
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,359
Bye.

315
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,599
I wasn't going to give in that easily.

316
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:39,200
I asked your mom for another chance.

317
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,279
Jan.

318
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
Hey.

319
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,960
-Are you okay?
-Ouch.

320
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,640
Let's go to the hospital.

321
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,079
However, fate wasn't on my side.

322
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,599
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

323
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,759
Three years after their wedding,

324
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,920
I married Jan.

325
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,880
It was the worst decision I ever made.

326
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,240
Are you all right?

327
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,440
I don't understand my mom.

328
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,039
Why did she make that decision?

329
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,319
I think there must be more to the story.

330
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,559
Everyone has their own reasons.

331
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,720
If one could choose,

332
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,599
no one would choose heartache.

333
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,759
In fact,

334
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,920
when your mom
got admitted to the hospital,

335
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
there was more to it.

336
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,839
I saw that she has been dumping the pills.

337
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,759
So I…

338
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,079
started mixing the pills with apple juice
and gave it to her.

339
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,359
I think her memory was getting better.

340
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,559
Then Jan tried to make her remember.

341
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,200
As she started to remember,

342
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,519
she must have struggled with it

343
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
and ended up this way.

344
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,519
I'm sorry.

345
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,039
If you're angry with me, you can hit me.

346
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:54,880
I don't mind.

347
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,720
How could I hit you?

348
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,640
You did it

349
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,920
because you want the best for me

350
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,240
and my mother.

351
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,160
Thank you

352
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,920
for staying by my side through all this.

353
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,119
I'm glad to have you.

354
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,799
Likewise. I'm glad…

355
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,559
to be here for you.

356
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,839
Get home safely.

357
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,720
Make sure to lock up

358
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,799
and feed Kuenchai.

359
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,119
I will.

360
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,839
Didn't I once say there's nothing good
about being human?

361
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,599
I'm taking back what I said.

362
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,599
Being someone who can hug Nut

363
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,200
and hold his hand

364
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,799
is amazing.

365
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm sorry I put the medicine
in your drink.

366
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,319
The meds must have affected you.

367
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,839
But I only did it

368
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,519
because I want you to get better.

369
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,200
I want you to be happy.

370
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,599
I'm the one

371
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,680
who should apologize
for making everyone worry.

372
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,319
What you said is right.

373
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,680
The path to happiness
might start with a nightmare.

374
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,119
But we have to wake up eventually.

375
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,920
We might miss a person who's far away,

376
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,720
but we shouldn't overlook
the people close to us.

377
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,599
In the past,

378
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,200
I kept avoiding reality.

379
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
I was selfish.

380
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,279
Until yesterday.

381
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,599
I came to realize

382
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,799
that my family's happiness
is more important than anything else.

383
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,519
Bad memories might cause suffering,

384
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,960
but they make us realize
we are still alive.

385
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,880
And I want to keep on living.

386
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,119
I think

387
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,400
it's time I wake up from the nightmare

388
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,759
for the people I love.

389
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,799
I've already settled the bill, Mom.

390
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,240
Let's go home.

391
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,119
There's somewhere I want to go.

392
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,920
Can you take me there?

393
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,160
Don't worry about your mom.

394
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,359
She's strong enough to face the truth now.

395
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,240
It might be difficult and intimidating,

396
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,799
but now is the time.

397
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,840
If Na has to keep waiting,

398
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,199
when will she ever find happiness?

399
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,719
Hello.

400
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,159
It's me, Saen.

401
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,440
I'll pick you up at your house.
The usual time.

402
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,079
Okay. See you then.

403
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,159
I bet he's not coming.

404
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,880
He never keeps his word.

405
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,639
He might be tied up at work.

406
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,440
Work or something else?

407
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
You don't know, do you?

408
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,519
The money Saen gave you
for your grandmother's treatment

409
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,920
was a loan from that woman named Jan.

410
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,440
What did you say?

411
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,760
He took out a loan without asking you.

412
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,719
You could see it as
an act of love and protection.

413
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,119
But if you think about it,

414
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,079
how close must they be

415
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,199
for that woman to loan Saen so much money?

416
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,679
It's not too late for you
to change your mind.

417
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,880
There's someone who loves you
just as much as Saen.

418
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
Sib has always been there for you.

419
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,559
His career is stable
and has a clear path forward.

420
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,719
When he gets old and retires,
he'll receive government pension.

421
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,400
If you marry Sib, you won't regret it.

422
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Don't worry about me.

423
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,159
I promise I'll take good care of myself.

424
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:07,800
Na,

425
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,599
you are a woman.

426
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,239
You will have to get married one day.

427
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,599
That way your life will be fulfilled.

428
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,280
You shouldn't be alone.

429
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,119
Who would help protect you then?

430
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,639
People

431
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,079
will talk about you behind your back

432
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,920
saying you couldn't find a good man
to be your husband.

433
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,679
I want to see you happy.

434
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,960
Love someone who loves you.

435
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,599
Trust me.

436
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,800
Thank you…

437
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,800
for the trouble you went to.

438
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,719
You paid my mortgage

439
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,920
and my grandmother's medical bills.

440
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,400
You must be sick of helping me.

441
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,079
You won't have to anymore.

442
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm returning this to you.

443
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,559
I'm doing all this because I love you.

444
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,280
Do you hear me? I love you!

445
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,320
I married you
because your father pressured me,

446
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,400
and you were the only woman
I was close to.

447
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,239
If I had known
everything was just a scheme,

448
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,559
if I had been more assertive
with you back then,

449
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,559
I wouldn't have been stuck
with a woman I don't love.

450
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,360
Thank you.

451
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,880
I never thought that you would miss
an important appointment for me.

452
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,599
You knew?

453
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,880
Yes, I knew.

454
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,960
That's why I did this.

455
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,639
Jan.

456
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,559
Na and Sib are happy now.

457
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,519
You should accept
that you can't make her happy.

458
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,639
You put yourself in this predicament.

459
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,920
Sib actually knows you very well.
I guess it's a twin thing.

460
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,079
Since when?

461
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,599
How long have you and Sib been scheming?

462
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,800
It doesn't matter how long.
It would always lead to this anyway.

463
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,079
Why are you doing this?

464
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,239
I merely presented the opportunity.
You took it yourself.

465
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,480
You were prepared to take on debt
just to beat your brother.

466
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,400
You gave Sib the chance
of winning Na's heart.

467
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,920
You must have thought
that what you did would win her heart.

468
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,440
But you didn't realize

469
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,199
you can't buy love like that.

470
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,280
What you said is right.

471
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,960
Your money can't buy my love either.

472
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,920
I might not be a big shot
who can take out a big loan for you,

473
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,440
but as a soldier, I have a stable career
that will ensure a comfortable life.

474
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,599
I love you, Na.

475
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,119
You won't regret it.

476
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,639
Give me a chance to take care of you
for the rest of your life.

477
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,760
Here we go.

478
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,400
You're ready.

479
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
There.

480
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Done.

481
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,800
Hello, boy.

482
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,920
Come here.

483
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:11,400
Quiet.

484
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,880
Did you think you could run away?

485
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,159
Don't.

486
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,280
Please.

487
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,639
Nut! Open up!

488
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,079
Open up!

489
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:35,639
Nut, open up!

490
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,480
How dare you raise your voice at me.

491
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,719
How dare you raise your voice
at your own dad.

492
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,960
Nut!

493
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,800
A little pervert like you
will never achieve anything.

494
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,719
It's my fault.

495
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:32,360
If I wasn't indecisive,

496
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,719
if I had been firm

497
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,599
and not easily swayed by others,

498
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,159
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

499
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,519
If I had thought it through,

500
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:51,639
things would have turned out better.

501
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,639
Be careful.

502
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:33,719
Mrs. Na.

503
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,840
Nut.

504
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,599
Nut.

505
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,320
Are you okay?

506
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:48,880
I'm just tired.

507
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,960
Your mom is regaining her memory.

508
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,760
Things will get better soon.

509
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,360
What will get better?

510
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,480
I think your mom must have loved your dad,

511
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,639
or she wouldn't have chosen to marry him.

512
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,599
When he died,

513
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,199
it must have been a huge blow.

514
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,559
If he were still alive,

515
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,199
I'm sure she would be happier.

516
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:31,679
You know nothing.

517
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:34,119
If that's what upset her,

518
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,679
why is it Uncle Saen that she misses?

519
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:38,880
She should miss Dad.

520
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,639
Nut.

521
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,960
She chose the path

522
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,239
that everyone thought was right.

523
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:54,679
Maybe it was just the safest.

524
00:48:57,719 --> 00:48:59,000
Mom chose Dad

525
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,119
as a substitute for Uncle Saen.

526
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,920
She didn't really love him.

527
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:09,199
I'm just a product of their mistake.

528
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,519
Love should make people happy.

529
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,239
Why, then, is everyone so sad?

530
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,320
Whichever path you choose,

531
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,320
someone would always be disappointed.

532
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,880
If disappointment is inevitable,

533
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,599
why do humans seek love?

534
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,840
You still don't know humans that well.

535
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,199
You've learned about humans
based on theory

536
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
and from your experience here.

537
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
There's still much more you need to learn

538
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,320
about humans and love.

539
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,519
Love between humans is complicated,
just like humans themselves.

540
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,559
Humans are even more complicated.

541
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,159
It's not just about love.

542
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:53,679
There are other things
you might not even think of.

543
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,239
Some people appear pitiful,

544
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,159
but they are really terrifying.

545
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:00,239
Some people might seem decent,

546
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,800
but they may not necessarily be
good people.

547
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,480
Aren't you going to help at all?

548
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:02,320
Why should I help?

549
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,880
You don't need help
pouring alcohol down your throat.

550
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,079
If you just came to lecture me, get lost.

551
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:08,320
Leave.

552
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,159
I want to know about the guy
you hired to follow me.

553
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,519
He has been following me for a while.

554
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,920
You know what happened that day, right?

555
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,360
Are you admitting you went there that day?

556
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:37,719
You wanted to get rid of him,
just like I did.

557
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,400
We're in the same boat here.

558
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,280
Do you still plan to abandon me?

559
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:07,639
Stay out of this.

560
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:09,800
Also, tell your guy to stop following me.

561
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,679
You wanted to get rid of him,
just like I did.

562
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,679
Please, Tarn. I don't want anything
to happen to you.

563
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,639
Are you threatening me?

564
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,079
I'm just trying to warn you.

565
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,400
Stop trying.

566
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,159
I won't back down.

567
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,760
What do you hope to gain?

568
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:42,760
You know full well
that you don't have enough influence.

569
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,000
It's not going to bring about any change.

570
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:47,039
Things might not change today,

571
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,760
but they will in the future.

572
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:51,400
Time is on our side.

573
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,599
We have time to win, to fight, to lose.

574
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,360
Winning might take time,

575
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,000
but that day will come.

576
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:01,719
But power is on their side.

577
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,880
We have to get that power on our side.

578
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,199
The people should have the power,

579
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,880
so that problems can be solved.

580
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,079
Am I supposed to give up
and be a coward like you?

581
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,760
Should I give in to power,
abandon my principles,

582
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:19,320
and behave immorally like you?

583
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,360
-I can't do it.
-Tarn!

584
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,119
What is it, Lieutenant?

585
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,039
I searched the house
and the surrounding area.

586
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,639
I didn't find any weapons.

587
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,440
We checked the car again,

588
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,159
but we didn't find
the perpetrator's blood or fingerprints.

589
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,480
This means

590
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,639
that we have no other suspects.

591
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:26,119
All the evidence we have
points to Saen as the perpetrator.

592
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,840
The wife

593
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,039
might have hired someone to use
Tarn's grandfather as a diversion.

594
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,840
It's my fault.

595
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,119
If I wasn't indecisive,

596
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,440
if I had been firm

597
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,639
and not easily swayed by others,

598
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,320
I wouldn't have made the wrong choice.

599
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:17,079
If I had thought it through,

600
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:20,519
things would have turned out better.

601
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:25,800
Mom chose Dad because she saw him
as a substitute for Uncle Saen.

602
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,480
She didn't really love him.

603
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:32,559
I'm just a product of their mistake.

604
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Nut.

605
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,159
Yes?

606
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:51,119
What?

607
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Why did you come in?

608
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,400
I brought you coffee.

609
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:05,840
Did you get your phone fixed?

610
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,000
I did.

611
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:17,800
What's on your mind?

612
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm working.

613
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,800
Working or daydreaming?
You were in a trance.

614
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:28,159
My brain is not working.

615
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:31,559
Shall I give you a massage?

616
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:33,119
It might help.

617
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,239
What does a massage have to do with this?

618
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,760
I can't focus with you massaging me.

619
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,480
Let me help you.

620
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:16,079
Focus, Nut.

621
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,679
When you're so close,

622
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,119
I can't focus.

623
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,440
I'm sorry.

624
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,199
I'll go then.

625
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,480
If you go, I'll still be stuck.

626
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,480
What should I do then?

627
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,079
You made me lose my focus.

628
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,280
You must take responsibility.

629
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,519
No problem.

630
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,320
I know what to do.

631
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,440
-Hurry up.
-But why?

632
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,519
Is this taking responsibility?

633
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,760
They say running is good for dogs.

634
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,480
But I'm not a dog.

635
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,599
-Come on.
-Damn it.

636
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,719
Humans are the same.

637
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,719
All you do is work.

638
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,039
How can you have energy
if you sit inside all day?

639
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,840
I guarantee running a few laps
will kick your brain into gear.

640
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,280
I am busy.

641
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,639
But…

642
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:39,599
you're getting fat.

643
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,239
Your butt is big.

644
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,199
Your thighs are big.

645
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,480
You're getting a belly.

646
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:49,119
Come on. Don't complain.

647
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,000
Give me a sec.

648
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,760
See?

649
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:58,760
You're busy now.

650
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,239
I'm busy, Song.

651
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,199
I'm tending to Nut's heart at the moment.

652
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,079
Is it that serious?

653
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:09,880
If you're busy, you're busy.
Speak to you later.

654
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:13,440
Who's busy, son?

655
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:16,679
Dad.

656
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,159
Do I really have to run?

657
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:23,719
Two laps will be fine.

658
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,960
I'll do one.

659
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,679
How about three and a half?

660
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:30,960
Come on.

661
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,000
Hurry up, Nut.

662
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,599
-I'm already tired.
-We are only just starting.

663
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,239
I'm catching up.

664
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:46,800
Hurry up, Nut.

665
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:50,639
How come you're so fit?

666
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:54,199
That's obvious. Since I turned human,
I've been running regularly.

667
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,360
What?

668
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:57,199
What I meant to say was,

669
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,679
since we got to know each other.

670
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,599
Don't you remember we had a chase
the first time we met?

671
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,400
Did you bring me out to reminisce?

672
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,639
I'm giving you a second shot.

673
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:09,559
I wonder if you'll lose again today?

674
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:11,639
I won't lose to you today.

675
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,000
I'm sorry, Song. I really am busy.

676
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,159
It's important to look after
your loved ones' hearts.

677
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:27,039
Right now,

678
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:30,519
I think Nut is in desperate need
of someone to look after him.

679
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:31,880
Kuenchai.

680
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,639
What are you training for?

681
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,039
Next week,
we're shooting a basketball scene.

682
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,800
That's why I called Tofu
to practice with me, but he's busy.

683
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,039
Speaking of Tofu,

684
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,159
we barely had a chance to talk

685
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,679
before Nut came to pick him up.

686
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
It's a shame.

687
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,079
He had to go home, Dad.

688
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,239
Why, do you miss him?

689
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,840
What?

690
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,679
Between Tofu and me, who do you miss more?

691
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,920
You, of course.

692
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,679
What's up?
You're acting like a neglected puppy.

693
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:09,159
I don't know. You just seem
more interested in other people's lives.

694
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:12,440
What part of your life
don't I take an interest in?

695
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,320
There's a lot.

696
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,440
You don't remember the food I like.

697
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:19,000
You don't even remember my birthday.

698
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,840
I wasn't the one who gave birth to you.

699
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,360
But you always remember Neung's birthday.

700
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,840
Even after he passed away,
you still remember.

701
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:44,840
Thanks for offering to train with me, Dad,

702
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,159
but I forgot I arranged to meet a friend.

703
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:48,800
I better get going.

704
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,800
What's wrong with you?

705
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,840
When I called, you sounded upset.

706
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,159
Did you trick me into watching you play?

707
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:29,519
You're quick. Not bad.

708
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,760
I didn't ask you to come just to watch.

709
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,599
Will you help me with my lines?

710
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,280
What lines?

711
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,920
A proposal.

712
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,639
I have to play basketball

713
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,000
and pour my heart out at the same time.

714
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,199
What about this? If I score,
you agree to be my boyfriend?

715
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:13,400
I'm not playing.

716
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,840
Don't fool me. I've read the script.

717
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,119
There's no such scene.

718
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,960
What about this, if you can't score,
you have to be my boyfriend?

719
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:30,639
Fine. Remember, this is your challenge.

720
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
How was that?

721
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,000
That's that.

722
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,400
How come you're so good?

723
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
Damn.

724
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,480
Are you okay?

725
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:28,840
Song,

726
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
take this.

727
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,760
Thank you.

728
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,320
Aren't you going to ask anything?

729
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,639
Are you not worried about me?

730
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:59,320
Tell me if you want to.
If you don't want to, don't tell me.

731
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,360
I'll just sit here, okay?

732
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,159
It's just tiring

733
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,360
when you try your best to please someone,

734
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,119
but they don't even notice.

735
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,320
So now you're sulking, are you?

736
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:25,360
Look at you.

737
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,760
You may seem like an adult,
but you are not really one.

738
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,880
What? I am an adult.
I'm not a kid anymore.

739
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,719
I'm also very good at making money.

740
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,239
I know that.

741
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,480
I've seen you running yourself
into the ground

742
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,159
trying to make that someone proud of you.

743
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,519
There might be a reason
they haven't noticed.

744
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,840
If you want them to notice you,

745
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,199
why don't you say something?

746
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,440
Just tell them. It's not that hard.

747
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,400
What are you doing?

748
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,440
Come on.

749
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:12,559
Just let me recharge for five minutes.

750
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,119
Fine.

751
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,119
Anything over five minutes,
I'll charge you.

752
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,960
Aren't you stingy?

753
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,199
It's fine. I'll pay.

754
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,199
I don't remember

755
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:44,480
the last time I came running here.

756
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,960
Let's come again sometime.

757
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:53,000
When I'm not busy.

758
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,559
Where's Kuenchai?

759
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,720
Kuenchai.

760
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,119
Kuenchai.

761
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:27,239
Kuenchai.

762
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,760
Hey.

763
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,800
I'm sorry for letting him loose.

764
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:37,800
Come here, Kuenchai. Let's go.

765
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,600
Is his name Kuenchai?

766
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,479
Please don't be angry with him.

767
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,520
He just wanted to play.

768
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,479
Today is my daughter's birthday.

769
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,319
I made her a cake.

770
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:52,279
She found him adorable
and wanted to share her cake with him.

771
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,840
But she dropped it.

772
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,399
Didn't you?

773
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:56,920
Thank you.

774
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,119
What decoration do you want
on your cake this year?

775
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:16,279
I want a rainbow.

776
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:20,119
With these colors please, Mom.

777
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,800
Let me see.

778
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,319
Your birthday is in a few days.

779
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,520
Is there anything you want?
I'll surprise you with it.

780
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,520
You're so stupid.

781
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,039
If you ask me what I want,
how will it be a surprise?

782
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,119
I want to give you a special gift.

783
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,159
Birthdays are special days.

784
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,800
Everyone celebrates, don't they?

785
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,159
My birthday is just another normal day.

786
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,680
It has never been special.

787
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,279
I've never wanted anything before.

788
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:08,479
But this year…

789
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,039
What is it?

790
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,000
Forget it.

791
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,159
Nut.

792
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,079
What do you want?

793
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,920
Tell me.

794
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:28,960
I don't know.

795
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,359
Listen, Prib.

796
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:33,359
I had to eat that burnt pork you made,

797
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:36,359
and now you want me
to help you think of a gift for Nut.

798
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,680
You're the worst niece of all time.

799
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,000
Your heart is blacker
than your burnt pork.

800
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,640
You can talk, Uncle. Your skin is black,
and you have a black heart.

801
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,359
We're family but you won't help me.

802
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,840
You've worked with Nut for ages.
How come you know nothing about him?

803
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:53,560
You're a useless uncle

804
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,399
and the worst boss.

805
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,399
Listen. Nut and I just work together.

806
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,680
I'm not his father. I don't know
everything about him.

807
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,159
This is a waste of time.

808
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:08,920
Yes, you're wasting your time.

809
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,119
Wasting time is still better
than wasting my chance.

810
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,960
You'll surely waste your chance.

811
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,920
No matter how precious the gift is,

812
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,840
no matter how expensive it might be,

813
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,159
Nut will never accept your love.

814
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,079
A precious gift?

815
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,119
-Uncle Juea!
-What is it?

816
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:41,079
Thank you. You are the best uncle ever.

817
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:44,479
-Whatever. I've warned you.
-Hey.

818
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,319
Give me your paw.

819
01:11:57,039 --> 01:11:58,239
The other one.

820
01:11:58,319 --> 01:11:59,920
Well done.

821
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
Here.

822
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,880
Here's some water.

823
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:07,640
Thank you.

824
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,439
What brings you here?

825
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:14,520
I would like your help with something.

826
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,960
I've figured out what I'm going
to give Nut for his birthday.

827
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,439
Did you tell her

828
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,199
what Nut's teddy bear looked like?

829
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:35,600
Yes.

830
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,439
Was that a good idea?

831
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,479
What if she manages to find
an identical teddy bear,

832
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,960
and Nut replaces you with it?

833
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,039
The best she'll find is something similar.

834
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,000
Nothing can replace me, right?

835
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:56,319
Well, I guess
it won't hurt to be optimistic.

836
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:01,640
I know that Prib likes Nut.

837
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,640
She just wants him to be happy.

838
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:08,079
If her gift makes him happy,

839
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,159
I am happy too.

840
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,960
How naive.

841
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:14,159
Of course, you and Nut
are getting on well.

842
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,640
Even better than before, I may say.

843
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,600
When he is being nice to me,

844
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:24,359
I want to be even nicer to him.

845
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,800
But…

846
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,560
I haven't figured out what to give him.

847
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:33,560
When I asked him,
he wouldn't say what he wants.

848
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,840
Should I get him a new bolster cushion?

849
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,680
Tofu, you evil teddy bear!

850
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:43,880
You are very close to him.
You must know what he wants.

851
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,399
It shouldn't be that hard.

852
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,359
Nut was a cute kid.

853
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,800
He was.

854
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:20,479
He was such a cute child.

855
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,960
He was lively and he always smiled.

856
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,399
Lately, he hardly ever smiles though.

857
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,319
It must be because of me.

858
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,960
He seems to have a lot on his mind.

859
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:39,079
There's his work and his research.

860
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,439
He works really hard.

861
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,600
That's why he looks so serious.

862
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,079
Is that a rainbow?

863
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:18,680
When he was young,
he wanted a rainbow on his cake.

864
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,920
He asked me to make it for him.

865
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,199
That year, he must have been very happy.

866
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,119
No.

867
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,359
I didn't make it for him.

868
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:50,079
We never made
another birthday cake together again.

869
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,000
In that case,

870
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,079
for his birthday this year,
shall we make him a cake?

871
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,119
ALARM

872
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,000
Nut.

873
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:14,840
Are you awake, Nut? It's getting late.

874
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,920
All right. I know.

875
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:26,600
Happy birthday.

876
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:42,439
What are you doing with that?

877
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,159
Hey.

878
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,640
Go put it away.

879
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,720
Take this.

880
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:07,520
I'm leaving, Mom.

881
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,479
I already opened the gate for you.

882
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:42,560
Are you nearly here, Song?

883
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,239
Sure.

884
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:58,479
Song.

885
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:03,079
Here's everything.

886
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,920
Thank you.

887
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,319
Sure. I'm going now.

888
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:07,680
Drive safely.

889
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:30,359
Here you go, Prib.

890
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:32,319
Thank you, Nut.

891
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:54,119
LOOKING FOR A TEDDY BEAR

892
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,880
LOOKING FOR A TEDDY BEAR
IDENTICAL TO THIS

893
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,840
ANYONE WITH INFO, PLEASE DM ME

894
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,000
-I'm going.
-See you.

895
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,479
Haven't you finished yet?

896
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,880
It's all right.
I have someone to delay him.

897
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:31,000
-Look.
-Yes?

898
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:33,479
I've been editing this for hours.

899
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,720
It's fine as it is.

900
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,079
You say good.

901
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,560
I say not good enough.

902
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,399
A bit more. Go on.

903
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,560
Fine, a bit more.

904
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,760
Why do you sound so irritated?

905
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,479
It's okay now. You can let him go home.

906
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,600
Wait, let me see.

907
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,239
Not bad. This dialogue here is good.

908
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,239
What?

909
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,000
That dialogue was in the first draft.

910
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:20,920
That's what I'm saying. The dialogue
is exactly where it should be.

911
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,439
All right. You may leave now.

912
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,960
Good job.

913
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:26,960
-I'm going then.
-Hold on.

914
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:31,039
What is it now, Juea?

915
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:36,520
You remembered?

916
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,880
Nut,

917
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,600
how long have we worked together?
How could I not remember?

918
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,199
Thank you.

919
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:45,760
You're like a father to me.

920
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,239
I'm more handsome than him.

921
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,880
I'm kidding. Don't crush my hopes.

922
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,800
I would like to be handsome too.

923
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,279
Thank you.

924
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:00,359
Even though you didn't raise me
as a parent,

925
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:03,520
you've guided my career in this industry.

926
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,399
Well said.

927
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,800
If you didn't have talent,
I wouldn't be able to help you.

928
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,359
Whatever problems you faced last year,

929
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,600
let them go.

930
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,279
I'm sure this year will be your year.

931
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:24,479
Because your series
is going to be a big hit.

932
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,359
You would like that, right?

933
01:27:26,439 --> 01:27:27,640
It's a win-win situation.

934
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,560
Go on. Go home.

935
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,840
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

936
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:33,560
Drive safely.

937
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:50,000
You?

938
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,680
Gen.

939
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,319
Yes, it's me.

940
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:58,920
Who else would it be?

941
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,840
Happy birthday.
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

942
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:05,640
You buy yourself a cake every year,

943
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,840
so I bought you one.

944
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,199
Although this year,

945
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,600
you might not really want any cake.

946
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:13,560
All right. Thank you.

947
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,640
I'm leaving.

948
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,800
Got you, Nut.

949
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:39,279
Hey, you.

950
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:41,680
Is that all you got for him?

951
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:45,000
What should I give him?

952
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:46,359
A car? A house?

953
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
Nut doesn't want anything.

954
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,560
Every year,

955
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,880
I wish him a happy birthday

956
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,920
and offer my support.

957
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,159
That's adorable.

958
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,560
I would like someone

959
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:04,479
to offer me support

960
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:06,399
like that.

961
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,000
Wait.

962
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:12,000
Find a good friend like me then.

963
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,640
I already have plenty of friends.

964
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,439
But now, I want you.

965
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:27,039
This is for the cake.

966
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,479
Thanks for buying it for me.

967
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,239
Right, I…

968
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:42,159
better get going.

969
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:46,920
You can buy a cake like that
from loads of places around here.

970
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:50,520
You can just tell me
if you want to see me.

971
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,640
Stay by my side…

972
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,159
and don't go anywhere.

973
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,520
Your mom said,

974
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,960
love isn't about doing
something for someone.

975
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:12,760
It's about putting your heart into it.

976
01:30:13,239 --> 01:30:16,920
How are you involved with what happened
to Nut and his mother?

977
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,760
You're nosy

978
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,960
because you're jealous
of Nut's mother, right?

979
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,039
Why would I be jealous?

980
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:25,520
Well, everybody loves her.

981
01:30:26,119 --> 01:30:27,399
This includes Mr. Saen too.

982
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,359
Have you heard of the phrase

983
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,960
"Pity is the foundation of love"?

984
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:39,279
No. I've only heard of sympathy.

985
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:46,199
